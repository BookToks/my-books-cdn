" Hence, if the ambiguity is not guarded against, we may come to think that whiteness is an " idea " in the other sense, i.e. an act of thought ; and thus we come to think that whiteness is mental. But in so thinking, we rob it of its essential quality of universality.
 
 One man's act of thought is necessarily a different thing from another man's ; one man's act of thought at one time is necessarily ad ifferent thing from the same man's act of thought at another time. Hence, if whiteness were the thought as opposed to its object, no two different men could think of it, and no one man could think of it twice.
 
 That which many different thoughts of whiteness have in common is their object, and this object is different from all of them. Thus universals are not thoughts, though when known they are the objects of thoughts.
 
 We shall find it convenient only to speak of things existing when they are in time, that is to say, when we can point to some time ai which they exist (not excluding the possi- 156 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY bility of their existing at all times).
