This relation is something, although we cannot say that it exists in the same sense in which I and my room exist. The relation " in " is something which we can think about and understand, for, if we could not understand it, we could not understand the sentence " I am in my room." Many philosophers, following Kant, have maintained that relations are the work of the mind, that things in themselves have no relations, but that the mind brings them together in one act of thought and thus produces the relations which it judges them to have.
 
 This view, however, seems open to objections similar to those which we urged before against Kant. It seems plain that it is not thought which produces the truth of the proposition " I am in my room." It may be true that an earwig is in my room, even if neither I nor the earwig nor any one else is aware of this truth ; for this truth concerns only the earwig and the room, and does not depend upon anything else. Thus relations, as we shall tee more fully in the next chapter.
