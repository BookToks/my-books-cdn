134 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY The physical object, which he calls the *' thing in itself," * he regards as essentially unknowable ; what can be known is the object as we have it in experience, which he calls the " phenomenon." The phenomenon, being a j oint product of us and the thing in itself, is sure to have those characteristics which are due to us, and is therefore sure to conform to our a priori knowledge. Hence this knowledge, though true of all actual and possible experience, must not be supposed to apply outside experience. Thus in spite of the existence of a priori knowledge, we cannot know anything about the thing in itself or about what is not an actual or possible object of experience. In this way he tries to reconcile and harmonise the contentions of the rationalists with the arguments of the empiricists.
 
 Apart from minor grounds on which Kant's philosophy may be criticised, there is * Kant's " thing in itself " is identical in definition with the physical object, namely, it is the cause of sensation. In t he properties deduced from the definition it is not identical, since Kant held (in spite of some inconsistency as regards cause) that we can know that none of the categories are applicable to the " thing in itself." A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE 135 one main objection which seems fatal to any attempt to deal with the problem of a priori knowledge by his method.
