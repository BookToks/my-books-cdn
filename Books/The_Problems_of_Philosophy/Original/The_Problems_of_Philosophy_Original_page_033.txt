By inventing the method of doubt, and by showing that subjective things are the most certain, Descartes performed a great service to philosophy, and one which makes him still useful to all students of the subject.
 
 But some care is needed in using Descartes' argument. " / think, therefore / am " says rather more than is strictly certain. It might seem as though we were quite sure of being the same person to-day as we were yesterday, and this is no doubt true in some sense. But the real Self is as hard to arrive at as the real table, and does not seem to have that absolute, convincing certainty that belongs to particular experiences. When I look at my table and see a certain brown colour, what is quite certain at once is not " / am seeing a brown colour," but rather, " a brown colour is being seen." This of course involves something (or somebody) which (or who) sees the brown colour ; but it does not of itself involve that more or less permanent person whom we call " I.'- So far as immediate certainty goes.
