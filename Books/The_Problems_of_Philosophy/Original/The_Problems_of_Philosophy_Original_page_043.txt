All knowledge, we find, must be built up upon our instinctive beliefs, and if these are rejected, nothing is left. But among our instinctive beliefs some are much stronger than others, while many have, by habit and association, become entangled with other beliefs, not really instinctive, but falsely supposed to be part of what is believed instinctively.
 
 Philosophy should show us the hierarchy of our instinctive beliefs, beginning with those we hold most strongly, and presenting each as much isolated and as free from irrelevant additions as possible. It should take care to show that, in the form in which they are finally set forth, our instinctive beliefs do not clash, but form a harmonious system.
 
 There can never be any reason for rejecting one instinctive belief except that it clashes with others ; t hus, if they are found to harmonise, the whole system becomes worthy of acceptance.
 
 It is of course possible that all or any of our beliefs may be mistaken, and therefore all 40 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY ought to be held with at least some slight element of doubt.
