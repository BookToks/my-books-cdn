" In this way I become acquainted with the universal relation.
 
 In like manner I become aware of the relation of before and after in time. Suppose I hear a chime of bells : when the last bell of the chime sounds, I can retain the whole chime before my mind, and I can perceive that the earlier bells came before the later ones. Also in memory I perceive that what I am remembering came before the present time. From either of these sources I can abstract the universal relation of before and after, just as I abstracted the universal relation "being to the left of." Thus time - relations, like space - relations, are among those with which we are acquainted.
 
 Another relation with which we become acquainted in much the same way is resemblance. If I see simultaneously two shades of green, I can see that they resemble each other ; if I also see a shade of red at the same ON KNOWLEDGE OF UNIVERSALS 161 time, I can see that the two greens have more resemblance to each other than either has to the red.
