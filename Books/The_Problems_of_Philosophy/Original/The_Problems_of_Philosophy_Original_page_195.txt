TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD 19i There is, however, a great difficulty in this view, or rather two great difficulties. The first is that there is no reason to suppose that only one coherent body of beliefs is possible.
 
 It may be that, with sufficient imagination, a novelist might invent a past for the world that would perfectly fit on to what we know, and yet be quite different from the real past.
 
 In more scientific matters, it is certain that there are often two or more hypotheses which account for all the known facts on some subject, and although, in such cases, men of science endeavour to find facts which will rule out all the hypotheses except one, there is no reason why they should always succeed.
 
 In philosophy, again, it seems not uncommon for t wo rival hypotheses to be both able to account for all the facts. Thus, for example, it is possible that life is one long dream, and that the outer world has only that degree of reality that the objects of dreams have ; but although such a view does not seem inconsistent with known facts, there is no reason to prefer it to the common-sense view, according to which other people and 192 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY things do really exist.
