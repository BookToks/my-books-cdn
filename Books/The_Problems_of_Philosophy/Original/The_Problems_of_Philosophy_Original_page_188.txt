The inductive principle has less self-evidence than some of the other principles oi logic, such as *' what follows from a true premiss must be true." Memories have a diminishing self-evidence as they become remoter and fainter ; the truths of logic and mathematics have (broadly speaking) less self-evidence as they become more complicated. Judgments of intrinsic ethical or aesthetic value are apt to have some self-evidence, but not much.
 
 Degrees of self-evidence are important in the theory of knowledge, since, if propositions may (as seems likely) have some degree of self -evidence without being true, it will not be necessary to abandon all connection between self-evidence and truth, but merely to say that, where there is a conflict, the more self-evident proposition is to be retained and the less self-evident rejected.
 
 It seems, however, highly probable that two different notions are combined in " selfevidence " as above explained ; that one of them, which corresponds to the highest ON INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE 185 degree of self-evidence, is really an infallible guarantee of truth, while the other, which corresponds to all the other degrees, does not give an infallible guarantee, but only a greater or less presumption.
