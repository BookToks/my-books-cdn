It is true that we have a greater body of evidence from the past in favour of the laws of motion than we have in favour of the sunrise, because the sunrise is merely a particular case of fulfilment of the laws of motion, and there are countless other particular cases.
 
 But the real question is : Do any number of cases of a law being fulfilled in the past afford evidence that it will be fulfilled in the future ? If not, it becomes plain that we have no ground whatever for expecting the sun to rise to-morrow, or for expecting the bread we shall eat at our next meal not to poison us, or for any of the other scarcely conscious expectations that control our daily lives. It is to be observed that all such expectations are only probable ; thus we have not to seek for a proof that they must be fulfilled, but only for some reason in favour of the view that they are likely to be fulfilled.
 
 Now in dealing with this question we must, to begin with, make an important distinction, ON INDUCTION 97 without which we should soon become involved in h opeless confusions.
