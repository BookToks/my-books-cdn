To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious ; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As s oon as we begin to philosophise, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening chapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be ; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating 2i4 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect.
