The desire to prove this is a form of self-assertion, and like all self-assertion, it is an obstacle to the growth of Self which it desires, and of which the Self knows that it is capable. Selfassertion, in philosophic speculation as elsewhere, views the world as a means to its own ends ; thus it makes the world of less account than Self, and the Self sets bounds to the greatness of its goods. In contemplation, on the contrary, we start from the not-Self, and through its greatness the boundaries of Self are enlarged ; through the infinity of the universe the mind which contemplates it achieves some share in infinity.
 
 For this reason greatness of soul is not fostered by those philosophies which assimilate the u niverse to Man. Knowledge is a form of union of Self and not-Self ; like all union, it is impaired by dominion, and therefore by any attempt to force the universe into conformity with what we find in ourselves. There is a widespread philosophical tendency towards the view which tells THE VALUE OF PHILOSOPHY 247 us that man is the measure of all things, that truth is man-made, that space and time and the world of universals are properties of the mind, and that, if there be anything not created by the mind, it is unknowable and of no account for us.
