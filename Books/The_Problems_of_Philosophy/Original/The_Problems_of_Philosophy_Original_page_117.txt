For no very good reason, three of these principles have been singled out by tradition under the name of " Laws of Thought." They are as follows : (1) The law of identity: "Whatever is, is." (2) The law of contradiction : " Nothing can both be and not be." (3) The law of excluded middle : " Everything must either be or not be."
