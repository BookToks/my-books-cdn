Let us take as an illustration the law of contradiction. This is commonly stated in the form " Nothing can both be and not be," which is intended to express the fact that nothing can at once have and not have a given quality. Thus, for example, if a tree is a beech it cannot also be not a beech ; i f my table is rectangular it c annot also be not rectangular, and so on.
 
 Now what makes it natural to call this principle a law of thought is that it is by thought rather than by outward observation that we persuade ourselves of its necessary truth. When we have seen that a tree is a beech, we do not need to look again in order to ascertain whether it is also not a beech ; thought alone makes us know that this is impossible. But the conclusion that the law of contradiction is a law of thought is nevertheless erroneous. What we believe, when we believe the law of contradiction, is not that the mind is so made that it must believe the law of contradiction. This belief is a 188 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY subsequent result of psychological reflection, which presupposes the belief in the law of contradiction.
