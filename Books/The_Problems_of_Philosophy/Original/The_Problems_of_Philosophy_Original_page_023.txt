The arguments employed are of very different value : some are important and sound, others are confused or quibbling. But Berkeley retains the merit of having shown that the existence of matter is capable of being denied without absurdity, and that if there are any things that exist independently of us they cannot be the immediate objects of our sensations.
 
 There are two different questions involved when we ask whether matter exists, and it is important to keep them clear. We commonly mean by " matter " something which is opposed to " mind," something which we think of as occupying space and as radically incapable of any sort of thought or consciousness. It i s chiefly in this sense that Berkeley denies matter ; that is to say, he does not deny that the sense-data which we commonly take as signs of the existence of the table are really signs of the existence of something independent ofu s, but he does deny that this some^ 20 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY thing is non-mental, that it is neither mind nor ideas entertained by some mind.
