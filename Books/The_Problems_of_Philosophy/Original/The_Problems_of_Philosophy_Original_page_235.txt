What has happened in the case of space and time has happened, to some extent, in other directions as well. The attempt to prescribe to the universe by means of a priori principles has broken down ; logic, instead of being, as formerly, the bar to possibilities, has become the great liberator of the imagination, presenting innumerable alternatives which are closed to unrefiective common sense, and leaving to experience the task of deciding, where decision is possible, between the many worlds which logic offers for our choice. Thus knowledge as to what exists becomes limited to what v/e can learn from experience â€” not to what we can actually experience, for, as we have seen, there is much knowledge by description concerning things of which we have no direct experience.
 
 But in all cases of knowledge by description, we need some connection of universals, enabling us, f rom such and such a datum, to infer an object of a certain sort as implied by our datum. Thus in regard to physical objects, 232 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY for example, the principle that sense-data are signs of physical objects is itself a connection of universals ; and it is only in virtue of this principle that experience enables us to acquire knowledge concerning physical objects.
