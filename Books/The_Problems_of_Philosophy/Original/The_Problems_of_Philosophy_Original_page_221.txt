KNOWLEDGE AND ERROR 217 From what has been said it is evident that, both as regards intuitive knowledge and as regards derivative knowledge, if we assume that intuitive knowledge is trustworthy in proportion to the degree of its self-evidence, there will be a gradation in trustworthiness, from the existence of noteworthy sense-data and the simpler truths of logic and arithmetic, which may be taken as quite certain, down to judgments which seem only just more probable than their opposites. What we firmly believe, if it is true, is called know- 1 ledge, provided it is either intuitive or in-| fe rred (logically or psychologically) from] intuitive knowledge from which it follows ' logically. What we firmly believe, if it is not] true, is called error. What we firmly believe, ' if it is neither knowledge nor error, and also what we believe hesitatingly, because it is, or is derived from, something which has not the highest degree of self -evidence, may be called probable opinion. Thus the greater part of what would commonly pass as knowledge is m ore or less probable opinion.
 
 In regard to probable opinion, we can I 218 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY derive great assistance from coherence, which we rejected as the definition of truth, but may often use as a criterion.
