But the space of science is neutral as between touch and sight ; thus it cannot be either the space of touch or the space of sight.
 
 Again, different people see the same object as of different shapes, according to their point of view. A circular coin, for example, though we should always judge it to be circular, will look oval unless we are straight in front of it. When we judge that it is circular, we are judging that it has a real shape which is not its apparent shape, but belongs to it intrinsically apart from its appearance. But this real shape, which is what concerns science, must be in a real space, not the same as anybody's apparent space. The real space is public, the apparent space is private to the percipient. In different people's private spaces the same object seems to have different shapes ; thus the real space, in which it has its real shape, must be THE NATURE OF MATTER 47 different from the private spaces.
