 We do not, in fact, feel our certainty that two and two are four increased by fresh instances, because, as soon as we have seen the truth of this proposition, our certainty becomes so great as to be incapable of growing greater. IVIoreover, we feel some quality of necessity about the proposition " two and two are four," which is absent from even the best attested empirical generalisations. Such generalisations always remain mere facts : we feel that there might be a world in which they were false, though in the actual world they happen to be true. In any possible world, on the contrary, we feel that two and two would be four : this is not a mere fact, but a necessity to which everything actual and possible must conform.
