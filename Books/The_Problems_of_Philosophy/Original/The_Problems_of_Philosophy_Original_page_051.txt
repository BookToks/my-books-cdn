The space ' of science, therefore, though connected with the spaces we see and feel, is not identical with them, and the manner of its connection, requires investigation. ' We agreed provisionally that physical objects cannot be quite like our sense-data, but may be regarded as causing our sensations. These physical objects are in the space of science, which we may call " physical " s pace. It is important to notice that, if our sensations are to be caused by physical objects, there must be a physical space containing these objects and our senseorgans and nerves and brain. We get a sensation of touch from an object when we are in contact with it ; that is to say, when some part of our body occupies a place in physical space quite close to the space occupied by the object. We see an object (roughly speaking) when no opaque body is between the object and our eyes in physical space. Similarly, we only hear or smell or taste an object when we are sufficiently near to it, or when it touches the tongue.
