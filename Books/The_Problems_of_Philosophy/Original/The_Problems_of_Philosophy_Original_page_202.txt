The subject and the objects together are called the constituents of the judgment. It will be observed that the relation of judging has what is called a " sense " or " direction." We may say, metaphorically, that it puts its objects in a certain order, which we may indicate by means of the order of the words in the sentence. (In an inflected language, the same thing will be indicated by inflections, e.g. by the difference between nominative and accusative.) Othello's judgment that Cassio loves Desdemona differs from his judgment that Desdemona loves Cassio, in spite of the fact that it consists of the same constituents, because the relation of judging places the constituents in a different order in the two cases. Similarly, if C assio judges that Desdemona loves Othello, the constituents of the judgment are still the same, but their order is different.
