If Othello believes falsely that Desdemona loves Cassio, then there is no such complex unity as " Desdemona's love for Cassio." Thus a belief is true when it corresponds to a certain associated complex, and false when it does not. Assuming, for the sake of definiteness, that the objects of the belief are two terms and a relation, the terms being put in a certain order by the " sense " of the believing, then if the two terms in that order are united by the relation into a complex, the belief is true ; if not, it is false. This constitutes the definition of truth and falsehood that we were in search of. Judging or believing is a certain complex unity of which a mind is a constituent ; if the remaining constituents, taken in the order which they have in the belief, form a complex unity, then the belief is true ; i f not, it is false.
 
 Thus although truth and falsehood are properties of beliefs, yet they are in a sense extrinsic properties, for the condition of the truth of a belief is something not involving beliefs, or (in general) any mind at all, but 202 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY only the objects of the belief.
