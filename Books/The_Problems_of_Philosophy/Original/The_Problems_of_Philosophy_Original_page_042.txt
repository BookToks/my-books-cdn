This discovery, however— which is not at all paradoxical in the case of taste and smell and sound, and only slightly so in the case of touch — leaves undiminished our instinctive belief that there are objects corresponding to our sense-data.
 
 Since this belief does not lead to any difficulties, but on the contrary tends to simplify and systematise our account of our experiences, there seems no good reason for rejecting it. We may therefore admit — though with a slight doubt derived from dreams — that the external world does really exist, and is not wholly dependent for its existence upon our continuing to perceive it.
 
 The argument which has led us to this conclusion is d oubtless less strong than we could wish, but it is typical of many philosophical arguments, and it is therefore worth while to THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER 39 consider briefly its general character and validity.
