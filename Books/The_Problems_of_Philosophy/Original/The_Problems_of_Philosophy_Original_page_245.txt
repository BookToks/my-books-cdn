Has the universe any unity of plan or purpose, or is it a fortuitous concourse of atoms ? Is consciousness a permanent part of the universe, giving hope of indefinite growth in wisdom, or is it a transitory accident on a small planet on which life must ultimately become impossible ? Are good and evil of importance to the universe or only to man ?
 
 Such questions are asked by philosophy, and variously answered by various philosophers.
 
 But it would seem that, whether answers be otherwise discoverable or not, the answers suggested by philosophy are none of them demonstrably true. Yet, however slight may be the hope of discovering an answer, it is part of the business of philosophy to continue the consideration of such questions, to make us aware of their importance, to examine all the approaches to them, and to keep alive that speculative interest in the universe which is 242 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY apt to be killed by confining ourselves to definitely ascertainable knowledge.
