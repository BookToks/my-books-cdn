Thus it is the fact that different people have similar sense-data, and that one person in a given place at different times has similar sense-data, which makes us suppose that over and above the sensedata there is a permanent public object which underlies or causes the sense-data of various people and various times.
 
 Now in so far as the above considerations depend upon supposing that there are other people besides ourselves, they beg the very question at issue. Other people are represented to m e by certain sense-data, such as the sight of them or the sound of their voices, and if I had no reason to believe that there were physical objects independent of my sense-data, I should have no reason to believe that other people exist except as part of my dream. Thus, when we are trying to show that there must be objects independent of our own sense-data, we cannot appeal to the testimony of other people, since this testimony itself B 34 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY consists of sense-data, and does not reveal other people's experiences unless our own sense-data are signs of things existing indeoendently of us.
