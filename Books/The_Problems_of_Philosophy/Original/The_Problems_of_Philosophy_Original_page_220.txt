The same thing happens in tuning a musical instrument, or in any other case where there is a continuous gradation. Thus self-evidence of this sort is a matter of degree ; and it seems plain that the higher degrees are more to be trusted than the lower degrees.
 
 In derivative knowledge our ultimate premisses must have some degree of selfevidence, and so must their connection with the conclusions deduced from them. Take for example a piece of reasoning in geometry.
 
 It is not enough that the axioms from which we start should be self-evident : it is necessary also that, at each step in the reasoning, the connection of premiss and conclusion should be self-evident. In difficult reasoning, this connection has often only a very small degree of self -evidence ; hence errors of reasoning are not improbable where the difficulty is great.
