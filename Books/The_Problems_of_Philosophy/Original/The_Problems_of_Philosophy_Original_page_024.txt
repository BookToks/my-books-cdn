He admits that there must be something which continues to exist when we go out of the room or shut our eyes, and that what we call seeing the table does really give us reason for believing in something which persists even when we are not seeing it. But he thinks that this something cannot be radically different in nature from what we see, and cannot be independent of seeing altogether, though it must be independent of our seeing.
 
 He is thus led to regard the " real " table as an idea in the mind of God. Such an idea has the required permanence and independence of ourselves, without being — as matter would otherwise be — something quite unknowable, in the sense that we can only infer it, and can never be directly and immediately aware of it.
 
 Other philosophers since Berkeley have also held that, although the table does not depend for its existence upon being seen by me, it does depend upon being seen (or otherwise apprehended in sensation) by some APPEARANCE AND REALITY 21 mind — not necessarily the mind of God, but more often the whole collective mind of the universe.
