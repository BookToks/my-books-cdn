If we say that the things known must be in the mind, we are either unduly limiting the mind's power of knowing, or we are uttering a mere tautology. We are uttering a mere tautology if we mean by " in the mind " the same as by " before the mind," i.e. if we mean merely being apprehended by t he mind. But if we mean this, we shall have to admit that what, in this sense, is in the mind, may nevertheless be not mental. Thus when we realise the nature of knowledge, Berkeley's argument is seen to be wrong in substance as well as in form, and his grounds for supposing that "ideas" — i.e.
 
 the objects apprehended — must be mental, are found to have no validity whatever.
 
 Hence his grounds in favour of idealism may be dismissed. It remains to see whether there are any other grounds.
 
 It is often said, as though it were a selfevident truism, that we cannot know that anything exists which we do not know. It is inferred that whatever can in any way be 68 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY relevant to our experience must be at least capable of being known by us ; whence it follows that if matter were essentially something with which we could not become acquainted, matter would be something which we could not know to exist, and which could have for us no importance whatever.
