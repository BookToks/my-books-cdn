The impartiality which, in contemplation, its he unalloyed desire for truth, is the very same quality of mind which, in action, is justice, and in emotion is that universal love which can be given to all, and not only to those who are judged useful or admirable.
 
 Thus contemplation enlarges not only the objects of o ur thoughts, but also the objects of our actions and our affections : i t makes us citizens of the universe, not only of one walled city at war with all the rest. In this citizenship of the universe consists man's true freedom, and his liberation from the thraldom of narr-^w hopes and fears.
 
 Thus, to sum up our discussion of the value of philosophy : Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions, since no definite answers can, as a rule, be known to be true, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves ; because these questions enlarge our conception of what 250 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY is possible, enrich our intellectual imagination, and diminish the dogmatic assurance which closes the mind against speculation ; b ut above all because, through the greatness of the universe which philosophy contemplates, the mind also is rendered great, and becomes capable of that union with the universe which constitutes its highest good.
