But the sense-data are private to each separate person ; what is immediately present to the sight of one is not immediately present to the sight of another : they all see things from slightly different points of view, and therefore see them slightly differently. Thus, if there are to be public neutral objects, which can be in some sense known to many different people, there must be something over and above the private and particular sense-data which appear to various people. What reason, then, have we for believing that there are such public neutral objects ?
 
 The first answer that naturally occurs to one is that, although different people may see the table slightly differently, still they all see more or less similar things when they look at the table, and the variations in what they see follow the laws of perspective and reflection of light, so that it is easy to arrive at a permanent object underlying all the different people's sense-data. I bought my table from the former occupant of my room ; I THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER 33 could not buy his sense-data, which died when he went away, but I could and did buy the confident expectation of more or less similar sense-data.
