We spoke of the relation called " judging " or " believing " as knitting together into one complex whole the subject and the objects, i In this respect, judging is exactly like every other relation. Whenever a relation holds between two or more terms, it unites the terms into a complex whole. If Othello loves Desdemona, there is such a complex whole as " Othello's love for Desdemona." The terms united by the relation may be themselves complex, or may be simple, but the whole which results from their being united must be complex. Wherever there is a relation which relates certain terms, there is a complex object formed of the union of those terms ; and conversely, wherever there is a complex object, there is a relation which relates its constituents. When an act of believing occurs, there is a complex, in which " believing " is the uniting relation, and subject and objects are arranged in a certain order by the "sense" of the 200 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY relation of believing.
