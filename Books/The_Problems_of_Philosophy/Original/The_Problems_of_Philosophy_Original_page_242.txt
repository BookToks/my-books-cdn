Physical science, through the medium of i nventions, is useful to innumerable people who are wholly ignorant of it ; thus the study of physical science is to be recommended, not only, or primarily, because of the effect on the student, but rather because of the effect on mankind in general. This utility does not belong to philosophy. If the study of philosophy has any value at all for others than students of philosophy, it must be only indirectly, through its effects upon the lives of those who study it. It is in these effects, therefore, if anywhere, that the value of philosophy must be primarily sought.
 
 But further, if we are not to fail in our endeavour to d etermine the value of philosophy, we must first free our minds from the prejudices of w hat are wrongly called " practical " men. The " practical " man, as this word is often used, is one who recognises only material needs, who realises that men must have food for the body, but is oblivious of the necessity of providing food for the mind. If all men were well off, if poverty and disease had been reduced to their lowest possible point, there THE VALUE OF PHILOSOPHY 239 would still remain much to be done to produce a valuable society ; and even in the existing world the goods of the mind are at least as important as the goods of the body.
