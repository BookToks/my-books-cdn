GENERAL PRINCIPLES 125 (This is obvious, because if all men are mortal, so is Socrates ; but if Socrates is mortal, it does not follow that all men are mortal.) Hence we shall reach the conclusion that Socrates is mortal with a greater approach to certainty if we make our argument purely inductive than if we go by way of " all men are mortal " and then use deduction.
 
 This illustrates the difference between general propositions known a priori, such as ' " two and two are four," and empirical generalisations such as " all men are mortal." In regard to the former, deduction is the right mode of argument, whereas in regard to the latter, induction is always theoretically preferable, and warrants a greater confidence in the truth of our conclusion, because all empirical generalisations are more uncertain than the instances of them.
 
 We have now seen that there are propositions known a priori, and that among them are the propositions of logic and pure mathematics, as well as the fundamental propositions of ethics. The question which must next occupy us is this : How is it possible that there 126 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY should be such knowledge ?
