(The distinction involved is roughly that between savoir and connaitre in French, or between wissen and kennen in German.) Thus the statement which seemed like a truism becomes, when re-stated, the following : " We can never truly judge that something with which we are not acquainted exists." This is by no means a truism, but on the contrary a palpable falsehood, I have not the honour to be acquainted with the Emperor of Russia, but I truly judge that he exists.
 
 It may be said, of course, that I judge this because of o ther people's acquaintance with him.
 
 This, however, would be an irrelevant retort, since, if the principle were true, I could not know that any one else i^ acquainted with him. But further : there is no reason why I should not know of the existence of something with which nobody is acquainted. This point is important, and demands elucidation.
 
 If I am acquainted with a thing which exists, my acquaintance gives me the knowledge that it exists. But it is not true that, conversely, whenever I can know that a IDEALISM 71 thing of a certain sort exists, I or some one else must be acquainted with the thing.
