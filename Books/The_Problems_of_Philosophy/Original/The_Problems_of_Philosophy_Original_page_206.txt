A mind, which believes, believes truly when there is a corresponding complex not involving the mind, but only its objects. This correspondence ensures truth, and its absence entails falsehood.
 
 Hence we account simultaneously for the two ' f acts that beliefs (o) depend on minds for their existence, (6) do not depend on minds for their truth.
 
 We may restate our theory as follows ; If we take such a belief as " Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio," we will call Desdemona and Cassio the object-terms, and loving the object-relation. If there is a complex unity " Desdemona's love for Cassio," consisting of the object-terms related by the object-relation in the same order as they have in the belief, then this complex unity is called the fact corresponding to the belief. Thus a belief is true when there is a corresponding fact, and is false when there is no corresponding fact.
 
 It will be seen that minds do not create truth or falsehood. They create beliefs, but when once the beliefs are created, the mind TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD 203 cannot make them true or false, except in the special case where they concern future things which are within the power of the person believing, such as catching trains.
