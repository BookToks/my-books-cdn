On the contrary, I believe that it is because the table exists continuously that all these sense-data will reappear when I open my eyes, replace my arm, and begin again to rap with my knuckles. The question we have to consider in this chapter is : What is the nature of this real table, which persists independently of my perception of i t ?
 
 To this question physical science gives an answer, somewhat incomplete it is true, and in part still very hypothetical, but yet deserving of respect so far as it goes. Physical science, more or less unconsciously, has drifted into the view that all natural phenomena ought to be reduced to motions. Light and heat and sound are all due to wave-motions, which travel from the body emitting them to the person who sees light or feels heat or hears sound. That which has the wave-motion is either cether or " gross matter," but in either case is what the philosopher would call matter.
 
 The only properties which science assigns to 44 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY I i t are position in space, and the povyer of 1 m otion according to the laws of motion.
