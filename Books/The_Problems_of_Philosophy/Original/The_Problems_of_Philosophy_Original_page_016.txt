I know that, if I move, the parts that rC' fleet the light will be different, so that the apparent distribution of colours on the table will change. It follows that if several people are looking at the table at the same moment, no two of them will see exactly the same distribution of colours, because no two can see it from exactly the same point of view, and any change in the point of view makes some change in the way the light is reflected.
 
 For most practical purposes these differences are unimportant, but to the painter they are all-important : the painter has to unlearn the habit of thinking that things seem to have the colour which common sense says they " really " have, and to learn the habit of seeing things as they appear. Here we have already the beginning of one of the distinctions that cause most trouble in philosophy â€” the distinction between " appearance " a nd " reality," between what things seem to be and what they are. The painter wants to know what tilings seem to APPEARANCE AND REALITY 13 be, the practical man and the philosopher want to know what they are ; b ut the philosopher's wish to know this is stronger than the practical man's, and is more troubled by knowledge as to the difficulties of answering the question.
