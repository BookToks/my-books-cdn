Neglecting the second ground, and considering merely our experience of men's mortality, it is plain that we should not be content with one quite clearly understood!
 
 instance of a man dying, whereas, in the case: of " two and two are four," one instance doeji suffice, when carefully considered, to persuade us that the same must happen in any other instance. Also we can be forced to admit,, on reflection, that there may be some doubt, however slight, as to whether all men are; mortal. This may be made plain by the; attempt to imagine two different worlds, in one of which there are men who are not mortal, while in the other two and two make five. When Swift invites us to consider the race of Struldbugs who never die, we are able to acquiesce in imagination. But a world where two and two make five seems quite on a different level. We feel that such a world, if GENERAL PRINCIPLES 123 there were one, would upset the whole fabric of our knowledge and reduce us to utter doubt.
