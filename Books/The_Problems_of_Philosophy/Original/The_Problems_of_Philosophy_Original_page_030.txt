CHAPTER II THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER In this chapter we have to ask ourselves whether, in any sense at all, there is such a thing as matter. Is there a table which has a certain intrinsic nature, and continues to exist when I am not looking, or is the table merely a product of my imagination, a dreamtable in a very prolonged dream ? This question is of the greatest importance. For if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, we cannot be sure of the independent existence of other people's bodies, and therefore still less of other people's minds, since we have no grounds for believing in t heir minds except such as are derived from observing their bodies. Thus if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, we shall be left alone 36 THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER 27 in a desert â€” it may be that the whole outer world is nothing but a dream, and that we alone exist.
