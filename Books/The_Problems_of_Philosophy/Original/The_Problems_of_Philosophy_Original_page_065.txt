In order to understand his argument, it is necessary to understand his use of the word " idea." He gives the name " idea " to any- \ thing which is immediately known, as, for i example, sense-data are known. Thus a par- 1 ticular colour which we see is an idea ; so is a voice which we hear, and so on. But the term is not wholly confined to sense-data.
 
 There will also be things remembered or imagined, for with such things also we have immediate acquaintance at the moment of remembering or imagining. All such immediate data he calls " ideas." He then proceeds to consider common objects, such as a tree, for instance. He shows that all we know immediately when we " perceive " t he tree consists of ideas in his sense of the word, and he argues that there is not the slightest ground for supposing that there is anything real about the tree except what is perceived. Its being, he says, consists in being perceived : in the Latin of the schoolmen its " esse " is " percipi.^' He fully admits 62 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY that the tree must continue to exist even when we shut our eyes or when no human being is near it.
