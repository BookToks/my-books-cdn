The sha'pe of the table is no better. We are all in the habit of judging as to the " real " shapes of things, and we do this so unreflectingly that we come to think we actually see the real shapes. But, in fact, as we all have to learn if we try to draw, a given thing looks different in shape from every different point of view. If our table is " really " rectangular, it will look, from almost all points of view, as if it had two acute angles and two obtuse angles. If opposite sides are parallel, they will look as if they converged to a point away from the spectator ; if they are of equal length, they will look as if the nearer side were longer.
 
 All these things are not commonly noticed in looking at a table, because experience has taught us to construct the " real " shape from the apparent shape, and the " real " shape is what interests us as practical men. But the " real " shape is not what we see ; it is something inferred from what we see. And what we see is constantly changing in shape 16 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY as we move about the room ; so that here again the senses seem not to give us the truth about the table itself, but only about the appearance of the table.
