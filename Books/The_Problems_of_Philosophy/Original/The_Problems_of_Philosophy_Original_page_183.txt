We see a patch of red, and we judge " there is such-and-such a patch of red," or more strictly " there is that " ; this is one kind of intuitive judgment of perception.
 
 The other kind arises when the object of sense is complex, and we subject it to some degree of analysis. If, for instance, we see a round patch of red, we may judge " that patch of red is round." This is again a judgment of perception, but it differs from our previous kind. In our present kind we have a single sense-datum which has both colour and shape : the colour is red and the shape is round. Our judgment analyses the datum into colour and shape, and then recombines them by stating that the red colour is round in shape. Another example of this kind of judgment is " this is to the right of that," where " this " and " that " are seen simultaneously. In this kind of judgment the sense-datum contains constituents which have some relation to each other, and the judgment asserts that these constituents have this relation.
