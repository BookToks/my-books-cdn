Every apparently separate piece of reality has, as it were, hooks which grapple it to the next piece ; the next piece, in turn, has fresh hooks, and so on, until the whole universe is reconstructed.
 
 This essential incompleteness appears, according to H egel, equally in the world of thought and in the world of things. In the world of thought, if we take any idea which is abstract or incomplete, we find, on examination, that, if we forget its incompleteness, we become involved in contradictions ; these contradictions turn the idea in question into its opposite, or antithesis ; and in order to escape, we have to find a new, less incomplete idea, which is the synthesis of our original idea and its antithesis.
 
 This new idea, though less incomplete than the idea we started with, will be found, nevertheless, to b e still not wholly complete, but to pass into its antithesis, with which it must be combined in a new synthesis. In this waj'^ Hegel advances until he reaches the " Absolute Idea," which, according to him, has no incompleteness, no opposite, and no need of THE LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 223 further development.
