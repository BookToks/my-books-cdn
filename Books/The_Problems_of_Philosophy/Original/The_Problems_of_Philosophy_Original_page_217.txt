" This would be a fact with which no one could have acquaintance except Desdemona ; hence in the sense of self-evidence that we are considering, the truth that Desdemona loves Cassio (if it were a truth) could only be selfevident to Desdemona. All mental facts, and all facts concerning sense-data, have this same privacy : there is only one person to whom they can be self-evident in our present sense, since there is only one person who can be acquainted with the mental things or the sense-data concerned.
