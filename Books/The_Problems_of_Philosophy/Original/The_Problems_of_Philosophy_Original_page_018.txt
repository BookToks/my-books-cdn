But the other colours which appear under other conditions have just as good a right to be considered real ; and therefore, to avoid favouritism, we are compelled to deny that, in itself, the table has any one particular colour.
 
 The same thing applies to the texture.
 
 With the naked eye one can see the grain, but otherwise the table looks smooth and even. If we looked at it through a microscope, we should see roughnesses and hills and valleys, and all sorts of differences that are imperceptible to the naked eye. Which of these is the "real" table? We are naturally tempted to say that what we see through the microscope is more real, but Lliat in turn would be changed by a still more powerful microscope. If, then, we cannot trust what we see with the naked eye, why should we trust what we see through a microscope ? Thus, again, the APPEARANCE AND REALITY 15 confidence in our senses with which we began deserts us.
