When I am acquainted with *' my seeing the sun," it seems plain that I am acquainted with two different things in relation to each other. On the one hand there is the sensedatum which represents the sun to me, on the other hand there is that which sees this sense-datum. All acquaintance, such as my acquaintance with the sense-datum which represents the sun, seems obviously a relation between the person acquainted and the object with which the person is acquainted. When a case of acquaintance is one with which I can be acquainted (as I am acquainted with my acquaintance with the sense-datum representing the s un), it is plain that the person acquainted is myself. Thus, when I am acquainted with my seeing the sun, the whole fact with which I am acquainted is " Selfacquainted-with-sense-datum." Further, we know the truth " I am acquainted with this sense-datum." It is hard to see how we could know this truth, or 80 THE PROr.
