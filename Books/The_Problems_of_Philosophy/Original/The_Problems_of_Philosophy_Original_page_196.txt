Thus coherence as the definition of truth fails because there is no proof that there can be only one coherent system.
 
 The other objection to this definition of truth is that it assumes the meaning of " coherence " k nown, whereas, in fact, " coherence " p resupposes the truth of the laws of logic. Two propositions are coherent when both may be true, and are incoherent when one at least must be false. Now in order to know whether two propositions can both be true, we must know such truths as the law of contradiction. For example, the two propositions " this tree is a beech " and " this tree is not a beech," are not coherent, because of the law of contradiction. But if the law of contradiction itself were subjected to t he test of coherence, we should find that, if we choose to suppose it false, nothing will any longer be incoherent with anything else. Thus the laws of logic supply the skeleton or framework within which the test of coherence applies, and they themselves cannot be established by this test.
