The phrase " a pn'on " is less objectionable, and is more usual in modern writers. Thus, while admitting that all knowledge is e licited and caused by experience, we shall nevertheless hold that some knowledge is a priori^ in the sense that the experience which makes us think of it does not suffice to prove it, but merely so directs our attention that we see its truth without requiring any proof from experience.
 
 There is another point of great importance, in which the empiricists were in the right as against the rationalists. Nothing can be known to exist except by the help of experience. That is to say, if we wish to prove that something of which we have no direct experience exists, we must have among our premisses the existence of one or more things of which we have direct experience. Our belief that the Emperor of Russia exists, for example, rests upon testimony, and testimony consists, in the last analysis, of sense-data seen or heard in reading or being spoken to. Rationalists believed that, from general consideration as to what must be, they could GENERAL PRINCIPLES 117 deduce the existence of this or that in the actual world.
