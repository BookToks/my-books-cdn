There are three important things to keep in mind when trying to understand what truth really is. Any idea about truth has to meet these three requirements.

First, our idea of truth must allow for its opposite, which is falsehood. Many philosophers have struggled with this because they made ideas that said all our thoughts should be true, and then they couldn’t explain how falsehood fits in. Our idea about belief has to be different from our idea about knowing things directly, because when we just know something directly, we don’t need to think about opposites.

Second, it seems clear that without beliefs, there would be no falsehood and no truth either, at least not in the way that truth and falsehood are connected. If we imagine a world made only of matter, there wouldn’t be any falsehood there. That world might have facts, but it wouldn’t have truths like we usually mean, the kind that are the opposite of falsehood.
