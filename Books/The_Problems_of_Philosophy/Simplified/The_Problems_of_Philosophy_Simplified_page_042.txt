This discovery isn’t strange when it comes to taste, smell, and sound, and only a little strange when it comes to touch. It doesn’t change our natural belief that there are real objects behind what we sense.

Since this belief doesn’t cause any problems and actually makes it easier to explain what we experience, there’s no good reason to stop believing it. So, we can accept—though with a little doubt because of dreams—that the outside world really exists and doesn’t depend on us always noticing it.

The argument that brought us to this idea isn’t as strong as we might want. But it’s like many other philosophical arguments, so it’s worth thinking about its overall nature and how valid it is.
