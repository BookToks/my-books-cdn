All place names—like London, England, Europe, Earth, and the Solar System—are connected to specific things we already know about. I think even the Universe, when studied in philosophy, is linked to these kinds of specific things.

But in logic, we don’t just think about what actually exists. We also think about anything that could exist or be real, without needing to point to actual examples.

It seems that when we talk about something only by its description, we often want to say something about the real thing itself, not just the description. For example, when we say something about Bismarck, we want to make a judgment that only Bismarck himself could make, because he is part of that judgment.
