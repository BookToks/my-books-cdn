So, it’s really unnecessary to think that physical things actually have colors, and there’s no good reason to believe they do.

The same kind of thinking applies to other things we sense.

Now, we need to ask if there are any big philosophical reasons to say that if matter is real, it has to be a certain way. Many philosophers, maybe most, have said that whatever is real must be mental in some way, or at least that we can only know things that are mental in some way. These philosophers are called *idealists.* Idealists say that what looks like matter is really something mental. For example, Leibniz thought matter was made of simple minds, and Berkeley said matter is just ideas in minds that notice or "perceive" it.

So, idealists don’t believe matter is something totally different from the mind, but they do agree that what we sense points to something that exists outside of our own private feelings.
