Thus it is quite gratuitous to suppose that physical objects have colours, and therefore there is no justification for making such a supposition.
 
 Exactly similar arguments will apply to other sense-data.
 
 It remains to ask whether there are any general philosophical arguments enabling us to say that, if matter is real, it must be of such and such a nature. As explained above, , v ery many philosophers, perhaps most, have held that whatever is real must be in some sense mental, or at any rate that whatever we can know anything about must be in some ' sense mental. Such philosophers are called *' idealists." Idealists tell us that what appears as matter is really something mental ; namely, either (as Leibniz held) more or less rudimentary minds, or (as Berkeley contended) ideas in the minds which, as we should commonly say, " perceive " the matter. Thus idealists deny the existence of matter as something intrinsically different from mind, though they do not deny that our sense-data are signs of something which exists inde- THE NATURE OF MATTER 57 pendently of our private sensations.
