When we use the word "idea" like Berkeley does, there are two different things to think about whenever we have an idea in our mind. 

First, there is the thing we are aware of — like the color of my table. Second, there is the actual mental action of noticing or understanding that thing. 

The mental action is definitely happening in the mind, but is the thing we notice also in the mind? Our earlier points about color didn’t show that color is in the mind. They only showed that the color depends on how our eyes and the table work together. 

This means a certain color will appear if the light is right and a normal eye looks at the table from the right spot. But this doesn’t prove the color is inside the person’s mind. 

Berkeley’s idea, that the color has to be in the mind, seems believable because he mixes up the thing we notice with the act of noticing it. Both of these could be called an “idea,” and Berkeley probably called both ideas.
