For no clear reason, three of these ideas have been called the "Laws of Thought." They are: (1) The law of identity: "Whatever is, is." (2) The law of contradiction: "Nothing can both be and not be." (3) The law of excluded middle: "Everything must either be or not be." These three laws are examples of obvious logical rules, but they are not really more basic or obvious than other similar rules. For example, the one we talked about earlier, which says that if something follows from a true statement, then it is also true.

The name "laws of thought" can be confusing because what really matters is not that we think following these laws, but that things actually follow these laws. In other words, when we think using these laws, we are thinking correctly.
