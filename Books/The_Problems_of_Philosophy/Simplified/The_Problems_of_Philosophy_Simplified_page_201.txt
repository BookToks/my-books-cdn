So, when Othello believes something, what’s really happening is that the idea of Othello, Desdemona, loving, and Cassio are all connected together in his mind. Believing or judging means the mind is linking itself to different things. A belief or judgment is just this connection happening at a certain time.

Now, we can understand what makes a judgment true or false. To do this, we need some definitions. Every time someone judges, there is a mind doing the judging, and there are things being judged about.

We’ll call the mind the subject in the judgment, and the things it judges about the objects. So, when Othello thinks that Desdemona loves Cassio, Othello is the subject, and Desdemona, loving, and Cassio are the objects.
