When what we believe is true, you might think that means we actually know what we believe. But that’s not how people usually use the word "know." 

For example, if a guy thinks the last name of the late Prime Minister starts with a B, he believes something true because the late Prime Minister was Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman.

But if he thinks Mr. Balfour was the late Prime Minister, he still believes the last name starts with B. Even though this belief is true, we wouldn’t say he truly knows it. 

If a newspaper guesses the result of a battle before getting any official news, and it turns out they guessed right, some readers might believe it. But even though they believe something true, they don’t really know it. 

So, it’s clear that just having a true belief doesn’t mean you have knowledge, especially if that belief comes from something false.
