This is how I learn about general connections.

In the same way, I notice the order of things in time. For example, if I hear a set of bells ringing, when the last bell sounds, I can remember the whole set and see that the earlier bells came before the later ones. Also, when I remember something, I know it happened before now. From these experiences, I understand the general idea of before and after, just like I understood the idea of "being to the left of." So, time relationships, like space relationships, are things I get to know.

Another connection I learn about in a similar way is how things look alike. If I see two shades of green at the same time, I can tell they look alike. If I also see a shade of red then, I can tell the two greens look more alike to each other than either does to the red.
