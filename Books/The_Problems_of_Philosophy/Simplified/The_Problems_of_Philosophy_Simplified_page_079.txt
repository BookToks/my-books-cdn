We know a description, and we know that only one thing fits that description, even if we don’t know the thing itself. In this case, we say we know the thing by its description.

All our knowledge, whether it’s about things or facts, is based on being familiar with something first. So, it’s important to think about what kinds of things we can be familiar with.

We already saw that sense-data, like what we see or hear, are things we are familiar with. They are the clearest example of knowing by being directly familiar with something. But if sense-data were the only things we knew, our knowledge would be very limited. We would only know what we sense right now; we couldn’t know anything about the past or even that a past exists. Also, we couldn’t know any facts about our sense-data, because knowing facts needs us to be familiar with things that are very different from sense-data. These things are sometimes called "abstract ideas," but we will call them "universals."
