Philosophical knowledge is not really different from scientific knowledge. There isn’t a special kind of wisdom that only philosophy can access and science cannot. The ideas that come from philosophy are not completely different from the ideas that come from science.

What makes philosophy different from science is that it is all about criticism. Philosophy carefully checks the ideas used in science and everyday life. It looks for any problems or contradictions in these ideas and only accepts them if, after careful thinking, there is no good reason to reject them.

Some philosophers have thought that the basic ideas behind science could help us understand the whole universe. If that were true, this knowledge would be just as reliable as scientific knowledge. But our investigation hasn’t found any such knowledge. So, when it comes to the big claims made by some bold philosophers, the results have mostly been negative.

However, when it comes to the knowledge most people agree on, our results have been mostly positive. We rarely found reasons to reject this kind of knowledge after careful thought, and we have no reason to believe that humans can’t have the kind of knowledge they usually are thought to have.
