The arguments used are very different: some are good and clear, while others are confusing or picky. But Berkeley deserves credit for showing that you can say matter doesn’t exist without sounding crazy, and if anything exists outside of us, it can’t be the direct things we see or feel.

There are two different questions when we ask if matter exists, and it’s important to keep them separate. Usually, when we say "matter," we mean something opposite to "mind," something that takes up space and can’t think or feel.

Berkeley mainly denies matter in this way. He doesn’t deny that the things we sense, like the table, show that something exists outside of us, but he does deny that this something is non-mental—that it isn’t a mind or ideas in a mind.
