Coherence can’t be used to explain what truth really means, even though it’s often a helpful way to check if something is true once we already know some truth.

So, we have to go back to the idea that truth means matching up with facts.

But first, we need to be clear about what we mean by “fact” and how a belief has to match a fact for the belief to be true.

Based on three important points, we need a theory of truth that:

(1) says truth can have an opposite, which is falsehood,  
(2) says truth is something that beliefs can have, and  
(3) says truth depends completely on how beliefs relate to things outside our minds.

Because we have to allow for falsehood, we can’t think of belief as just a connection between our mind and one single object that we believe in. If belief worked like that, it would always be true, and there wouldn’t be any difference between truth and falsehood.
