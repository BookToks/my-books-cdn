If what we said before is right, this idea is wrong. Besides being wrong, it makes thinking about big questions useless because it traps us inside ourselves. What it calls knowledge isn’t really understanding the world outside us; it’s just a bunch of biases, habits, and wants that block us from seeing the world clearly. Someone who likes this idea of knowledge is like a person who never leaves their home because they’re scared they won’t be in charge.

Real deep thinking, on the other hand, feels good when we learn more about things outside ourselves. It grows the things we think about and also grows us as people. In true thinking, anything that’s just about you or depends on your habits doesn’t matter.
