This view, if our previous discussions were correct, is untrue ; but in addition to being untrue, it has the effect of robbing philosophic contemplation of all that gives it value, since it fetters contemplation to Self. What it calls knowledge is not a union with the not-Self, but a set of prejudices, habits, and desires, making an impenetrable veil between us and the world beyond. The man who finds pleasure in such a theory of knowledge is like the man who never leaves the domestic circle for fear his word might not be law.
 
 The true philosophic contemplation, on the contrary, finds its satisfaction in every enlargement of t he not-Self, in everything that magnifies the objects contemplated, and thereby the subject contemplating. Everything, in c ontemplation, that is personal or private, everything that depends upon habit.
