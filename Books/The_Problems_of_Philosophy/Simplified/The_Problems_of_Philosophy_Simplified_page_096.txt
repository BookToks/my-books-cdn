When we talk about Julius Caesar, we're not just talking about the name itself. Instead, we're talking about a description of him made up of things we know and understand.

The main point about knowing something by description is that it helps us learn about things beyond what we've personally seen or experienced.

Even though we can only truly know things made up of stuff we've experienced, we can still understand things we've never directly experienced by using descriptions.

Since our own experiences are pretty limited, being able to know things this way is really important. If we donâ€™t get this, a lot of what we know might seem confusing or doubtful.
