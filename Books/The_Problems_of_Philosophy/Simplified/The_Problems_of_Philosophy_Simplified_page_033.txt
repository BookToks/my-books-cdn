Descartes helped philosophy a lot by creating the idea of doubt and showing that things we feel inside ourselves are the most certain. This is why his ideas are still important for students learning about philosophy.

But you have to be careful when using Descartes' argument. "I think, therefore I am" might mean more than we can really be sure of. It seems like we can be sure we are the same person today as we were yesterday, and that’s probably true in some way.

But the real "self" is hard to understand, just like the real table is hard to know for sure. It doesn’t feel as definitely true as certain experiences do. When I look at my table and see a brown color, what’s really certain is not "I am seeing a brown color," but "a brown color is being seen."

This means something or someone is seeing the brown color, but it doesn’t automatically mean the permanent person we call "I" is there. That’s as far as we can be immediately certain.
