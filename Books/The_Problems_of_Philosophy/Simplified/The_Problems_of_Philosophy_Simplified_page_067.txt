The idea of something being "in" your mind is a bit unclear. When we say we are "bearing someone in mind," we don’t mean that the person is actually inside our mind, but that we are thinking about them.

When someone says they forgot about some business, they don’t mean the business itself was inside their mind. They just mean that they used to think about it, but then they stopped.

So, when Berkeley says that a tree must be in our minds if we know it, what he really means is that we must have a thought of the tree in our minds. Saying the tree itself is in our minds is like saying the person we think about is actually inside our heads.

This mix-up might seem too silly for a smart philosopher to make, but some things made it possible. To understand how, we need to learn more about what ideas really are.
