There is a big problem with this idea, actually two big problems. The first problem is that there’s no reason to think that only one complete set of beliefs can be true.

A writer, for example, could use their imagination to create a story about the past that fits with what we know, but is still very different from what really happened.

In science, there are often two or more explanations that can explain all the facts about something. Scientists try to find facts that prove only one explanation is right, but they might not always succeed.

In philosophy, it’s also common for two different ideas to explain all the facts. For example, it’s possible that life is just one long dream and the outside world is only as real as things in dreams. But even though this idea doesn’t contradict what we know, there’s no reason to believe it more than the normal idea that other people and things really exist.
