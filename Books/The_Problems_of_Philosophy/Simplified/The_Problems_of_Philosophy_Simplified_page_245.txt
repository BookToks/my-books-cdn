Is the universe planned with a purpose, or is it just a random mix of atoms? Is consciousness something permanent in the universe that might grow smarter forever, or is it just a temporary accident on a small planet where life will eventually die out? Do good and evil matter to the universe, or only to people?

These kinds of questions are asked by philosophy, and different philosophers give different answers.

But it seems that, whether we can find true answers or not, the ideas from philosophy are never proven to be definitely true. Still, even if it’s hard to find answers, philosophy’s job is to keep thinking about these questions, show us why they matter, look at all the ways to answer them, and keep our curiosity about the universe alive. This curiosity often gets lost if we only focus on things we can prove for sure.
