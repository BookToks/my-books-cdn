Here’s how the problem came up for Plato. Let’s think about something like justice. If we ask what justice really is, it makes sense to look at different just actions to see what they have in common. They must all share some kind of common nature that only belongs to what is just.

This common nature, which makes all these actions just, is what justice really is—the pure idea of justice. When this idea mixes with real-life situations, it creates many different just actions. The same goes for other words that describe things we see a lot, like “whiteness.” The word fits many things because they all share a common nature or essence.

Plato calls this pure essence an "idea" or "form." (These "ideas" don’t exist in our minds, but we can understand them.) The "idea" of justice isn’t the same as any one just thing; it’s something different that all just things have in common.
