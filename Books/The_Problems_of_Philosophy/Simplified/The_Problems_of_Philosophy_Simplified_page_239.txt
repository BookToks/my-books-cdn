Descartes' "methodical doubt," which started modern philosophy, is not just any kind of doubt. It is a special kind of questioning that is really what philosophy is all about. His "methodical doubt" means doubting anything that seems unsure. He would stop and ask himself if he could really be sure about something he thought he knew.

This kind of questioning is what makes up philosophy. Some knowledge, like knowing that we have sense experiences, seems completely certain no matter how carefully we think about it. For these kinds of knowledge, philosophy doesn’t say we should stop believing them.

But there are other beliefs, like thinking that physical objects look exactly like our sense experiences. We believe these until we start thinking carefully, and then these beliefs can disappear when we really examine them. Philosophy tells us to stop believing things like this unless we find a good reason to keep believing them.

However, rejecting beliefs that don’t have any problems when we look closely at them is not reasonable, and philosophy does not support doing that.
