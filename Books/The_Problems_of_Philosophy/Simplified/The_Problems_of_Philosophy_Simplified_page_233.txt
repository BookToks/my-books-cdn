Kant was the first to point out a problem with space and time. He said that space and time aren’t real things but just things we imagine in our minds. Since then, many philosophers have thought that space and time are only how things seem, not how the world actually is. 

But thanks to mathematicians like Georg Cantor, we now know that thinking infinite collections are impossible was wrong. Infinite collections don’t actually contradict themselves; they just go against some common but stubborn ideas we have.

Because of this, the reasons for thinking space and time aren’t real don’t work anymore. This idea was a big part of some deep philosophical theories, and now that idea is fading away.

Mathematicians didn’t stop there. They showed that the usual way we think about space is just one way, and many other types of space are possible too, at least according to logic. Some rules from Euclid, which we used to think were absolutely true because they made sense to us, are now seen as true only because we are used to regular space, not because they are logically necessary.
