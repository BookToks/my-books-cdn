Now, we can be pretty sure about which ideas are true or false between these two groups. We have to admit, for the reasons already mentioned, that logical rules are something we know, but we can’t prove them by experience because all proof depends on them. So, in this important part of the argument, the rationalists were right.

But, even the knowledge we have that doesn’t rely on experience (meaning experience can’t prove it) still comes from experience. It’s through certain experiences that we learn the general rules that those experiences show us.

It would be silly to think that babies are born knowing everything adults know, and that this knowledge can’t come from experience. That’s why we don’t call our understanding of logical rules “innate” anymore.
