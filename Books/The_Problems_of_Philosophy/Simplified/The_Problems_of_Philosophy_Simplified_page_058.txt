What is true for colors is pretty much the same for other things we sense.

So, even though physical objects have many properties we can understand because they match what we sense, the objects themselves stay unknown in their true nature, at least as far as our senses can tell.

The question is whether there is any other way to find out what physical objects are really like inside.

The most obvious idea, though not the strongest one, especially about what we see, is that even though physical objects can’t be exactly like what we sense, they might be kind of similar. This means objects might really have colors, and sometimes we might be lucky enough to see the object’s true color.

The color an object looks like at any moment will usually be very close, but not exactly the same, from different angles. So, we might think the "real" color is like a middle color between all the different shades we see from different views.
