And what holds for colours is closely similar to what holds for other sense-data.
 
 Thus we find that, although the relations of physical objects have all sorts of knowable properties, derived from their correspondence with the relations of sense-data, the physical objects themselves remain unknown in t heir intrinsic nature, so far at least as can be discovered by means of the senses.
 
 The question remains whether there is any other method of discovering the intrinsic nature of physical objects.
 
 The most natural, though not ultimately the most defensible, hypothesis to adopt in the first instance, at any rate as regards visual sense-data, would be that, though physical objects cannot, for the reasons we have been considering, be exactly like sense-data, yet they may be more or less like. According to this view, physical objects will, for example, really have colours, and we might, by good luck, see an object as of the colour it really is. The colour which an object seems to THE NATURE OF MATTER 55 have at any given moment will in general be very similar, though not quite the same, from many different points of view ; we might thus suppose the " real " colour to be a sort of medium colour, intermediate between the various shades which appear from the different points of view.
