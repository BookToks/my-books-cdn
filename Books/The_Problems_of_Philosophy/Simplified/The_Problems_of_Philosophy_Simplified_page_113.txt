CHAPTER VII ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES

In the last chapter, we learned that the principle of induction is needed for all arguments based on experience. But this principle itself can’t be proved by experience. Still, everyone believes it, at least when they use it in real life.

This principle isn’t the only one like this. There are many other principles that can’t be proved or disproved by experience, but we use them when we talk about things we have experienced.

Some of these principles are even more certain than the principle of induction. Knowing them is as sure as knowing that we have sense-data (what we see, hear, and feel).

These principles help us make guesses or conclusions from what we sense. If our conclusions are going to be true, then it’s just as important for our rules of thinking to be true as it is for our senses to give us true information.
