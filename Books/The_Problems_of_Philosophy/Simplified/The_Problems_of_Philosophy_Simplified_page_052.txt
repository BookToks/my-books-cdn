We can only understand what kind of feelings we get from an object if we think about where the object is compared to our body in physical space. The way we feel or sense something depends a lot on how close or far the object is from us.

Our senses, like sight and touch, happen in our own personal spaces. But science and common sense say that there is one big physical space where all objects exist. The way things are placed in this big space matches up with the way we experience them in our own senses. This idea makes sense and is easy to believe.

For example, if we see one house closer to us on the road than another, our other senses will agree. We know the closer house will take less time to reach if we walk down the road.
