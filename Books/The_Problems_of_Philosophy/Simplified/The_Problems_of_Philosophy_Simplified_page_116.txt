" This principle is really involved — at least, concrete instances of it are involved — in all demonstrations. Whenever one thing which we believe is used to prove something else, which we consequently believe, this principle is relevant. If any one asks : " Why should I accept the results of valid arguments based on true premisses ? " we can only answer by appealing to our principle. In fact, the truth of the principle is impossible to doubt, and its obviousness is so great that at first sight it seems almost trivial. Such principles, however, » are not trivial to the philosopher, for they show that we may have indubitable knowledge which is in no way derived from objects of sense.
 
 The above principle is merely one of a certain number of self-evident logical principles. Some at least of these principles must be granted before any argument or proof becomes possible. When some of them have been granted, others can be proved, though GENERAL PRINCIPLES 113 these others, so long as they are simple, are just as obvious as the principles taken for granted.
