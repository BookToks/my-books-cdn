This idea is really involved — or at least, real examples of it are involved — in all proofs. Whenever we use something we believe to show that something else is true, this idea matters. If someone asks, "Why should I trust the results of good arguments based on true facts?" we can only answer by using this idea. Actually, it’s impossible to doubt this idea, and it seems so obvious that at first it looks almost too simple. But these ideas are not simple to philosophers, because they show we can have certain knowledge that doesn’t come from what we see or feel.

The idea above is just one of several self-evident logical ideas. At least some of these ideas have to be accepted before any argument or proof can work. Once some are accepted, others can be proven, but these others, as long as they are simple, are just as obvious as the ideas we start with.
