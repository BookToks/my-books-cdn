The space of science is connected to the spaces we see and feel, but it is not exactly the same. How exactly they are connected needs to be studied.

We agreed that physical objects are not exactly like what we sense, but they might cause the sensations we have. These physical objects exist in the space of science, which we can call "physical" space.

Itâ€™s important to understand that if physical objects cause our sensations, there must be a physical space that holds these objects, our sense organs, nerves, and brain.

We feel touch from an object when our body is touching it, which means our body is very close to the object in physical space. We see an object when nothing solid is blocking the space between the object and our eyes.

In the same way, we only hear, smell, or taste an object when we are close enough to it or when it touches our tongue.
