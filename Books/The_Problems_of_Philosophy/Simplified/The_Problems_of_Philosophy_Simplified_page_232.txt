So, space and time seem to go on forever.

Also, if you pick any two points on a line, it looks like there are always other points between them, no matter how close those two points are. You can keep splitting the distance in half again and again, without end. The same goes for time: no matter how little time passes between two moments, there always seems to be another moment in between.

This means space and time can be divided into smaller and smaller parts forever. But some philosophers argue that there canâ€™t be infinite amounts of things. So, they say the number of points in space or moments in time must be limited. This creates a problem because space and time seem infinite, but infinite sets might not be possible.
