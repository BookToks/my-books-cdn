CHAPTER XIII KNOWLEDGE, ERROR, AND PROBABLE OPINION

The question about what truth and falsehood mean, which we talked about in the last chapter, is not as interesting as the question about how we can actually know what is true and what is false. This is what we will focus on in this chapter.

We know that some of our beliefs are wrong. So, we want to find out how sure we can be that a belief is not wrong. In other words, can we really know anything for sure, or do we just sometimes get lucky and believe what is true?

Before we can think about this question, we have to decide what we mean by "knowing." This is not as easy as it sounds.

At first, we might think that knowledge just means "true belief."
