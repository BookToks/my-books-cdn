This all seems so obvious that it hardly needs to be said, except when someone doubts that I really know anything. But it’s okay to question this, and we need to think carefully before we can be sure we’ve explained it perfectly.

To make things clearer, let’s focus on the table. It looks long, brown, and shiny. When you touch it, it feels smooth, cool, and hard. If I tap it, it makes a wooden sound. Anyone who sees, touches, and hears the table would agree with this. So, it seems like there shouldn’t be any problem.

But when we try to be more exact, things get tricky. I believe the table is actually the same color all over, but some parts look brighter because they reflect more light. Some parts even look white because of the light reflecting off them.
