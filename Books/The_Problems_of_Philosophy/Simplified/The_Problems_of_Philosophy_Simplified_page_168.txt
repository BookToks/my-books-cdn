It’s not necessary to know every single pair in the world. If it were, we could never understand the idea because there are endless pairs, and we can’t know them all.

Even though our general statement talks about pairs in general, it doesn’t say anything about any specific pair. So, it doesn’t make a claim about any actual pair.

The statement is about the idea of “pair” in general, not about any one particular pair.

For example, the statement “two and two are four” is about general ideas, and anyone who understands those ideas and how they connect can know it. It’s a fact that we can sometimes understand these connections between general ideas, which lets us know things like math and logic without needing to check every case.
