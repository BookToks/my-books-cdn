The newness of the knowledge is less sure when we look at the common example of deduction in logic books: "All men are mortal; Socrates is a man, so Socrates is mortal."

What we really know without much doubt is that some men, like A, B, and C, died. If Socrates is one of these men, it’s silly to use "all men are mortal" to say Socrates is mortal.

If Socrates isn’t one of the men we already know about, it’s still better to think directly from A, B, and C to Socrates, instead of going through "all men are mortal." This is because the chance that Socrates is mortal is higher based on what we know about A, B, and C than on the idea that all men are mortal.
