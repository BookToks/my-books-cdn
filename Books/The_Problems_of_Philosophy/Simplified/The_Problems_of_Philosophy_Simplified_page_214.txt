It's hard to give a super exact definition because any definition might be a bit confusing or wrong.

The main problem with knowledge isn’t about things we learn from other things (derivative knowledge), but about knowledge we just know without proof (intuitive knowledge). When we have derivative knowledge, we can check it by comparing it to intuitive knowledge. But with intuitive beliefs, it’s really hard to tell which ones are true and which ones are false.

Because of this, it’s almost impossible to get a perfect answer. All the truths we know have some doubt, and any idea that ignores this is definitely wrong.

Still, we can try to make things a bit easier to understand.

Our idea of truth helps us see that some truths are obvious and can’t be wrong. When a belief is true, there is a real fact behind it where all parts of the belief fit together perfectly.
