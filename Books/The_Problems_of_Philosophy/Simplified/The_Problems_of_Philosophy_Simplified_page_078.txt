The things I see and feel on my table are things I know directly, just as they are.

But knowing the table itself as a real object is different. I don't know it directly. I learn about the table by knowing the things I see and feel on it.

We can even doubt if the table is really there, but we can't doubt the things we see and feel. My knowledge of the table is called "knowledge by description." That means the table is described as "the real object that causes these things I see and feel."

To know anything about the table, I have to understand that these things I see and feel come from a real object. We never directly experience the table itself; all we really know are facts connecting what we sense to the idea of a table. So, in a way, we donâ€™t truly know the table itself.
