From what has been said, it’s clear that both intuitive knowledge and knowledge we get from it can be trusted depending on how obvious they seem. There is a range of how much we can trust things, from definitely true stuff like clear sensory experiences and basic logic or math, to things that only seem a bit more likely than their opposite.

When we strongly believe something and it’s true, we call that knowledge, as long as it comes directly or logically from intuitive knowledge. If we strongly believe something but it’s not true, that’s called an error. If we strongly believe something but it’s neither knowledge nor error, or if we believe something with some doubt because it’s not very obvious, we call that probable opinion. So, most things people call knowledge are actually just probable opinions.

About probable opinion, we can get a lot of help from how well ideas fit together, which we don’t use as the main way to decide what’s true, but we often use it to help us figure things out.
