We can only stop believing something if we have a reason to believe something else instead. So, by organizing our natural beliefs and thinking about what might need to change or be dropped, we can create a clear and organized way of understanding what we know. Even though we might still make mistakes, the chances get smaller because everything fits together and has been carefully checked before we accept it.

This is at least one thing philosophy can do. Many philosophers think, right or wrong, that philosophy can do even more — like helping us know things about the whole universe and what reality really is. Whether that’s true or not, philosophy can definitely do the simpler job we talked about. This is enough for people who start to question common sense and want to spend time working on tough philosophical problems.
