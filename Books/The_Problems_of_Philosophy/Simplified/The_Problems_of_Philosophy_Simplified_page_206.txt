A mind believes something when there is a real situation that matches what it believes. This real situation doesn’t depend on the mind but only on the things the belief is about. If this match is there, the belief is true. If not, it is false.

So, beliefs need minds to exist, but their truth doesn’t depend on minds.

For example, if we say "Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio," then Desdemona and Cassio are the things the belief is about, and loving is the relationship between them. If there really is a situation where Desdemona loves Cassio, then this situation matches the belief. That means the belief is true. If there isn’t, it is false.

Minds don’t make beliefs true or false. They only create beliefs. Once a belief is made, the mind can’t change if it’s true or false, except when it’s about future things that the person can control, like catching a train.
