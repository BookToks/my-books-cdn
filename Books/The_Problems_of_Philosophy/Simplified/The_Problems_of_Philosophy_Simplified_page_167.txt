If we can show that statements like this only talk about general ideas, then we can say the idea is proven.

One way to figure out what a statement is about is to ask what words we need to understand — or what things we need to know about — to get the meaning. Once we understand what the statement means, even if we don’t know if it’s true or false yet, we can see what the statement really talks about. 

By using this idea, it looks like many statements that seem to be about specific things are actually about general ideas. For example, the statement "two and two are four," even if we think it means "any group made of two twos is a group of four," is clear once we know what "group," "two," and "four" mean.
