The inductive principle isn’t as obviously true as some other rules in logic, like "if something follows from a true statement, it must also be true." Memories become less clear and believable the older and weaker they get. The truths in logic and math are also less obvious when they get more complicated. Opinions about what’s right or beautiful might seem somewhat obvious, but not very much.

How obvious something is matters in understanding knowledge. If some ideas seem obvious but might still be wrong, we don’t have to stop thinking obviousness and truth are connected. Instead, when two ideas clash, we should keep the one that seems more obvious and reject the one that seems less obvious.

It’s very likely that “self-evidence” actually means two different things. One kind, which feels the most obvious, is a sure sign that something is true. The other kind, which covers all the less obvious cases, doesn’t guarantee truth but only makes something seem more or less likely to be true.
