For example, if we draw lines straight down from each corner of a triangle to the opposite side, all three lines will meet at one point. You might discover this by drawing lots of triangles and noticing that the lines always meet in the same way. This could make you want to prove why it always happens. Many mathematicians have this kind of experience.

There is another interesting idea that is more about how we think. Sometimes, we can know a rule is true even if we havenâ€™t seen a single example of it. For example, we know any two numbers can be multiplied to get a new number called their product. We also know that for all pairs of whole numbers whose product is less than 100, people have already multiplied them and written them down in multiplication tables.

But we also know there are infinitely many whole numbers, and only a limited number of pairs have ever been multiplied or imagined by humans.
