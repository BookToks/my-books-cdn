If what was said before is right, then all the truths we know come from our intuitive knowledge. So, it’s important to think about what intuitive knowledge is and how far it goes, just like we did earlier with knowledge by acquaintance.

But knowing truths brings up a new problem that doesn’t happen when we just know things. This problem is about mistakes. Sometimes, what we believe turns out to be wrong. So, we need to figure out how to tell the difference between what we really know and what is just an error.

This problem doesn’t happen with knowledge by acquaintance. No matter what we are acquainted with, even in dreams or hallucinations, there’s no mistake as long as we stick to what we directly experience. Mistakes only happen when we think that what we directly experience (like a sense-datum) is a sign of a real physical object.

So, the problems with knowing truths are harder than those with just knowing things.
