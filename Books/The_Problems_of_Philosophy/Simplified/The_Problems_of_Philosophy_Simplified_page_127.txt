Sometimes, we can understand simple facts like "two and two are four" or other logical ideas without needing to look at examples first. But usually, seeing an example helps us understand what the general idea means.

This is why deduction is useful. Deduction means starting from a general idea and figuring out more general or specific ideas from it. Induction is the opposite—it starts from specific examples and moves to other specific cases or general ideas.

Philosophers have long debated whether deduction can ever give us new information. Now, we can see that sometimes it does. For example, if we know that two and two always make four, and we know Brown and Jones are two people, and Robinson and Smith are also two people, we can figure out that Brown, Jones, Robinson, and Smith are four people.

This is new information because the general idea "two and two are four" didn’t tell us about these people, and the specific facts didn’t say there were four of them. But the conclusion tells us both things.
