If Othello wrongly thinks that Desdemona loves Cassio, then there isn’t really a real connection like “Desdemona’s love for Cassio.” A belief is true when it matches up with a certain connection, and false when it doesn’t.

Let’s say a belief involves two things and a relationship between them. If these two things are joined by that relationship in the right order, the belief is true. If they aren’t, the belief is false. This is how we can define what truth and falsehood mean.

When someone believes or judges something, their mind is part of a bigger connection. If the other parts of that connection fit together in the way the belief says, then the belief is true. If they don’t, it’s false.

So, even though truth and falsehood belong to beliefs, they actually depend on things outside of the mind, like the actual objects or facts the belief is about.
