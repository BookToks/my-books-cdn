Science tries to find rules that always work, like the laws of motion and gravity. So far, these rules have never been broken in our experience.

This makes us wonder: if these rules have always worked before, do we have a good reason to believe they will keep working in the future?

Some people say yes, because what used to be the future eventually becomes the past, and it has always been similar to the past. So, they think we already know about the future by looking at past futures. But this idea doesn’t really answer the question. We know about past futures, but not about future futures. The real question is: will future futures be like past futures? We can’t answer that just by looking at the past. So, we still need a reason to believe the future will follow the same rules as the past.
