The business of science is to find uniformities, such as the laws of motion and the law of gravitation, to which, so far as our experience extends, there are no exceptions. In t his search science has been remarkably successful, and it may be conceded that such uniformities have held hitherto.
 
 This brings us back to the question : Have we any reason, assuming that they have always held in the past, to suppose that they will hold in the future ?
 
 It has been argued that we have reason to know that the future will resemble the past, because what was the future has constantly become the past, and has always been found to resemble the past, so that we really have experience of the future, namely of times which were formerly future, which we may call past futures. But such an argument really begs the very question at issue. We have experience of past futures, but not of future futures, and the question is : W ill future futures resemble past futures ? This question is n ot to be answered by an argument which starts from past futures alone. We ON INDUCTION 101 have therefore still to seek for some principle which shall enable us to know that the future will follow the same laws as the past.
