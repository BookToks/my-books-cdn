Our minds are made in a way that we believe two plus two equals four, and that’s true. But when we say two plus two equals four, we’re not just saying this because of how our minds work. Nothing about how our minds are made can make two plus two equal four true or false. So, if our knowledge before experience (a priori knowledge) isn’t wrong, it’s not just about how our minds are built. It applies to anything in the world, whether it’s about thoughts or real things.

It seems that all our a priori knowledge deals with things that don’t really exist, either in our minds or in the physical world. These things can be named by words that aren’t objects, like qualities or relationships. For example, imagine I’m in my room. I exist, and my room exists, but does the word “in” exist? Of course, “in” has meaning; it shows a relationship between me and my room.
