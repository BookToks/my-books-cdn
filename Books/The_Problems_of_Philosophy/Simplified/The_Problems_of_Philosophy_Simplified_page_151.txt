We feel such words to be incomplete and insubstantial ;t hey seem to demand a context before anything can be done with them.

 Even among philosophers, we may say, broadly, that only those universals which are named by adjectives or substantives have been much or often recognised, while those named by verbs and prepositions have been usually overlooked. This omission has had a very great effect upon philosophy ; it is hardly too much to say that most metaphysics, since Spinoza, has been largely determined by it.
