When we think about something like the head of Charles I or the act of cutting off his head, these are specific details. But we don’t usually stop to think about what the word "head" or "cut" really means on its own, because these words are more general. They feel incomplete and don’t make much sense without more information.

Because of this, we tend to ignore these general ideas until we study philosophy, which makes us pay attention to them.

Even philosophers mostly focus on general ideas that are named by adjectives or nouns, while those named by verbs and prepositions are often ignored. This has had a big impact on philosophy. In fact, a lot of modern metaphysics, especially since Spinoza, has been shaped by this.

In simple terms, adjectives and nouns usually describe qualities or features of single things, while verbs and prepositions often show the relationship between two or more things.
