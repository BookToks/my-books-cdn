He is said to have finally believed that he was at the Battle of Waterloo because he kept saying that he was. In this case, what people remembered was that he said it a lot; the belief in what he said (if he really believed it) came from hearing himself say it so much. So, it wasn’t a true memory. 

It seems that all cases of false memory can probably be explained this way—they are not really memories in the true sense.

One important thing about self-evidence is shown by the case of memory. Self-evidence isn’t just something you either have or don’t have. It can be stronger or weaker, from being 100% certain to just a tiny feeling that something is true. 

Things we see or some logical rules have the strongest kind of self-evidence. Memories we remember right away are almost as certain.
