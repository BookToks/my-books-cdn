I might know my toothache really well, just from feeling it, but that doesn’t mean I understand everything about it like a dentist does. The dentist can explain what causes the toothache, which I might not know. So, just because I know something personally doesn’t mean I know everything about it.

Also, just because something has connections or relationships with other things doesn’t mean those connections have to be that way. We only think they do because we already know about them.

Because of this, we can’t prove that the whole universe is one perfect system like the philosopher Hegel thought.

And if we can’t prove that, then we also can’t prove that space, time, matter, or even evil are not real. Hegel said they weren’t real because they only exist in parts and in relation to other things.

So, we have to study the world piece by piece, and we can’t fully understand parts of the universe that are far away from what we’ve experienced.
