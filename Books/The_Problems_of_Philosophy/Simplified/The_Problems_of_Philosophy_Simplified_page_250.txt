Wanting to prove something is a way of showing off yourself, and like all showing off, it actually stops the real you from growing, even though deep down you know you can grow. Showing off sees the world as something to use for its own goals; this makes the world seem less important than yourself, and you limit how great your achievements can be.

But when you think deeply and calmly, you start by looking at things outside yourself. By seeing how big and amazing the world is, your sense of self grows bigger too. When you think about the endless universe, your mind feels like it’s part of something endless.

Because of this, having a great soul doesn’t come from the ideas that say the universe is just like humans. Learning is a way to connect yourself with the world outside you. Like all connections, it doesn’t work well if one side tries to control the other, so trying to force the universe to fit what we expect inside ourselves makes this connection worse.

Many philosophies say that humans are the most important and that truth is made by people. They say space, time, and big ideas only exist in our minds, and if something is outside the mind, we can’t really know or care about it.
