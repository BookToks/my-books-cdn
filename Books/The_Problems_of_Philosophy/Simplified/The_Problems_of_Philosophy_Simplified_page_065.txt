To understand his argument, you need to know what he means by the word "idea." He uses "idea" to mean anything we know right away, like the things we sense. For example, a color we see is an idea, and a sound we hear is also an idea. But "idea" isn’t just about what we sense.

It also includes things we remember or imagine because when we remember or imagine, we know those things right away too. He calls all these immediate experiences "ideas." 

Next, he talks about common things, like a tree. He says that everything we know about the tree when we see it is made up of ideas, in the way he uses the word. He argues that there is no reason to think there is anything real about the tree besides what we perceive. He says the tree’s existence depends on being perceived. In Latin, they say its "being" is "to be perceived."

He does agree, though, that the tree still exists when we close our eyes or when no one is around.
