We have already looked at these reasons and decided they are not good enough. So, we can now assume it is true that nothing about the mind is needed to say that Edinburgh is north of London.

But this fact includes the idea of "north of," which is a general idea. It wouldn’t make sense if the whole fact had nothing to do with the mind, but the idea "north of," which is part of the fact, did depend on the mind. So, we have to accept that the idea, like the places it connects, doesn’t depend on thinking. Instead, it belongs to the real world, which our mind understands but does not make up.

However, there is a problem. The idea "north of" does not seem to exist in the same way that Edinburgh and London do. If we ask, "Where and when does this idea exist?" the answer has to be "Nowhere and no time." There is no place or time where you can find the idea "north of." It isn’t in Edinburgh any more than it is in London because it connects the two and is neutral between them.
