He decided that he would only believe something if he could see clearly that it was true. If he could even slightly doubt it, he would keep doubting it until he found a good reason not to.

Using this idea, he slowly became sure that the only thing he could be completely sure of was that he himself existed.

He thought about a tricky demon who could fool his senses by showing him things that weren’t real all the time. Even if it was very unlikely this demon was real, it was still possible. So, he could doubt everything he saw or felt.

But he couldn’t doubt that he existed, because if he didn’t exist, the demon couldn’t trick him. If he was doubting or experiencing anything, that meant he had to exist. So, his own existence was something he knew for sure.

He said, “I think, therefore I am” (Cogito, ergo sum). Starting with this truth, he began to slowly rebuild what he knew about the world after doubting everything else.
