He determined that he would believe nothing which he did not see quite clearly and distinctly to be true. Whatever he c ould bring himself to doubt, he would doubt, until he saw reason for not doubting it.

 He imagined a deceitful demon, who presented unreal things to his senses in a perpetual phantasmagoria ; it might be very improbable that such a demon existed, but still it was possible, and therefore doubt concerning things perceived by the senses was possible.
 
 But doubt concerning his own existence was not possible, for if he did not exist, no demon could deceive him. If he doubted, he must exist ; if he had any experiences whatever, he must exist. Thus his own existence was an absolute certainty to him.
