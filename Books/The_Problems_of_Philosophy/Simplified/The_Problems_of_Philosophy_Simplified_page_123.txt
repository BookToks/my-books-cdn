But it's pretty clear that you can't prove something is good or bad just by experiencing it. Whether something exists or not doesn't show if it should exist or shouldn't. This topic belongs to ethics, where they explain that you can't figure out what should happen just by looking at what does happen.

Here, the important thing is to understand that knowing what really matters or has value comes before experience, just like logic does. This means you can't prove or disprove it just by seeing or experiencing things.

All pure math is like this tooâ€”it comes before experience, just like logic.

Some philosophers who believed in learning only from experience strongly disagreed. They said that we learn math from experience just like we learn geography.

They argued that by always seeing two things and then two more things, and noticing they make four things together, we learn by repeating this experience that two plus two will always equal four.
