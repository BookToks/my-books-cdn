Science does not deny that it may have other properties ; but if so, such other properties are not useful to the man of science, and in no way assist him in explaining the phenomena.
 
 It is sometimes said that " light is a form of wave-motion," but this is misleading, for the light which we immediately see, which we know directly by means of our senses, is not a form of wave-motion, but something quite different â€” something which we all know if we are not blind, though we cannot describe it so as to convey our knowledge to a man who is blind. A wavemotion, on the contrary, could quite well be described to a blind man, since he can acquire a knowledge of space by the sense of touch ; and he can experience a wave-motion by a sea voyage almost as well as we can. But this, which a blind man can understand, is not what we mean by light: we mean by light just that which a blind man can never understand, THE NATURE OF MATTER 45 and which we can never describe to him.
