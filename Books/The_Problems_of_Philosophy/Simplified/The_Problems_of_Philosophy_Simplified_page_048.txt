Science doesn’t say light might not have other qualities. But if it does, those qualities don’t help scientists understand how light works or explain what happens.

People sometimes say “light is a kind of wave,” but that’s confusing. The light we see with our eyes is not a wave. It’s something different — something everyone with sight knows, but can’t explain to someone who is blind.

A wave can be explained to a blind person because they can feel space and even feel waves, like when on a boat. But the kind of light we see is something a blind person can’t understand, and we can’t describe it to them.
