We understand more about how distances relate to each other in physical space than about the actual distances themselves. For example, we can tell if one distance is longer than another or if they lie on the same straight line. But we don’t experience physical distances directly like we do with things in our personal space, or with colors, sounds, or other sensations.

It’s like how a person born blind can learn about sight from others but can never truly experience it. We can know about physical space in the same way, but we can’t fully understand it the way we do with things we sense directly. We can learn the rules about how distances relate to each other based on what we sense, but we can’t know what the distances really are by themselves.

When it comes to time, the way we feel time passing is often not a reliable way to know how much time has actually passed on a clock.
