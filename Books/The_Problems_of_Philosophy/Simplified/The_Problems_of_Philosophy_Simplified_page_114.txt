The rules we use to figure things out are often ignored because they seem so obvious. We agree with them without even realizing they are assumptions. But it’s really important to understand these rules if we want to have a good idea of what knowledge is. Learning about them brings up interesting and hard questions.

When we learn general ideas, what usually happens is that first we notice one specific example of the idea. Then we understand that the specific example doesn’t really matter, and that the general idea is true for many cases. 

This happens a lot when learning math. For example, we first learn "two and two are four" using some specific pair of twos. Then we try other pairs, and eventually, we see that it’s true for any pair of twos.
