We know that when we look, we see certain colors and shapes, and when we touch, we feel hardness. These feelings and experiences are real to us. So, even if many things are unsure, some of what we experience right now seems totally sure.

Descartes (1596-1650), who started modern philosophy, came up with a way to think called systematic doubt that we can still use today.
