This idea might not be completely proven wrong, but it can be shown to have no real basis. First, the color we see depends only on the light waves that hit our eyes. This means the color can change because of the space between us and the object, and how light bounces off the object toward our eyes.

The air between us and the object can change colors unless it is perfectly clear. Also, strong reflections can change colors a lot. So, the color we see comes from the light rays when they reach our eyes, not just from the object itself.

Because of this, as long as certain light waves reach our eyes, we will see a certain color, even if the object doesnâ€™t actually have that color.
