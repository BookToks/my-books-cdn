This is a big question, and we will have to come back to it later.

Besides the logical rules that help us prove something is definitely true from a given starting point, there are other logical rules that help us show that something is more or less likely to be true.

One important example of these rules is the inductive principle, which we talked about in the last chapter.

A major debate in philosophy has been between two groups called "empiricists" and "rationalists." The empiricists, like British philosophers Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, said all our knowledge comes from experience. The rationalists, like Continental philosophers Descartes and Leibniz, believed that besides what we learn from experience, there are some ideas and principles we know naturally, without needing experience.
