Actually, I think the reason we see the table again when I open my eyes, put my arm back, and start knocking on it is because the table is always there. It doesn’t just appear when I look at it.

So, the big question is: What is this real table that stays the same even when I’m not looking at it?

Physical science tries to answer this question. It’s not a perfect answer and some parts are still guesses, but it’s worth paying attention to. Science has slowly started to believe that everything in nature can be explained by movement.

Things like light, heat, and sound happen because of waves moving from the thing making them to the person sensing them. These waves happen in either something called ether or solid stuff, which philosophers call matter.

Science says that matter only has two important features: where it is in space and the ability to move following certain rules.
