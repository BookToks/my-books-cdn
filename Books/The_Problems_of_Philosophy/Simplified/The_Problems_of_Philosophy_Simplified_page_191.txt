Sometimes people believe things that aren’t true just as strongly as things that are true. This makes it hard to figure out how to tell the difference between true and false beliefs. How can we know if what we believe is actually wrong? This is a very tough question, and there isn’t a perfect answer.

But before we try to answer that, there’s an easier question to think about: What do we mean by truth and falsehood? This chapter will focus on that question.

Here, we’re not trying to find out how to know if a belief is true or false. Instead, we want to understand what it means to say a belief is true or false. Hopefully, this will help us later to figure out which beliefs are true.

For now, we only ask “What is truth?” and “What is falsehood?” — not “Which beliefs are true?” or “Which beliefs are false?” It’s very important to keep these questions separate because mixing them up will lead to answers that don’t really work for either one.
