The belief is said to constitute knowledge of this fact, provided it fulfils those further somewhat vague conditions which we have been considering in the present chapter.
 
 But in regard to any fact, besides the knowledge constituted by belief, we may also have the kind of knowledge constituted by perception (taking this word in its widest possible sense). For example, if you know the hour of the sunset, you can at that hour know the fact that the sun is setting : this is knowledge of the fact by way of knowledge of truths ; but you can also, if the weather is fine, look to the west and actually see the setting sun : you then know the same fact by the way of knowledge of things.
 
 Thus in regard to any complex fact, there are, theoretically, two ways in which it may be known : (1) by means of a judgment, in which its several parts are judged to be related as they are in fact related ; (2) by means of acquaintance with the complex fact itself, which may (in a large sense) be called perception, though it is by no means confined to objects of the senses. Now it will be 212 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY observed that the second way of knowing a complex fact, the way of acquaintance, is only possible when there really is such a fact, while the first way, like all judgment, is liable to error.
