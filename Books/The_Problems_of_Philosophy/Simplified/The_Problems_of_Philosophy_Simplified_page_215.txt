Believing something counts as knowing a fact, but only if it meets some unclear extra conditions we've talked about in this chapter.

Besides knowing facts by belief, we can also know facts by perception, which means seeing or experiencing them in the broadest sense. For example, if you know what time the sun sets, you can know the fact that the sun is setting at that time by understanding the truth. But if the weather is nice, you can also look outside and actually see the sun setting. That way, you know the fact by directly experiencing it.

So, for any complicated fact, there are two ways to know it: (1) by making a judgment, where you think about how its parts are connected; (2) by being directly familiar with the fact itself, which can be called perception, but this isnâ€™t just about using your senses. 

The second way, knowing by being familiar with the fact, only works if the fact really exists. The first way, making a judgment, can sometimes be wrong.
