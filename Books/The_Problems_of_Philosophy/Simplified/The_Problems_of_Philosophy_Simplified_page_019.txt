The shape of the table isn’t any clearer. We usually think we know the "real" shapes of things without even thinking about it, and we believe we actually see their true shapes.

But if you try to draw something, you’ll notice it looks different from every angle. If our table is really rectangular, from most views it will look like it has two sharp corners and two wide corners. If the sides are parallel, they will look like they meet at a point far away. If the sides are the same length, the closer side will look longer.

We don’t usually notice these things when we look at a table because we’ve learned to figure out the "real" shape from what it looks like. The "real" shape is what matters to us in real life. But the "real" shape isn’t exactly what we see; it’s something we guess based on what we see. And what we see changes all the time as we move around the table, so our senses don’t show us the truth about the table itself, just how it looks.
