Criticism means not just rejecting something without a good reason, but thinking carefully about each piece of information and keeping what still seems true after checking it.

We have to admit that we can still make mistakes because people are not perfect. Philosophy can help lower the chance of making mistakes, and sometimes it can make the chance so small that it hardly matters.

But it canâ€™t do more than that, because in the real world, mistakes will happen. No smart person who supports philosophy would say it can completely stop mistakes.
