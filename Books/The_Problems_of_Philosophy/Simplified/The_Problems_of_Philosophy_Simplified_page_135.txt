Pure empiricists say that we learn math by looking at many examples and noticing patterns. But this idea doesn’t work for two reasons. First, we can’t prove that this way of learning (called induction) is always true by using induction itself. Second, math statements like "two and two always make four" can be known for sure by just thinking about one example, and seeing more examples doesn’t make it more certain.

So, our knowledge of math and logic must come from something different than just learning from experience, unlike ideas like "all men are mortal," which are based on what we see around us and are only probably true. The problem is that math and logic are about general ideas, but all our experiences are about specific things.

It seems weird that we can know some truths about things before we have even seen them. But it’s hard to doubt that math and logic will work for those things too.
