The mention of the future in this question isn’t really necessary. The same question comes up when we use the rules we learn from our experiences to understand past events we haven’t seen — like in geology or ideas about how the Solar System started.

The real question we need to ask is: "If two things are often found together, and we never see one without the other, does seeing one now mean we can expect the other to be there too?"

How we answer this question is very important. It affects how much we can trust our guesses about the future, all the conclusions we make based on experience, and almost everything we believe in daily life.

We have to admit, at first, that just because two things are often found together and never apart doesn’t prove for sure they will always be found together the next time we check.
