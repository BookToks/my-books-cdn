When we are bored or in pain, time feels like it goes very slowly. But when we are doing something fun, time seems to fly by. When we are sleeping, time feels like it almost disappears.

Because time is about how long things last, we need to think about public time and private time, just like we think about space. But when we think about time as the order of events happening one after another, we donâ€™t need to make that distinction. The way events seem to happen in order is the same as how they actually happen.

This is also true for space. For example, if a group of soldiers is marching down a road, their shape might look different depending on where you are standing. But the order of the soldiers stays the same no matter where you look from. So, we believe the order is real in physical space, while the shape only matches the space enough to keep the order correct.
