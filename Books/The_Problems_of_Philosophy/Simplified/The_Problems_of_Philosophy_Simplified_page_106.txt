The most we can hope for is that the more often things happen together, the more likely it is they will happen together again. If they happen together enough times, it almost feels like a sure thing. But it can never be 100% sure, because sometimes, even after many times, it can still fail—like a chicken whose neck is wrung.

So, all we should really try for is probability.

Some people might say that all natural events follow strict laws, and sometimes from what we see, only one law can explain what’s happening. But there are two answers to this. First, even if there is a perfect law with no exceptions, we can never be completely sure we’ve found it and not a law that has exceptions. Second, the idea that everything follows laws is itself just a guess based on what we’ve seen before, and this guess is based on the same idea we’re trying to understand.
