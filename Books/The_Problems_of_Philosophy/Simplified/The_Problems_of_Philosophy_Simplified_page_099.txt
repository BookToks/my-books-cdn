If someone asks why we think the sun will rise tomorrow, we usually say, "Because it always has risen every day." We believe it will rise again because it has done so in the past.

If someone asks why we think it will keep rising, we might say it’s because of the laws of motion. The Earth spins freely, and things that spin don’t stop unless something else messes with them. Since nothing is going to stop the Earth from spinning tonight, the sun should rise tomorrow.

But maybe we can’t be 100% sure nothing will interfere. Still, that’s not the main question. The main question is whether the laws of motion will still work tomorrow. If we doubt that, then we’re back to the same problem as with the sunrise.

The only reason we believe the laws of motion will keep working is because they have always worked in the past, as far as we know.
