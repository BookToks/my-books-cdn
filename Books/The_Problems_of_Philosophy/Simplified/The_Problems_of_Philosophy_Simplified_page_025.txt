They believe, like Berkeley does, that nothing real exists except minds and their thoughts and feelings. The argument they use goes something like this: "Anything you can think of is an idea in your mind; so, you can only think of ideas in minds; therefore, anything else is impossible to imagine, and if you can't imagine it, it can't be real."

I think this argument is wrong, and the people who use it don’t usually say it so simply. But whether it’s right or wrong, many philosophers have used this idea in some form. Lots of them, maybe most, believe that only minds and their ideas are real. These philosophers are called "idealists."

When idealists explain matter, they either say, like Berkeley, that matter is just a group of ideas, or they say, like Leibniz, that what looks like matter is actually made up of tiny minds.
