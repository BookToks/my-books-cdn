This they hold, as Berkeley does, chiefly because they think there can be nothing real — or at any rate nothing known to be real — except minds and their thoughts and feelings. We might state the argument by which they support their view in some such way as this : " Whatever can be thought of is an idea in the mind of the person thinking of it ; t herefore nothing can be thought of except ideas in minds ; therefore anything else is inconceivable, and what is inconceivable cannot exist." Such an argument, in my opinion, is fallacious ; and of course those who advance it do not put it so shortly or so crudely. But whether valid or not, the argument has been very widely advanced in one form or another ; and very many philosophers, perhaps a majority, have held that there is nothing real except minds and their ideas. Such philosophers are called " idealists." When they come to explaining matter, they either say, 22 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY like Berkeley, that matter is really nothing but a collection of ideas, or they say, like Leibniz (1646-1716), that what appears as matter is really a collection of more or less rudimentary minds.
