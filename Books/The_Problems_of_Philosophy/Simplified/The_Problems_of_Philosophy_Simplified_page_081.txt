When I see the sun, I often notice that I am seeing it; so "my seeing the sun" is something I know about. When I want food, I can be aware that I want it; so "my wanting food" is something I understand.  

In the same way, we can notice when we feel happy or hurt, and usually we know what is happening in our minds. This kind of knowing, called self-consciousness, is where all our knowledge about our thoughts and feelings comes from.  

It’s clear that only what happens inside our own minds can be known directly. What happens in other people’s minds we learn about by watching their bodies and actions, which we notice through our senses.  

Without knowing what’s in our own minds, we couldn’t imagine that other people have minds too, and so we wouldn’t know they have thoughts and feelings.  

It seems natural to think that self-consciousness is something that makes humans different from animals. Animals might notice things around them, but they probably don’t realize that they are noticing, so they don’t really know that they exist.
