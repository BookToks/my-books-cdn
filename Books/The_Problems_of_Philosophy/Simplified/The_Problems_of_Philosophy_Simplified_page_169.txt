What used to seem mysterious when we thought about this kind of knowledge was that it seemed to predict and control what we experience. But now, we can see that was a mistake.

We can’t know anything about things we experience without actually experiencing them. For example, we know without needing to check that two things plus two other things make four things. But we don’t know without experience that if Brown and Jones are two people, and Robinson and Smith are two people, then all four of them together make four people.

This is because we can’t understand the idea unless we know who Brown, Jones, Robinson, and Smith are—and we only know that by experiencing them. So, even though the general rule is known without experience, using it for real people always needs some experience, which means it has an element based on what we actually see or know.

That’s why what seemed mysterious about this kind of knowledge turns out to be a mistake.
