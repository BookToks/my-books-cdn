By imagining worlds in which these axioms are false, the mathematicians have used logic to loosen the prejudices of common sense, and to show the possibility of spaces differing — some more, some less — from that in which we live. And some of these spaces differ so little from Euclidean space, where distances such as we can measure are concerned, that it is impossible to discover by observation whether our actual space is strictly Euclidean or of one of these other kinds.
 
 Thus the position is completely reversed.
 
 Formerly it appeared that experience left only one kind of space to logic, and logic showed this one kind to be impossible. Now, logic presents many kinds of space as possible apart from experience, and experience only partially decides between them. Thus, while our knowledge of what is has become less than it was formerly supposed to be, our knowledge of what may be is enormously increased. Instead of b eing shut in within narrow walls, of which every nook and cranny could be THE LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 281 explored, we find ourselves in an open world of free possibilities, where much remains unknown because there is so much to know.
