By thinking about worlds where these basic rules aren’t true, mathematicians have used logic to challenge what we usually believe and show that different kinds of spaces can exist — some very different, some only a little different from the space we live in. Some of these spaces are so close to normal space, where we measure distances, that we can’t tell just by looking if our space is exactly like normal space or one of these other kinds.

So, everything has changed.

Before, it seemed like experience only allowed one kind of space, and logic said that kind was impossible. Now, logic says many kinds of space could exist beyond what we experience, and experience can only help us choose between them a little bit. This means we know less for sure about what really is, but we know a lot more about what could be. Instead of being stuck inside a small, limited space where everything was known, we are now in a big open world full of possibilities, where a lot is still unknown because there is so much to learn.
