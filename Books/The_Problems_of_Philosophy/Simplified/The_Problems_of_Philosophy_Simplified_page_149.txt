THE WORLD OF UNIVERSALS 145 The word *' i dea " has acquired, in the course of time, many associations which are quite misleading when applied to Plato's " ideas." We shall therefore use the word "universal" instead of the word "idea," to describe what Plato meant. The essence of the sort of entity that Plato meant is that it is opposed to the particular things that are given in sensation. We speak of whatever is given in sensation, or is of the same nature as things given in sensation, as a particular ; by opposition to this, a universal will be anything which may be shared by many particulars, and has those characteristics which, as we saw, distinguish justice and whiteness from just acts and white things.
 
 When we examine common words, we , find that, broadly speaking, proper names ; stand for particulars, while other substantives, adjectives, prepositions, and verbs ' stand for universals. Pronouns stand for â€¢ particulars, but are ambiguous : it is only by the context or the circumstances that we know what particulars they stand for.
 
 The word " now " stands for a particular.
