The word "idea" has picked up a lot of meanings over time that don’t really match what Plato meant. So, instead of "idea," we’ll use the word "universal" to explain Plato’s meaning.

A universal is the opposite of particular things we can see or touch. Particulars are things we experience with our senses. Universals are qualities or features that many particulars can share, like justice or whiteness, which are different from just acts or white things.

When we look at common words, proper names usually refer to particulars. Other types of words like adjectives, verbs, and prepositions usually refer to universals. Pronouns refer to particulars too, but they can be confusing because we only know which particulars they mean by the situation.

The word "now" is an example of a particular.
