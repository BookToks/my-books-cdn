The sentence "a is the so-and-so" means that a has a special quality called so-and-so, and no one else has it. For example, "Mr. A. is the Unionist candidate for this area" means "Mr. A. is the only Unionist candidate for this area."

When we say "The Unionist candidate for this area exists," it means that there is someone who is the Unionist candidate, and no one else is.

So, if we know an object that is the so-and-so, we know that the so-and-so exists. But we can also know the so-and-so exists even if we donâ€™t know exactly who or what it is.

Common words, even names, are usually descriptions. This means that when someone uses a name correctly, what they really mean can be explained by describing it instead of just using the name.

Also, the description someone uses to explain a name can be different for different people or even for the same person at different times.
