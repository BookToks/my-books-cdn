Probability depends on the information you have. In our example, the information is just the known cases where A and B exist together. There might be other information that could change the probability a lot.

For example, a man who has seen many white swans might say, based on what he knows, that all swans are probably white. This is a reasonable guess. The fact that some swans are black doesn’t prove his guess wrong because something can still happen even if some information makes it seem unlikely. 

In the case of swans, the man might also know that color can change a lot in different animals, so guessing color might be risky.

But this new information doesn’t mean his original probability was wrong. Just because things often don’t go as we expect doesn’t mean our expectations won’t probably happen in a certain case or group of cases.
