In everyday life, we believe many things without questioning them. But if we think carefully, we find that some of these things donâ€™t really make sense. It takes a lot of thinking to figure out what we can truly believe.

When we want to be sure about something, we usually start with what we are experiencing right now. In some way, we do get knowledge from these experiences. But what we think we know from just looking or feeling might be wrong.

For example, I feel like I am sitting in a chair, at a table with a certain shape. On the table, I see papers with writing on them. If I turn my head, I can see buildings, clouds, and the sun outside the window. I believe the sun is about ninety-three million miles away from the earth. I also believe the sun is a hot ball much bigger than the earth. Because the earth spins, the sun seems to rise every morning, and will keep doing that for a long time. I think if someone else comes into my room, they will see the same chairs, tables, books, and papers that I see. I also believe the table I see is the same one I feel against my arm.
