The only thing that stays the same (as long as the name is used correctly) is the thing the name refers to. But as long as this stays the same, the exact description usually doesn’t change whether the statement using the name is true or false.

Let’s look at some examples. Imagine a statement about Bismarck. If Bismarck knows himself directly, he could use his name to mean the exact person he knows. So, if he said something about himself, he would be part of that statement. Here, the name is used directly to mean the person, not a description of him.

But if someone else who knows Bismarck makes a statement about him, it’s different. That person only knows certain things they see or sense, which they connect (correctly, let’s say) to Bismarck’s body. His body and mind are only known through these things they sense.
