So, our idea that we can learn from experience can’t be proven wrong by using experience itself.

But, this idea also can’t be proven right just by looking at experience. Experience might support this idea for things we’ve already checked out, but for things we haven’t seen yet, only this idea can help us guess what will happen.

Any argument that tries to predict the future or things we haven’t experienced yet already assumes this idea is true. So, we can’t use experience to prove this idea without going in circles.

That means we either have to believe in this idea because it makes sense on its own or give up on trusting anything we expect to happen in the future. If this idea is wrong, then we have no reason to think the sun will rise tomorrow, that bread is better to eat than a rock, or that if we jump off a roof, we’ll fall.
