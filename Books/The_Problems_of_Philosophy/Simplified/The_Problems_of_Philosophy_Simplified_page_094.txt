It will be seen that there are various stages in the removal from acquaintance with particulars : there is Bismarck to people who knew him, Bismarck to those who only know of him through history, the man with the iron mask, the longest -lived of men. These are progressively further removed from acquaintance with particulars ; the first comes as near to acquaintance as is possible in regard to another person ; i n the second, we shall still be said to know "who Bismarck was " ; i n the third, we do not know who was the man with the iron mask, though we can know many propositions about him which are not logically deducible from the fact that he wore an iron mask ; in the fourth, finally, we know nothing beyond what is logically deducible from the definition of the man.
