Common sense clearly says that there is a real table. Something you can buy, sell, move around, or put a cloth on can’t just be a bunch of things you see or feel. 

If the cloth completely covers the table, we wouldn’t see any part of the table. So, if the table was only what we sense, it would stop existing, and the cloth would be hanging in empty air, staying in the same spot where the table was. This sounds really strange. But if you want to think like a philosopher, you have to be okay with strange ideas.

One big reason we believe there is a real object, not just what we sense, is because we want the same object to be there for different people. When ten people are sitting around a dinner table, it would be crazy to say they don’t all see the same tablecloth, knives, forks, spoons, and glasses.
