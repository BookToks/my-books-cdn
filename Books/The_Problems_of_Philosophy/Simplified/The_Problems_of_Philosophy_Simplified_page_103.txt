The belief in the uniformity of nature means thinking that everything that has happened or will happen follows some general rule with no exceptions. The simple expectations we have can sometimes be broken, so they might let us down.

But science usually works on the idea that rules with exceptions can be replaced by rules that have no exceptions.

For example, "things that are not held up fall" is a rule, but balloons and airplanes are exceptions. However, the laws of motion and gravity explain why most things fall and also why balloons and airplanes can rise. So, these laws don’t have exceptions.

We believe the sun will rise tomorrow, but this could be proven wrong if something big hit the Earth and stopped it from spinning. Still, the laws of motion and gravity wouldn’t be broken by that kind of event.
