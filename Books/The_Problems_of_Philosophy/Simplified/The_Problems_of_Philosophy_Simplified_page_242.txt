Physical science helps a lot of people through inventions, even if they don’t know much about it. So, studying physical science is a good idea, not just because it helps the person learning it, but because it helps everyone in the world. This usefulness doesn’t apply to philosophy in the same way. If philosophy is helpful to people besides the students, it’s only because it changes the lives of those who study it. So, the main value of philosophy must be found in how it affects those who learn it.

Also, to understand the value of philosophy, we need to stop thinking like so-called "practical" people. These "practical" people only care about physical needs, like food for the body, and forget about the need to feed the mind. Even if everyone had enough money and was healthy, there would still be a lot to do to make a good society. Right now, things that help the mind are just as important as things that help the body.
