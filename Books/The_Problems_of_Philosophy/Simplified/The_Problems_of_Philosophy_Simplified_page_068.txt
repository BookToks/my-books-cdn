Before talking about what ideas really are, we need to separate two different questions about what we see and the actual things out there. 

We learned that Berkeley was right in saying that the things we see, like the tree, depend on us as much as on the tree itself. These things wouldn’t exist if no one was looking at the tree. But this idea is not the same as Berkeley’s main point that anything we know right away must exist in our minds. 

To prove that, just showing how what we see depends on us isn’t enough. 

We need to show, in general, that because we know things, those things must be mental or part of the mind. 

Berkeley thinks he has already done this. This is the question we need to focus on now, not the difference between what we see and the real physical object.
