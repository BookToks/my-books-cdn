For example, the law of contradiction says that something can’t both have a certain quality and not have it at the same time. This idea is clear once you understand it, but it’s not as obvious as saying a rose we see can’t be both red and not red.

Of course, it’s possible that parts of the rose are red and parts are not, or that the rose is a shade of pink that’s hard to decide if it’s red or not. But if parts are red and parts aren’t, then the whole rose isn’t red. If it’s a tricky color like pink, we can decide for sure if it’s red once we agree on what "red" means exactly.

Usually, we learn these general ideas by looking at specific examples. Only people who are used to thinking about abstract ideas can understand a general rule without examples.

Besides these general rules, there are also truths that come straight from what we sense. We’ll call these "truths of perception," and the opinions we form from them are "judgments of perception."
