The same thing happens when tuning a musical instrument or in any situation where things change little by little. So, being obvious or clear like this is a matter of how strong it is. It’s clear that stronger obviousness can be trusted more than weaker obviousness.  

In knowledge that comes from other knowledge, our basic ideas must have some level of being obvious, and the way they connect to the conclusions must also be obvious. For example, think about a piece of reasoning in geometry.  

It’s not enough that the starting points (axioms) are obvious. At every step in the reasoning, the link between the idea and the conclusion must also be obvious. In hard reasoning, this link is often only a little obvious. That’s why mistakes can happen when the reasoning is very hard.
