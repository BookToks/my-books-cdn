It's true that this happens because when we start to truly understand something, it stops being called philosophy and becomes its own science. For example, studying the stars used to be part of philosophy, but now it's called astronomy. Newton's famous work was called "the mathematical principles of natural philosophy."

The study of the human mind was also part of philosophy until recently, but now it's called psychology. So, a lot of the confusion about philosophy isn’t really because philosophy is unclear. Instead, questions that can be clearly answered become part of science, and only the ones we can't answer yet stay in philosophy.

But this is only part of why philosophy seems uncertain.

There are many questions—especially the ones that really matter to our inner lives—that we probably won’t ever be able to answer unless human thinking changes in a big way.
