He agrees that something must keep existing when we leave the room or close our eyes. When we say we see the table, it really gives us a reason to believe that something stays there even if we aren’t looking at it.

But he thinks this something can’t be completely different from what we see. It can’t exist without being seen at all, though it doesn’t have to depend on us seeing it.

Because of this, he thinks the “real” table is like an idea in God’s mind. This idea lasts forever and doesn’t depend on us. It’s not like matter, which would be something we can only guess about and never actually know or see directly.

Other philosophers after Berkeley also believed that even if the table doesn’t need me to see it to exist, it still needs to be seen or sensed by some mind. It might not have to be God’s mind, but maybe the combined mind of the whole universe.
