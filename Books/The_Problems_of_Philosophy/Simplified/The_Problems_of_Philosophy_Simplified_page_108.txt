The chance of a general rule being true is obviously less than the chance of a specific example being true. This is because if the general rule is true, then the specific example must be true too. But the specific example can be true even if the general rule is not.

Still, the chance of the general rule being true gets higher when we see it happen again and again, just like the chance of the specific example being true does.

So, we can say two things about the general rule: (a) The more times we see something like A happening with something like B, the more likely it is that A always happens with B, as long as we don’t find any cases where it doesn’t. (b) If we see enough cases where A happens with B, it becomes almost certain that A always happens with B, and this general rule gets closer and closer to being 100% true.
