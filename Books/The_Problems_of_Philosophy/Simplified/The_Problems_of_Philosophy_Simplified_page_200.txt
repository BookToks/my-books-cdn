When Othello thinks that Desdemona loves Cassio, he doesn't just think about "Desdemona's love for Cassio" or "Desdemona loves Cassio" as separate ideas. If he did, that would mean there are wrong ideas that exist on their own, no matter what anyone thinks. This idea is hard to prove wrong, but it's better to avoid thinking this way.

It's easier to understand false ideas if we think of a judgment as a connection between the mind and the things it thinks about. So, in Othello's case, Desdemona, loving, and Cassio are all part of this connection when he believes she loves Cassio. This connection actually has four parts because Othello himself is also included.

When we say there are four parts, we don’t mean Othello has one connection to Desdemona, another to loving, and another to Cassio. That might be true for some other feelings, but believing is different. Othello doesn’t have separate connections to each part; instead, he has one single connection that links all four parts together.
