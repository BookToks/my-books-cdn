Usually, believing something is okay.

But imagine a very stubborn Socrates who keeps asking for a reason behind every reason we give. Sooner or later, we won’t be able to find any more reasons, and it’s almost sure that no more reasons can be found at all.

Starting from everyday beliefs, we can keep going back from one reason to another until we reach a general idea that is really clear and obvious. This idea can’t be explained by anything even clearer.

In most daily life questions, like whether our food is safe to eat, we end up relying on the idea of induction, which we talked about in Chapter VI. But after that, there’s no way to keep going back.

We use this idea of induction all the time in our thinking, sometimes without even noticing. But there’s no simpler idea that proves the idea of induction.
