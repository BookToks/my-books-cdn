In this belief they seem to have been mistaken. All the knowledge that we can acquire a priori concerning existence seems to be hypothetical : it tells us that if one thing exists, another must exist, or, more generally, that if one proposition is true, another must be true. This is exemplified by the principles we have already dealt with, such as'' if t his is true, and this implies that, then that is true," or " if t his and that have been repeatedly found connected, they will probably be connected in the next instance in which one of them is found." Thus the scope and power of a priori principles is strictly limited. All knowledge that something exists must be in part dependent on experience.
 
 When anything is known immediately, its existence is known by experience alone ; w hen anything is proved to exist, without being known immediately, both experience and a priori principles must be required in the proof.
 
 Knowledge is called empirical when it rests wholly or partly upon experience. Thus all knowledge which asserts existence is empirical.
