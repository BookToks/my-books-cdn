They seem to have been wrong about this. All the knowledge we can get without experience is only based on guesses: it tells us that if one thing exists, another thing must exist too, or that if one idea is true, another idea must be true. This is shown by rules like "if this is true, and this means that, then that is true," or "if this and that have always been connected, they will probably be connected next time too." So, the power of these kinds of rules is very limited. Knowing that something exists has to be partly based on experience.

When we know something right away, we know it exists because of experience only. When we prove something exists but donâ€™t know it right away, we need both experience and these rules to prove it.

Knowledge is called empirical when it depends fully or partly on experience. So, all knowledge that says something exists is empirical.
