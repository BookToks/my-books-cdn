Different people often see or feel the same things, and even one person at different times experiences similar feelings or sights. Because of this, we think there must be real, permanent things out there that cause these experiences.

But this idea depends on believing that other people exist. We only know other people through what we see or hear, like their voices or faces. If we didn’t believe in things outside our own experiences, we might just think other people are part of a dream.

So, when we try to prove that real things exist outside our own experiences, we can’t just use other people’s experiences as proof. That’s because what we know about them also comes from our own experiences, and this only works if our experiences are connected to things that exist outside of us.
