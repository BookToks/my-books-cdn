GENERAL PRINCIPLES 121

We can think about this carefully; but we should avoid using any property that isn’t true for all triangles. This way, from one example, we can find a rule that works for every triangle.

We don’t feel more sure that two plus two equals four just because we see it happen more times. Once we understand it’s true, our confidence can’t really get any stronger. Also, we feel like “two and two are four” has to be true, which is different from facts we learn from experience.

Facts from experience, no matter how many times they happen, might not always be true. They are just things that happen to be true in our world. But in any possible world, we believe that two plus two will always be four. This isn’t just a fact, it’s something that must be true no matter what.

To explain this better, think about a fact from experience, like “All men are mortal.” We believe this because we have never seen anyone live forever, and because the way our bodies work, they have to get old and stop working eventually.
