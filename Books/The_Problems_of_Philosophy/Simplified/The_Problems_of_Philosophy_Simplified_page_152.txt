Ignoring prepositions and verbs made people think that every statement just describes a quality of one thing, instead of showing a connection between two or more things. Because of this, it was believed that relationships between things don’t actually exist. So, either there is only one thing in the whole universe, or if there are many things, they can’t interact at all, since any interaction would be a kind of relationship, and relationships were thought to be impossible.

The first idea, called monism, was supported by Spinoza and is still believed by Mr. Bradley and some other philosophers today. The second idea, called monadism, was supported by Leibniz but isn’t very popular now. It says that each separate thing, called a monad, exists alone without connections. Both ideas are interesting, but I think they come from focusing too much on certain types of general ideas, like those shown by adjectives and nouns, instead of paying attention to verbs and prepositions.
