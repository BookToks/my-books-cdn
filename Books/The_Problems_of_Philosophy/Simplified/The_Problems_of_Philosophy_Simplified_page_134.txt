Kant, who had been educated in the rationahst tradition, was much perturbed by Hume's scepticism, and endeavoured to find an answer to it. He perceived that not only the connection of c ause and effect, but all the propositions of arithmetic and geometry, are " synthetic," i.e. not analytic : in all these propositions, no analysis of the subject will reveal the predicate. His stock instance was the proposition 7 + 5 = 12.
 
 He pointed out, quite truly, that 7 and 5 have to be put together to give 12 : the idea of 12 is not contained in them, nor even in the idea of adding them together.
 
 Thus he was led to the conclusion that all pure mathematics, though a priori, is synthetic ; a nd this conclusion raised a new problem of which he endeavoured to find the solution.
 
 The question which Kant put at the beginning of h is philosophy, namely " How is pure mathematics possible ? " is an interesting and difficult one, to which every philosophy which is not purely sceptical must find A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE 131 some answer.
