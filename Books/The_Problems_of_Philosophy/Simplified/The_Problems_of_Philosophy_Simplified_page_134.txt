Kant, who was taught to think based on reason, was really bothered by Hume's doubts. He tried to find a way to answer them. He realized that not only the idea of cause and effect but also all math facts like arithmetic and geometry are "synthetic," meaning you can't just figure them out by breaking down the parts. For example, the statement 7 + 5 = 12.

He explained, correctly, that you have to actually add 7 and 5 to get 12. The number 12 is not already in the ideas of 7 or 5, or even in the idea of adding them.

Because of this, he concluded that all pure math, even though it happens before experience, is synthetic. This idea created a new problem, and Kant tried to solve it.

The main question Kant asked at the start of his philosophy was, "How is pure math possible?" This is a tough and interesting question that every philosophy that isnâ€™t just about doubting everything has to answer.
