Before Kant, people believed that any knowledge we have without experience (called a priori) had to be "analytic." To understand this, let's look at some examples.

If I say, "A bald man is a man," "A plane figure is a figure," or "A bad poet is a poet," I’m making an analytic judgment. This means I’m just pointing out something that’s already part of the subject. These statements are obvious and usually not said unless someone is trying to trick others.

They’re called "analytic" because the second part (the predicate) comes from just breaking down the first part (the subject). Before Kant, it was thought that all certain a priori knowledge worked like this. In other words, if we tried to deny something known a priori, we would end up contradicting ourselves.
