This means that whatever exists belongs to them even if no one is thinking about it or aware of it.

We talked a little about this at the end of the last chapter, but now we need to understand better what kind of existence universals have.

Think about the statement "Edinburgh is north of London." This shows a connection between two places, and it’s clear that this connection exists even if no one knows about it. When we learn that Edinburgh is north of London, we’re just finding out a fact about these two places. We don’t make it true by learning it; the fact was already true before we knew it.

The spot on Earth where Edinburgh is would be north of where London is, even if no people existed to know about directions, or if there were no minds at all. Some philosophers disagree with this idea, for reasons like those Berkeley or Kant gave.
