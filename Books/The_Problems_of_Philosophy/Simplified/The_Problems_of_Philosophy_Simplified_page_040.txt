If the cat is just a bunch of things I see, it couldn’t have been anywhere I didn’t see it. So, we would have to think it didn’t exist when I wasn’t looking, and suddenly appeared somewhere new.

If the cat is real whether I see it or not, we can understand how it gets hungry between meals. But if it doesn’t exist when I’m not looking, it’s weird that it would get hungrier even when it’s not there.

Also, if the cat is only what I see, it can’t feel hungry because only I can feel hunger. So, the way the cat looks like it’s hungry makes sense if it’s real, but it doesn’t make sense if it’s just colors and shapes, because colors and shapes can’t feel hungry—like a triangle can’t play football.

But the problem with the cat is nothing compared to the problem with human beings.
