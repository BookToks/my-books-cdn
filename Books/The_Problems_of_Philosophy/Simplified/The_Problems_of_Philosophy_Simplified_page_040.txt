But if it is merely a set of sensedata, it cannot have ever been in any place where I did not see it ; thus we shall have to suppose that it did not exist at all while I was not looking, but suddenly sprang into being in a new place. If the cat exists whether I see it or not, we can understand from our own experience how it gets hungry between one meal and the next ; but if it does not exist when I am not seeing it, it seems odd that appetite should grow during non-existence as fast as during existence.
 
 And if the cat consists only of sense-data, it cannot be hungry, since no hunger but my own can be a sense-datum to me. Thus the behaviour of the sense-data which represent the cat to me, though it seems quite natural when regarded as an expression of hunger, becomes utterly inexplicable when regarded as mere movements and changes of patches of colour, which are as incapable of hunger as a triangle is of playing football.
 
 But the difficulty in the case of the cat is nothing compared to the difTiculty in the case THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER 37 of human beings.
