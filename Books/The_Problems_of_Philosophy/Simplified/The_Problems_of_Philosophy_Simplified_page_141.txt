Let's use the law of contradiction as an example. It usually says, "Nothing can both be and not be," which means something can't have and not have the same quality at the same time. For example, if a tree is a beech, it can't also not be a beech. If my table is rectangular, it can't also not be rectangular.

What makes it natural to call this a law of thought is that we understand it by thinking, not by looking outside. When we know a tree is a beech, we don’t have to check again to see if it’s not a beech. Just thinking about it tells us that’s impossible.

But saying the law of contradiction is a law of thought is actually wrong. When we believe in this law, we don’t believe our mind has to accept it. This belief comes later, after we think about how our mind works, and it already assumes the law of contradiction is true.
