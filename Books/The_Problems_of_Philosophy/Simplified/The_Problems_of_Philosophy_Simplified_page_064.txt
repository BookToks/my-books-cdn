People who support idealism usually base their ideas on how we know things. They talk about what needs to be true for us to actually know something.

The first person to seriously try to prove idealism this way was Bishop Berkeley.

He showed, with mostly good reasons, that what we sense—like what we see, hear, touch, smell, or taste—can’t exist on its own. These things have to be at least partly “in” our minds, meaning they wouldn’t keep existing if no one was sensing them.

This part of his idea was probably right, even if some of his reasons weren’t perfect. But then he said that the only things we can be sure exist are the things we sense. To know something means it has to be “in” a mind, so it has to be mental. Because of this, he thought that nothing can be known unless it’s in some mind. If something is known but not in my mind, it must be in someone else’s mind.
