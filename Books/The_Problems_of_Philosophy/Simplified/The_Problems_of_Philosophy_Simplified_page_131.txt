CHAPTER VIII HOW WE CAN KNOW THINGS BEFORE EXPERIENCING THEM

Immanuel Kant is often called the greatest modern philosopher.

Even though he lived during tough times like the Seven Years' War and the French Revolution, he kept teaching philosophy in Konigsberg, East Prussia.

His biggest idea was something he called "critical" philosophy. He started with the fact that we have different kinds of knowledge and asked how this knowledge is even possible. From this question, he came up with many ideas about what the world is really like.

People still argue about whether his ideas are correct. But Kant definitely deserves credit for two things: first, he realized that we can know some things before we experience them, and these ideas are not just based on definitions or word meanings.
