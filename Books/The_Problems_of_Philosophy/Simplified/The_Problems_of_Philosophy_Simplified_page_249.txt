In life like this, there is no peace. Instead, there is always a fight between what we want and what we can actually do. To live a great and free life, we have to break free from this struggle.

One way to escape is by thinking deeply about life and the world. Thinking like this doesn’t divide everything into friends or enemies, or good and bad. It looks at everything fairly.

When we think this way, we don’t try to prove that the world is just like us. Learning new things helps us grow as people, but this happens best when we don’t try too hard for it. It happens when we just want to learn and accept things as they are, without expecting them to be a certain way.

We grow the most when we don’t try to make the world fit our own ideas, but instead change ourselves to understand the world, even if it seems different from us.
