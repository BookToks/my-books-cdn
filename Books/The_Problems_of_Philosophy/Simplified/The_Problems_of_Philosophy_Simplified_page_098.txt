We need to understand that when one thing, A, exists, it can show that another thing, B, also exists either at the same time or at a different time. For example, thunder means that lightning happened before. If we didn’t know this, we couldn’t learn anything beyond what we see or experience ourselves. But our own experience is very limited. Now, we need to think about whether it’s possible to learn beyond what we’ve experienced, and if yes, how we do that.

Let’s look at an example that nobody really doubts. We all believe the sun will rise tomorrow. But why do we believe that? Is it just because it always has in the past, or is there a good reason for this belief? It’s hard to find a clear way to say if this belief is reasonable or not. But we can try to figure out what kinds of general beliefs would make it fair to expect the sun to rise tomorrow, and many other similar things that we act on every day.
