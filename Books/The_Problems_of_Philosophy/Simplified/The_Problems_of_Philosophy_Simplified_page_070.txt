The act happens in the mind; so, when we think about the act, we quickly agree that ideas must be in the mind. But then, we forget that this was only true when ideas meant the acts of understanding. We wrongly apply the idea that "ideas are in the mind" to ideas as the things we understand.

Because of this mix-up, we end up thinking that everything we can understand has to be inside our minds. This is the main point of Berkeley's argument and the mistake it is based on.

Understanding the difference between the act and the object we understand is really important because our ability to learn depends on it.

Being able to know things outside of ourselves is what makes a mind special. Knowing something means there is a connection between our mind and something outside of it; this is how our mind can know things.
