The main idea when we look at sentences with descriptions is this: Every sentence we understand must be made up of parts we know about.

Right now, we won’t try to answer all the questions people might have about this idea. For now, we just want to say that somehow, these questions need to be answered because it’s hard to believe we can think or guess about something without knowing what it is. We have to give meaning to the words we use if we want to say something useful and not just random sounds. The meaning we give to words has to be something we know.

So, for example, when we say something about Julius Caesar, it’s clear that Julius Caesar himself is not in our minds because we don’t actually know him. Instead, we think about a description of Julius Caesar like “the man who was killed on the Ides of March,” “the founder of the Roman Empire,” or maybe just “the man named Julius Caesar.”
