In this chapter, we will quickly look at how this kind of thinking works to see if it can really be trusted. 

The most famous person with this idea in modern times was Hegel (1770-1831). Hegel’s ideas are very hard to understand, and people don’t all agree about what he really meant. The way I will explain it is the one many people agree on, and it shows an interesting and important type of philosophy. 

His main idea is that anything less than the whole picture is clearly just a part and can’t exist without the rest of the world. Just like a scientist studying animals can guess what the whole animal looked like from just one bone, Hegel says a philosopher can see, from one part of reality, what the whole reality must be like—at least in a rough way.
