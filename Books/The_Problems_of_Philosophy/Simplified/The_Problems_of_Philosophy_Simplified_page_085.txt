Also, it’s likely, but not totally sure, that we know ourselves as the part that notices things or wants things.

Besides knowing specific things around us, we also know general ideas, like whiteness, being different, or brotherhood. Every full sentence has at least one word that stands for a general idea, because all verbs have a general meaning. We will talk more about these general ideas in Chapter IX. For now, just remember that not everything we know has to be a specific, real thing. Knowing these general ideas is called conceiving, and the general idea we know is called a concept.

You can see that things we know don’t include physical objects (different from what we sense) or other people’s minds. We learn about those by something I call "knowledge by description," which we will look at next.
