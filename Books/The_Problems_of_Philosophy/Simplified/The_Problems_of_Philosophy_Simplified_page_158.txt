We can’t say that something like "north of" exists at a specific time. Things we can see, hear, or feel always happen at a certain time.

So, the idea of "north of" is very different from those things. It isn’t in a place or time, and it’s not physical or a feeling, but it still exists.

This kind of thing is called a universal, and many people think universals are just ideas in our minds. We can think about a universal, and that thinking is like any other mental activity. For example, when we think about the color white.

In one way, we can say that whiteness is "in our mind." But this is a bit tricky. It’s not actually whiteness inside us, but the act of thinking about whiteness. The word "idea" also causes confusion because it can mean different things. In one meaning, like when it means what we think about, whiteness is an "idea."
