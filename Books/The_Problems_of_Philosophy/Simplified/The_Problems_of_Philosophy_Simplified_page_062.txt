CHAPTER IV IDEALISM

The word "idealism" means different things to different philosophers.

Here, we will understand it as the idea that whatever exists, or at least whatever we can know exists, must be mental in some way. This idea is very popular among philosophers and comes in different forms for different reasons.

Idealism is so common and interesting that even a short look at philosophy has to mention it.

People who don’t usually think about philosophy might think this idea sounds silly.

It’s true that most people usually think tables, chairs, the sun, the moon, and other physical things are very different from minds and thoughts, and that these things would still exist even if no one was thinking about them.
