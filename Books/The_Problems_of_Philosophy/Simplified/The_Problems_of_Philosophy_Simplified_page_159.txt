If we don’t watch out, we might start to think that "whiteness" is just an idea in our minds, like a thought. If we do that, we make it seem like whiteness is only something mental.

But one person’s thought is always different from another person’s thought. Even the same person’s thought changes over time. So, if whiteness was just a thought, no two people could think about it the same way, and one person couldn’t even think about it twice the same way.

What’s actually the same in all these different thoughts about whiteness is the thing they are thinking about. This thing is not the thoughts themselves. That’s why universals, like whiteness, are not just thoughts, but things that thoughts are about.

It’s easier to talk about things as existing only when they are in time. That means we can point to a time when they exist, even if they might exist at all times.
