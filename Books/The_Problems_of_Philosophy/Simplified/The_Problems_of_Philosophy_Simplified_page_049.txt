Everyone who can see knows what light is, but science says light isn’t something that exists outside of us. Instead, light happens because certain waves hit our eyes, nerves, and brain. When scientists say light is made of waves, they mean these waves cause us to feel like we see light. But the light we actually see isn’t something that exists by itself in the world outside of us. The same idea applies to other things we sense, like colors and sounds.

It’s not just colors and sounds that don’t exist in the scientific idea of matter, but also space as we experience it through seeing or touching. Science needs matter to be in space, but the space it talks about isn’t exactly the same as the space we see or feel. For example, the space we see looks different from the space we feel with our hands. When we’re babies, we learn how to connect what we see and what we touch, like knowing how to touch things we see or look at things we’re touching.
