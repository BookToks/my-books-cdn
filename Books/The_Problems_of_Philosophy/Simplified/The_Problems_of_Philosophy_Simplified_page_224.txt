CHAPTER XIV THE LIMITS OF PHILOSOPHICAL KNOWLEDGE

So far, we haven’t talked about many ideas that most philosophers spend a lot of time on. Many philosophers say they can prove important religious beliefs, the universe’s basic logic, or even that matter isn’t real, just by using reasoning alone.

A lot of people who study philosophy hope to find good reasons to believe these things. But I think this hope is useless.

It seems like we can’t really know everything about the universe just by using philosophy. The arguments that say certain things must be true or false because of logic don’t hold up when you look at them closely.
