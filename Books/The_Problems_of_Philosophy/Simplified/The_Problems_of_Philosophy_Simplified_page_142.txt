Believing in the law of contradiction means believing something about real things, not just about what we think. For example, it’s not just believing that if we think a tree is a beech, we can’t think it’s not a beech at the same time. It means believing that if the tree really is a beech, it can’t also not be a beech at the same time. So, the law of contradiction is about things in the world, not just about our thoughts.

Even though believing in this law is something we think about, the law itself isn’t just a thought. It’s a fact about how things actually are.

If what we believe about the law of contradiction wasn’t true in the world, just feeling like it’s true wouldn’t make it true. This shows that the law isn’t just about how we think.

The same idea works for other facts we know without needing experience. When we say two plus two equals four, we aren’t just talking about how we think. We’re talking about all real or possible pairs of things.
