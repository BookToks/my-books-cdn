They were known by how people described them. It’s mostly random which parts of a person's appearance come to a friend’s mind when they think about them. So, the description a friend has is kind of accidental. The important thing is that the friend knows all these different descriptions are about the same person, even if they don’t actually know that person.

When we, who never met Bismarck, think about him, the description in our heads is usually just some unclear mix of facts from history. This is usually more than what we need to recognize him. But to make it simple, let’s say we think of him as "the first Chancellor of the German Empire." All the words here are pretty abstract except for "German." The word "German" can mean different things to different people. For some, it might remind them of trips to Germany; for others, it might make them think of Germany’s shape on the map.

But if we want a description that we know really fits, at some point we have to mention something specific that we actually know.
