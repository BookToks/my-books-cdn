By a "description," I mean any phrase like "a so-and-so" or "the so-and-so." A phrase like "a so-and-so" is called an "ambiguous" description, and a phrase like "the so-and-so" (singular) is called a "definite" description. For example, "a man" is an ambiguous description, and "the man with the iron mask" is a definite description.

There are different problems with ambiguous descriptions, but I won’t talk about them because they don’t directly relate to what we are discussing. We are focusing on how we know about objects when we know there is an object that fits a definite description, even if we don’t actually know that object personally.

This topic is only about definite descriptions. So, from now on, when I say "descriptions," I mean "definite descriptions." That means any phrase like "the so-and-so" in the singular.

We say an object is "known by description" when we know it is "the so-and-so," meaning we know there is one and only one object with a certain property. Usually, this means we don’t know the object by being personally familiar with it.
