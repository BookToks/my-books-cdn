So, using coherence to define truth doesn’t work because there’s no proof that only one coherent system can exist.

Another problem with this idea is that it assumes we already understand what "coherence" means. But actually, "coherence" depends on the truth of the laws of logic. Two statements are coherent if they can both be true, and they’re incoherent if at least one must be false.

To figure out if two statements can both be true, we have to know rules like the law of contradiction. For example, the statements "this tree is a beech" and "this tree is not a beech" can’t both be true because of this law.

But if we try to test the law of contradiction itself using coherence, we’d see that if we pretend it’s false, then nothing would seem incoherent anymore. So, the laws of logic are like the basic framework that makes the test of coherence possible, and these laws can’t be proven just by using that test.
