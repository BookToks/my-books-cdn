When we look at things, like in the example "Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio," one part has to be a relationship—in this case, the relationship is "loving." But this "loving" in the belief isn’t what holds the whole idea together. The "loving" is just part of the idea, like a brick in a wall.

The thing that actually holds the idea together is the act of "believing." When the belief is true, there is another connected idea where the relationship "loving" links the other parts.

For example, if Othello truly believes that Desdemona loves Cassio, then there is a real connection called "Desdemona’s love for Cassio." This connection is made only of the parts of the belief, arranged the same way, but now "loving" is what holds them together.

However, if the belief is false, there is no real connection made just from the parts of the belief.
