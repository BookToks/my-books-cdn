We have similar problems when we think about touch. It’s true that the table usually feels hard, and we notice it pushes back when we press on it. But how it feels depends on how hard we press and which part of our body we use. So, the different feelings we get from different pressures or body parts don’t directly show us a clear property of the table. Instead, they might just be signs of something about the table that causes all these feelings, but we don’t actually see that thing in any of the feelings themselves. The same idea is even clearer when we think about the sounds we hear when we tap the table.

So, it becomes clear that the real table, if it exists, isn’t exactly the same as what we see, touch, or hear right away. The real table, if it’s there, is not something we know immediately. Instead, we have to guess or figure it out based on what we do experience.
