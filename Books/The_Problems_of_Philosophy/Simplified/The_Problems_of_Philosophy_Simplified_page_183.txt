We see a spot of red, and we think, "There is a red spot," or more simply, "There it is." This is one type of quick judgment we make when we see something.

The other type happens when what we see is more complicated, and we think about it more. For example, if we see a round red spot, we might say, "That red spot is round." This is also a judgment about what we see, but it's different from the first kind.

Here, we notice that the thing we see has both color and shape: the color is red, and the shape is round. Our brain breaks it down into color and shape, then puts it back together by saying the red color is round.

Another example is when we say, "This is to the right of that," while looking at both things at the same time. In this kind of judgment, what we see has parts that relate to each other, and we say how those parts are connected.
