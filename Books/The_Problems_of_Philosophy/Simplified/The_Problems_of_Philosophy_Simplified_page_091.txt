When we talk about the past, present, or future without using exact dates, or when we say here or there, or share what others have told us, we are making references. 

It seems that when we describe something specific, we have to connect it to something we know about. Otherwise, what we know is just what logically comes from the description. 

For example, "the longest-lived man" is a description that applies to some man, but we can't say anything more about him than what the description tells us. 

But if we say, "The first Chancellor of the German Empire was a smart diplomat," we can only be sure this is true because we know something about that person—usually from what we’ve heard or read. 

Besides sharing this information with others, the idea we have includes the specific person involved, and the rest is just general concepts.
