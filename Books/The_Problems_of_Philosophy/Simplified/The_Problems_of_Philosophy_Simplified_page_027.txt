Now obviously this point in which the philosophers are agreed — the view that there is a real table, whatever its nature may be — is vitally important, and it will be worth while to consider what reasons there are for accepting this view before we go on to the further question as to the nature of the real table. Our next chapter, therefore, will be concerned with the reasons for supposing that there is a real table at all.
 
 Before we go farther it will be well to consider for a moment what it is that we have discovered so far. It has appeared that, if we take any common object of the sort that is supposed to be known by the senses, what the senses immediately tell us is not the truth about the object as it is apart from us, but only the truth about certain sense-data which, so far as we can see, depend upon the relations between us and the object. Thus what we directly see 24 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY and feel is merely " appearance," which we believe to be a sign of some " reality " behind.
