Right now, all the philosophers agree on one thing — that a real table exists, even if we don’t know exactly what it is like. This is really important. So, before we talk more about what the real table is, it makes sense to look at the reasons why we believe there is a real table at all. Our next chapter will focus on these reasons.

Before we go any further, let’s think about what we’ve learned so far. It seems that when we look at any normal object, like the ones we know through our senses, what our senses actually tell us isn’t the true object itself. Instead, they tell us about certain “sense-data” that depend on how we and the object are connected.

So, what we see and feel right away is just an “appearance,” and we believe this appearance shows that there is some real thing behind it.
