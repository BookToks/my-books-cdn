If all men are mortal, then Socrates is mortal too. But just because Socrates is mortal, it doesn’t mean all men are mortal. So, we can be more sure that Socrates is mortal if we use examples and observations (induction) instead of starting with "all men are mortal" and using logic to figure it out (deduction).

This shows the difference between things we know for sure without needing experience, like "two plus two is four," and things we learn from the world, like "all men are mortal." For the first kind, using logic is best. But for the second kind, using examples and experience is better and makes us more confident because general ideas from experience are less certain than the specific examples we see.

We’ve now learned that some knowledge comes before experience, like logic, math, and basic ideas about right and wrong. The next question we need to ask is: How is it possible to have this kind of knowledge?
