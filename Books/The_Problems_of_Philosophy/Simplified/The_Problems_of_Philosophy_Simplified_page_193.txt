Truth and falsehood are about beliefs and statements. So, if the world was made of only stuff with no beliefs or statements, there would be no truth or falsehood.

But, the truth or falsehood of a belief depends on something outside the belief itself. For example, if I believe that Charles I died on the scaffold, my belief is true, not because of anything inside my belief, but because of a real event that happened a long time ago. 

If I believe that Charles I died in his bed, my belief is false. It doesn't matter how strongly I believe it or how carefully I thought about it; itâ€™s still false because of what really happened long ago, not because of anything inside my belief. 

So, even though truth and falsehood are about beliefs, they depend on how those beliefs connect to other things, not on anything inside the beliefs themselves.
