In fact, truth and falsehood are properties of beliefs and statements : hence a world of mere matter, since it would contain no beliefs or statements, would also contain no truth or falsehood.
 
 (3) But, as against what we have just said, it is to be observed that the truth or falsehood of a belief always depends upon something which lies outside the belief itself. If I believe that Charles I. died on the scaffold, I believe truly, not because of any intrinsic quality of my belief, which could be discovered by m erely examining the belief, but because of an historical event which happened two and a half centuries ago. If I believe that Charles I. died in his bed, I believe falsely : no degree of vividness in my belief, or of care in arriving at it, prevents it from being false, again because of what happened long ago, and not because of any intrinsic property of my belief. Hence, although truth and falsehood are properties of beliefs, they 190 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY are properties dependent upon the relations of the behefs to other things, not upon any internal quality of the beliefs.
