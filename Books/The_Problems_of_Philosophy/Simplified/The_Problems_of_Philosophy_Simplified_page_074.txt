The difference here is kind of like the difference between two French words, savoir and connaitre, or the German words wissen and kennen.

So, the idea that seemed obvious actually means: "We can never really say that something exists if we don’t know it." But this isn’t true at all. For example, I don’t personally know the Emperor of Russia, but I still believe he exists.

Some might say I believe this because other people know him.

But that doesn’t really work as an answer. If that were true, I wouldn’t even know that other people know him. Also, there’s no reason why I couldn’t know something exists even if nobody knows it personally. This is an important point and needs to be explained.

If I know something and it exists, then knowing it tells me it’s real. But it’s not true that I or someone else has to know something for me to know that it exists.
