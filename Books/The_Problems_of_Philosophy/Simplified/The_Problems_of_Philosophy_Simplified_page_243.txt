Philosophy is only valuable because of the ideas and knowledge it helps us understand. Only people who care about these kinds of things will agree that studying philosophy isn’t a waste of time.

Like other subjects, philosophy mainly focuses on gaining knowledge. The kind of knowledge it looks for helps connect different sciences and comes from carefully thinking about why we believe what we do. But philosophy hasn’t been very successful in giving clear, definite answers to its big questions.

If you ask a mathematician, a scientist, or a historian what facts their field has discovered, they can tell you a lot. But if you ask a philosopher the same thing, they will honestly admit that philosophy hasn’t found clear answers like other sciences have.
