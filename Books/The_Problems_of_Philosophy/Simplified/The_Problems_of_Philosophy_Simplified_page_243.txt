It is exclusively among the goods of the mind that the value of philosophy is to be found ; and only those who are not indifferent to these goods can be persuaded that the study of philosophy is not a waste of time.
 
 Philosophy, like all other studies, aims primarily at knowledge. The knowledge it aims at is the kind of knowledge which gives unity and system to the body of the sciences, and the kind which results from a critical examination of the grounds of our convictions, prejudices, and beliefs. But it cannot be maintained that philosophy has had any very great measure of success in its attempts to provide definite answers to its questions. If you ask a mathematician, a mineralogist, a historian, or any other man of learning, what definite body of truths has been ascertained by his science, his answer will last as long as you are willing to listen. But if you put the same question to a philosopher, he will, if he is 240 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY candid, have to confess that his study has not achieved positive results such as have been achieved by other sciences.
