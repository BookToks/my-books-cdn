A true belief isn’t real knowledge if it comes from bad reasoning, even if the starting facts are true.

For example, if I know that all Greeks are men and that Socrates was a man, but I guess that Socrates was Greek, I don’t actually know that. Even though my facts and conclusion are true, the conclusion doesn’t logically follow from the facts.

But should we say that knowledge only comes from correct reasoning based on true facts? Obviously, that’s not right.

This idea is both too broad and too narrow. First, it’s too broad because it’s not enough for the facts to be true — we also have to actually know those facts. For example, if someone believes Mr. Balfour was the Prime Minister and uses the true fact that the Prime Minister’s name starts with B to make a conclusion, they still don’t really know the conclusion.

So, we need to change the definition and say that knowledge is what you get from correct reasoning based on facts you actually know.
