I know that if I move, the way light bounces off things will change, so the colors I see on the table will look different. This means that if several people look at the table at the same time, none of them will see the exact same colors because they are all looking from different spots. Even a small change in where you stand changes how the light reflects.

For most people, these differences don’t really matter. But for a painter, they are super important. A painter has to stop thinking that things have the color we usually believe they "really" have. Instead, the painter has to learn to see things as they actually appear.

Here, we start to see one of the big problems in philosophy — the difference between "appearance" and "reality," or between how things seem and how they really are. The painter wants to know how things look, but practical people and philosophers want to know what things truly are. Philosophers care even more about this and find it harder to answer the question.
