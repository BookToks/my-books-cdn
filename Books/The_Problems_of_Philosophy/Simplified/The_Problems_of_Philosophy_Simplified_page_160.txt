Thus* thoughts and feelings, minds and physical objects exist. But universals do not exist in this sense ; we shall say that they subsist or have being, where " being " is opposed to *' existence " as being timeless. The world of universals, therefore, may also be described as the world of being. The world of being is unchangeable, rigid, exact, delightful to the mathematician, the logician, the builder of metaphysical systems, and all who love perfection more than life. The world of existence is fleeting, vague, without sharp boundaries, without any clear plan or arrangement, but it contains all thoughts and feelings, all the data of sense, and all physical objects, everything that can do either good or harm, everything that makes any difference to the value of life and the world. According to our temperaments, we shall prefer the contemplation of t he one or of the other. The one we do not prefer will probably seem to us a pale shadow of the one we prefer, and hardly worthy to be regarded as in any sense real.
 
 But the truth is that both have the same THE WORLD OF UNIVERSALS 157 cairn on our impartial attention, both are real, and both are important to the metaphysician.
