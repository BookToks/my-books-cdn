So, thoughts and feelings, minds and physical things are real. But universals don’t exist in the same way. Instead, we say they "subsist" or "have being," which means they are timeless and don’t exist like normal things do.

The world of universals is also called the world of being. This world doesn’t change, is very exact, and is loved by mathematicians, logicians, and people who build big ideas about reality. They like it because it’s perfect and unchanging.

On the other hand, the world of existence is always changing and unclear. It doesn’t have clear edges or plans, but it includes all thoughts, feelings, what we sense, and all physical things. It has everything that can do good or harm and everything that affects life and the world.

Depending on our personality, we might like one world more than the other. The one we don’t like might seem like a weak copy of the one we prefer, and we might not think it’s really real.

But the truth is, both worlds deserve our fair attention. Both are real and both matter a lot to people who study the nature of reality.
