It would be silly to say that the reader doesn’t know the newspaper is telling them the King has died.

So, we have to accept any knowledge that comes from something we understand right away, even if it’s just because we connect ideas in our mind, as long as there is a clear, logical link and the person can figure this out by thinking about it.

There are actually many ways, besides straight logic, that we move from one belief to another. For example, reading printed words and understanding their meaning shows these ways. We can call these ways "psychological inference." We should accept psychological inference as a way to get new knowledge, as long as there is a logical reasoning that matches the psychological one.

This makes our definition of new knowledge less exact than we want because the word "discoverable" is unclear—it doesn’t say how much thinking is needed to figure it out. But really, "knowledge" isn’t a perfect idea; it blends into "probable opinion," which we will explain more in this chapter.
