When we talk about philosophy as a way to question knowledge, we need to set some limits.  

If we act like total skeptics, meaning we completely doubt all knowledge and try to force ourselves back into believing anything, this is impossible. Our extreme doubt can never be proven wrong.  

This is because every argument needs to start with some shared knowledge. If we start from complete doubt, no argument can even begin.  

So, the way philosophy questions knowledge shouldn't be this destructive kind if we want to find any answers.  

No logical argument can work against total skepticism. But it’s easy to see that this kind of skepticism doesn’t make sense.
