The idea we are looking at is called the principle of induction, and it has two parts:

(a) When something of type A is always found with something of type B, and never found without B, the more times we see A and B together, the more likely it is that they will be together in a new situation where one is present.

(b) If we see enough cases where A and B are together, it becomes almost certain that they will be together in a new case, and the chance of this gets closer and closer to 100%.

This principle only helps us predict what will happen in one new case. But we also want to believe that there is a good chance a rule exists saying things of type A are always with things of type B, as long as we have seen many examples together and no examples where they are apart.
