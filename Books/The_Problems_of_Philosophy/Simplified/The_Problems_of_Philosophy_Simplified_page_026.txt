But these philosophers, even though they say matter is not real like the mind, still accept matter in another way. Remember, we asked two questions: (1) Is there a real table at all? (2) If yes, what kind of thing is it?

Both Berkeley and Leibniz agree that a real table exists. Berkeley says the table is made of ideas in Godâ€™s mind, and Leibniz thinks it is a group of souls. So, they both say yes to the first question but have different ideas than most people about the second question.

Actually, most philosophers agree that a real table is real. They think that even though things like color, shape, and smoothness depend on us, these feelings show that something really exists outside of us. This real thing might be very different from how we see it, but it causes what we sense when we are in the right position to see the table.
