But these philosophers, though they deny matter as opposed to mind, nevertheless, in another sense, admit matter. It will be remembered that we asked two questions ; namely, (1) Is there a real table at all ? (2) If so, what sort of object can it be ? Now both Berkeley and Leibniz admit that there is a real table, but Berkeley says it is certain ideas in the mind of God, and Leibniz says it is a colony of souls. Thus both of them answer our first question in the affirmative, and only diverge from the views of ordinary mortals in their answer to our second question. In fact, almost all philosophers seem to be agreed that there is a real table : they almost all agree that, however much our sense-data — colour, shape, smoothness, etc. — may depend upon us, yet their occurrence is a sign of something existing independently of us, something differing, APPEARANCE AND REALITY 23 perhaps, completely from our sense-data, and yet to be regarded as causing those sense-data whenever we are in a suitable relation to the real table.
