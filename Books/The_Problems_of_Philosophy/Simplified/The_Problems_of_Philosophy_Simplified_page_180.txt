The same thing goes for other basic rules of thinking. We can see that they are true, and we use them when we explain things. But some of these rules themselves can’t be proven.

Self-evidence isn’t only for those basic rules that can’t be proven. Once we accept some logical rules, we can figure out the rest from them. The new ideas we get this way are often just as obvious as the first ones we accepted without proof. Also, all math comes from these logical rules, yet simple math facts like "two plus two equals four" are just as clear as the logical rules.

It also seems, though this is more arguable, that there are some obvious moral rules, like "we should try to do what is good." It’s important to notice that, with general rules, examples we know well are easier to understand than the big rule itself.
