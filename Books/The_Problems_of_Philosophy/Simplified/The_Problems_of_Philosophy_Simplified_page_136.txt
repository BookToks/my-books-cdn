We don’t know who will live in London 100 years from now, but we do know that if you take any two people and then any other two people, you will have four people in total. It’s surprising that we can figure out things like this without having seen them before.

Kant tried to explain this, but I don’t think his answer is correct, even though it’s interesting.

His idea is hard to understand and different philosophers explain it in different ways. So, we can only give a very simple summary, but even that might confuse some people who follow Kant’s ideas.

Kant said that whenever we experience something, there are two parts: one part comes from the object itself (like a physical thing), and the other part comes from our own mind.

Earlier, we talked about how the physical object is not the same as what we sense or see, and that what we sense happens because of how the object and our mind work together.
