But if the reality is not what appears, have we any means of knowing whether there is any reality at all ? And if so, have we any means of finding out what it is like ?
 
 Such questions are bewildering, and it is difficult to know that even the strangest hypotheses may not be true. Thus our familiar table, which has roused but the slightest thoughts in us hitherto, has become a problem full of surprising possibilities.
 
 The one thing we know about it is that it is not what it seems. Beyond this modest result, so far, we have the most complete liberty of conjecture. Leibniz tells us it is a community of souls ; Berkeley tells us it is an idea in the mind of God ; sober science, scarcely less wonderful, tells us it is a vast collection of electric charges in violent motion.
 
 Among these surprising possibilities, doubt suggests that perhaps there is no table at all.
 
 Philosophy, if it cannot answer so many APPEARANCE AND REALITY 25 questions as we could wish, has at least the power of asking questions which increase the interest of the world, and show the strangeness and wonder lying just below the surface even in the commonest things of daily life.
