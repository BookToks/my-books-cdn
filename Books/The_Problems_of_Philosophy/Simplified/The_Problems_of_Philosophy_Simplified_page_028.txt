But if what we see isn’t really how things are, can we even know if anything is real? And if there is something real, can we find out what it really is like?

These questions are confusing, and it’s hard to say that even the weirdest ideas might not be true. So, the table we usually don’t think much about suddenly becomes a mystery full of surprising possibilities.

The only thing we can be sure of is that the table isn’t what it seems. Beyond that, we can guess anything. One thinker, Leibniz, says it’s a group of souls; another, Berkeley, says it’s just an idea in God’s mind; and science says it’s a huge bunch of electric charges moving around really fast.

Among these strange ideas, we might even doubt that there is a table at all.

Philosophy might not give us all the answers we want, but it helps us ask questions that make the world more interesting and show us how strange and amazing even everyday things can be.
