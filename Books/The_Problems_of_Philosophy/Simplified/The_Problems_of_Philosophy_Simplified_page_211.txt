This is a circular definition because it assumes we already know what "known premisses" means. So, it can only explain one type of knowledge, which we call derivative knowledge, different from intuitive knowledge. We can say, "Derivative knowledge is what we can logically figure out from premisses we know intuitively." This sentence makes sense, but it doesn’t explain what intuitive knowledge actually is.

Putting aside the idea of intuitive knowledge for now, let’s look at the definition of derivative knowledge. The main problem with it is that it limits what knowledge can be. Sometimes, people believe something true because of some intuitive knowledge, but they never actually figured it out through a logical process.

For example, think about the beliefs you get from reading.
