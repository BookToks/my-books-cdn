The present moment is like a pronoun because it points to something unclear and is always changing.

You can’t make a sentence without at least one word that means something general. For example, the sentence "I like this" uses the word "like," which is general because it can apply to many things and people. So, all true statements involve general ideas, and knowing the truth means knowing these general ideas.

Almost all words in the dictionary are general ideas, but most people, except philosophy students, don’t realize this. We usually don’t focus on words that aren’t about specific things. If we do think about a general word, we tend to imagine one specific example. For instance, when we hear "Charles I.'s head was cut off," we naturally picture Charles I himself.
