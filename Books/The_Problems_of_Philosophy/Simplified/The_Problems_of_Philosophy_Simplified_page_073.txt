But if we include this kind of interest, it doesn’t mean that matter isn’t important to us, as long as it exists, even if we can’t be sure it does. We can guess that it might be real and wonder if it is; so it connects to our wish to learn things and matters because it can either help us feel satisfied or frustrated.

Also, it’s definitely not true that we can’t know something exists if we don’t already know it.

The word "know" is used in two different ways here. First, it means the kind of knowledge that is true and not wrong, the kind we have when we believe or are sure about something. This is called knowing the truth.

Second, "know" means being familiar with things, like when we recognize what we see or feel. This is called knowledge by acquaintance, like knowing what sense-data are.
