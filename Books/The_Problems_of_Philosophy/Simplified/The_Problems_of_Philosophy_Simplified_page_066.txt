He says that the tree keeps existing because God keeps noticing it. The "real" tree, which is what we call the physical object, is actually made up of ideas in God's mind. These ideas are kind of like the ones we have when we see the tree, but they stay in God's mind as long as the tree is still there.

All our experiences, he says, come from sharing a little bit of God's way of seeing things. That's why different people see mostly the same tree. So, without minds and their ideas, there is nothing in the world. Also, nothing else can ever be known because everything we know has to be an idea.

There are some mistakes in this way of thinking that have been important in the history of philosophy, and it’s good to point them out. First, the word "idea" is confusing. We usually think of an idea as something in someone's mind. So, when we hear that a tree is just ideas, it’s easy to think that means the tree is only in minds.
