Sometimes, I can make a true judgment about something even if I haven’t experienced it directly. This happens because I know about the thing from a description. Also, using a general rule, I can guess that something matching this description must exist because I know something related to it.

To understand this better, it’s important to first learn the difference between knowing something by experience and knowing something by description. Then, we need to think about whether knowing general rules can be as certain as knowing things we have actually experienced.

These ideas will be explained more in the next chapters.
