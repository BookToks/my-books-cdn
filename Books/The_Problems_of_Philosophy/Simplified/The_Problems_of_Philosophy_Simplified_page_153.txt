If someone really wanted to say that universals don’t exist at all, we would see that it’s hard to prove that qualities, like the ones described by adjectives and nouns, actually exist. But we can prove that relationships, which are usually shown by verbs and prepositions, must exist.

Let’s use the example of whiteness. If we believe whiteness is a universal, we’d say things are white because they have the quality called whiteness. However, philosophers like Berkeley and Hume strongly disagreed with this idea, and many later thinkers agreed with them.

They said there are no “abstract ideas.” When we think about whiteness, they explained, we picture a specific white thing. Then, we think about that thing carefully and only say things about it that are true for every other white thing too.
