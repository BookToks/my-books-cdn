All knowledge is built on our natural beliefs, and if we stop believing in these, we have nothing left. But some of these natural beliefs are stronger than others. Also, many beliefs we think are natural are actually mixed up with other ideas that aren’t really natural but we mistakenly think they are.

Philosophy should help us understand which natural beliefs are the strongest. It should explain each belief clearly and simply, without adding extra stuff that doesn’t belong. Philosophy should show that these natural beliefs don’t fight each other but fit together nicely.

We should only stop believing in a natural belief if it conflicts with another one. So, if all these beliefs agree with each other, then we can trust the whole system.

It’s still possible that some or all of our beliefs are wrong, so we should always keep a little doubt about them.
