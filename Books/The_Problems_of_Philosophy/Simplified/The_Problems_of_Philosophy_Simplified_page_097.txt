CHAPTER VI ON INDUCTION

In almost all the talks we've had before, we've tried to understand the facts we know about what exists. What things are really out there in the universe that we know about because we have experienced them? So far, we have said that we know about the things we sense around us, and probably about ourselves too. These things we are sure exist. Also, the things we remember from the past are known to have existed before. These facts give us our basic information.

But if we want to make guesses or conclusions from these facts—like knowing that matter exists, that other people exist, or what happened before we started remembering, or what might happen in the future—we need to understand some general rules. These rules help us figure things out from the facts we have.
