Let's go back to talking about the table. It’s clear that the table doesn’t have just one color. It looks different colors when you look at it from different angles. There’s no reason to say one color is the real color more than the others.

Also, even if you look from the same spot, the table’s color can change. It might look different under fake light, or to someone who can’t see colors well, or to someone wearing blue glasses. In the dark, the table has no color at all, but you can still feel it and hear it the same way. So, color isn’t something the table has by itself. It depends on the table, the person looking, and the light on the table.

When we normally talk about the color of the table, we just mean the color it looks like to a regular person from a usual spot with normal light.
