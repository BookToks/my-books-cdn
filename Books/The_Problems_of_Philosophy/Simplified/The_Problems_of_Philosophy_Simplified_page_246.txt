Many philosophers have believed that philosophy can prove the truth about important questions. They thought that the most important parts of religious beliefs could be shown to be true through careful reasoning. To understand these attempts, we need to look at what people know and how they learn things, as well as what limits there are to this knowledge.

It would be unwise to say something for sure on this topic. But if what we have studied before is correct, we have to give up the hope of finding clear philosophical proof for religious beliefs. So, we cannot say that philosophy gives us definite answers to these questions.

Because of this, the value of philosophy should not depend on having a set of clear, certain knowledge for those who study it.

In fact, the value of philosophy comes mostly from its uncertainty. A person without any philosophy is stuck with the biases from common sense, the usual beliefs of their time or country, and ideas they've accepted without thinking carefully or using reason.
