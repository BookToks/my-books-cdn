We know that expecting things to always happen the same way can sometimes be wrong. For example, a man who feeds a chicken every day might suddenly kill it, which shows that thinking nature is always the same isn’t always true for the chicken.

But even though these expectations can be wrong, they still exist. Just because something has happened many times before makes animals and people think it will happen again.

So, our instincts make us believe the sun will rise tomorrow, but we might be just like the chicken that didn’t see danger coming. We need to understand the difference between expecting things to happen because they did before and actually having a good reason to trust those expectations.

The problem we need to talk about is whether there is any real reason to believe in what is called “the uniformity of nature.”
