I’m pretty sure I ate breakfast this morning, but if I didn’t care about breakfast like a philosopher should, I might not be so sure. When I think about what was said at breakfast, I can remember some of it easily, some with some effort, some with a lot of doubt, and some not at all. So, my memory changes in how clear it is, and this affects how much I can trust it.

The first way to deal with false memories is to understand that memories have different levels of how clear they seem, and these levels match how trustworthy the memory is. Our most trustworthy memories are the ones that are very recent and clear.

But sometimes people strongly believe in memories that are completely wrong. In these cases, what’s actually in their mind is something different from what they think they remember, but it’s usually something connected to it.
