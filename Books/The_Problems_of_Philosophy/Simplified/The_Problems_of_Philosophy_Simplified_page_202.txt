The subject and the objects together are called the parts of the judgment. The act of judging has what is called a "sense" or "direction." This means it puts its parts in a certain order, which we can show by the order of words in a sentence. (In languages that change word endings, this order is shown by those changes, like the difference between nominative and accusative cases.)  

For example, Othello's judgment that Cassio loves Desdemona is different from his judgment that Desdemona loves Cassio, even though the parts are the same. This is because the judging puts the parts in a different order in each case. Similarly, if Cassio thinks Desdemona loves Othello, the parts are still the same, but their order changes.  

This idea of having a "sense" or "direction" is something that judging shares with all other relations. The "sense" of relations is the main source of order and many math ideas. But we donâ€™t need to think more about this right now.
