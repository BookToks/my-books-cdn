So far, we agree with Kant. But what makes Kant different is how he divides what comes from us and what comes from the physical object.

He thinks that the basic stuff we get from our senses—like color and hardness—comes from the object itself. What we add is how we place things in space and time, and how we connect what we sense by comparing them or thinking about causes and effects.

His main reason for this idea is that we seem to know about space, time, cause and effect, and comparison before we experience anything. But we don’t have this kind of knowledge about the basic sensory stuff.

He says we can be sure that everything we ever experience will have these features from our own nature. So, nothing can enter our experience without having these characteristics.
