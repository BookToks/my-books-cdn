So far, we are in agreement with Kant. But what is distinctive of Kant is the way in which he apportions the shares of ourselves and the physical object respectively. He considers that the crude material given in sensation — the colour, hardness, etc. — is due to the object, and that what we supply is the arrangement in space and time, and all the relations between sense -data which result from comparison or f rom considering one as the cause of the other or in any other way. His chief reason in favour of this view is that we seem to have a 'priori knowledge as to space and time and causality and comparison, but not as to the actual crude material of sensation. We can be sure, he says, that anything we shall ever experience must show the characteristics affirmed of it in our a priori knowledge, because these characteristics are due to our own nature, and therefore nothing can ever come into our experience without acquiring these characteristic*.
