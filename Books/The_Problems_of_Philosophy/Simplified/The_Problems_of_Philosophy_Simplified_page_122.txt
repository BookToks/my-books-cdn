A priori knowledge about existence is just about how things that exist or might exist are connected. It doesn’t actually prove that something exists.

A priori knowledge isn’t always about logic like we have talked about before.

One important kind of a priori knowledge is about what is right or wrong, or ethical value. I’m not talking about what is useful or what seems good because of facts, but about what is valuable in itself.

If something is useful, it is because it helps achieve a goal. That goal has to be valuable by itself, not just because it helps reach another goal. So, all ideas about what is useful depend on ideas about what is truly valuable.

For example, we think that happiness is better than misery, knowledge is better than ignorance, and goodwill is better than hatred.

These ideas must be partly immediate and a priori. Like other general principles, they come from experience, and they have to; because we can’t judge if something is really valuable unless we have experienced things like it before.
