What we see is private to each person; what one person sees isn’t exactly what another person sees. Everyone looks at things from a slightly different angle, so they see them a bit differently. 

So, if there are objects that everyone can know about, there must be something beyond these private and personal experiences that show up for different people. But why should we believe that these shared objects really exist?

The first obvious answer is that even though people see the table in slightly different ways, they all see mostly the same thing. The differences in what they see follow rules like how light reflects and how perspective works. This makes it easy to think there is a real, permanent object behind all these different views.

For example, I bought my table from the person who used to live in my room. I didn’t buy their personal experience of the table, which disappeared when they left, but I did buy the expectation that I would see more or less the same table.
