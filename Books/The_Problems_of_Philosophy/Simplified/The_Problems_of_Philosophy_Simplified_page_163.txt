A similar process will help us understand other things like this, called "sensible qualities." These are easier to notice than other kinds of universals, and they seem more connected to actual things we see.

Next, we look at relations. The easiest relations to notice are those between different parts of one thing we see. For example, I can see the whole page Iâ€™m writing on at once. The whole page is one thing I see.

But I also notice that some parts of the page are to the left of other parts, and some parts are above others. The way I understand this is like this: I see many examples where one part is to the left of another. I realize that all these examples share something in common. By thinking about it carefully, I find that what they share is a certain relation between their parts, which I call "being to the left of."
