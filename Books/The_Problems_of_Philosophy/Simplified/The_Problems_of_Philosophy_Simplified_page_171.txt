But this just means that our general idea is now part of a bigger, more general idea. The evidence for this bigger idea is still the same kind, just more detailed. Science keeps doing this—combining smaller ideas into bigger ones—and this gives us a stronger base for scientific ideas.

Even though this makes us more sure about what we know, it doesn’t change the kind of proof we have. The basic reason we believe something is still because we’ve seen many examples, not because the connection is obvious like in math or logic.

There are two opposite things to notice about general statements that are known without needing examples first (a priori). First, if we know lots of examples, we might come up with a general idea by looking at those examples first. Later on, we might realize the general idea connects things in a way that’s true on its own.
