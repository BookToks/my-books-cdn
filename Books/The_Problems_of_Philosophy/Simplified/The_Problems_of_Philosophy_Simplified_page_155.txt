The idea of things being alike is something that is true for everyone.

Since we have to accept this idea, it doesn’t make sense to come up with hard or strange explanations to avoid accepting things like "whiteness" or "triangular shape."

Berkeley and Hume didn’t realize this argument against their rejection of "abstract ideas." They only thought about qualities and ignored the idea that relationships can be universal too. Because of this, the rationalists were right in some ways compared to the empiricists, but their conclusions could still be more wrong because they didn’t pay attention to relationships.

Now that we know universals must exist, the next step is to prove that they aren’t just ideas in our minds.
