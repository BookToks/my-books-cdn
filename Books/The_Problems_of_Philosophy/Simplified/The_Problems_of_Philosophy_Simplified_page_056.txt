When we say that the order in which events seem to happen is the same as the order they really happen in, we have to be careful not to get confused.

We shouldn’t think that the order of different things happening to objects is the same as the order of what we actually see or hear.

For example, thunder and lightning happen at the same time as physical things. The lightning and the air moving where the lightning is happen together. But we don’t hear the thunder until the sound travels to where we are.

Also, it takes about eight minutes for sunlight to reach us. So when we see the sun, we’re actually seeing how it looked eight minutes ago. Our senses show us the sun from eight minutes earlier. If the sun had stopped existing in the last eight minutes, we wouldn’t know it yet because the light hasn’t reached us.
