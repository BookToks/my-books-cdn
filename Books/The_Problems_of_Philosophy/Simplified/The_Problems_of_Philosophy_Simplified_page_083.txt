When I know that I am seeing the sun, it feels like I’m aware of two different things that are connected. 

First, there is the thing I see that shows me the sun. Second, there is the part of me that sees this thing. 

Knowing something, like knowing the thing that shows me the sun, is always about a connection between the person and the thing they know. 

When I can know something about my own knowing, like knowing that I am seeing the sun, it’s clear that the person who knows is me. 

So, when I know that I am seeing the sun, what I really know is “Me knowing the thing that shows the sun.” 

Also, we understand the true fact, “I know this thing.” 

It’s hard to imagine how we could know this truth otherwise.
