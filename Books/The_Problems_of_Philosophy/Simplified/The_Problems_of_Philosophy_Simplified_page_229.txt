If we use the word "nature" like this, then it means we can know something even if we don’t fully understand its "nature" or what it really is.

There’s a mix-up when people use the word "nature" this way, between knowing about things and knowing the true facts about them. We can know something just by being familiar with it, even if we don’t know many facts about it — in fact, we don’t need to know any facts at all.

So, just being familiar with something doesn’t mean we know its "nature" like described here. Also, even if we know one fact about something, that doesn’t mean we understand its full "nature."

Therefore, (1) just knowing or being familiar with something doesn’t mean we know how it connects to other things, and (2) knowing some facts about it doesn’t mean we know all the facts or its full "nature" like explained here.
