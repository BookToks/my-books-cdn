Chapter 2: Does Matter Really Exist?

In this chapter, we ask if matter is real in any way. Is there a table that has its own nature and stays there even when I’m not looking? Or is the table just something I imagine, like a table in a very long dream?

This question is super important. If we can’t be sure that objects exist by themselves, then we can’t be sure that other people’s bodies exist either. And if we can’t be sure about their bodies, it’s even harder to believe their minds are real, since we only think they have minds because we see their bodies.

So, if we can’t trust that objects exist on their own, we might be all alone in a desert — maybe the whole outside world is just a dream, and only we really exist.
