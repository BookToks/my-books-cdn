When a group of opinions all make sense together, they become more believable than if you just look at each opinion by itself. This is how many scientific ideas become more likely to be true. They fit well with other ideas that also seem likely, so they become more believable than if they stood alone.

The same thing happens with big philosophical ideas. Sometimes, one idea might seem really doubtful on its own, but when you see how it helps explain a lot of other ideas that make sense together, it starts to seem almost definitely true. This is especially true for things like telling the difference between dreams and real life.

If our dreams were as organized and connected as our days, it would be hard to know if we should trust the dreams or the real world. But since the test of how well things fit together shows that dreams are less connected, we trust waking life more.

However, this test of fitting ideas together only makes something more likely to be true. It doesnâ€™t give us 100% certainty unless we already have something we know for sure in the system.
