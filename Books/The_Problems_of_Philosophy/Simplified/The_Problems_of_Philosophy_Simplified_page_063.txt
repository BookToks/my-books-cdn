We usually think that matter existed long before there were any minds, and it’s hard to believe that matter is just something created by thinking. But whether this is true or not, the idea called idealism shouldn’t be ignored just because it sounds weird.

Even if physical objects do exist on their own, they must be very different from what we actually see or feel. They only match up with what we sense in a way similar to how a list matches the things on that list. So, common sense doesn’t really help us understand what physical objects are like deep down. If there was a good reason to think they are mental, we shouldn’t reject that idea just because it seems strange. The real nature of physical objects must be strange.

We might never fully understand it, but if a philosopher thinks they have figured it out, the fact that their idea sounds strange shouldn’t be a reason to say they’re wrong.
