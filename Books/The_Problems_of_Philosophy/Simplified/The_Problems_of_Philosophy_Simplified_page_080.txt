We need to think about knowing things beyond just what we see or hear if we want to understand how we really know stuff.

The first step beyond what we sense is knowing by memory.

It's clear that we often remember things we have seen, heard, or experienced with our senses. Even though these memories are from the past, we are still directly aware of them. This kind of memory knowledge is how we know about the past. Without it, we wouldn't even realize the past existed to learn about.

The next step is knowing by looking inside ourselves. Not only do we notice things around us, but we also notice that we are noticing them.
