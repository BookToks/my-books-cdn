The second way gives us the whole complex idea, but it only works if the parts really connect in the way that makes them form that complex. The first way, however, gives us the parts and the relation separately, and only needs the parts and the relation to be real. The relation might not connect those parts in that way, but the judgment can still happen.

Remember at the end of Chapter XI, we said there might be two kinds of self-evidence. One kind gives a total guarantee that something is true, and the other only gives a partial guarantee. Now, we can tell these two kinds apart.

We can say a truth is self-evident in the strongest way when we know the fact that matches the truth. For example, if Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio, the fact that matches this belief, if it’s true, would be "Desdemona’s love for Cassio."
