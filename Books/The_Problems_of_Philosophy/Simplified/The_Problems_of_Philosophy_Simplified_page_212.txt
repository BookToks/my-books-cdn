If the newspapers say the King has died, we have good reason to believe it’s true because they wouldn’t say it if it wasn’t.

We are also sure that the newspaper is saying the King is dead. But the reason we believe this is because we see the words printed on the paper.

Usually, we don’t even think about seeing the letters. Only someone who has trouble reading, like a kid, might notice the shapes of the letters before understanding what they mean.

People who read easily understand the meaning right away and don’t think about how they got the information from the letters.

So, even though it’s possible to carefully think through the letters to understand their meaning, most readers don’t actually do this step-by-step thinking.
