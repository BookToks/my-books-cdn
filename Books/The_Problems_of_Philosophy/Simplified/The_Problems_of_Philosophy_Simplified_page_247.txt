To a person like that, the world seems clear and limited. Everyday things don’t make them ask questions, and they don’t care about new ideas.

But when we start to think deeply, like in philosophy, we see that even simple things can cause big questions. Usually, there aren’t perfect answers.

Philosophy can't always tell us the right answer, but it shows us many different ideas. This helps us think more and not just follow what we’re used to.

So, even though we become less sure about what things really are, we learn more about what they could be. It stops people from being too sure about things without thinking, and it keeps us curious by making us see normal things in a new way.
