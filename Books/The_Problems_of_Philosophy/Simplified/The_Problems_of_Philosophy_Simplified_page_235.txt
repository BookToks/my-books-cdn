What has happened with space and time has also happened in other areas to some degree. Trying to explain the universe using rules we think of before any experience has failed. Logic used to limit what we could imagine, but now it actually frees our imagination, showing many possibilities that common sense might miss. Experience then helps us choose between these many possible worlds that logic gives us.

So, what we know about what exists depends on what we can learn from experience—not just what we have actually experienced. This is because we can know about things through descriptions even if we haven’t directly experienced them.

But when we know something through descriptions, we need some universal connections. These connections let us figure out what kind of object is related to the information we have. For example, when it comes to physical objects, the idea that what we sense points to real objects is itself a universal connection. Only because of this idea can experience help us learn about physical objects.
