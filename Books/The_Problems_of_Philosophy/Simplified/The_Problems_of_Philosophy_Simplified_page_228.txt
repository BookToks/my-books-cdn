People say that if something is connected to other things, it must have some part of those things inside it. So, it couldn’t be what it is if those other things didn’t exist. For example, a person’s nature is made up of their memories, what they know, and the things they love or hate. Without the things they know or care about, they wouldn’t be who they are. A person is basically just a small part of a bigger picture; if you looked at them as the whole world, it wouldn’t make sense.

This idea depends on what we mean by the "nature" of something, which seems to mean all the true facts about that thing. It’s true that a fact linking one thing to another couldn’t exist if the other thing didn’t exist. But a fact about something isn’t actually part of the thing itself, even though we say it’s part of its "nature." If we say that a thing’s "nature" means all the true facts about it, then we can’t really know a thing’s "nature" unless we know everything about how it connects to every other thing in the universe.
