It is held that whatever has relations to things outside itself must contain some reference to those outside things in its own nature, and could not, therefore, be what it is if those outside things did not exist. A man's nature, for example, is constituted by his memories and the rest of his knowledge, by his loves and hatreds, and so on ; thus, but for the objects which he knows or loves or hates, he could not be what he is. He is essentially and obviously a fragment : taken as the sum-total of reality he would be self-contradictory.
 
 This whole point of view, however, turns upon the notion of the " nature " of a thing, which seems to mean "' all the truths about the thing." It is of course the case that a truth which connects one thing with another thing could not subsist if the other thing did not subsist. But a truth about a thing is not part of the thing itself, although it must, according to the above usage, be part of the " nature " of the thing. If we mean THE LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE 225 by a thing's " nature " all the truths about the thing, then plainly we cannot know a thing's " nature " unless we know all the thing's relations to a ll the other things in the universe.
