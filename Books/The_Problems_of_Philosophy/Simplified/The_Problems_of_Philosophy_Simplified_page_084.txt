LE^lS OF PPIIL030PIIY even understand what is meant by it, unless we were acquainted with something which we call " I." It docs not seem necessary to suppose that we are acquainted with a more or less permanent person, the same to-day as yesterday, but it does seem as though we must be acquainted with that thing, whatever its nature, which sees the sun and has acquaintance with sense-data. Thus, in some sense it would seem we must be acquainted with our Selves as opposed to our particular experiences. But the question is difficult, and complicated arguments can be adduced on either side. Hence, although acquaintance with ourselves seems probably to occur, it is not wise to assert that it undoubtedly does occur.
 
 We may therefore sum up as follov/s what has been said concerning acquaintance with things that exist. We have acquaintance in sensation with the data of the outer senses, and in introspection with the data of what may be called the inner sense â€” thoughts, feelings, desires, etc. ; we have acquaintance in memory with things which have been data ACQUAINTANCE AND DESCRIPTION 81 either of the outer senses or of the inner sense.
