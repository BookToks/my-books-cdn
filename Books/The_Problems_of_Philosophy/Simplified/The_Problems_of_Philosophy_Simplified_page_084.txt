Philosophy talks about something called the "I," which means the part of us that knows and experiences things. We don’t have to think of this "I" as a permanent person who is exactly the same every day, but it does seem like there is something inside us that sees the world and knows what we sense.

So, it looks like we have to be aware of ourselves in some way, separate from just our experiences. But this idea is tricky, and smart people can argue both for and against it. That means even though it’s likely we know ourselves, we can’t be 100% sure.

To sum it up: we know things around us through our senses, like seeing and hearing. We also know our own thoughts and feelings by looking inside ourselves. And we remember things we sensed or felt before through memory.
