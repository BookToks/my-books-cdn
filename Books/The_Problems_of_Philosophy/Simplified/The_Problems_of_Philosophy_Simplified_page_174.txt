So, we can never really know for sure that something we see or touch is a physical object. This is because when we say "this," we are talking about something we directly experience, not the object itself. 

That means all our knowledge about physical objects is based on ideas, but we can’t actually show a real example of the physical object. We can show examples of what we sense, like colors or shapes, but not the object itself. So, our knowledge about physical objects depends on general ideas, even though we can’t point to a real example.

The same thing goes for knowing what other people are thinking or feeling, or anything else that we don’t directly experience.

Now, let’s look at where our knowledge comes from, based on what we have studied. First, we need to separate knowledge about things from knowledge about truths. In both cases, there are two types: one we know right away and one we learn from other knowledge.
