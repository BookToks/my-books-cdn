Philosophy is useful because it helps us see new possibilities we didn’t expect. But its biggest value comes from thinking about really important things and not just focusing on small, personal goals.

People who live only by their instincts care mostly about their own family and friends. They don’t think much about the world outside unless it affects what they want. This kind of life feels busy and limited, while a life with philosophy feels calm and free.

Our personal world is small compared to the huge world around us. That big world can mess up our small world sooner or later. If we don’t widen our interests to include the whole world, we’re like soldiers stuck in a fortress surrounded by enemies, knowing we can’t escape and will eventually have to give up.
