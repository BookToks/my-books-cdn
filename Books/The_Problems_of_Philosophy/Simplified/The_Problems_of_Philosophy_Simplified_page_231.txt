This result, even though it’s disappointing for people who hoped philosophers had clear answers, fits well with the way we think today—based on science and careful observation. It also matches everything we’ve learned about human knowledge in the earlier chapters.

Many big attempts by philosophers have tried to show that certain things we see in the world don’t make sense and can’t be real. But modern thinking is moving more toward proving that these supposed contradictions aren’t real problems. We actually can’t prove much just by guessing what must be true.

A good example is space and time. Space and time seem to go on forever and can be divided into smaller and smaller parts. If we walk in a straight line, it’s hard to believe we’d ever reach a final point where there is nothing beyond—not even empty space. The same goes for time. If we imagine going back or forward in time, it’s hard to believe there’s a first or last moment with nothing beyond it.
