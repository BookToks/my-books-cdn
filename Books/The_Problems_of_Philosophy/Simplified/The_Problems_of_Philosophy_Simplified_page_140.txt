186 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY Reflection, moreover, seems to make it clear that, if there is any truth in our arithmetical beliefs, they must apply to things equally whether we think of them or not. Two physical objects and two other physical objects must make four physical objects, even if physical objects cannot be experienced.
 
 To assert this is certainly within the scope of what we mean when we state that two and two are four. Its truth is just as indubitable as the truth of the assertion that two phenomena and two other phenomena make four phenomena. Thus Kant's solution unduly limits the scope of a priori propositions, in addition to failing in the attempt at explaining their certainty.
 
 Apart from the special doctrines advocated by Kant, it is very common among philosophers to r egard what is a priori as in some sense mental, as concerned rather with the way we must think than with any fact of the outer world. We noted in the preceding chapter the three principles commonly called *' l aws of thought." The view which led to their being so named is a natural one, but A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE 137 there are strong reasons for thinking that it is erroneous.
