Thinking about it more shows that if our math ideas are true, they have to work the same way whether we think about things or not. For example, two objects plus two more objects always make four objects, even if we can’t see or touch them.

Saying this is definitely what we mean when we say two plus two equals four. It’s just as true as saying two events plus two other events make four events. So, Kant’s idea limits these basic truths too much and doesn’t really explain why they are certain.

Besides Kant’s ideas, many philosophers think that a priori knowledge is mostly about how we have to think, not about facts in the real world. We talked before about the three rules called the “laws of thought.” It makes sense to call them that, but there are good reasons to believe this idea is actually wrong.
