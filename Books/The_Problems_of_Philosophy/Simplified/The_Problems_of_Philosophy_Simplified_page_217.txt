All thoughts and feelings, and all things we notice with our senses, are private like this. Only one person can fully understand their own thoughts or what they sense. That means no fact about something personal can be obvious to more than one person.

But facts about general ideas or concepts aren’t private like that. Lots of people can understand the same general ideas. So, many people can know the same fact about how these ideas connect.

Whenever we understand a fact by directly knowing the parts and how they fit together, we say that fact is absolutely clear and must be true.
