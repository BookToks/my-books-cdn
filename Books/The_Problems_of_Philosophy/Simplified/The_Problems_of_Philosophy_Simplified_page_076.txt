CHAPTER V KNOWLEDGE BY ACQUAINTANCE AND KNOWLEDGE BY DESCRIPTION

In the last chapter, we learned that there are two kinds of knowledge: knowing things and knowing facts. 

In this chapter, we will focus only on knowing things. There are two types of knowing things.

The first type is called knowledge by acquaintance. This kind of knowledge is simpler than knowing facts and does not depend on knowing facts. But itâ€™s probably true that people never really know things without also knowing some facts about them.

The second type is knowledge by description. This kind always needs some knowledge of facts, which we will explain more in this chapter.
