We talked about something called "judging" or "believing." This means joining together a subject and some objects into one bigger thing.

Judging is just like any other connection between things. When two or more things are connected, they form a bigger whole. For example, if Othello loves Desdemona, that makes a bigger idea called "Othello's love for Desdemona."

The things joined by the connection can be simple or complicated, but the whole made by joining them is always complicated. Whenever there is a connection between things, a complex object is made from joining them. And if there is a complex object, it means there is some connection joining its parts.

When someone believes something, a complex whole happens where "believing" is the connection. The subject and objects are put in a certain order because of the meaning of believing.
