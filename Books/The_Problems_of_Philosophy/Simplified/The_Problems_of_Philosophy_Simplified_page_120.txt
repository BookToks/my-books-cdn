The phrase "a pn'on" is less offensive and more common in modern writers. So, even though all knowledge comes from experience, we still believe that some knowledge is a priori. This means that the experience makes us think about something, but it doesn’t have to prove it. Instead, it just helps us notice the truth without needing any proof from experience.

There is another important point where the empiricists were right against the rationalists. We can only know that something exists if we have experience of it. This means, if we want to prove that something we haven’t seen or experienced is real, we need to start with things we have experienced.

For example, we believe the Emperor of Russia exists because people tell us so. This testimony comes from things we see or hear, like reading or talking to others. Rationalists thought they could figure out if something exists just by thinking about what must be true in general, without needing experience.
