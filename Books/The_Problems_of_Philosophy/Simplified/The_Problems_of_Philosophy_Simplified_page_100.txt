We have more proof from the past that the laws of motion are true than we do for the sunrise because the sunrise is just one example of those laws working. There are many other examples too.

But the real question is: Does seeing a law work many times before mean it will work in the future? If not, then we have no reason to believe the sun will rise tomorrow, or that the bread we eat won’t poison us, or any of the other things we expect every day. It’s important to know that these expectations are only likely, not guaranteed. So, we don’t need proof that they must happen, just some reason to think they probably will.

To understand this better, we need to make an important difference first. Without this, we would get totally confused.
