If we say that things we know have to be inside our mind, we are either making the mind’s ability to know too small, or we are just saying the same thing twice in a different way. It’s like saying "in the mind" means the same as "before the mind," which just means the mind understands it. But if that’s what we mean, then what is "in the mind" might not actually be mental.

So, when we really understand what knowledge is, Berkeley’s idea is wrong both in how it’s said and what it means. His reason for thinking that "ideas" — the things we understand — have to be mental doesn’t hold up at all.

Because of this, we can ignore his reasons for supporting idealism. Now, we need to check if there are any other good reasons for it.

People often say it’s obvious that we can’t know something exists if we don’t know it. From this, they think that anything connected to our experience must be something we can know. So, if matter was something we couldn’t understand at all, then we wouldn’t know it exists, and it wouldn’t matter to us in any way.
