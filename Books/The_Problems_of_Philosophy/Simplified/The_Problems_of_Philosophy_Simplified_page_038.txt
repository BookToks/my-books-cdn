We should try to find, in our own personal experiences, signs that show there are things outside of ourselves and our feelings.

But we have to admit that we can never fully prove that things other than ourselves and our experiences really exist. It’s not impossible to think that the world is just me and my thoughts, feelings, and sensations, and that everything else is just made up.

For example, in dreams, we might see a very detailed world, but when we wake up, we realize it wasn’t real. This means the things we sensed in the dream didn’t match up with real objects we expect in the physical world.

(It’s also true that if we assume the physical world exists, we can sometimes explain dream sensations by real causes—like a door slamming might make us dream about a battle at sea.)
