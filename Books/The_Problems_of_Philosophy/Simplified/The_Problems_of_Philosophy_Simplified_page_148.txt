Because it is not specific, it can’t exist in the physical world we see and touch. Also, it doesn’t change or disappear like things we can sense; it always stays the same and can’t be destroyed.

So, Plato thinks there is a world beyond what we can see, a world that is more real than the one we live in. This world is full of unchanging ideas, and it’s these ideas that give the physical world any kind of real meaning. For Plato, the real world is the world of ideas. When we talk about things we see around us, we are really just talking about how they connect to these ideas, which make up what those things are like.

Because of this, it’s easy to start thinking in a mystical way. We might hope to see these ideas clearly, like we see objects with our eyes. Some even imagine that these ideas live in heaven.

These mystical thoughts are understandable, but the main idea comes from logical thinking. We need to look at the theory based on logic first.
