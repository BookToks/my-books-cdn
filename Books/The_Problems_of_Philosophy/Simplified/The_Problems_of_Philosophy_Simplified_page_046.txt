CHAPTER III THE NATURE OF MATTER

In the last chapter, we agreed, even though we couldn’t fully prove it, that it makes sense to believe that what we see and feel—like when I look at my table—actually shows that something real exists outside of us and our senses. 

This means that besides the colors, hardness, sounds, and other things I notice about the table, I think there is something else there that these things are just a part of.

The color goes away if I close my eyes, the feeling of hardness stops if I take my arm off the table, and the sound disappears if I stop tapping the table with my fingers.

But I don’t think the table itself stops existing just because I don’t see, feel, or hear these things anymore.
