Self-interest or desire can change how we see things and get in the way of understanding. When personal feelings create a barrier between us and what we are trying to understand, they trap our mind. A free mind can see things like God might see them—without thinking about the present moment, hopes, fears, or usual beliefs. It looks at things calmly and only wants to know the truth, in the most unbiased and thoughtful way possible.

Because of this, a free mind values abstract and general knowledge more than what we learn from our senses. Sensory knowledge depends on our personal point of view and our body, which can both change and limit what we see.

A mind used to this kind of free and fair thinking will keep some of that freedom when dealing with real-life actions and feelings. It will see its goals and desires as small parts of a bigger picture and won’t get too caught up in them, knowing that the rest of the world isn’t changed by just one person’s actions.
