We can’t really know Bismarck himself because he’s a real person from history, and we don’t have direct access to him. But we do know there is a person called Bismarck, and that he was a smart diplomat.

So, we can say the statement: "Bismarck was a smart diplomat," where Bismarck is that real person.

If we describe Bismarck as "the first Chancellor of the German Empire," then the statement we want to say is: "The person who was the first Chancellor of the German Empire was a smart diplomat."

What helps us understand each other, even when we use different descriptions, is that we know there is one true statement about the real Bismarck. No matter how we describe him (as long as it’s correct), the statement is still about the same person.

This true statement is what matters to us, but we don’t actually have the statement itself in front of us or fully know it, even though we know it’s true.
