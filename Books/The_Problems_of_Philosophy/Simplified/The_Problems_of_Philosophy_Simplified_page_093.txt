In this we are necessarily defeated, since the actual Bismarck is unknown to us. But we know that there is an object B, called Bismarck, and that B was an astute diplomatist. We can thus describe the proposition we should like to affirm, namely, " B was an astute diplomatist," where B is the object which was Bismarck. If we are describing Bismarck as " the first Chancellor of the German Empire," the proposition we should like to affirm may be described as " the proposition asserting, concerning the actual object which was the first Chancellor of the German Empire, that this object was an astute diplomatist." What enables us to communicate in spite of the varying descriptions we employ is that we know there is a true proposition concerning the actual Bismarck, and that however we may vary the description (so long as the description is correct) the proposition described is s till the same. This proposition, which is described and is known to be true, is what interests us ; b ut we are not acquainted 90 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY with the proposition itself, and do not know it, though we know it is true.
