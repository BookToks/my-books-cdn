Relations are connections between things. Spinoza talked about these connections a lot. Sometimes there are many connections at once. A “subject” is the main focus in something. Our “sense of” things means how we understand or feel about them. Swift is mentioned in this context.

Resemblance means how things look or seem alike. The Emperor of Russia is mentioned in some examples. A “thing in itself” means what something really is, beyond how we see it. The laws of thought are rules about how we think.

The “self” means who you really are inside. Time is about when things happen and how we understand it.

Self-consciousness means knowing you exist and can think about yourself. Touch is one of the ways we feel the world. Self-evidence means something is obviously true without needing proof. Truth is about what is real or right.

There are different levels of truth. Truth can be defined in two ways. Sensation is how we feel things through our senses. Sense-data are the pieces of information we get from our senses.

The Uniformity of Nature means nature behaves in a steady, predictable way. Universals are ideas or things that can apply to many different cases. Some things are certain or sure to be true. Shapes are about how things look in space and how we understand them.

Solipsism is the idea that only your own mind is sure to exist. Space is where things are located. Some space ideas are not just in our minds.

There are different types of geometry like Euclidean and non-Euclidean. Verbs are action words.
