So, there’s a problem about how what we see (sense-data) relates to a real table, if that table really exists.

If the real table does exist, we call it a "physical object." So, we need to think about how sense-data connects to physical objects.

All physical objects together are called "matter." That means our two questions are: (1) Does matter really exist? (2) If it does, what exactly is it like?

The philosopher who first talked a lot about why what we sense might not exist on its own was Bishop Berkeley (1685-1753). In his book *Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous*, he tries to prove that matter doesn’t exist at all, and that the world is only made of minds and their ideas.

Hylas used to believe in matter, but Philonous challenges him with tough questions and contradictions. In the end, denying matter almost seems like common sense.
