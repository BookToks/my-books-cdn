When human beings speak — that is, when we hear certain noises which we associate with ideas, and simultaneously see certain motions of lips and expressions of face — it is very difficult to suppose that what we hear is not the expression of a thought, as we know it would be if we emitted the same sounds. Of course similar things happen in dreams, where we are mistaken as to the existence of other people. But dreams are more or less suggested by what we call waking life, and are capable of being more or less accounted for on scientific principles if we assume that there really is a physical world. Thus every principle of simplicity urges us to adopt the natural view, that there really are objects other than our selves and our sense-data which have an existence not dependent upon our perceiving them.
 
 Of course it is not by argument that we originally come by our belief in an independent external world. We find this belief ready in ourselves as soon as we begin to reflect : it is what may be called an instinctive belief 38 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY We should never have been led to question this belief but for the fact that, at any rate in the case of sight, it seems as if the sensedatum itself were instinctively believed to be the independent object, whereas argument shows that the object cannot be identical with the sense-datum.
