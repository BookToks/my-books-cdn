When people talk — that means when we hear certain sounds that we connect with ideas, and at the same time see movements of lips and facial expressions — it's really hard to think that what we hear isn’t the expression of a thought, just like it would be if we made the same sounds ourselves.

Sure, similar things happen in dreams, where we might think other people are real. But dreams are mostly based on what we experience when we’re awake, and they can be explained by science if we believe that a real physical world exists.

So, it makes the most sense to believe that there are real things outside of ourselves and what we sense, and that these things exist even if we aren’t noticing them.

We don’t come to believe in a world outside ourselves just by thinking about it. This belief is already inside us as soon as we start to think—it’s like an instinct.

We wouldn’t even question this belief if it weren’t for the fact that, especially with sight, it seems like what we see is the real object itself. But reasoning shows that the real object isn’t the same as what we actually sense.
