Experience has shown us that when something happens the same way many times, we expect it to happen the same way again next time. Food that looks a certain way usually tastes a certain way, so it’s a big surprise when it tastes different than we expect. Things we see also become connected in our minds with how they feel when we touch them. One scary thing about ghosts in stories is that you can’t feel them when you try to touch them. People who haven’t traveled much are surprised and don’t believe it when they find out people in other countries don’t understand their language.

This kind of connection doesn’t just happen with people; animals experience it too.

For example, a horse that has been taken down the same road many times will try to resist going a different way. Pets and other animals expect food when they see the person who usually feeds them.
