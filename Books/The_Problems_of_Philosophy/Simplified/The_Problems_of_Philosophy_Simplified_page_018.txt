But the other colors that show up in different situations are just as real. So, to be fair, we have to say that the table itself doesn’t have just one specific color.

The same idea goes for the texture.

With our eyes, we can see the grain on the table, but it looks smooth and even. If we looked at it with a microscope, we would see bumps, hills, and valleys—all kinds of tiny details we can’t see with just our eyes. Which one is the “real” table? We might want to say the microscope shows the real one, but if we used an even stronger microscope, it would look different again. So if we can’t fully trust what our eyes see, why should we trust what the microscope shows? This makes us start to doubt what our senses tell us.
