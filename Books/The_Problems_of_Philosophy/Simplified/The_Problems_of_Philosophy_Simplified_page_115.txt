The same kind of thing happens with logical rules. Imagine two guys are talking about what day it is. One says, "You have to agree that if yesterday was the 15th, today must be the 16th." The other replies, "Okay, I agree with that."

Then the first guy says, "And you know yesterday was the 15th because you had dinner with Jones, and your calendar shows that was on the 15th." The second guy says, "Yeah, so today has to be the 16th."

This kind of argument is easy to understand. If the starting ideas are true, then no one can say the ending idea is false. But this depends on a general rule of logic.

The rule is: "If we know that if one thing is true, then another thing is true, and we also know the first thing is true, then the second thing must be true."

When one thing being true means another thing is true, we say the first thing 'implies' the second, and the second 'follows from' the first. So the rule says if the first thing implies the second, and the first thing is true, then the second thing is true too.

In other words, "if something is true, then everything it implies is also true."
