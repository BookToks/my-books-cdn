This shows why it’s important to understand the difference between what we see and the real objects themselves.

When it comes to space, what we learn is similar to how we connect what we see with the actual physical things. If one thing looks blue and another looks red, it makes sense to think the real objects are different in some way. If two things both look blue, we can guess they are similar in some way.

But we can’t directly know the exact thing in the real object that makes it look blue or red. Science explains that this is because of a certain kind of wave motion.

This sounds familiar because we think of waves happening in the space we see. But actually, these waves happen in physical space, which we can’t directly experience. So, these real waves are not as familiar as we might think.
