" This affords a fresh illustration of the necessity of distinguishing between sense-data and physical objects.
 
 What we have found as regards space is much the same as what we find in relation to the correspondence of the sense-data with their physical counterparts. If one object looks blue and another red, we may reasonably presume that there is some corresponding difference between the physical objects ; if two objects both look blue, we may presume a corresponding similarity. But we cannot hope to be acquainted directly with the quality in the physical object which makes it look blue or red. Science tells us that this quality is a certain sort of wavemotion, and this sounds familiar, because we think of wave-motions in the space we see. But the wave-motions must really be in physical space, with which we have no direct acquaintance ; thus the real 54 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY wave - motions have not that f a miharity which we might have supposed them to have.
