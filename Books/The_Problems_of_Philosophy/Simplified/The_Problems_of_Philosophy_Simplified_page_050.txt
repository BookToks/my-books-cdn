Science looks at space in a way that doesn’t favor either touch or sight, so it isn’t just the space we feel or the space we see.

Also, different people can see the same thing in different shapes depending on where they stand. For example, a round coin looks oval unless you look at it straight on. When we say the coin is round, we mean it really is round, not just how it looks. This real shape is part of the coin itself, not just how it seems.

But this real shape happens in a real space, which isn’t the same as anyone’s personal way of seeing things. Real space is shared by everyone, while the space we see is private to each person. Since the same thing looks different in each person’s private space, the real space where it has its true shape must be different from those private spaces.
