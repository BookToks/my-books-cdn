Let’s go back to the statement "two and two are four." It’s pretty clear that this sentence shows a connection between the idea of "two" and the idea of "four." This brings up a new idea we want to prove: all knowledge we get without experience (a priori knowledge) only deals with connections between these general ideas or universals.

This idea is really important and helps us understand the problems we had before about knowledge that doesn’t come from experience.

The only time it might seem like this idea is wrong is when a statement says that all things in one group belong to another group, or that everything with one quality also has another quality. At first, it might look like we’re talking about individual things instead of the qualities themselves. For example, "two and two are four" could also be said as "any two and any other two make four," or "any group made of two twos is a group of four."
