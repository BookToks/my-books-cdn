When we think about how our minds work, this is mostly true. In geometry, for example, when we want to prove something about all triangles, we draw one triangle and think about it, making sure not to use anything special that only that triangle has.

Beginners often find it helpful to draw many different triangles that look very different from each other. This helps them check that their thinking works for all triangles.

But a problem comes up when we ask how we know if something is white or a triangle. If we don’t want to use the idea of “whiteness” or “triangularity” in general, we pick one white thing or one triangle and say that anything is white or a triangle if it looks like the one we chose.

But then the “looking like” has to mean something that applies to many white things. This is what we call a universal. Since many things are white, the way they look alike has to be the same for many pairs of white things.

It wouldn’t help to say there’s a different way they look alike for each pair, because then we would have to say that these ways of looking alike also look alike. So, in the end, we have to accept that resemblance itself is a universal.
