So, two really hard questions come up at the same time: (1) Is there a real table at all? (2) If yes, what kind of thing is it?

To think about these questions, it helps to have some simple words with clear meanings. Let's call "sense-data" the things we notice right away with our senses, like colors, sounds, smells, hardness, roughness, and so on. We'll call "sensation" the feeling of noticing these things.

For example, when we see a color, we have the sensation of that color, but the color itself is the sense-datum, not the sensation. The color is what we notice directly, and the sensation is the experience of noticing it.

It's clear that if we want to know anything about the table, it has to be through the sense-data — like its brown color, shape, smoothness, and so on — that we connect with the table. But for reasons already explained, we can't say the table is just the sense-data, or even that the sense-data are directly parts of the table.
