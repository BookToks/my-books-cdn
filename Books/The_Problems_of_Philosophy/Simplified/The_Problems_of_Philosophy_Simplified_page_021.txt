Hence, two very difficult questions at once arise ; namely, (1) Is there a real table &t all ? (2) If so, what sort of object can it be?
 
 It will help us in considering these questions to have a few simple terms of which the meaning is definite and clear. Let us give the name of " sense-data " to the things that are immediately known in sensation : such things as colours, sounds, smells, hardnesses, roughnesses, and so on. We shall give the name " sensation " to the experience of being immediately aware of these things.
 
 Thus, whenever we see a colour, we have a sensation of the colour, but the colour itself is a sense-datum, not a sensation. The colour is that of which we are immediately aware, and the awareness itself is the sensation.
 
 It is plain that if we are to know anything about the table, it must be by means of the sense-data — brown colour, oblong shape, smoothness, etc. — which we associate with the table ; but for the reasons which have been given, we cannot say that the table is the 18 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY sense-data, or even that the sense-data are directly properties of the table.
