The same goes for the law of cause and effect, or more specifically, for rules like the law of gravity.

Rules like gravity are proven, or at least made very likely, by combining what we experience with some basic ideas we accept without needing proof, like the idea of induction. 

So, our natural understanding, which is where all our knowledge comes from, is of two types. One is pure experience-based knowledge, which tells us about the things we see and some of their features. The other is pure logical knowledge, which helps us understand how general ideas connect and lets us make conclusions from the facts we get from experience.

All the knowledge we build depends on some pure logical ideas and usually also on some pure experience-based facts.
