This connection is real, but not in the same way that I and my room are real. The word "in" is something we can think about and understand. If we couldn't understand it, we wouldn't be able to understand the sentence "I am in my room."

Many philosophers, following Kant, say that relations are made by the mind. They believe things themselves don’t have relations, but our mind puts them together and creates the relations we think they have.

However, this idea has some problems, like the ones we talked about before with Kant. It seems clear that just thinking doesn’t make the sentence "I am in my room" true. For example, an earwig might be in my room even if no one knows it. This truth depends only on the earwig and the room, not on anyone’s thoughts. So, relations are real, as we will explain more in the next chapter.
