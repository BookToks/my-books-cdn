The Absolute Idea, therefore, is adequate to describe Absolute Reality ; but all lower ideas only describe reality as it appears to a partial view, not as it is to one who simultaneously surveys the Whole. Thus Hegel reaches the conclusion that Absolute Reality forms one single harmonious system, not in space or time, not in any degree evil, wholly rational, and wholly spiritual. Any appearance to the contrary, in the world we know, can be proved logically — so he believes — to be entirely due to our fragmentary piecemeal view of the universe.
 
 If we saw the universe whole, as we may suppose God sees it, space and time and matter and evil and all striving and struggling would disappear, and we should see instead an eternal ] perfect unchanging spiritual unity. \ In this conception, there is undeniably something sublime, something to which we could wish to yield assent. Nevertheless, when the arguments in support of it are carefully examined, they appear to involve much confusion and many unwarrantable assumptions.
 
 The fundamental tenet upon which the system 224 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY is built up is that what is incomplete must be not self-subsistent, but must need the support of other things before it can exist.
