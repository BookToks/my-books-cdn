The Absolute Idea is the only way to fully describe Absolute Reality. All other ideas only show parts of reality, not the whole picture like someone who sees everything at once. So, Hegel believes that Absolute Reality is one perfect system. It doesn’t exist in space or time, it isn’t evil, and it is completely logical and spiritual. Any problems we see in the world are just because we only see small pieces of the universe.

If we could see the universe all at once, like God might, then things like space, time, matter, evil, and struggles would disappear. Instead, we would see a perfect, unchanging spiritual unity that lasts forever. This idea is very impressive and something many people might want to believe. But when you look closely at the reasons for it, there are many confusing parts and assumptions that don’t seem fair.

The main idea behind this system is that anything incomplete can’t exist on its own. It needs other things to support it before it can be real.
