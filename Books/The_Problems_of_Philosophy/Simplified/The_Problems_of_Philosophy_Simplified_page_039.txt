Even though there is a physical reason for what we see or feel, there isn’t always a real physical thing that matches those feelings, like a real naval battle matching the idea of one.

It’s not impossible to think that life is just a dream where we make up everything we see and experience. But even if that idea isn’t impossible, there’s no good reason to believe it’s true. Actually, it’s a more complicated idea than just believing that real things exist outside of us and cause our feelings and sensations.

It’s easier to understand things if we believe real objects exist. For example, if a cat appears in one spot in the room and then later in another, it makes sense to think the cat moved from one place to the other, going through the spaces in between.
