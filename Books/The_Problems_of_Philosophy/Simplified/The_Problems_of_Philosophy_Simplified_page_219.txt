This second kind of self-evidence will have degrees, from the very highest degree down to a bare inclination in favour of the belief. Take, for example, the case of a horse trotting away from us along a hard road. At first our certainty that we hear the hoofs is complete ; gradually, if we listen intently, there comes a moment when we think perhaps it was imagination or the blind upstairs or our own heart-beats ; at last we become doubtful whether there was any noise at all ; then we think we no longer hear anything, and at last we know we no longer hear anything. In this process, there is a continual gradation of self-evidence, from the highest degree to the least, not in the sensedata themselves, but in the judgments based on them.
 
 Or again: Suppose we are comparing two shades of colour, one blue and one green.
 
 We can be quite sure they are different shades of colour ; but if the green colour is gradually 216 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY altered to be more and more like the blue, becoming first a blue-green, then a greenyblue, then blue, there will come a moment when we are doubtful whether we can see any difference, and then a moment when we know that we cannot see any difference.
