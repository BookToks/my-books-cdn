This second kind of obviousness can have different levels, from very strong to just a little bit of belief. For example, imagine a horse running away from us on a hard road. At first, we are completely sure we hear the horse’s hooves. But if we listen carefully for a long time, we might start to wonder if we only imagined the sound, or if it was something inside the house or even our own heartbeat. Soon, we become unsure if there was any sound at all. Then, we think we don’t hear anything anymore, and finally, we know for sure that we don’t hear anything. 

In this process, our feeling of certainty changes little by little, from very sure to not sure at all. This change happens not because the sounds themselves change, but because of how we judge what we hear.

Or, imagine we are looking at two colors, one blue and one green.

We can be sure they are different colors. But if the green slowly changes to look more like blue—first a mix of blue and green, then more blueish green, and finally blue—there will be a moment when we aren’t sure if there is any difference. Then, there will be a moment when we know for sure that we can’t see any difference at all.
