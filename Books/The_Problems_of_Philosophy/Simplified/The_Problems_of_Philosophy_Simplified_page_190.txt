CHAPTER XII TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD

When it comes to knowing facts, unlike knowing things, there is an opposite called error. 

With things, we either know them or we don’t, but there isn’t really a way to “wrongly” know something if we have direct experience with it. When we are directly familiar with something, it has to be real. We might make mistakes when we think about it, but our basic experience can’t trick us. So, there’s no “both sides” when it comes to direct experience.

But with knowing facts or truths, it’s different. We can believe things that are true or things that are false. We see that many people have different opinions on many topics, and some of those opinions can’t both be right. That means some beliefs must be wrong.
