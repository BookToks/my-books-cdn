Every single part of reality is connected to the next part by something like hooks. Each part grabs onto the next one, and that one grabs onto another, and so on, until the whole universe is put together.

This idea of things being incomplete is true, according to Hegel, both in our thoughts and in the real world. When we think about any idea that is not complete, we find that if we ignore what’s missing, we end up with problems or contradictions. These problems turn the idea into its opposite, called the antithesis. To fix this, we have to come up with a new idea that combines the first idea and its opposite. This new idea is called the synthesis.

Even though the new idea is better, it still isn’t perfect. It will also face its opposite, and we need to combine them again to get a new synthesis. Hegel keeps doing this until he reaches the "Absolute Idea," which he says is perfect, has no opposite, and doesn’t need any more changes.
