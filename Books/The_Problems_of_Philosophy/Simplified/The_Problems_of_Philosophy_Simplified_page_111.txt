When we see someone who looks like our best friend coming toward us, we have no real reason to think that their mind belongs to our worst enemy or a complete stranger. We act the way we do because of habits that worked before, so we believe they will work again in the future. This belief depends on something called the inductive principle.

Big ideas in science, like believing that rules always apply and that everything has a cause, also rely on the inductive principle. People believe these things because they have seen many examples where they are true, and no examples where they are false. But this doesn’t guarantee they will always be true unless we accept the inductive principle.

So, all the knowledge we get from experience about things we haven’t experienced yet depends on a belief that experience itself cannot prove or disprove. Still, this belief feels as natural and strong to us as many things we know from experience.
