Other people will agree that the house which looks nearer to us is nearer ; the ordnance map will take the same view ; and thus everything points to a spatial relation between the houses corresponding to the relation between the sense-data which we see when we look at the houses. Thus we may assume that there is a physical space in which physical objects have spatial relations corresponding to those which the corresponding sense-data have in our private spaces. It is this physical space which is dealt with in geometry and assumed in physics and astronomy.
 
 Assuming that there is physical space, and that it does thus correspond to private spaces, what can we know about it ? We can know only what is required in order to secure the correspondence. That is to say, we can know nothing of what it is like in itself, but we can know the sort of arrangement of physical objects which results from their spatial relations. We can know, for example, that the earth and moon and sun are in one straight line during an eclipse, though 50 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY we cannot know what a physical straight line is in itself, as we know the look of a straight line in our visual space.
