Other people agree that the house that looks closer to us really is closer; maps say the same thing. So, everything shows that the space between houses matches what we see when we look at them. This means there is a real physical space where objects have positions like the ones we see in our own minds. This physical space is what geometry studies and what physics and astronomy assume.

If we say this physical space exists and matches what we see in our minds, what can we really know about it? We only know what we need to make this match work. That means we don’t know what physical space is like by itself, but we can understand how objects are arranged because of their positions. For example, we can know that the earth, moon, and sun line up during an eclipse, even though we don’t know what a perfect straight line really is, just how it looks to us.
