The physical object, which Kant calls the "thing in itself," is something we can’t really know. What we can know is the object as we experience it, which he calls the "phenomenon." The phenomenon is a mix of the thing in itself and our own perception, so it will always have qualities that come from us. This means it fits with our built-in knowledge.

Because of this, even though our a priori knowledge (knowledge we have before experience) is true for all real and possible experiences, it doesn’t work for things outside of experience. So, even with a priori knowledge, we can’t know anything about the thing in itself or about things we can’t experience.

Kant tries to bring together the ideas of rationalists, who believe in knowledge from reason, and empiricists, who believe knowledge comes from experience.

Besides small issues with Kant’s philosophy, there’s one big problem that seems to stop his way of dealing with a priori knowledge from working. The "thing in itself" is the same as the physical object in that it causes our sensations. But Kant says we can’t apply any of our usual categories or concepts to the "thing in itself," even though this idea has some contradictions.
