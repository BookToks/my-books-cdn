Another type of judgment we make, similar to those from our senses but different, comes from memory.

Memory can be confusing because when we remember something, we often see a mental picture of it. But this picture is not what memory really is. The picture happens right now, but what we remember happened in the past.

We can also compare our mental picture with the real thing we remember. This helps us know if our picture is close to the actual memory. This wouldn’t be possible unless the real thing we remember is somehow in our mind too.

So, memory isn’t just about the mental picture. It’s about having something in our mind that we know happened before now. Without memory like this, we wouldn’t even know there was a past, and we wouldn’t understand the word "past," just like a person who was born blind can’t understand the word "light."
