When we think deeply and want to find the truth without any bias, this way of thinking is the same as being fair in our actions and feeling a love that can be shared with everyone—not just with people who seem useful or impressive.

This kind of thinking not only broadens what we consider in our minds but also expands what we do and who we care about. It helps us feel like we belong to the whole world, not just one small city that’s fighting against others. Being part of the whole world like this is real freedom. It frees us from being stuck on small hopes and fears.

So, to sum up what we said about philosophy: We study philosophy not to find clear answers—because usually, we can’t be sure any answer is totally true—but to explore the questions themselves. These questions help us imagine more possibilities, make our thinking stronger, and stop us from being too sure of ourselves in a way that blocks new ideas. Most importantly, by thinking about the huge universe, philosophy makes our minds bigger too, helping us connect with the universe in a way that brings us the greatest happiness.
