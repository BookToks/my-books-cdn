First, we need to explain what we mean by "acquaintance" and "description." We say we have acquaintance with something when we are directly aware of it, without having to think or guess about it.

For example, when I am near my table, I am acquainted with how it looks and feels—its color, shape, hardness, smoothness, and so on. I notice all these things right away when I see and touch my table.

The exact color I see can be described in many ways—I might say it is brown or a bit dark.  

But saying these things helps me know facts about the color, not the color itself. When I actually see the color, I already know it completely. No extra information can make me know the color itself any better than I do by just seeing it.
