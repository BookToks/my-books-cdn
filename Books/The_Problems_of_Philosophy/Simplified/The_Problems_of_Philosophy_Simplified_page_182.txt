We need to be careful when trying to understand what self-evident truths really are. The things we see or sense are not true or false by themselves. For example, a certain spot of color I see just exists; it’s not something that can be true or false.

It is true that the spot is there, true that it has a certain shape and brightness, and true that it is surrounded by other colors. But the spot itself, like everything else we sense, is very different from things that can be true or false. So, we can’t really say the spot is true.

This means that any self-evident truths we get from our senses must be different from the actual sense-data we get.

It looks like there are two types of self-evident truths from what we perceive. Maybe in the end, these two types are really the same. The first type is simply stating that the sense-data exists, without trying to explain it.
