So, we have to trust our gut feelings about memories because that’s how we know about the past.

But memory can be tricky and sometimes wrong, which makes us wonder if we can really trust these gut feelings at all. This is a big problem. 

Let’s try to make it simpler. Usually, memory is more reliable if the experience was strong and happened recently. For example, if the house next door was hit by lightning just half a minute ago, I can be sure I actually saw the flash.

The same goes for less clear memories, as long as they happened not long ago. I’m sure that half a minute ago I was sitting in the same chair I’m in now.

If I think back over my day, there are things I’m absolutely sure about, some things I’m almost sure about, some things I can figure out if I think hard and remember details, and some things I’m not sure about at all.
