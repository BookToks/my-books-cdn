This way, I get to know how things can be similar in a general way.

Between general things, just like with specific things, there are connections we can notice right away. For example, we can see that two shades of green are more alike than a shade of red and a shade of green. Here, we're talking about a connection called "greater than" between two other connections. Understanding these connections takes more thinking than just noticing colors, but it still feels immediate and certain in some cases. So, we can know about general things just as clearly as we know about what we see and feel.

Now, going back to the question about knowledge we have before experience, which we couldnâ€™t solve before when we talked about general things, we are now able to look at it in a much better way than before.
