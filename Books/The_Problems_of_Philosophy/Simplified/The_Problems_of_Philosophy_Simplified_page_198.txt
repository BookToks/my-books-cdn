Let me explain this with examples. Othello wrongly thinks that Desdemona loves Cassio. We can’t say that this belief is about one thing, like “Desdemona’s love for Cassio,” because if that were true, then Othello’s belief would be true. But since that love doesn’t actually exist, Othello can’t believe in something that isn’t there. So, his belief can’t be about that.

Some might say that his belief is about “the idea that Desdemona loves Cassio,” but it’s just as hard to say that this idea exists when Desdemona doesn’t love Cassio. So, it’s better to find a way to understand belief that doesn’t depend on the mind being connected to one single object.

People usually think that relations (connections) are always between two things, but that’s not always true. Some relations need three things, some four, and so on.
