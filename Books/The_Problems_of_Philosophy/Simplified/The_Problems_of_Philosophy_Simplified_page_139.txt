We are sure that facts always follow logic and math.

Saying that logic and math come from us doesn’t explain this. Our nature is part of the world, and nothing guarantees it will always stay the same. If Kant is right, it could happen that tomorrow our nature changes so much that two plus two equals five.

Kant never seems to think about this, but it completely destroys the surety and universal truth he wants to prove for math. It’s true this idea doesn’t fit with Kant’s view that time is something our mind adds to what we see, so our true self isn’t really inside time and has no tomorrow. But he still has to believe that the order of events depends on what’s behind those events, and that idea supports our main point.
