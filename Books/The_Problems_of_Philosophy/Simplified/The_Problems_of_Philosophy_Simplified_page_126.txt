Ignoring the second reason, and just thinking about what we know about people dying, it’s clear that we shouldn’t be okay with just one example of someone dying.

For example, with “two and two are four,” one example is enough to show that it’s true every time. But when it comes to people dying, we might still have a tiny bit of doubt that everyone dies.

You can see this if you try to imagine two different worlds. In one world, there are people who never die. That idea is something we can picture. But in the other world, two and two make five. That idea feels totally impossible.

When Swift talks about the Struldbrugs, a group of people who never die, we can imagine that. But a world where two and two make five would break everything we know and make us question everything.
