Let's make this clearer by comparing a true a priori judgment with an example from experience, like "all men are mortal." 

Just like before, we can understand what this sentence means once we know the general ideas involved, which are "man" and "mortal." We don't need to know every single person to get what the sentence means.

So, the difference between an a priori general statement and one based on experience isn't about what the sentence means; it's about what kind of proof we have for it.

For the experience-based case, the proof comes from specific examples. We believe all men die because we've seen many men die, and no one lives forever. We don't believe it because we see a direct connection between the idea of "man" and "mortal."

However, if science like physiology can prove, by explaining how living bodies work, that no living thing can last forever, then we do have a connection between "man" and "mortal." This would let us say the sentence is true without just relying on seeing people die.
