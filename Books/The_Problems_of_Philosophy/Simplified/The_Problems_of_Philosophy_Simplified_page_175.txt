When we know things right away, which we call acquaintance, there are two kinds depending on what we know: particular things or general ideas. For particular things, we are familiar with what we sense and probably with ourselves. For general ideas, there isnâ€™t a clear rule about which ones we can know directly, but some we do know this way are things we can sense, like qualities, space and time relationships, similarity, and some logical ideas.

When we know things by description, it always includes both direct acquaintance with something and knowing some facts or truths.

Knowing truths right away is called intuitive knowledge, and these truths are called self-evident truths.

These truths include what we get from our senses, some basic logic and math ideas, and maybe some moral ideas, though we are less sure about those. When we know truths by using reasoning, it means we figure them out from self-evident truths by following clear rules of deduction.
