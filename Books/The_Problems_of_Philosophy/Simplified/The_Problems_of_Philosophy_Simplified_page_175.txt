ON KNOWLEDGE OF UNIVERSALS 171 Our immediate knowledge of things, which we called acquaintance, consists of two sorts, according as the things known are particulars or universals. Among particulars, we have acquaintance with sense-data and (probably) with ourselves. Among universals, there seems to be no principle by which we can decide which can be known by acquaintance, but it is clear that among those that can be so known are sensible qualities, relations of space and time, similarity, and certain abstract logical universals. Our derivative knowledge of things, which we call knowledge by description, always involves both acquaintance with something and knowledge of truths.
 
 Our immediate knowledge of truths may be called intuitive knowledge, and the truths so known may be called self-evident truths.
 
 Among such truths are included those which merely state what is given in sense, and also certain abstract logical and arithmetical principles, and (though with less certainty) some ethical propositions. Our derivative knowledge of t ruths consists of everything that we can deduce from self-evident truths 172 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY by the use of self - evident principles of deduction.
