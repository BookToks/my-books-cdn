PREFACE

In the pages ahead, I mostly focus on parts of philosophy where I thought I could say something useful and clear. I didnâ€™t want to just criticize without offering ideas. Because of this, I talk more about how we know things (theory of knowledge) than about what really exists (metaphysics). Some popular topics in philosophy are only mentioned briefly or not at all.

I got a lot of help from some unpublished work by Mr. G. E. Moore and Mr. J. M. Keynes. Mr. Moore helped me understand how our senses relate to physical objects, and Mr. Keynes helped with ideas about probability and reasoning. I also learned a lot from the advice and feedback of Professor Gilbert Murray.
