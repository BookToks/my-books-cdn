CHAPTER X ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF UNIVERSALS In regard to one man's knowledge at a given time, universals, like particulars, may be divided into those known by acquaintance, those known only by description, and those not known either by acquaintance or by description.
 
 Let us consider first the knowledge of universals by acquaintance. It is obvious, to begin with, that we are acquainted with such universals as white, red, black, SAveet, sour, loud, hard, etc., i.e. with qualities which are exemplified in sense-data. When we see a white patch, we are acquainted, in the first instance, with the particular patch ; but by seeing many white patches, we easily learn to abstract the whiteness which they all have in common, and in 158 ON KNOWLEDGE OF UNIVERSALS 159 learning to do this we are learning to be acquainted with whiteness.
