CHAPTER X ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF UNIVERSALS

When it comes to what one person knows at a certain time, universals (things that can be found in many different objects) can be split into three groups: those we know by direct experience, those we only know by description, and those we don’t know at all.

First, let’s think about knowing universals by direct experience. It’s clear that we know universals like white, red, black, sweet, sour, loud, hard, and so on. These are qualities we notice through our senses.

For example, when we see a white spot, at first we notice that one specific spot. But after seeing many white spots, we learn to understand the whiteness they all share. By doing this, we get to know the idea of whiteness itself.
