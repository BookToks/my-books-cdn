So, there are pairs of whole numbers that no one has ever thought about and never will. All these pairs have products bigger than 100.

This means: "All products of two whole numbers, which no one has ever thought about and never will, are more than 100." This idea is definitely true, but we can never give an example because any numbers we think of don't count.

Some people say you can't know general ideas without examples. But actually, knowing these ideas just means understanding how general things relate, not needing examples.

Knowing these general ideas is really important for a lot of what we say we know. For example, we learned earlier that physical objects arenâ€™t things we directly see but are understood by reasoning.
