Hence it follows that there are pairs of integers which never have been and never will be thought of by human beings, and that all of them deal with integers the product of which is over 10(^ Hence we arrive at the proposition : " All products of two integers, which never have been and never will be thought of by any human being, are over 100." Here is a general proposition of which the truth is undeniable, and yet, from the very nature of the case, we can never give an instance ;b ecause any two numbers we may think of are excluded by the terms of the proposition.
 
 This possibility, of knowledge of general propositions of which no instance can be given, is often denied, because it is not perceived that the knowledge of such propositions only requires a knowledge of the relations of universals, and does not require any knowledge of instances of the universals in question. Yet the knowledge of such general propositions is quite vital to a great deal of what is generally admitted to be known. For example, we 170 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY saw, in our early chapters, that physical objects, as opposed to sense-data, are only obtained by an inference, and are not things with which we are acquainted.
