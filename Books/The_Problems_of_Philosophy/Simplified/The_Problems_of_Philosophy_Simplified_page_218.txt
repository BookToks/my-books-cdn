So, this kind of obviousness is a sure way to know something is true.

But even though this obviousness guarantees truth, it doesn’t mean we can be 100% sure that any specific judgment is true. For example, if we first see the sun shining, which is a complicated fact, and then say “the sun is shining,” we have to break down that fact. We have to separate “the sun” and “shining” as parts of the fact. When doing this, it’s possible to make a mistake. So, even when a fact is clearly true, the judgment we make about it might not be completely correct because it might not match the fact exactly. But if it does match the fact, then it has to be true.

The second type of obviousness is about judgments made for the first time, not from directly seeing a fact as one complete thing.
