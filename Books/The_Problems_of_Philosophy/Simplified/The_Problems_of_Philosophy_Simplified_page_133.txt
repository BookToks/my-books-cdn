" A bald man is not bald " would assert and deny baldness of the same man, and would therefore contradict itself. Thus according to the philosophers before Kant, the law of contradiction, which asserts that nothing can at the same time have and not have a certain property, sufficed to establish the truth of all a priori knowledge.
 
 Hume (1711-1776), who preceded Kant, accepting the usual view as to what makes knowledge a priori, discovered that, in many cases which had previously been supposed analytic, and notably in the case of cause and effect, the connection was really synthetic.
 
 Before Hume, rationalists at least had supposed that the effect could be logically deduced from the cause, if only we had sufficient knowledge. Hume argued — correctly, as would now be generally admitted — that this could not be done. Hence he inferred the far more doubtful proposition that nothing could be known a priori about 130 THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY the connection of cause and effect.
