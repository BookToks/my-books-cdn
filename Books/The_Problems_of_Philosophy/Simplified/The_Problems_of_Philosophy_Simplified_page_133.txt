Saying "A bald man is not bald" is confusing because it both says the man is bald and not bald at the same time, which doesn’t make sense. So, before Kant, philosophers believed in the law of contradiction, which says something can’t both have and not have a certain quality at the same time. They thought this law was enough to prove all knowledge we have before experience.

Hume (1711-1776), who lived before Kant, agreed with the usual idea about what counts as knowledge we have before experience. But he found that many things people thought were true by definition, especially cause and effect, actually needed experience to understand.

Before Hume, rationalists thought that if we knew everything, we could figure out the effect just by knowing the cause. Hume argued—and most people now agree—that this isn’t true. Because of this, he believed we can’t really know anything about cause and effect without experience.
