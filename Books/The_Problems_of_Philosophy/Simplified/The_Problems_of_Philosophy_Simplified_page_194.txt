The third idea mentioned before makes us think that truth means our beliefs match up with facts. This idea is popular among many philosophers. But it’s not easy to find a way to show this match without any problems.

Also, some philosophers feel that if truth means matching something outside our thoughts, then we can never really know if we have found the truth. Because of this, many try to define truth without linking it to anything outside what we believe.

One important idea like this is the theory of coherence. It says that something is false if it doesn’t fit with our other beliefs. Truth, then, is part of a complete and connected system of beliefs called The Truth.
