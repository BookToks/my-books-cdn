What if these ideas about human nature seem hard to understand and kind of abstract? That doesn’t mean they are wrong. In fact, it’s probably true that something so tricky and not noticed by many smart philosophers isn’t going to be simple or obvious. Even if studying these ideas takes a lot of effort, we can feel rewarded not just by learning useful things but also by enjoying the process if it helps us know more about really important topics.

But since these complex ideas aren’t easy to like and can be a problem, maybe we can get past the difficulty by being careful and clear, and by skipping unnecessary details. In what follows, we’ve tried to explain some topics that have scared smart people because they seem uncertain and confused beginners because they seem unclear. It would be great if we can bring together different parts of philosophy by combining deep thinking with clear explanations, and new ideas with truth! Even better, if by thinking simply, we can challenge a complicated kind of philosophy that seems to have only helped keep superstition alive and hide mistakes and wrong ideas!
