No one can have any experience except their own. We only trust what others say because of what we know about people from our own experience.

It’s not contradictory to say that all real stories about miracles are ridiculous, but we can imagine a made-up story about a miracle that might be believable and prove something. For example, if the sun disappeared for 48 hours, smart people would just think something was wrong with how the world works during that time.

I can explain what I mean, but probably won’t change it in future versions. Proof against a miracle comes from experiences that never change. This kind of proof is strong and certain by itself, unlike guesses or chances. But if a weaker proof faces a stronger one, the stronger wins.

It’s almost as polite to say someone is talking nonsense indirectly as it is to say it straight out.

Would a smart person believe every silly story about witches, goblins, or fairies and check all the evidence? I’ve never met anyone who looked into nonsense carefully and didn’t end up believing it.

I wonder why some religious leaders like John Knox and Alexander Henderson didn’t perform as many miracles as others. Miracles were a trick used by the Catholic Church and were dropped with the rest of that religion. People need new and different ways to support new and different crazy beliefs. The same goes for Muhammad. The nearby Greek priests were as good at miracles as the Catholics, so Muhammad would have been laughed at for copying old tricks. Healing the blind or casting out devils, which almost anyone can do, doesn’t help you control people.

I’ve never heard of a miracle that wasn’t meant to prove a new religious idea. In Spain, there are no miracles proving the Bible, but St. Francis Xavier did many well-known miracles in the Indies to do that. The miracles in Spain show that a certain cross or relic works, which is always a new or not widely accepted idea.

If a miracle proves that a teaching is from God and true, then a miracle can’t happen to prove the opposite teaching.

So, the facts don’t match if the teachings don’t match.
