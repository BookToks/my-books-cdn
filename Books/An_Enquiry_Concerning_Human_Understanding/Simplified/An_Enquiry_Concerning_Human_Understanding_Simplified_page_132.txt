It seems like people start the question about freedom and necessity in the wrong way by looking at the mind, understanding, and will first. Instead, they should start with something simpler, like how the body and non-living things work. They should see if they can understand cause and effect there, which is just noticing that one thing always happens after another and the mind connects them.

If this idea really is all there is to cause and effect in matter, and if this also happens in the mind, then the argument is over or just about words. But if we wrongly think there is more to cause and effect in the outside world, but nothing more in the mind’s choices, then we can’t solve the argument because we start with a wrong idea. The best way to clear this up is to look closely at how little we really know about cause and effect in the physical world and realize all we know is that things happen together and we expect one after the other.

It might be hard to accept that our understanding is so limited, but once we do, it’s easier to apply this idea to how we make choices. Since our choices always happen with reasons and situations, and we always connect them, we have to admit there is a kind of necessity in all our decisions and actions.

Now, about the big argument of freedom and necessity, which is one of the hardest topics, it’s easy to see that people have always believed in both freedom and necessity. The whole argument is mostly just about words. What do we really mean by freedom when we talk about choices? We can’t mean...
