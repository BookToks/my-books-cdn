Imagine someone who has had their eyesight for thirty years and knows all kinds of colors, except for one specific shade of blue that they have never seen. If you showed them all the different shades of that color, from the darkest to the lightest, but left out that one shade, they would notice something missing. They would feel like there is a bigger gap between the colors where that shade should be.

Now, can this person imagine that missing shade of blue on their own, even though they have never seen it? Most people would say yes. This shows that sometimes simple ideas don’t always come directly from what we have seen or experienced. But this example is very rare and probably not important enough to change the general rule.

Here is an idea that seems simple and clear. If we use it right, it could make every argument easier to understand and stop all the confusing language that often messes up philosophical discussions. Ideas, especially abstract ones, are usually weak and unclear. Our minds don’t hold onto them well, and they can get mixed up with similar ideas. Sometimes we use words a lot without really knowing what they mean, and then we think those words have a clear idea behind them.

On the other hand, impressions—our senses and feelings—are strong and clear. They have exact limits, and it’s hard to be wrong about them. So, when we think a philosophical word is used without meaning, we just need to ask: what impression is this idea coming from? If we can’t find any, then we know the word probably doesn’t have a real meaning. By understanding ideas like this, we can hope to clear up arguments about what ideas really are and whether they are real.
