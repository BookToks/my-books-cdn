But is that a good enough reason for philosophers to stop searching and let superstition keep its hold? Shouldn’t we actually do the opposite and try to explore even the deepest, hidden parts of these ideas? It’s useless to hope that people will just give up on these tricky subjects because they’ve been disappointed before. Besides, many people have a strong interest in these topics. Also, giving up just because things are hard doesn’t make sense in science. Even if past attempts failed, there’s still hope that future generations, with more effort or luck, might find new answers.

Every brave thinker wants to challenge these tough problems. Instead of feeling discouraged by past failures, they feel motivated, hoping that they’ll be the ones to finally succeed. The only way to get rid of confusing ideas is to seriously study how human understanding works and show, by careful analysis, that our minds just aren’t made for such complicated subjects. We have to put in this hard work now to be able to live more peacefully later. We should focus on real philosophy to get rid of the fake and confusing stuff.

Some people avoid this hard work because they’re lazy, but others are too curious to stop. Sometimes people feel hopeless, but later they get hopeful again. Clear and fair thinking is the only solution that works for everyone. It’s the only way to break down the confusing philosophy and fancy talk that, mixed with popular superstition, makes it hard for casual thinkers to understand and makes it seem like real science and wisdom.

Besides getting rid of the confusing and uncertain parts of learning after careful thinking, there are many good things that come from closely studying how our minds work. It’s interesting that even though our thoughts are always with us, when we try to think about them carefully, they seem unclear. It’s hard to see the clear lines that separate and define different mental activities.
