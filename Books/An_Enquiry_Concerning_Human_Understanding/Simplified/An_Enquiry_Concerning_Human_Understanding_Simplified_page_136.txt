It’s also easy to prove, using the same ideas, that freedom, as people agree it means, is really important for being moral. If someone doesn’t have freedom, their actions can’t be seen as good or bad. This is because we only judge actions based on what they show about a person’s feelings and character. If an action is forced on someone from outside, and not from their own choices, we can’t really blame or praise them for it.

I’m not saying I’ve answered all questions about freedom and fate. There are other problems I haven’t talked about yet. For example, some people say that if our choices follow the same rules as everything else in nature, then everything we do was already decided from the very start of the universe. That means there’s no real chance or freedom in anything.

When we act, we are also being acted upon. The ultimate cause of all our choices is the Creator of the world, who set everything in motion. Because of this, all things that happen must happen. So, if human actions are caused by the Creator, they can’t be wrong. Or if they are wrong, then the Creator must be blamed for them too.

It’s like if someone lights a fuse on a bomb; they are responsible for everything that happens after, no matter how long the fuse is. So, whoever started the chain of causes is responsible for everything that happens later. Our ideas about right and wrong show this clearly when we think about what causes human actions. This is even more true when we think about a being who is all-powerful and all-knowing.

Humans can be blamed for mistakes because we don’t know everything and we aren’t all-powerful. But those problems don’t apply to the Creator. The Creator knew and planned all the actions that we call bad. So, we must decide either that those actions aren’t really bad, or that the Creator, not us, is responsible for them.
