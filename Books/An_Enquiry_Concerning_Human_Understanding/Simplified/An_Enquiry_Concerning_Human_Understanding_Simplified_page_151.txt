Stories often get exaggerated a lot because of many different reasons. Foolish people work hard to spread lies, while smart and educated people usually just laugh at how silly these stories are without checking the facts carefully to prove they’re wrong. Because of this, the trickster mentioned earlier was able to go from fooling his simple neighbors in Paphlagonia to gaining followers even among famous Greek philosophers and important people in Rome. He even caught the attention of the wise emperor Marcus Aurelius, who trusted his false predictions enough to plan a military mission based on them.

It’s easier to start a lie among uneducated people, so even if the story is too silly for most to believe, it can still spread well in faraway places rather than in cities known for learning and knowledge. The most ignorant people are the ones who spread these stories far and wide. None of their friends or family have enough influence or respect to stop the rumors. People love strange and amazing tales, so a story that is clearly false where it started can be accepted as true far away. But if Alexander had lived in Athens, the city full of wise philosophers, they would have quickly shared the truth across the Roman Empire. Their strong arguments would have made everyone see the story was fake. Luckily, Lucian once passed through Paphlagonia and was able to expose this lie.

However, it doesn’t always happen that a smart person like Lucian is around to stop every trickster like Alexander. Another reason why people don’t fully believe miracles is that there are always many witnesses who say they didn’t happen. This means not only do miracles make people doubt the stories, but the stories also end up contradicting themselves. To understand this better, remember that in religion, anything very different is seen as wrong, and it’s impossible for the religions of ancient Rome, Turkey, Siam, and China to all be based on solid facts.
