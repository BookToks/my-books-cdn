Maybe people will enjoy reading Addison even after Locke is completely forgotten.

A philosopher is someone who thinks deeply, but people often don’t like them much because they seem to offer nothing useful or fun to society. Philosophers live far away from others and think about ideas that most people don’t understand. On the other hand, people who know nothing are even more looked down on. In a time when science and knowledge are important, not caring about learning is seen as a sign of a closed mind. The best kind of person is somewhere in the middle. They enjoy books, hanging out with friends, and working. They talk politely and wisely, and in their jobs, they are honest and careful. To help people become this kind of well-rounded person, easy-to-read books are very helpful. These books don’t make you work too hard to understand them and send you back into the world with good ideas and advice that fit real life. With these books, being good is nice, learning is fun, hanging out is useful, and alone time is enjoyable.

Humans are thinking beings, so science and learning give them what they need to grow. But our minds are limited, so we can’t expect to know or understand everything perfectly. People are also social and like being with others, but sometimes they can’t always find fun and friendly company or keep enjoying it. Humans are active and have to work and deal with life’s problems, but the mind needs breaks and can’t always handle stress and hard work. Because of this, nature seems to suggest that the best life mixes all these parts—thinking, socializing, and working—without letting one take over too much. Nature says, enjoy learning, but make it about people and real life. Deep, complicated thinking and research can cause sadness, confusion, and loneliness, and when you share your ideas, people might not care much.
