Doesn’t the same habit affect everyone the same way?

Here, we’ll try to quickly explain why people think so differently. After that, it will be easier to understand why humans and animals think differently.

1. When we live for a while and get used to how nature works, we develop a habit. This habit makes us expect that new things will be like the things we already know.

Because of this habit, even one good example can help us reason and expect the same result again if everything is done right. That’s why paying attention to what happens is very important. Since some people are better at noticing and remembering things, they can think better.

2. When many causes work together to create an effect, some people have bigger minds that can understand the whole situation better and guess the results more accurately.

3. Some people can think through longer chains of reasoning than others.

4. Few people can think for a long time without getting their ideas mixed up or confused, and this problem is worse for some than others.

5. Sometimes, the cause of something is mixed up with other unrelated things. Separating the real cause often needs a lot of focus and careful thinking.

6. Making general rules from specific examples is tricky. People often make mistakes here because they rush or don’t look at things from all sides.

7. When we compare things to reason (using analogies), the person with more experience or who quickly thinks of comparisons is usually better at reasoning.

8. Personal biases like prejudice, education, feelings, or group loyalty affect some people’s thinking more than others.

9. Once we trust what people say, books and talking with others can greatly expand one person’s knowledge and thinking more than another’s.

There are many other reasons why people’s minds work differently.
