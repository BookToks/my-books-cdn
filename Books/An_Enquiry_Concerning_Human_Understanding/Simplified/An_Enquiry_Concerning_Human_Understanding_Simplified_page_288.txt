Hobbes is often seen as someone who believes in learning from experience (empiricism) because he doesn’t believe in ideas we’re born with. But in many ways, he’s similar to Descartes, especially in how much he trusts logical reasoning rather than experiments in science. Like Descartes, he thinks the physical world is completely full of matter.

However, Hobbes is very different in that he is a materialist. He doesn’t believe in Descartes’ idea of a non-physical mind. Instead, Hobbes thinks all minds, including human and divine, are made of physical stuff. This made many people call him an atheist and accuse him of following the ideas of Epicurus. In the 1600s, calling someone a “Hobbist” was an insult.

Because of this, the philosopher Hume didn’t like to talk about Hobbes unless he was criticizing him. For example, Hume said Hobbes’ politics promote tyranny (cruel rule), and his ethics encourage bad behavior. Even though Hobbes was against religion, he wasn’t a skeptic (someone who doubts everything). He was very sure of his ideas, especially about human reason. Hobbes’ writing is known for being clear and well-organized.

Francis Bacon (1561–1626) was a lawyer and politician in England, and he became Lord Chancellor. He wrote about history, science, and how science should be done. Bacon didn’t like the old way of thinking based on Aristotle, which focused on logical deduction from first ideas. Instead, Bacon believed in learning through experiments by ruling out wrong ideas one by one.

Hume praised Bacon in his writings, calling him “the father of experimental physics.” Hume also used Bacon’s ideas to explain why we should doubt miracles and other strange claims, like what we now call “New Age” or paranormal stuff.

Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655) was a French philosopher and scientist. He is famous for criticizing Descartes’ ideas but was also one of the first modern empiricists. Influenced by Epicurus and skepticism, Gassendi rejected the idea of innate knowledge, believed all ideas come from our senses, and was unsure about the true nature of things.

He also had ideas about animal reasoning that were similar to Hume’s, but it’s not clear if Hume ever read his work.
