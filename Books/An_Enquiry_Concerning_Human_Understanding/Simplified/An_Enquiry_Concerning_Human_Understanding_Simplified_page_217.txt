When these ideas are fully explained, like some philosophers and almost all religious thinkers do, who can still trust our weak ability to reason when it comes to such deep, complicated, and far-off topics? If we can’t even fully understand something as simple as a stone and how its parts fit together—things we see every day—then how can we be sure about where the universe came from or what its history is from beginning to end?

You say, Philo, replied Cleanthes, that you want to build religious faith on philosophical doubt. You think that if we lose certainty in everything else, then religious ideas will become stronger and more trustworthy. Whether your doubt is really as strong and honest as you say, we’ll find out soon, when everyone leaves. Then we’ll see if you really doubt things like whether your body has weight or can get hurt if you fall—things most people believe because of their senses and experience, even if both can be misleading...

In truth, Philo, Cleanthes continued, it seems clear that even if someone, feeling emotional or after thinking hard about how imperfect human reason is, decides to stop believing in anything at all, they can’t keep this total doubt going for long. The world around them won’t let them—they have feelings, desires, and life’s pressures. Their sad, doubtful mood fades, and no matter how hard they try, they can’t keep pretending to be a skeptic for very long. Why would they put themselves through that? This is something they can never fully agree with, if they really stick to being skeptical. So, overall, the ideas of the ancient Pyrrhonian skeptics seem pretty ridiculous if they really tried to be completely doubtful all the time, as their schools taught them, instead of just sometimes.

Looking at this, the Stoics and Pyrrhonians, who were always arguing against each other, actually have a lot in common. Both seem to believe wrongly that if a person can do something sometimes and in some moods, they can do it all the time and in every mood.
