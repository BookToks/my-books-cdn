Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746) was a professor who believed that people have a "moral sense," kind of like how we can see colors or taste flavors. He argued against Hobbes by saying that humans don’t always act selfishly but have natural feelings of kindness. Doing good things makes us feel happy and approved, which is where the moral sense comes from. Hutcheson also had ideas about beauty, and it’s likely that his thoughts influenced the young philosopher Hume. A famous Hume expert, Norman Kemp Smith, even thought Hutcheson inspired Hume’s main idea that we rely on feelings more than logic, even when learning about knowledge.

In one of Hutcheson’s books from 1728, he talks about how the soul works. He says Reason and Will are the most important parts, with our Senses below Reason, and our Passions below Will. Reason’s job is to understand things before we want or decide anything. This matches what Hume said about Reason being the part that helps us tell what is true or false.

Joseph Butler (1692–1752) was a religious leader known for his book The Analogy of Religion (1736). Hume liked Butler’s work even though they didn’t always agree. Hume wanted Butler to think well of him, so he took out his most controversial religious ideas from his own book.

The note about Butler talks about an idea from one of his sermons on loving others. Hume’s take is a bit tricky, but the main idea is that acting selfishly means trying to satisfy some desire—like wanting food, money, success, friendship, or even caring for someone else. So, selfish actions actually depend on other desires besides just self-interest. That means not all desires are selfish; some are kind and caring. Both Butler and Hume agree that people naturally feel connected to others and care about their well-being.
