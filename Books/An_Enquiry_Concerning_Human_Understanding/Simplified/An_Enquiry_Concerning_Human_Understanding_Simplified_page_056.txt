I agree with Beauchamp’s basic editing ideas and methods, like checking the 1777 text to see if the author made any last changes. But I chose to go back to the 1777 edition because Hume himself was happy with his final edits (like removing Section III), and because there hasn’t been a really reliable version of that edition published before.

So, this text sticks closely to the 1777 edition, with very few changes except where I explain them below. My goal was not to create a critical edition but to make a completely accurate version since the only other true copy is a very expensive facsimile. Because of this, even Hume’s original mistakes, like different spellings or capitalization differences (like between the table of contents and chapter titles), are kept because they might interest scholars and readers.

I also kept the wording of the running headers the same, but I updated the font style to match the chapter headings and took out the full stops at the end. I also removed the full stops that were originally after all the headings inside the text.

I only made three real changes where it was clear there were typos, and I could check other editions to fix them. These fixes were adding “[is]” in note 3.3 n. 6, adding “[and]” in endnote [B], and changing “reasonings” to “reasoning” in the first line of endnote [H]. I prepared my text using the 1777 edition from the Brotherton Library at the University of Leeds and also checked it against the facsimile edition published by Thoemmes Press in 2002.

About Hume’s notes: In his editions, both footnotes and endnotes use symbols like * for the first note on each page, then †, ‡, and § as needed (for example, in paragraph 3 of Section III). Since these symbols aren’t used or referenced much in later writings and don’t mean anything else, I replaced them with numbers. This change matches the footnote numbering in Beauchamp’s critical edition.
