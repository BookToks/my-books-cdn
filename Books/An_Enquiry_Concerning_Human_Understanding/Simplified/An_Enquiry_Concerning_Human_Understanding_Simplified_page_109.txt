When we try to understand how the human mind works step by step, we can feel pretty good about what we learn. But nature soon stops us from finding out the real reasons behind things, and we have to admit we don’t know everything. The main problem with getting better at moral or metaphysical sciences is that the ideas are unclear and the words are confusing. In math, the biggest challenge is that it takes a long time and a lot of thinking to reach any conclusion. In natural science, progress is often slowed down because we don’t always have the right experiments or examples to study. These examples sometimes only show up by chance and can be hard to find, even if we look carefully. Since moral philosophy has improved less than geometry or physics, it seems like the problems in moral philosophy need more skill and effort to overcome.

Some ideas in metaphysics, like power, force, energy, or necessary connection, are very unclear and uncertain. But we need to talk about them all the time. So, in this part, we will try to clearly explain what these words really mean. This might help make this kind of philosophy less confusing.

It seems pretty obvious that all our ideas come from our experiences or feelings. In other words, we can’t think about anything unless we have felt it first, either through our senses or inside ourselves.

I have tried to explain and prove this idea and hope that using it the right way will help people think more clearly and accurately in philosophy than they have before. Complex ideas might be easier to understand by defining them, which means listing all the simple ideas that make them up.

But even after defining things down to the simplest ideas, if some confusion still remains, what should we do next?
