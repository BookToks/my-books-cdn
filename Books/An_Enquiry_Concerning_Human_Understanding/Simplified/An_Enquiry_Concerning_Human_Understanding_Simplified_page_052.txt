Locke thinks that when we see things, there are two kinds of qualities: primary and secondary. Primary qualities, like length, movement, and how solid something is, are actually in the objects themselves and match up with how we imagine them. Secondary qualities, like how hard something feels, its temperature, or color, aren’t really in the objects but depend on how we perceive them. But Hume agrees with Berkeley that even our ideas about primary qualities come from secondary ones. For example, we understand the size of an area because we see it in different colors compared to what's around it. So, if we try to think of an object without any of the qualities we sense, we end up with just a confusing, unknown thing that causes our perceptions, which is so unclear that no serious doubter would bother arguing about it.

One big point from this is that trying to understand the true nature of physical objects—something many religious philosophers have tried to do—is impossible.

In the second part of Section XII, Hume talks about doubting our ability to reason, starting with tricky problems about dividing things forever. He explains these problems and seems to agree with them, but he also suggests there might be a way to avoid these confusing ideas by using a different way of thinking about general ideas, which he explains more in another book.

Then, Hume talks about doubting how we use facts to reason. He rejects a popular extreme version of skepticism that says our mistakes mean all reasoning from experience is useless. He says that while these doubts might work in schools, when we face real life and strong feelings, those doubts disappear like smoke.

Hume also talks about a more serious kind of skepticism about reasoning from experience, which he explains in an earlier section. This argument can also be seen as too extreme if it tries to make us stop believing anything at all. But luckily, humans are naturally too strong in their nature to actually stop believing anything, which helps us survive.
