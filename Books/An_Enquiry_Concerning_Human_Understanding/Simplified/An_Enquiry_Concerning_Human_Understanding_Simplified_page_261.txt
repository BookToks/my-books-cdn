Notes to Pages 70–77 197  
8.27 Necessity . . . cause: Hume reminds us of his two definitions from earlier in 7.29.  

8.28 All laws . . . mind: Here, Hume starts to argue that determinism (the idea that everything happens for a reason) isn’t against morality, but actually needed for it. See pages xlvii–xlviii of the Introduction.  

8.32 no indifference; no liberty: ‘Indifference’ means actions that aren’t caused by anything and can’t be predicted, like some things in quantum physics. The person Hume imagines thinks free will means we must have this kind of unpredictable freedom. They say we aren’t truly free unless our actions aren’t determined. But Hume and others who believe in compatibilism say that random actions aren’t really free because they’re just chance, so we can’t be held responsible for them. (Earlier, Hume used ‘liberty’ to mean indifference, which made things confusing.)  

8.32 train: This means a line of gunpowder that leads to a hidden store of explosives. When the gunpowder is lit, it causes the big explosion, usually to blow down a castle wall or something similar.  

8.34 the ancient Stoics: See the Glossarial Index for more info.  

8.34 malignant humours: In old medicine, people thought diseases came from bad fluids in the body like blood, bile, and phlegm.  

8.35 sentiment of approbation or blame: Hume builds his ideas about right and wrong on feelings of approval or blame. Here he shows how this fits with free will and moral responsibility. See page xlviii of the Introduction.  

8.36 These are mysteries: Hume uses mystery to seem traditional, but he also points out how hard the Problem of Evil is for belief in God.  

8.36 To reconcile . . . prescience: If things aren’t determined, how can God know the future?  

8.36 to defend . . . sin: If everything, including sin, is caused by God’s laws, how can God be perfectly good? See Section 4 of the Introduction for more on this.  

SECTION IX  
9.1 ANALOGY: Hume starts by talking about analogical reasoning (comparing things based on similarities). He will use this later in Section XI. See Section 15 of the Introduction.  

9.2 the hare in her doubles: When a hare is chased by dogs, it often suddenly changes direction. A dog that expects this can use it to catch the hare.
