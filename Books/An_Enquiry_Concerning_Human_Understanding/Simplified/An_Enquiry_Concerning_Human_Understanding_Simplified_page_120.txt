The main use of all science is to help us understand how to control and predict what will happen next by knowing what causes it. We are always thinking about how things cause other things to happen. But our ideas about cause and effect are not very clear, so it’s hard to give a perfect definition of what a cause really is except by using something outside of it.

From what we’ve seen, a cause can be defined as something that is followed by something else, and every time something like the first thing happens, something like the second thing happens too. Or, in other words, if the first thing didn’t happen, the second thing wouldn’t happen either. When we see a cause, our mind automatically thinks about the effect because we are used to seeing them together.

So, another way to define a cause is something that always makes us think about what comes next. But even with these definitions, we still can’t explain exactly what inside the cause connects it to the effect. We don’t really understand this connection or even know what we’re trying to understand when we try to think about it.

For example, when we say that the vibration of a string causes a sound, what do we really mean? We either mean that this vibration is always followed by this sound, or that when we see the vibration, our mind automatically expects the sound. We can look at cause and effect in these two ways, but we don’t have any other clear idea about it.

To sum up, every idea we have comes from something we have experienced before. If we can’t find an experience behind an idea, then that idea doesn’t really exist. When things happen one time, there is nothing that shows us any power or necessary connection between them. But when the same thing happens many times, and the same result always follows, then we start to form ideas about cause and effect.
