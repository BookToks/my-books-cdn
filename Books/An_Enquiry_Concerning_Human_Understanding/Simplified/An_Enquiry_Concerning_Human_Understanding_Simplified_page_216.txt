Philo said that regular people, who don’t know much about science or deep thinking, often don’t respect philosophy because they see how much smart people argue. Because of that, they stick even more strongly to the religious ideas they were taught.

But when people start to study and think a bit, they see some evidence for new and strange ideas, and they believe nothing is too hard for human reason. They boldly challenge old beliefs and disrespect the most sacred ideas.

However, after we move past ignorance, there is still one way to stop this disrespect. We need to realize how weak, limited, and blind human reason really is. We should understand that our thinking is uncertain and full of contradictions, even about everyday things.

We must remember that our senses can deceive us, that the basic ideas in all systems have huge problems, and that there are contradictions in ideas like matter, cause and effect, space, time, and motion. In short, even the one science that seems sure about anything—math—deals with tricky concepts that aren’t always certain.
