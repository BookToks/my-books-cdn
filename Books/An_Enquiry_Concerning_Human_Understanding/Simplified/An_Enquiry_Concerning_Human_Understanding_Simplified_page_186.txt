For example, limits and rules in government are important. Reason tells us that people are not perfect and can’t be trusted with unlimited power. History and experience show us that when people have too much power, they often abuse it because of ambition.

This idea of using both reason and experience is true in all parts of life. Experts like politicians, doctors, or businesspeople are trusted because they have experience. Beginners, even if smart, are often ignored. Reason can help us guess what might happen, but experience is needed to be sure and make strong rules.

Even though many people believe this, I think it’s actually wrong or at least too simple.

If you look closely at arguments from science or other areas, you’ll see that they end with general ideas based on experience and observation. The difference is that some ideas need thinking and reflection to understand why they happen, while others come directly from seeing the same event again and again. For example, knowing about bad rulers like Tiberius or Nero makes us afraid of a king with no rules. Seeing a lie or cruelty in everyday life also helps us understand that people can’t always be trusted. Both cases rely on experience to draw conclusions.

No one is so young or inexperienced that they haven’t learned some important lessons about life from watching what happens around them. But when we try to use these lessons, we often make mistakes until we get more experience and learn how to apply them properly. Every situation has many small details that even very smart people can miss at first, but those details are very important for making good decisions.
