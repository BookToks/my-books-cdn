Custom is the rule that helps us connect ideas and understand the world. It is very important for people to live and behave properly in every situation. If seeing one thing didn’t make us think of other related things, all we would know is what we remember or sense right now. We wouldn’t be able to plan or use our abilities to do good or avoid bad things. People who like to think about why things happen have a lot to be amazed by here.

I will add more proof for this idea. The way our mind guesses that similar causes will make similar effects is very important for everyone. It’s unlikely that we could depend on slow thinking and reasoning for this, because reasoning doesn’t work well when we are babies, and even when we grow up, it often makes mistakes.

It makes more sense that nature gave us an instinct or automatic way of thinking that never fails. This instinct shows up as soon as we start to think and doesn’t need careful reasoning. Just like nature taught us how to use our bodies without explaining muscles and nerves, it gave us an instinct that helps our thoughts follow the way things happen outside, even though we don’t understand the forces behind them.
