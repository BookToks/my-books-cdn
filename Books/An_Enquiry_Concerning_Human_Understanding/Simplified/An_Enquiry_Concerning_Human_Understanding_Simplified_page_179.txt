Philosophy can be really confusing, making it hard for someone to be sure about anything.

When it comes to time, the ideas get even stranger. The idea that time is made up of an endless number of tiny parts, one after another, seems like a clear contradiction. You’d think no one with a normal mind would believe that.

But even with these confusing ideas, our minds keep searching for answers and can’t stay calm. It’s hard to understand how a clear idea can also have parts that go against itself or other clear ideas. This kind of doubt is very confusing and strange, even more than other kinds of skepticism, especially when it comes from complex subjects like math or measurements.

People question what we know about facts in two main ways: from everyday experience or from philosophical thinking. Everyday doubts come from how weak our understanding can be, the different opinions people have had over time, how our thoughts change when we’re sick or healthy, young or old, happy or sad, and how even one person's opinions can change. These doubts aren’t very strong because in real life, we constantly use reasoning about facts to get by. 

The biggest challenge to extreme doubt or skepticism is actually doing things and living life. These ideas about doubt might work well in school or theory, but once we face real situations and emotions, other stronger parts of human nature take over and prove those doubts wrong.
