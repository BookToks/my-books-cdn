Section XI talks about ideas about God’s plan and life after death. Most of the argument is shown through a character called ‘a friend who loves tricky questions’. Hume does this so he can talk about his ideas without directly saying them. Back then, many people used the Design Argument to prove God exists. It was the most popular way to argue about God.

Hume’s main point is that this argument can’t prove there is a being with better qualities—like more power, wisdom, or kindness—than what we see in the world. So, we can’t say God exists just by looking at the world and then guess more things about God, like there being an afterlife where good people get rewarded and bad people punished.

Like in the previous section, Hume is thinking about what happens when we base what we know on experience and observations. Some believers, called ‘experimental theists,’ say their belief in God is based on science and facts, not just guesswork or special messages from God. They think they can figure out causes from effects in the world.

Hume argues that these believers use imagination to help their reasoning. They assume that a better world would come from perfect beings like gods, but they forget that they only know what these beings are like based on what they see in the world now. 

Hume also points out a rule: the causes we guess should match the effects we see. He reminds us that the strength of an argument depends on how similar the things we compare are. For example, guessing what gods want based on what humans want isn’t very strong because gods and humans are very different.
