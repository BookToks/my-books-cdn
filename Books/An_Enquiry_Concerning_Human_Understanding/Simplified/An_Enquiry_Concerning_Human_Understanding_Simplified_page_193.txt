Back then in France, everyone knew about Mons. Heraut, the police lieutenant. People talked a lot about how sharp, active, and well-informed he was. Because of his job, he had almost total control and was given full power to stop or disprove these miracles. He often caught and questioned the witnesses and people involved, but he never found anything clear against them.

In the case of Mademoiselle Thibaut, the famous DeSylva was sent to check her out. His report is very interesting. The doctor said she couldn’t have been as sick as people said because she recovered too fast. He used common sense and natural reasons. But the other side said it was a miracle, and his own report actually proved that.

The Molinists were in a tough spot. They couldn’t say that human proof was useless for showing a miracle. Instead, they claimed these miracles were caused by witchcraft and the devil. But people said that was just what the Jews used to say a long time ago.

No Jansenist ever had trouble explaining why the miracles stopped when the king closed the graveyard. They said the miracle happened because people touched the tomb, and since no one could get close anymore, no miracles could happen. God could’ve knocked down the walls easily, but He chooses when and how to work, and it’s not for us to question. God didn’t break down every city wall like Jericho or free every prisoner like Saint Paul.

A very important man, the Duke de Chatillon, who was a high-ranking noble in France, witnessed a miracle cure on one of his servants who had been sick for years.

I’ll finish by saying that no priests are known for living better or stricter lives than the regular priests in France, especially the pastors in Paris, who all say these miracles were fake.

The intelligence, talent, and honesty of the gentlemen, and the strictness of the nuns at Port-Royal, were famous all over Europe.

Yet, they all agreed that a miracle happened to the niece of the famous Pascal, who was known for her holy life and great mind. The famous writer Racine told the story of this miracle in his well-known history of Port Royal, backing it up with proof from many nuns, priests, doctors, and respectable people. Some scholars, especially the bishop of Tournay, believed this miracle was so real that they used it to argue against atheists and free thinkers.
