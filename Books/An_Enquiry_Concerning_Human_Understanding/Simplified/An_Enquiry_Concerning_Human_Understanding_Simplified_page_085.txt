Doubts About Knowing Nature 21 [9] To understand that all the laws of nature and how things work are only known through experience, think about this: If someone showed you something and asked you to guess what would happen without using past experience, how would your mind figure it out?

Your mind would have to make up or imagine some result for that thing. And it’s clear that this guess would be completely random.

No matter how closely you look, you can’t find the effect just by examining the cause. The effect is totally different from the cause, so it can’t be found inside it. For example, when one billiard ball hits another, the second ball moves, which is a totally different event from the first ball’s movement. Nothing about the first ball’s motion tells you for sure that the second will move. Or think about a stone or metal piece held up in the air and then dropped. Before it falls, is there anything in its position that tells you it will move down instead of up or in some other direction?

[10] Since the first guess about what will happen in nature is random without experience, the idea that the cause and effect are connected and that only one result can happen also has to be a guess.

For example, if I see a billiard ball rolling straight toward another, and I accidentally think the second ball will move after they touch, can’t I also imagine many other things happening? Maybe both balls stay still, or the first ball bounces back, or it jumps off the second ball in any direction. All these ideas make sense and can be imagined. So why should I believe one over the others? Using reason alone can’t prove which one is right.

[11] In short, every effect is a different event from its cause.

So, it can’t be found inside the cause, and the first idea about it before seeing it has to be random. Even after we guess the effect, the link between cause and effect still seems random because many other results seem just as possible and natural when we think about them.
