So, will Philo, who is really open-minded and knows a lot, have any big doubts about the idea of religion? This idea is based on simple and clear reasons, and unless something gets in the way, it’s easy for people to believe.

PART II...

To get straight to the point, said Cleanthes, talking to Demea, I’ll quickly explain how I see this.

Look around the world: think about everything and every part of it. You’ll see it’s like one huge machine, made up of tons of smaller machines, which themselves have even smaller parts, too small for us to fully understand. All these machines and parts fit together perfectly, which amazes anyone who has ever thought about it. The way everything in nature works together is just like, but even better than, things made by humans using their brains and skills.

Because these results are so similar, we can guess by comparing them that the causes are alike too. The person who made nature is kind of like a human mind, but way smarter and more powerful, matching how big and amazing the world is. This way of thinking, called the argument a posteriori, is the only way we prove that a God exists and that He is like a human mind and intelligence.

I’ll be honest, Cleanthes, said Demea, I never agreed with your idea that God is like humans, and I don’t like the way you try to prove it either. What! No clear proof that God exists? No logical arguments from the start? Can we only rely on experience and guesswork?

...

...what bothers you most, I see, said Philo to Demea, is how Cleanthes explained the argument a posteriori.

Even though I don’t agree with some of Cleanthes’ risky ideas, I have to admit he explained that argument fairly. I’ll try to explain it so you won’t have any more doubts about it.
