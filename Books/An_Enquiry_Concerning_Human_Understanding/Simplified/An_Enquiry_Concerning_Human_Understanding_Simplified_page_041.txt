If we felt like there was a necessary connection between A and B, then we could know for sure that A causes B without needing any experience. But we can’t know that without experience. So, it means we don’t actually feel any necessary connection between them.

Since this feeling can’t come from our senses, Hume thinks maybe it comes from thinking about how our mind works or how our will makes things happen. But he says that’s not true either. He looks at how our will moves our body and how it helps us think, and shows that we only know these things from experience.

After this, Hume stops looking for this feeling of necessity and instead criticizes Malebranche’s idea called occasionalism. Malebranche said only God really has power because we can’t understand power in objects. Hume jokingly suggests this idea might come from old superstitions. Then he gives two reasons why it’s wrong: first, it’s too strange to believe, and second, if you use their own logic, it means even God’s power can’t be understood, which doesn’t make sense.

Even though Hume hasn’t found the feeling of necessary connection he’s looking for, his arguments still do something important. He challenges the basic idea of Cartesian science, which says we can clearly understand how nature works. Hume says we can’t really understand how cause and effect happens—not even how God causes things.

We can’t understand how billiard balls hit each other and move, how the mind controls the body, or even how any mind controls itself.

Because we can’t understand these things, it means we don’t actually see the necessity that’s supposed to control them.

All of these things are just as confusing and unclear—they are not “clear and distinct” at all.
