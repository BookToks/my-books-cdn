We can’t figure out any event or cause without watching and experiencing it first.

That’s why no smart and humble thinker has ever said they know the ultimate cause of anything in nature or exactly how the power that creates effects works. The best human reason can do is to make natural events simpler to understand by connecting many effects to a few general causes, using comparisons, experience, and observation. But trying to find the causes behind those general causes is useless; we will never fully explain them. These basic causes are completely hidden from us.

Things like elasticity, gravity, parts sticking together, and motion being passed on by impact are probably the deepest causes we can ever find. We should feel lucky if we can trace events back to these ideas. The best natural philosophy only delays our ignorance a bit, just like the best moral or metaphysical philosophy only reveals how much we don’t know. Realizing how little we understand is what philosophy always shows us, no matter how hard we try to avoid it.

Even using geometry with natural philosophy can’t fix this problem or help us find ultimate causes, no matter how precise the reasoning is. Math that mixes with nature assumes certain natural laws exist and uses abstract thinking to help find these laws or figure out their effects in specific cases involving exact distances and amounts. For example, we know from experience that the force of a moving body depends on its size and speed, and that a small force can move a big obstacle if we can increase its speed enough using machines or tricks.
