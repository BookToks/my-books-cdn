When we see the same event happen again and again, we start to think about cause and connection. We then feel a new kind of idea, which is the usual link in our mind between one thing and what normally happens with it. This feeling is where the idea we are looking for comes from.

This idea comes from many similar events, not just one. So, it must come from what these many events have that a single event does not. The only thing that is different is this usual connection or the way our imagination moves from one thing to the next. Everything else is the same.

For example, the first time we saw one billiard ball hit another and make it move, it looked just like any other time it happens. The only difference was that at first, we couldn’t predict that one ball would move after the other hit it. But now, after seeing it happen many times, we can.

I don’t know if the reader will easily understand this idea. I worry that if I say more or explain it in different ways, it might become more confusing. When it comes to tricky ideas, there is one way of looking at them that helps the most. If we find that way, it helps us understand better than any fancy words or long explanations. We should try to find that clear view and save the fancy language for things that need it more.
