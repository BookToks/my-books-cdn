Both of these ideas are really silly and disrespectful, so the main belief they come from can’t be true either, because it has the same problems. If an idea leads to a ridiculous result, that shows the original idea must be wrong—just like if a crime happens, the cause of that crime is also to blame if the connection is clear and unavoidable.

This argument has two parts, which we will look at one by one. First, if every human action is caused by God in a necessary way, then those actions can’t be bad because God is perfect and only wants good things. Second, if those actions are bad, then we have to say God isn’t perfect and accepts being the reason for all the bad things people do.

The answer to the first part seems clear and believable. Many thinkers have studied nature carefully and believe that the whole universe is organized perfectly with kindness. They say that, in the end, all creatures will be as happy as possible, without any real or total suffering. They think that every physical problem is part of this kind system and even God couldn’t remove these problems without causing something worse or losing some greater good that comes from them.

Some philosophers, including the old Stoics, used this idea to help people feel better during hard times. They told their students that the bad things they went through were actually good for the world, and that if you looked at the big picture, every event would make you happy. But even though this sounds impressive and inspiring, it didn’t really work in real life. Imagine trying to calm someone who has a painful disease by telling them how the laws of nature that caused their pain are actually fair and right. That would probably make them more upset. These big ideas might make a calm and safe person feel a little better for a short time, but they don’t stick in the mind, especially when someone is in pain or upset.
