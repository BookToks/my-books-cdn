When we feel sorry for Eve, it helps us also feel sorry for Adam. Our feelings stay strong because Adam is closely connected to Eve. But if the poet suddenly changes the story to someone completely different, it feels strange and hard to care about the new person. It takes time to start caring again, and when the story goes back to the main characters, it feels like starting over. This also happens when the poet talks about events that are too far apart or only loosely connected, making it harder to keep strong feelings throughout the story.

Because of this, poets use a trick called “oblique narration,” like in the Odyssey and Aeneid. They start the story near the important events and later explain what happened earlier. This way, readers get curious right away. The story moves fast and the events connect closely, keeping us interested and making our feelings grow from start to finish.

The same idea works in plays. You can’t just add a new character who doesn’t really connect to the main ones. If you do, the audience loses interest because the emotions don’t flow smoothly. When the story jumps to something unrelated, it breaks the feeling and makes it hard to care. Instead of building on feelings from one scene to the next, we have to get interested all over again, which ruins the excitement.

Looking at history and epic poetry, both need unity to work well. In history, events are connected by cause and effect, just like in epic poems. But epic poems need these connections to be stronger and clearer because they want to excite our imaginations and emotions more deeply.
