Geometry helps us use this law by giving us the right sizes and shapes for all the parts and figures that can be part of any kind of machine. But the discovery of the law itself comes only from experience, and no amount of thinking alone could have taught us about it. When we think just based on ideas and not on what we see or observe, we can’t come up with the idea of an effect or understand the strong connection between cause and effect. It would take a very clever person to figure out just by thinking that heat makes crystals and cold makes ice without having seen these things happen before.

PART II

We still don’t have a clear answer to the first question we asked. Every answer just creates another question that is just as hard, leading us to keep asking more. When we ask, “What is the nature of all our reasoning about facts?” the best answer seems to be that it’s based on the relationship between cause and effect. Then, when we ask, “What is the foundation of all our reasoning about that relationship?” the answer is simple: Experience. But if we keep asking, “What is the foundation of all conclusions from experience?” this is an even harder question to answer.

Philosophers who think they know everything have a tough time when they meet curious people who keep asking questions from every direction, eventually cornering them. The best way to avoid getting confused is to be humble about what we know and even admit the difficulties ourselves before others point them out. This way, we can make our ignorance seem like a kind of strength.

In this part, I will keep things simple and only give a negative answer to the question. I say that even after we have experience with cause and effect, our conclusions from that experience are not based on reasoning or any mental process. We need to explain and defend this answer.
