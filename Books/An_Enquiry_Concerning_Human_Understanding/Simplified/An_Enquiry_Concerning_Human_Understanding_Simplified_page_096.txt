That something is called Custom or Habit. When we do something over and over, we get a habit of doing it again without thinking or reasoning about it. We say this habit is caused by Custom. Using this word doesn’t explain exactly why this happens, but it points to a basic human truth that everyone agrees with and sees in real life. Maybe we can’t find the reason behind this reason, but we accept Custom as the basic cause of all our conclusions from experience. It’s enough to understand this much, even if our minds can’t go further.

For example, after always seeing heat with flames or weight with solidity, we expect one when we see the other just because of Custom. This idea is the only one that explains why we can learn from many examples but not from just one, even if that one example is exactly like the others. Reason alone can’t explain this. Reasoning about one circle gives the same result as reasoning about all circles in the world. But if someone only saw one object move when pushed, they couldn’t say every object will move the same way. So, all learning from experience comes from Custom, not reason.
