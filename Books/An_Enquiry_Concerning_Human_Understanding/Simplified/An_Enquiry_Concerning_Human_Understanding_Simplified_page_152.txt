Every miracle in these religions (and they all have lots of miracles) is meant to prove that particular religion is true. At the same time, it also indirectly tries to show that other religions are false. When one religion's miracle proves its system, it also hurts the belief in the miracles of other religions.

Because of this, all the amazing stories from different religions go against each other. The proof for these miracles, whether strong or weak, also conflicts with each other. So, when we believe a miracle from Muhammad or his followers, we're trusting the word of a few Arab people from long ago.

On the other hand, we also have to trust the writers like Titus Livius, Plutarch, Tacitus, and many others from Greek, Chinese, and Roman Catholic backgrounds who told their own miracle stories. We have to treat their stories just like we would if they had said the miracle from Muhammad was false, with the same certainty as they have for their own miracles.

This way of thinking might seem too complicated, but it’s really just like how a judge thinks. If two witnesses say someone did a crime, but two other witnesses say that person was far away at the same time, the judge won’t believe the crime happened.

One of the most believable miracles in history is from Tacitus, who told about Vespasian. Vespasian healed a blind man in Alexandria by spitting on him and made a lame man walk by just touching his foot. This happened because of a vision from the god Serapis, who told people to go to the Emperor for healing.

You can read this story in the work of that great historian, where every detail makes the story even more believable. It could be explained more fully with strong arguments, but no one today tries to prove the truth of that old and false religion. Vespasian was a serious and honest emperor who lived a long time ago and spent his life around important people.
