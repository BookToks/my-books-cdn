His famous idea, “I think, therefore I am,” is used to show that the mind’s way of understanding things clearly and logically is very reliable. He also says that the mind’s main job is thinking. He wants to avoid doubt by proving that God exists. He does this by using his own idea of a perfect being and some basic rules about causes, like the idea that everything must have a cause that is at least as perfect as the thing itself. Once he proves that a perfect and honest creator exists, he says human minds can be trusted if we use them correctly. This supports studying the world through science, using our senses and natural judgment instead of just relying on old traditions.

Descartes was really interested in science. For example, he was the first to fully explain how rainbows work. He also created analytic geometry, which means turning geometry problems into algebra problems, using what we now call Cartesian coordinates. He suggested that blood moves through the body in a circle, which went against older ideas. He also agreed with Copernicus and Galileo that the Earth moves around the Sun. For more about Descartes’s ideas about matter, see section 2 of the Introduction above.

Descartes is mentioned twice in the Enquiry, along with the group of thinkers who followed his ideas (7.25 endnote [D], 12.3). Another important thinker from that time, Nicolas Malebranche (1638–1715), is also mentioned twice (1.4, 7.25 endnote [D]). Malebranche’s “occasionalist” theory is criticized in detail in 7.21–25. For a short explanation of his theory and arguments, see section 6 of the Introduction.

Some of Hume’s own arguments in Section VII of the Enquiry, where he says we can’t actually see cause and effect happening, remind us of Malebranche’s ideas.

Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), the first major English philosopher, had a big but unspoken influence on Hume. Hobbes is still important today as a political thinker. He wanted to explain people scientifically, based on ideas about the physical world, feelings, and natural laws. Hume’s Treatise has a similar structure, and you can see clear influences from Hobbes in Section VIII of the Enquiry (see section 4 of the Introduction above). Here, Hume argues for a view that fits with Hobbes’s idea: we can understand human behavior as part of a scientific and determined system.
