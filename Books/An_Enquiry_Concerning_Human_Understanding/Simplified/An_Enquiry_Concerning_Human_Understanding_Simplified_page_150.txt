People know so much about this that smart people don’t pay attention to these stories unless there’s strong proof. Don’t the same feelings, and even stronger ones, make most people believe and share all kinds of religious miracle stories with a lot of confidence?

Also, it’s a good reason to doubt all supernatural and miracle stories that they mostly come from uneducated and uncivilized groups. If a more advanced society believes them, it’s usually because they got these stories from their uneducated ancestors, who passed them down as absolute truth. When we read old histories from any country, it feels like we’re in a totally different world, where nature works in weird ways. Wars, disasters, and death don’t happen for normal reasons like today. Strange signs, predictions, and punishments cover up the few natural events in the stories. But as you read more recent history, these strange stories become fewer. You realize there’s nothing mysterious or supernatural going on—it’s just that people love amazing stories. Even though thinking like this can be challenged by knowledge and reason, it never really goes away in humans.

A careful reader might wonder why such amazing events don’t happen today. But it’s not weird that people have lied throughout history. You’ve probably heard plenty of unbelievable stories that wise people laughed at and ordinary people eventually stopped believing. Those huge false stories that spread so much started the same way. They just grew bigger because the conditions were right, becoming almost as unbelievable as the stories themselves.

It was smart of the fake prophet Alexander, who was famous once but is forgotten now, to start his tricks in Paphlagonia, where people were really uneducated and easy to fool. People far away, who think these miracles are worth checking out, don’t get better information and just believe the lies.
