I got an invitation from General St. Clair to join him as a secretary for his expedition. At first, it was supposed to be against Canada, but it ended up being a trip to the coast of France.

The next year, in 1747, the General asked me again to come with him as his secretary for a military mission to the courts of Vienna and Turin. I wore an officer’s uniform and was introduced as the general’s aid-de-camp, along with Sir Harry Erskine and Captain Grant, who is now General Grant. These two years were the only real breaks I had from studying in my life. I enjoyed them and the company I kept. Because I was careful with money, I saved up nearly a thousand pounds, which I called a fortune, even though most of my friends didn’t take me seriously.

I always thought my failure to succeed with my book, the Treatise of Human Nature, was because of how I wrote it, not what I wrote about. I realized I had rushed it to print too soon. So I rewrote the first part into a new book called An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, which I published while I was in Turin. But this book didn’t do much better than the first one. When I came back from Italy, I was disappointed to see that England was all excited about Dr. Middleton’s Free Enquiry, while my book was ignored.

A new edition of my Essays, moral and political, didn’t get much attention either.

Because of my natural calmness, these failures didn’t bother me much. In 1749, I moved to live with my brother at his country house since my mother had died. There, I wrote the second part of my Essays, called Political Discourses, and also my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, which was another part of my Treatise rewritten. Meanwhile, my bookseller, A. Millar, told me that my earlier books (except the Treatise) were starting to get noticed. More people were buying them, and new editions were being printed. Several replies came out from important clergymen, and Dr. Warburton’s harsh comments showed me that my books were becoming respected. But I decided firmly never to reply to anyone, and since I’m not quick to anger, I avoided getting into any public arguments. These signs that I was gaining respect encouraged me because I always tried to see the positive side of things. I think it’s better to have that mindset than to be born rich with a big inheritance.
