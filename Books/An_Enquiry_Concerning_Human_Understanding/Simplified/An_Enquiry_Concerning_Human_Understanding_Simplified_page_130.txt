The same prisoner, when taken to the place of execution, knows for sure he will die—not just because the guards won’t let him escape, but also because of the actions of the executioner. His mind thinks through a clear series of events: the soldiers won’t help him run away; the executioner will act; his head and body will be separated; he will bleed, twitch, and then die. This is a natural chain of causes and actions, but his mind doesn’t see any difference between them. He feels as certain about what will happen as if it were something he could remember or see happening right now.

This connection between things affects the mind the same way, whether the things are reasons, choices, and actions, or shapes and movements. We can call them by different names, but their nature and how they affect our understanding never change.

If a man I know to be honest and rich, and who is my close friend, comes into my house where my servants are, I’m sure he won’t stab me to steal my silver inkstand before he leaves. I don’t even worry about this more than I worry about my strong, new house suddenly falling down. But maybe he suddenly goes crazy. Just like an earthquake might suddenly shake and collapse my house. So, I change my thoughts. I say I’m certain he won’t put his hand into the fire and hold it there until it’s burned. I’m as sure about this as I am that if he jumps out the window and nothing stops him, he won’t stay floating in the air. No sudden madness could make him do something so against all human nature. A man who leaves a purse full of gold on the street in a busy place like Charing Cross can’t expect it to just fly away like a feather or still be there after an hour. More than half of our reasoning is like this—making guesses based on what usually happens, with different levels of certainty depending on what we know about how people usually behave.
