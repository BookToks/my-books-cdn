But all his arguments, even if meant differently, are really just full of doubt because they can’t be answered and don’t convince anyone.

Their only result is to cause a brief feeling of surprise, confusion, and not knowing what to believe, which is what happens when you’re skeptical.

No matter what arguments there are about math,* we have to agree that there are physical points; that means tiny parts of space that can’t be divided or made smaller, either by looking or imagining. These images we see or picture are absolutely indivisible, so mathematicians must admit they are much smaller than any real part of space. Yet it’s very clear to reason that an infinite number of these make up an infinite space. Even more so for those tiny parts of space that are still thought to be infinitely divisible.*

It seems possible to avoid these confusing ideas if we accept that there are no real abstract or general ideas. Instead, all general ideas are actually specific ones linked to a general word,* which reminds us of other specific ones that look similar in some way. For example, when we hear the word Horse, we picture a black or white animal of a certain size or shape. But since the word is also used for horses of other colors, shapes, and sizes, these pictures, though not actually in our mind, can be easily remembered. Our thinking and conclusions work as if they were really there. If this is true (which seems reasonable), then all ideas about quantity that mathematicians use are just specific ones suggested by our senses and imagination, so they can’t be divided infinitely. It’s enough to mention this idea now without going deeper. Anyone who loves science should avoid making conclusions that make them look silly or foolish,* and this seems like the easiest way to solve these problems.

That old idea from ancient philosophy, Ex nihilo, nihil fit,* which means nothing can come from nothing and so matter can’t be created, stops being true according to this philosophy. Not only can the will of the supreme Being create matter, but for all we know, the will of any other being or any cause, no matter how strange we imagine, could create it too.
