I went through school successfully and became really interested in literature early on. This love for books has been the main thing I enjoy in life. Because I was serious, hardworking, and focused, my family thought law would be a good career for me. But I didn’t like law at all. Instead, I wanted to study philosophy and learn about many things. While my family thought I was studying legal books, I was actually reading authors like Cicero and Virgil.

I didn’t have much money, which made my plan hard to follow. Also, my health got a little worse because I worked so hard. So, I tried to start a different kind of life. In 1734, I went to Bristol and met some important merchants, but I didn’t like that life. Then I went to France to study quietly in the countryside. There, I made a plan to live very simply to save money, keep my independence, and focus only on improving my skills in literature.

While I was in France, first in Reims and later mostly in La Fleche, I wrote my book, Treatise of Human Nature. After three good years there, I returned to London in 1737. At the end of 1738, I published my Treatise and then went to stay with my mother and brother at his country house. My brother was wisely working on making his money grow.

My Treatise of Human Nature was a total failure. It didn’t get any attention or praise. But because I’m naturally cheerful and hopeful, I quickly got over this and kept studying with great energy in the country. In 1742, I printed the first part of my Essays in Edinburgh. People liked it, and it made me forget all about my earlier failure. I stayed with my mother and brother and also relearned Greek, which I hadn’t studied enough when I was younger.

In 1745, the Marquis of Annandale invited me to live with him in England. His family wanted me to take care of him because he needed help with his health and mind. I lived with him for a year, and the money I earned during that time helped me improve my small savings.
