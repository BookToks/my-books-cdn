These two ideas are very different. I have noticed that whenever this thing happens, a certain effect always follows. I also expect that other things that look similar will cause similar effects. I agree that one idea can be logically connected to the other. In fact, people always assume this connection. But if you say that this connection comes from a step-by-step explanation, I want you to show me that explanation. The link between these ideas isn’t obvious. There needs to be something in the middle that helps the mind make that connection, if it really comes from reasoning. I don’t understand what that middle step is, and it’s up to those who say it exists to explain it. They also have to prove that this is how we learn facts about the world.

Over time, this argument will become very strong if many smart philosophers look into it and no one finds any middle step to support the idea. But since this question is still new, not everyone will trust their own thinking enough to decide that because they can’t find an argument, it doesn’t exist. So, it might be necessary to try something harder: to look at all areas of human knowledge and show that none of them have this kind of argument.

All reasoning can be split into two types: one is demonstrative reasoning, which is about relations between ideas, and the other is moral reasoning, which is about facts and real things. It seems clear there are no demonstrative arguments in this case because it’s not impossible for nature to change. Something that looks like what we’ve seen before might have different or opposite effects. For example, I can imagine a falling object that looks like snow but tastes salty or feels like fire. Or I can imagine all trees growing in winter and dying in summer. These ideas make sense and don’t contradict anything, so no logical proof can show them to be false before we check the real world.
