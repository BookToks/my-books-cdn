First, is there anything in nature more mysterious than how the soul and body work together? The soul is thought to be something spiritual, but it can control the physical body. It’s amazing that our thoughts, which are invisible, can move our bodies, which are made of matter. Even if we could magically move mountains or control planets, that wouldn’t be more surprising or hard to understand. But if we feel any power in our will, we should be able to understand it. We should know how the soul and body connect and how they work together so the soul can make the body move.

Second, we can’t control all parts of our body the same way. We don’t really know why, except from what we see and experience. Why can we move our tongue and fingers with our will, but not our heart or liver? This question wouldn’t confuse us if we actually felt power in some parts and not in others. If we understood the power that makes things move, we would know why it only works on certain body parts and not others.

Third, a person who suddenly can’t move an arm or leg because of illness or injury often tries to move those limbs at first. They feel like they have the power to move them, just like a healthy person does with their working limbs. But our feelings don’t lie. So, in both cases, we are never really aware of any power. We only learn that our will causes movement by seeing what happens. Experience shows us that one thing follows another, but it doesn’t explain the secret connection that links them closely.

Finally, we learn from studying the body that when we move voluntarily, the power doesn’t act directly on the limb itself. Instead, it works through muscles, nerves, and something called animal spirits, or maybe even smaller things we don’t understand yet. This shows that the power behind voluntary movement is not fully known to us. It’s very mysterious and hard to understand.
