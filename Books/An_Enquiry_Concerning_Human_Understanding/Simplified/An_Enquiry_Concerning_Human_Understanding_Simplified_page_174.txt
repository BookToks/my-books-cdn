First, we should start with clear and obvious ideas. We need to move carefully and be sure about each step we take. It’s important to check our conclusions often and think carefully about what they mean. This way, even if progress is slow and small, it’s the only way we can hope to find the truth and be confident in what we decide.

There is another kind of doubt that comes from science and asking questions. Some people think our minds might not work well enough to find real answers about tricky topics. Even our senses—the things we see and hear—are questioned by some philosophers. They doubt everyday ideas just as much as big ideas in philosophy or religion. Since some philosophers believe these strange ideas and others argue against them, it makes us curious to learn what reasons they have.

I don’t need to go over the common reasons skeptics use to doubt what we see. For example, an oar looks bent in water, objects look different depending on how far away they are, or pressing one eye can create double images. These examples show that we can’t always trust our senses completely. Instead, we have to use reason and think about things like how far an object is or how our senses work to figure out what’s really true. But there are other, deeper reasons to doubt our senses that are harder to explain.

It seems clear that people naturally trust their senses without thinking much about it. Even before we start reasoning, we believe there is a real world outside of us that exists whether we or any other living creatures are here to see it or not.
