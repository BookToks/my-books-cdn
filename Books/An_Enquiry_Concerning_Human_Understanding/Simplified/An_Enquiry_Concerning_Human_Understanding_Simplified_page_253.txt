3.3 possible6: Note 5 in Beauchamp’s numbering system talks about text that was left out of the 1777 edition; check the Note on the Text, page lviii, above.

3.3 compleat and entire: In all editions of the Enquiry before 1777, Section III kept discussing how ideas connect to each other, especially in literature. See Textual Variants, pages 178–83.

SECTION IV  
4.1 Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact: This is a difference known as Hume’s Fork. See section 10 of the Introduction, above.

4.1 EUCLID: Euclid was a Greek math genius who lived in Alexandria around 300 BC. His book, Elements, was the main guide for geometry until the 1800s when new types of geometry were found. One famous example Euclid proved is Pythagoras’ Theorem. It says that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the longest side (called the hypotenuse) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. For example, a triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5 meters is right-angled because 3² + 4² = 5².

4.2 The contrary . . . is still possible: Here, Hume explains his Conceivability Principle. It means that if you can clearly imagine something without any contradictions, then it is logically possible. He first mentioned this at 2.4 and will talk about it again at 4.18.

4.6 reasonings à priori: Reasonings are called a priori if they don’t depend on any facts from observing or experiencing the world. But Hume uses ‘à priori’ a bit differently here. He means reasoning that doesn’t depend on any remembered experiences, only on pure thinking. See section 10 of the Introduction.

4.6 ADAM: According to the Bible’s first book, Genesis, Adam was the first man made by God. Hume imagines a thought experiment where Adam, who has perfect human abilities but no experience yet, wouldn’t be able to predict how natural things behave.

4.6 discovers: means reveals. Check the Glossary below for other words that may have different or unclear meanings since the 1700s.

4.7 loadstone: A lodestone is a naturally magnetic stone with iron in it. If you hang it from a string, it acts like a compass because it lines up with Earth’s magnetic field.
