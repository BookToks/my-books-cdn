There is nothing about these things, just thinking about them without any experience, that makes me believe something will happen. Even after I’ve seen the same thing happen many times, there’s no proof that it will always happen that way. We don’t know the real forces that make things happen. We only notice how things look or feel, so why should we think the same forces always come with the same looks or feelings?

So, it’s not reason that guides us in life, but habit. It’s habit that makes us expect the future to be like the past. This might seem like an easy idea, but reason alone could never figure it out.

This is a very interesting idea and it leads to even more interesting ones. When I see one billiard ball rolling towards another, my mind automatically expects the second ball to move too. But is that all? Do I just imagine the second ball moving? No, I also believe it will move.

So, what is this belief? How is it different from just imagining something? This is a new question that philosophers haven’t really thought about.

When I’m convinced by proof that something is true, I not only imagine it but also know it’s impossible to imagine it being false. What is definitely false can’t even be imagined because it doesn’t make sense. But with things we learn from experience, no matter how strong the proof is, I can still imagine the opposite, even if I don’t really believe it. So belief is different from just imagining something without agreeing with it.

To explain this, there are only two ideas. One is that belief adds a new idea to what we imagine. But this isn’t true. When we just imagine something, we imagine it completely with all its details.

We imagine it as it could be, even if we don’t believe it’s real. Believing wouldn’t add anything new to the idea. We can picture the whole thing in our mind without believing. We can see it clearly in our imagination with all the details. That’s the object imagined as it might be; and when we believe it, we don’t do anything more.

The second idea is that the mind can put all ideas together as long as they don’t contradict. So if belief was just adding a new idea, then by adding that idea, a person could believe anything they imagine.

Since belief means imagining something but is also more than that, and since it doesn’t add a new idea, it must be a different way of imagining. It’s something we can feel as different, and it doesn’t depend on our choice like all other ideas do.
