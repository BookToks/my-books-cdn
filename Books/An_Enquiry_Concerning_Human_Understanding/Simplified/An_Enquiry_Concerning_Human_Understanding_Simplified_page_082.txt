SECTION IV 25 Doubts about How We Understand Things PART I

All the things we think about or try to figure out can be split into two types: Relations of Ideas and Matters of Fact.

Relations of Ideas include subjects like Geometry, Algebra, and Arithmetic. These are things we know for sure just by thinking about them. For example, the idea that the square of the longest side of a triangle equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides is a fact about shapes. Or that three times five is the same as half of thirty is a fact about numbers. We can figure these out just by using our minds, without needing to look at the real world. Even if no circles or triangles existed, the truths found by Euclid would always be true.

Matters of Fact are the other kind of things we think about. We can’t be sure about these in the same way as Relations of Ideas. The opposite of any Matter of Fact can still be possible because it doesn’t create a contradiction, and we can imagine it just as clearly as the actual fact. For example, the idea that the sun might not rise tomorrow makes sense and doesn’t contradict anything, just like the idea that it will rise tomorrow.

So, trying to prove that the sun will definitely rise tomorrow is pointless.

If it were impossible for the sun not to rise, that would mean a contradiction, and we wouldn’t be able to clearly imagine it.

It’s interesting to ask what kind of proof we have that things really exist or that facts are true, beyond what we see or remember. This question hasn’t been studied much by thinkers in the past or now, so it’s okay if we get confused or make mistakes when trying to figure it out. We’re exploring tricky ideas without a clear guide.
