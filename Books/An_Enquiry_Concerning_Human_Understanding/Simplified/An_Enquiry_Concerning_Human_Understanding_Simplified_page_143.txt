SECTION X 109 Of Miracles PART I

Dr. Tillotson wrote an argument against the idea of the real presence that is very clear, smart, and strong. He says this argument is so good that the idea doesn't even need a serious reply. Everyone agrees, the learned bishop says, that the authority of the Bible or tradition comes only from the apostles’ testimony. The apostles saw the miracles of Jesus themselves, which showed that he was sent by God.

So, the proof we have for the Christian religion is weaker than the proof we get from our own senses. Even the first followers of the religion didn’t have stronger proof than what they saw with their own eyes. The proof gets weaker as the stories pass from the apostles to their followers. No one can trust secondhand stories as much as they trust what they see themselves. A weaker proof can never cancel out a stronger one. So, even if the Bible clearly said the real presence is true, it would still go against good reasoning to believe it. It goes against what we see with our senses, while both the Bible and tradition don’t have stronger evidence than our senses unless the Holy Spirit makes it very clear inside each person.

[2] This kind of strong argument is super useful because it can silence those who are blindly stubborn or superstitious. It can free us from their annoying ideas. I believe I have found an argument like this too. If it’s right, it will stop all kinds of superstitions forever for smart and educated people. It will be useful as long as the world exists because stories about miracles and strange events are found in all history, both religious and non-religious.

[3] Even though experience is the only way we can understand what really happens, we have to admit that it’s not always perfect. Sometimes experience can lead us to make mistakes.
