That argument was popular, so I wrote a lot more about it than the other parts of my work. Please don’t show it to anyone. When you have time, please tell me you got it, read it, and then burned it.

You and I think the same about Dr. Butler, and I’d like to meet him. Right now, I’m cutting out the best parts of my work, trying to make it less offensive. Before doing that, I didn’t want to give it to Dr. Butler. This is a kind of cowardice, and I blame myself, though I don’t think my friends will blame me. I decided not to be too enthusiastic about philosophy while I was criticizing other people’s enthusiasm. If I ever get excited about anything, it will be when I say, “I am, dear sir, yours.”

I’m feeling down on myself right now, but soon I’ll probably just be upset with the world like other writers who don’t do well.

Still, I know I was foolish to feel so unhappy or hopeless about this. I shouldn’t have expected better results from such difficult ideas, and I didn’t really promise myself much more. I liked the new discoveries I thought I made so much that I ignored common sense. Since I enjoyed the usual excitement of new ideas, it’s only fair that I also face the usual disappointments.

I’m eager for a second edition mainly because I want to make some changes to my work. Thanks to printing, we authors can fix mistakes, which the old writers couldn’t do. Without this, it would have been very bold of me to publish so many new ideas in such a tricky part of philosophy at my age. I’m worried people will use my youth against me. Honestly, when I’m calm, I often think most of my arguments will be more useful for giving people ideas and sparking their curiosity than for adding real knowledge that will last for future generations.
