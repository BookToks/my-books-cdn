Why is an old farmer better at his job than a young beginner? It’s because the sun, rain, and soil work in a pretty predictable way to help plants grow. The old farmer learns from experience how these things usually happen and knows the rules that control them.

But we shouldn’t think that all people always act exactly the same way in the same situations. People have different personalities, beliefs, and opinions. This kind of complete sameness doesn’t happen in nature. Instead, by seeing how people act differently, we can come up with many general ideas about behavior, which still rely on some regular patterns.

Do people behave differently in different times and places? Yes. This shows how much habits and education shape our minds from when we’re kids and make us who we are. Do men and women act very differently? That helps us understand the natural differences between the sexes that stay pretty consistent. Does a person’s behavior change as they grow from a baby to an old person? That lets us notice how our feelings and choices change with age. Even each person’s unique character follows certain patterns, or else we wouldn’t be able to understand them or know how to act around them.

Sometimes people do things that don’t seem to follow any clear reason or rule. These are exceptions to how people usually behave. But if we want to understand these strange actions, we can think about how unusual events happen in nature. Not every cause always leads to the same effect in the same way.
