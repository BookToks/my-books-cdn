4.8 One billiard ball hitting another: Hume uses Malebranche’s example of two billiard balls crashing into each other to show that even the easiest-to-understand causes can only be known by experience. See §2 of the Introduction above.

4.10 Can I imagine it? It might seem like Hume is just saying that other effects could logically happen. But he is actually saying more: before experience, many different effects seem equally possible, and there’s no good reason to pick one over the others, so choosing would be totally random (4.9).

4.12 Reduce the principles to observation: Hume explains that science’s only real goal is to work from observation because we can’t know everything just by thinking about it. See §7 of the Introduction above. With this idea, he later suggests some ideas about the mind, saying that habits work like how ideas connect (5.20) and can explain how we guess things based on chance (6.3). The phrase “springs and principles” reminds us of 1.15; see notes for 1.13 and 1.15.

4.13 Mixed mathematics: what we now call “applied math,” which means using math to understand the physical world.

4.13 The moment or force of motion: Hume is talking about momentum, which is how much motion something has, found by multiplying its mass by its speed and direction. One big rule in physics is that momentum stays the same before and after objects bump into each other. So, as Hume says, a small object moving really fast can push a bigger object that’s moving slowly.

4.13 The discovery through experience: Even though math is helpful in physics, we can’t figure out how objects behave just by math alone because the physical laws (like momentum staying the same) are found through experience.

4.14 Sifting humour: A curious and questioning attitude.

4.15 Pretend: To claim or hope for something, without the modern idea of tricking someone.

4.16 Force or power of bodies: People once thought that inertia (an object’s resistance to change in motion) was a kind of force called “vis inertiae” or inert power; see note [D].

4.16 Note 7: This note was added in the 1750 edition to answer a criticism by Kames, who said Hume was being inconsistent when he talked about objects having powers but later said they don’t really have powers. Hume says the word “powers” shouldn’t be taken as a final meaning here.
