But we have to be very careful when doing this, so we don’t move away from the truth.

First of all, we should be suspicious of any story that depends on religion, like the strange events Livy talks about. Also, we should doubt anything found in books about magic or alchemy, or from writers who seem to love making up lies and weird stories.

I like the way this argument is made because it helps to challenge people who try to defend Christianity using only human reason. Our holy religion is based on faith, not just reason. Trying to prove it by reason alone is not the right way and can actually hurt it.

To make this clearer, let’s look at the miracles in the Bible. To keep it simple, we’ll focus on the ones in the Pentateuch. We will treat these stories like they were written by a normal human writer, not as the words of God.

We have to remember that this book was given to us by a people who were considered very simple and uneducated. It was written long after the events it tells about, and there is no other proof to support it. It’s like the made-up stories that many nations tell about how they began.

When we read this book, we find many strange miracles and amazing events. It talks about a different world and human nature than what we know now. It tells about how humans fell from that better state, how people lived for nearly a thousand years, a huge flood that destroyed the world, and how one special group of people—those of the author’s country—were chosen by heaven.

It also tells how this group was freed from slavery through incredible miracles. I ask anyone to think seriously and honestly: do you think it would be more surprising if such a book was false, based on its kind of proof, than all the miracles it talks about? But believing it requires accepting that, according to what we consider likely, these miracles really happened.
