A baby wouldn’t understand this idea, but once I have it, I can be sure—without checking anything in real life—that all bachelors are unmarried. A truth is called a priori when you can know it’s true just by thinking about the ideas, without needing to experience anything. On the other hand, facts can only be known as true or false by looking at real-life experience.

Later in Section IV, Hume talks about two types of reasoning, but he doesn’t explain much because people were already familiar with it from John Locke’s work. All reasoning can be split into two kinds: demonstrative reasoning, which deals with relationships between ideas, and moral reasoning, which deals with facts and what exists.

Demonstrative reasoning is similar to deductive reasoning, where each step in the argument is definitely true based on how ideas connect—like math proofs, such as the Pythagorean theorem. Factual reasoning—also called moral by Hume and probable by Locke—is what we now call inductive reasoning. This includes everyday thinking where we make reasonable guesses based on experience, what others say, and how we understand people and things, but these guesses aren’t 100% certain.

In Sections IV and V, Hume asks how we can know facts that go beyond what we directly sense or remember. This question leads him to explain his ideas about reasoning. 

Induction here doesn’t only mean moving from many examples to a general rule, like Aristotle said. Hume’s examples usually involve guessing about one thing based on what we’ve seen before. Also, Hume himself doesn’t use the word “induction” in these exact ways.
