We can’t help but form beliefs based on habits, as Hume explained earlier, even though there’s no logical reason to assume that things will always happen the same way.

This idea that we have to believe something can stop us from doubting everything all the time. But it doesn’t mean we should believe everything without thinking. Hume says that if we understand how weak our minds are and also accept that belief is something we can’t avoid, we can be careful about what we believe. We should check our doubts and beliefs using common sense and thinking.

It also makes sense to focus only on things that our minds can really understand well. Even in everyday life, we don’t have a strong reason to trust our abilities fully. Science fits into this idea because it’s just a more organized way of using the kind of reasoning we do every day. Earlier parts of Hume’s work explain how this organized reasoning works, like explaining events with simple rules, calculating chances based on past experiences, looking for hidden causes, using comparisons, and making fair guesses.

Philo, a character in Hume’s later writings, sums this up well. Even if total doubt can’t be proven wrong, everyone still has to live and act like normal people because that’s human nature. So, everyday reasoning is okay. If we get curious and want to learn more, science can also be trusted if it follows the same careful way of thinking we use every day. The skeptic realizes that from when we’re babies, we start learning how to think better and make more general rules, and as we get more experience and better thinking skills, our ideas become wider and more solid.
