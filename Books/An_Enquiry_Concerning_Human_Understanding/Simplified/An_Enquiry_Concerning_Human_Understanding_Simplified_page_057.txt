There is one small problem: Beauchamp’s note 5 from the 1772 version is missing in the 1777 text used here, so it only shows up in a different version in Section III on page 179 below.

Besides changing some symbols, Hume’s original footnotes are kept exactly the same, including where the markers are placed. But the endnote references have been changed a little to make it easier to find things. For example, on page 174 of Hume’s 1777 edition, it said ‘*See NOTE [Q].’ at the bottom, and the endnote on page 486 was called ‘NOTE [Q], p. 174.’ In this edition, these lines on pages 120 and 131 are changed to: 35 See endnote [Q], p. 131.

Endnote [Q] on page 120 now says 35, making it easier to cross-reference and including Beauchamp’s note numbers as small superscript numbers (like note 35, the last one in the book).

Before 1770, all notes were footnotes, and Beauchamp’s edition does the same, but it doesn’t say what kind of notes were used in later editions.

We know Hume cared about these details because of his letters, especially one to his printer William Strahan on April 8, 1776. He said he liked Mr. Gibbon’s Roman History printed by Strahan, but he wanted to give advice about printing. He didn’t like how notes were done at the end of the book because you had to keep flipping pages just to see references. He thought all authority references should be printed at the bottom of the page instead. Hume also wanted a copy of his new edition sent to Mr. Gibbon because he respected him and wanted his work to be as perfect as possible.

In another letter on June 8, Hume talked about how sick he was and made final requests about how ‘My Own Life’ and the Dialogues about Natural Religion should be printed in his new edition. He was excited about the quality of the 1777 edition of his Essays and Treatises and the 1778 edition of his History of England. He said he was happy that Strahan had started working seriously on this new edition.
