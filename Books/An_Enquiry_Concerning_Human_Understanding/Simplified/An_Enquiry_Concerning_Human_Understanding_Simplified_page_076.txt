Everyone agrees there’s a big difference between what we feel right now—like the pain of being too hot or the nice feeling of warm weather—and when we remember or imagine those feelings later. Our mind can copy these feelings, but it can’t make them as strong or real as the first time. Even when our imagination is very clear, it’s still not as strong as actually feeling or seeing something. Unless someone is sick or crazy, they can always tell the difference between a real feeling and a memory or imagination. No matter how good a poem is, it can’t make you think a description is the same as a real place. The strongest thought is still weaker than the weakest real feeling.

We see the same difference in other feelings too. Someone who is really angry feels very different from someone who just thinks about being angry. If you say someone is in love, I understand what you mean and can imagine it, but I can never confuse that idea with actually feeling the strong emotions of love.

When we think about our past feelings, our mind shows us a true picture, but the colors are faint and dull compared to how bright those feelings were at the time. You don’t need to be super smart or a philosopher to notice this difference.

So, we can split all the things our mind perceives into two groups based on how strong and lively they are. The weaker, less lively ones are usually called Thoughts or Ideas. The stronger ones don’t have a common name in most languages, maybe because it wasn’t important to give them one except for philosophy. Let’s call these stronger feelings Impressions, using the word a bit differently than usual.
