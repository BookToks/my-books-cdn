Even though their ideas seem confusing and hard to understand for most people, these thinkers want to impress smart and knowledgeable people. They feel their hard work is worth it if they can find hidden truths that help teach future generations.

It’s clear that most people prefer simple and easy-to-understand ideas over complicated ones. Many say simple ideas are not only nicer but also more useful. Simple ideas relate to everyday life, shape our feelings, and change how we act. They help us become better people by showing us a clear example to follow.

On the other hand, complicated ideas come from a way of thinking that doesn’t fit well with real life and action. These ideas disappear when the thinker leaves their quiet space and faces the real world. Our emotions and strong feelings often ignore these ideas, making even the smartest thinker seem ordinary. It’s also true that the most lasting and respected fame comes from simple ideas. Deep thinkers usually get only short-term fame because people of their time either don’t understand or don’t care about their work.

It’s easy for a deep thinker to make a mistake in their tricky ideas. One mistake can lead to another, and they don’t stop just because their ideas seem strange or go against what most people believe. But a thinker who just wants to explain common sense in a better way will stop if they make a mistake. They will check again with what most people naturally understand and come back to the right path, avoiding serious errors. For example, Cicero is still famous today, but Aristotle is mostly forgotten. La Bruyere’s work is known far away and still respected, while Malebranche’s glory is limited to his country and his time.
