Hobbes said that our choices are already determined, and Hume agrees. But Hume adds a new reason for this idea. He explains that the idea of "necessity" comes from seeing things always happen together in nature. When we notice one thing always follows another, our mind gets used to expecting it. We don’t really understand any deeper connection beyond this. 

Most of Part I of Section VIII is about showing that human actions follow this same pattern. People usually act like this happens, even if they say they don’t believe it. Hume thinks this happens because people like to believe they understand nature better than they really do, thinking there’s a special connection between cause and effect. But this is just an illusion. Understanding that necessity is just about seeing things happen together helps us realize human actions are also determined in the same way.

While explaining this, Hume talks about how science should work. We should look for causes that always happen the same way and find the deeper rules behind things that seem random. This approach should be used not just in studying nature but also in understanding people.

In Part II of Section VIII, Hume looks at what his idea that everything is determined means for right and wrong, and for religion. He starts by saying his main point is to challenge the idea that the physical world has some special kind of necessity, not to offer a new idea about human actions. Then, he says something important: seeing human behavior as caused by things before it happens doesn’t go against morality. In fact, it’s necessary for morality, because we only blame or punish people when their actions come from their real character and habits.
