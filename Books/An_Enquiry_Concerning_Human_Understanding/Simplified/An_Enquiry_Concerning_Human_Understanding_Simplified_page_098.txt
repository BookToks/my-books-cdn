This belief happens naturally because of the way our mind works in certain situations. It’s like how we can’t help but feel love when someone does something nice for us, or hate when someone hurts us. These feelings are natural instincts, and no amount of thinking or reasoning can make us have them or stop them.

At this point, we could stop asking questions. For most problems, we can’t go any further, and in all problems, we have to stop eventually after looking into them as much as we can. But it’s okay to stay curious and keep exploring the nature of this belief and how it usually happens. By doing this, we might find some explanations and ideas that satisfy those who enjoy thinking about tricky ideas, even if there’s still some doubt. For others who don’t like this kind of thinking, the rest of this part might not be interesting, but it’s still easy to understand if you want to.

Our imagination is very free. Even though it can only use ideas from what we see, hear, and feel, it can mix and change these ideas in endless ways to create stories and pictures in our mind. It can imagine events that seem real, place them in certain times and places, and believe in them as if they actually happened.

So, what’s the difference between a made-up story and something we truly believe? It’s not just about having a special idea that makes us accept it as true, because our mind could choose to believe any story if it wanted to. But in real life, we find this isn’t true. For example, we can imagine a creature with a man’s head and a horse’s body, but we can’t really believe that such an animal ever existed.
