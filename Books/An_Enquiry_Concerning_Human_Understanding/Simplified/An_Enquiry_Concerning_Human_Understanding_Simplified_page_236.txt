In 1751, I moved from the countryside to the city, which is the best place for someone who loves books and writing. In 1752, I published my Political Discourses in Edinburgh, where I was living then. This was the only book of mine that became successful right after it came out. People liked it both at home and in other countries. That same year, I also published my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals in London. I think this is the best thing I ever wrote, better than all my other history, philosophy, or literature work. But no one really noticed it when it came out.

In 1752, the Faculty of Advocates made me their Librarian. This job didn’t pay much, but it let me use a big library. I planned to write a History of England, but I got scared thinking about covering 1700 years. So, I started with the time when the House of Stuart came to power because I thought that’s when most of the biased stories began. I was really hopeful that people would like my book. I thought I was the only historian who didn’t care about current politics, popular opinions, or power. Since the topic was easy to understand, I expected lots of praise.

But I was very disappointed. Everyone criticized and hated the book. People from England, Scotland, and Ireland, no matter their political or religious beliefs, were angry with me because I showed sympathy for Charles I and the Earl of Strafford. After the first wave of anger, the book was mostly ignored. Mr. Millar told me he only sold forty-five copies in a year. I hardly knew anyone important who liked the book, except the top church leaders in England and Ireland, Dr. Herring and Dr. Stone. These two were unusual exceptions.

They both sent me messages encouraging me not to give up.

I was discouraged, to be honest. If war hadn’t been about to start between France and England, I might have moved to a small town in France, changed my name, and never come back to Britain. But since that wasn’t possible, and I was already working on the next volume, I decided to be brave and keep going.

During this time, I also published my Natural History of Religion in London, along with some other small writings. Not many people noticed it except Dr. Hurd, who wrote a mean pamphlet attacking it with the usual rude and arrogant style of his group. His attack actually made me feel a bit better about the otherwise quiet response to my book.
