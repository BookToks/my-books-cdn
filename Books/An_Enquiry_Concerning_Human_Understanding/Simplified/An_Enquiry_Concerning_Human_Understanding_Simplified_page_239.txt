My friends never had to defend any part of my character or actions. Sure, people who didn’t like me probably wanted to make up stories to make me look bad, but they never found any that seemed believable.  

I can’t say I’m not a little proud while writing this speech about myself, but I hope it’s not the wrong kind of pride. This is something true and easy to prove.
