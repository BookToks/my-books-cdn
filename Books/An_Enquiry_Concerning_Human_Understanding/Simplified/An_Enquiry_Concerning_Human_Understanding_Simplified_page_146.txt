Imagine that someone is trying to prove something really strange or amazing with their story. In that case, the proof they give can be less believable depending on how unusual the event is. We believe people’s stories not because we automatically trust them, but because usually, their stories match what really happens. But when the event they talk about is something we rarely or never see, there are two opposite kinds of experience fighting against each other. One experience can cancel out the other as much as it can, and the stronger experience will only affect us by how much power it has left.

The same experience that makes us trust witnesses also makes us doubt the strange event they are trying to prove. Because of this, belief and proof fight against each other, balancing each other out and weakening both.

There was a saying in Rome that went, "I wouldn’t believe such a story even if Cato told me." Cato was a very respected person, but people still thought some stories were too unbelievable, even coming from him.

An Indian prince didn’t believe the first stories about frost because he had never seen anything like it. He was smart to doubt those stories, since they came from a natural world very different from what he knew. The stories didn’t go against what he experienced before, but they didn’t fit with it either.

Now, imagine the event people are talking about is not just strange but actually a miracle. Even if the proof from witnesses seems perfect on its own, there is still proof against it. The stronger proof will win, but its power will be less because of the opposing evidence.
