When many people agree on something that happened, it makes us believe it more strongly. This feeling is what we call belief. It makes us trust that thing more than the opposite, which doesn’t have as many examples or doesn’t come to mind as often when we think about the future based on the past.

If anyone tries to explain how the mind works in this way using the usual philosophical ideas, they will see how hard it is to do.

For me, I hope these ideas make philosophers curious and help them realize that common theories don’t explain these interesting and important topics very well.
