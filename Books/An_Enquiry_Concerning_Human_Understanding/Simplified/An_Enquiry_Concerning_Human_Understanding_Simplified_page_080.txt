23 SECTION III About How Ideas Connect

It’s clear that our thoughts or ideas are linked together, and when we remember or imagine things, one idea usually leads to another in a certain order. 

When we think seriously or talk about something important, if a random idea suddenly pops up and doesn’t fit, we notice it right away and ignore it. Even when our mind wanders or we dream, if we think about it, we see that our imagination still connects ideas in some way.

If you wrote down a random conversation, you’d still find something that links the ideas as they change. And if someone suddenly changes the topic, they could probably tell you what thoughts led them away from the original subject. 

Even in different languages, where you wouldn’t expect any connection, the words for complicated ideas are often very similar. This shows that simple ideas inside those complicated ones are linked by a universal rule that works for everyone.

24 [2] Even though it’s obvious that ideas connect, no philosopher has tried to list or group all the ways they connect, which is an interesting topic. To me, there seem to be only three main ways ideas connect: by similarity, by happening close together in time or place, and by cause and effect.

[3] Most people agree that these three ways connect ideas. For example, a picture makes us think of the real thing it shows. Talking about one room in a building naturally makes us think about the rest of the building.
