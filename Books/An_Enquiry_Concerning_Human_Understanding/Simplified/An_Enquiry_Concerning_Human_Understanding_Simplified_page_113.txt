When we want something to happen, our mind tries to make it happen. But right away, something else happens instead—something we don’t even know about and is very different from what we wanted. That event then causes another unknown event, and this keeps going on until finally, after many steps, the thing we wanted actually happens.

If we really felt the power that makes this happen, we would understand it. If we understood it, then we would also know what it causes, because power is connected to what it does. And if we don’t know what it causes, we can’t really know or feel the power. How could we be aware that we have the power to move our arms and legs if we actually don’t? Instead, we only have the power to move tiny things inside us, which eventually make our limbs move, but how this works is way beyond what we can understand.

So, from all this, we can safely say that our idea of power doesn’t come from any feeling or awareness inside us when we move. We know our limbs move because we want them to, just like other natural things happen. But the real power or energy behind it, like in other natural events, is unknown and impossible to fully understand.

What about when we think and focus on an idea? When we decide to bring up a new thought, look at it carefully, think about it from all sides, and then switch to a different idea after we feel we understand it well. Do we feel any real force or energy in our mind when we do this? Probably not, for the same reasons as before.

First, if we know a power, we know exactly what in the cause gives it the ability to make something happen. This means we must know both the cause and the effect and how they are linked. But can we say we truly know what the human soul is like, or what an idea really is, or how one can create the other? This is a true act of creating something new.
