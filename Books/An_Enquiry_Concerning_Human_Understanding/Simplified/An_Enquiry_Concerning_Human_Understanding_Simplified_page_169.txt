When we see that something was made by a person’s skill and hard work, and we already know about humans, we can guess a lot about what they might do. These guesses come from what we have seen and learned before. But if we only knew a person from just one thing they made, we couldn’t really make these guesses. That’s because all we know about them would come from that one thing, so it wouldn’t help us guess anything new.

For example, if we find a footprint in the sand, by itself it only shows that something with a matching shape made it. But if it’s a human footprint, from what we know about people, we can also guess that there was probably another foot too, even if we don’t see it anymore because of time or other reasons. Here, we start by looking at the effect and guess the cause, then go back to guess changes in the effect. But this isn’t just a simple way of thinking. We use lots of other experiences and facts about humans to make these guesses, and without that, this way of thinking would be wrong.

The situation is different when we think about nature and God. We only know God by looking at what was made, and God is one unique being, not part of any group or type that we know from experience. Because of this, we can’t use what we know about other things to guess what God is like. If the universe shows wisdom and goodness, we guess that God has wisdom and goodness. If the universe shows a certain amount of these qualities, we guess God has that amount too, matching what we see. But we can’t say for sure that God has more or different qualities than what we observe, based on fair reasoning.

Without making some guesses, we can’t really think about the cause (God) and guess changes in the effect (what happens in the world) beyond what we have seen. If God creates more good things, that must mean God is more good. If rewards and punishments are fairer, that must mean God cares more about justice and fairness.
