When we think about a wound, it’s hard not to also think about the pain that comes with it.  

But proving that these are the only ways our thoughts connect might be hard to convince anyone, even yourself.  

What we can do is look at many examples and study how different thoughts link together. We keep doing this until we find a rule that works for all cases.  

The more examples we check and the more careful we are, the more sure we become that we’ve found all the main ways ideas connect.  

For example, opposite ideas are connected too. This might be because one causes the other to disappear, and thinking about one means you also think about the other.
