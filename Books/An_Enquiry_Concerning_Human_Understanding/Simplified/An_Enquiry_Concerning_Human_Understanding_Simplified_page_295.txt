INDEX OF MAJOR THEMES, CONCEPTS, AND EXAMPLES [This index can be used to locate the sections and most important paragraphs where major topics (and some particularly notable examples) are discussed in the Enquiry itself, in the corresponding editorial notes (pp. 185–211), and in the relevant sections of the Introduction (pp. xxx–lvi). Other parts of the volume referring to specific paragraphs of the Enquirycan then easily be identified using the Index of References to Hume’s Works. The Index of Names Mentioned in the Enquirycan be used in a similar manner, to track down discussions and examples associated with specific individuals. See also the Glossary.
