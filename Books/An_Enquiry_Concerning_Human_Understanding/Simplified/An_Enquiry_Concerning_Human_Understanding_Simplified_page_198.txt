If I have helped fix this problem even a little, then I have done what I wanted. The book seemed to me to be very unique and new, which made me think people would be interested. Especially because the Author seems to suggest that if his ideas are accepted, we will have to change most of what we know about science from the ground up. These bold ideas are always good for learning because they challenge what we believe, help people think for themselves, give smart people new ideas to explore, and even disagreements help us see problems we didn’t notice before.

The Author will need to be patient because it will take time for experts to agree about his work. It is unlucky for him that he can’t ask regular people for their opinion, since they are usually very good judges in normal matters. Instead, he has to be judged by a small group of experts whose opinions can be biased or unfair. This is especially true because only people who have thought deeply about these topics can judge them, and those people often stick to their own ideas and won’t change their minds. I hope the Author doesn’t mind me getting involved, because I only want to help more people understand his ideas by explaining some parts that were hard to get. I picked one simple argument and followed it carefully from start to finish. That is the only part I made sure to explain fully.

The rest are just notes on interesting parts that caught my attention.

This book seems to be written in the same style as some other popular books in England recently. The way people think about philosophy has improved a lot across Europe in the last 80 years, and England is just as advanced as any other country. Our writers seem to have started a new kind of philosophy that promises to be both fun and useful for people, more than anything the world has seen before. Most old philosophers who wrote about human nature focused more on feelings, morals, or big ideas than on deep reasoning and thought. They usually just explained common sense in the best way they could, without carefully connecting all their ideas or making a clear system. But it is at least worth trying if the study of humans can be as exact and clear as parts of natural science are.
