Epicurus will still seem solid and convincing; and the political interests of society have nothing to do with arguments about philosophy and religion.

There is one thing you seem to have missed. Even if I accept your ideas, I don’t agree with your conclusion. You say religious beliefs and reasoning don’t affect life because they shouldn’t. But people don’t think like you do. They believe in a divine being who punishes bad behavior and rewards good behavior beyond what happens naturally. Whether their thinking is right or wrong doesn’t matter. It still affects how they live and act. And those who try to change these beliefs might be good thinkers, but I can’t see them as good citizens or leaders. They take away one way that controls people’s bad desires and make breaking society’s rules easier and safer.

Still, I might agree with your main idea about freedom, but for different reasons than you. I believe the state should allow all kinds of philosophy. No government has lost its political strength because of this. Philosophers don’t get people excited or passionate; their ideas aren’t very popular. And stopping people from thinking freely would harm science and the state because it could lead to unfair punishment and control in areas that most people care about deeply.

But there’s a problem with your main idea that I want to mention without arguing too much about it. I doubt that we can know the cause of something just by looking at its effect, as you have assumed. Or that a cause can be so unique that it has no similarity to anything else we’ve ever seen. We only guess one thing causes another when we always see them together. If we saw an effect that was completely new and didn’t fit any known type, I don’t think we could guess or figure out its cause at all.
