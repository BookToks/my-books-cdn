Aren’t the sun’s movements also a hint that the same idea might be true?

All the planets are like Earth, and they all go around the sun. The moons are like little planets that orbit Jupiter and Saturn, and these big planets, along with their moons, all go around the sun too. These similarities, and others I haven’t mentioned, are the main reasons people believe the COPERNICAN system. Now it’s up to you to think if your idea has any similar proof.

Actually, Cleanthes, the modern way of understanding space is so popular and taught from a young age that people don’t usually question why it’s true. But if we read Galileo’s famous book about the solar system, we see that he worked hard to show there’s no real difference between the stuff on Earth and the stuff in space.

Before, schools thought that things in space were unchangeable and perfect, while things on Earth were always changing and corruptible. But Galileo started with the moon and proved it was a lot like Earth—it’s round, dark when not lit, dense, has solid and liquid parts, changes its shape in phases, and has eclipses with Earth. After showing this for the moon and other planets, people realized these space bodies could be studied just like Earth, and their similarities helped explain what we see.

Because astronomers were careful like this, Cleanthes, you should realize your idea is far beyond what humans can really understand. Can you honestly show any similarity between how a house is built and how a whole universe is made? Have you ever seen nature creating something like the first order of the world? Have you watched a whole universe form from nothing to finished?

If you have, then please share what you saw and explain your theory.
