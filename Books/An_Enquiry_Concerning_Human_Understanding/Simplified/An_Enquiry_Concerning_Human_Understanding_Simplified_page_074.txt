For a long time, astronomers were happy just figuring out how the stars and planets move, their order, and how big they are. Then, a smart thinker came along and, using really good reasoning, figured out the rules and forces that control how planets move around the sun. People have done similar things with other parts of nature too. 

There’s no reason to give up on trying to understand how our minds work if we study carefully and smartly. It’s likely that one mental process depends on another, and these could all be explained by one big, general idea. But it’s hard to know exactly how far we can understand this until we try seriously. 

Every day, even people who don’t study deeply try to figure out these things. It’s really important to approach this work carefully so that if it’s possible for humans to understand the mind, we can succeed. If not, at least we can say so with some confidence. We don’t want to give up too quickly, though, because that would make this kind of study seem less valuable.

People who study right and wrong have tried to find one main idea that explains why we like or dislike so many different actions. Sometimes they’ve gone too far, wanting just one rule for all good and bad things. But it’s understandable they want to find these big principles. Critics, thinkers, and politicians have tried this too, and while they haven’t figured everything out, they’ve made some progress. 

Giving up on trying to find these big ideas too soon would be more reckless and stubborn than even the boldest ideas that have tried to force their rules on everyone.
