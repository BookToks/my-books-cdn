When someone believes in cause and effect, their mind follows certain patterns that help them understand how one thing leads to another. Hume admits that his explanations aren’t perfect: they don’t explain what exactly in the cause makes it connect to the effect. Instead, we only see this connection because events happen together over and over, or because we get used to guessing what will happen next. People naturally want to know more—like what exactly in the cause links it to the effect. But according to Hume, this idea doesn’t really make sense. We don’t have a clear idea of that connection, and we don’t even really know what we’re trying to understand when we look for it. So, Hume’s two explanations cover everything we can reasonably say about cause and effect. Even though we want a deeper meaning or some “glue” that ties events together, we can’t find it or even clearly imagine it. This doesn’t mean the idea of cause is wrong; it just means we have to accept Hume’s simpler explanation.

In Section VIII, Hume talks about the idea of freedom and how it fits with the idea that everything is determined by cause and effect. He tries to solve the old problem of whether free will can exist if everything is already decided. Like Hobbes, Hume says that determinism (everything happening because of causes) doesn’t stop us from being free. Hobbes said freedom means being able to do what you want without being stopped, and Hume agrees. He says freedom means you can choose to act or not act, depending on your will. For example, if you want to stay still, you can; if you want to move, you can. This kind of freedom works with determinism because if our actions come from our will, then we are free—even if our will itself is caused by earlier events.
