202 Notes to Pages 95–97  

10.41 And whoever . . . to it: Hume ends with a bit of irony, using a common trick called ‘theological lying’ to keep things polite by officially agreeing with the idea of God. See p. xxiii of the Introduction.  

SECTION XI  

11.0 Of a PARTICULAR PROVIDENCE . . . STATE: In the first edition from 1748, this part was called ‘Of the Practical Consequences of Natural Religion’. Hume might have changed the name because he thought the original title was too direct. The main idea is that natural religion—trying to prove religious ideas by looking at the world—doesn’t really change how we live. The new title talks about God’s special care for individuals (not just general rules of nature) and Christians’ hope for life after death. It’s interesting that Hume doesn’t include his strong arguments against life after death, which he wrote about in a different essay that was never published (see Appendix II).  

11.1 he advanced . . . approve: Here, Hume steps back from his most risky religious ideas by having a doubtful friend say them instead. See §4 of the Introduction.  

11.2 PROTAGORAS . . . SOCRATES: Protagoras (around 485–410 BC) was the first of the ancient Greek Sophists. He is famous for saying that truth depends on perspective, not fixed facts, as told in Plato’s dialogue Theaetetus. He was kicked out of Athens for questioning the gods. Socrates (469–399 BC), Plato’s teacher and one of the greatest ancient philosophers, was found guilty of disrespecting the gods and corrupting young people. His punishment was to drink poison and die, as told in Plato’s Phaedo.  

11.2 EPICURUS . . . EPICUREANS: See the Glossary. The footnote mentions Lucian (see note to 10.22).  

11.2 the wisest of . . . emperors: This refers to Marcus Aurelius (see note to 10.22). The footnote also mentions Lucian and Dio Cassius Cocceianus (about 150–235 AD), who wrote a big history of Rome from its start to 229 AD.  

11.4 a wise magistrate: This part, probably written between 1745 and 1748, feels personal. In 1745, Hume tried to get a job as Professor of Moral Philosophy in Edinburgh but was blocked by the Town Council because the Church didn’t like him. His skeptical friend now says a smart leader should allow people to doubt religion, since this kind of doubt doesn’t actually harm society or government safety.
