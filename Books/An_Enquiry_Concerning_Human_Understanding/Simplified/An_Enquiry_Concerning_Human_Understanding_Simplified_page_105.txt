SECTION VI 56 Of Probability

Even though there is no real thing called Chance in the world, not knowing the true cause of something makes us think it might happen by chance. This makes us believe or expect something in a similar way.

[2] Probability happens when one outcome has better chances than another. The more one chance is better than the other, the more likely we think it will happen. For example, if a die has one number on four sides and a different number on the other two sides, it’s more likely to land on the number that’s on four sides. If it had a thousand sides with the same number and only one side was different, then it would be even more likely to land on the first number. This way of thinking might seem simple, but if you think about it carefully, it can be really interesting.

[3] When we try to guess what will happen when we roll a die, we think each side has the same chance to come up. That’s what chance means — every possible outcome is equal. But since more sides have one number than the other, our mind expects the number on the most sides to come up more often.

This idea of many chances pointing to one outcome makes us believe that outcome more than the other one, which has fewer chances. This happens naturally in a way we can’t fully explain.

10 Mr. Locke said all arguments are either certain (demonstrative) or probable. So, it’s only probable that everyone will die or that the sun will rise tomorrow. But to make things clearer, we should say arguments can be demonstrations (certain), proofs (based on experience with no real doubt), or probabilities (likely but not certain).
