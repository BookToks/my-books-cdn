In 1609–10, Galileo Galilei made his own telescope, a device that was only invented in 1608, and looked at the sky in more detail than anyone had before. He quickly shared what he saw in a book called The Starry Messenger. He discovered craters, mountains, and valleys on the moon. By looking at the shadows, he could even measure their sizes. This showed that the moon was rough and rocky, not smooth and perfect like people had thought.

He also found four moons orbiting Jupiter, which proved that not everything in space moves around the Earth. He saw Venus change shape from a crescent to almost a full circle, which you can’t see without a telescope. This evidence went against the old idea that all planets move in a certain way around the Earth. Galileo also saw many new stars that seemed to go beyond the “crystal sphere” where people thought all stars were fixed.

If the Earth is not the center of the universe, then Aristotle’s ideas about space and motion were wrong. When tested, his predictions about things like how cannon balls fly, sledges slide on ice, water drips from gutters, and stones fall were also wrong. Galileo is said to have shown this by dropping a heavy and a light ball from the Tower of Pisa at the same time, and they fell at almost the same speed. He then created a new theory of motion based on inertia and forces.

Other important observations were made too. In 1572, Tycho Brahe saw a supernova (a huge exploding star), and in 1604, Johannes Kepler saw another one, which Galileo also observed. In 1577, a big comet appeared, and Brahe used measurements to prove it was farther away than the Moon. These things showed that the sky beyond the Moon was not unchanging and perfect like Aristotle had said. Aristotle had thought comets and meteors were just things in Earth’s atmosphere.

Aristotle also believed that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones in direct proportion to their weight, but in reality, they fall at almost the same speed. Galileo’s new ideas about motion helped explain these things better.
