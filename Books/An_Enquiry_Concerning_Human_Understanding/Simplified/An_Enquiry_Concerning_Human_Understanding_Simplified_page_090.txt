If we are supposed to trust past experiences and use them to decide what will happen in the future, the reasons for doing this must be based on facts and real things, like we said before. But there is no real proof like that, and this should be clear if we accept the explanation of this kind of reasoning as correct.

We said that all arguments about things existing are based on cause and effect; we only learn about this from experience. And all our conclusions from experiments assume that the future will be like the past. So, trying to prove this assumption by using arguments based on existence is just going in circles, because it assumes what it’s trying to prove.

In fact, all arguments from experience come from noticing similarities between things in nature, which makes us expect similar results from similar things. Even though no sane person would deny the power of experience or ignore it, it’s okay for a thinker to wonder why experience has such power and why we trust that similar causes will have similar effects. This is what all our conclusions from experiments are based on. But if this idea came from pure reason, it would be just as strong after one example as after many. But that’s not how it works.

For example, eggs look very similar, but no one expects all eggs to taste exactly the same just because they look alike. It’s only after many times of seeing the same result that we become sure about something happening. So, where is the kind of reasoning that can make a conclusion from one example that’s very different from the conclusion it makes after seeing a hundred similar examples? I ask this question to learn and to challenge ideas. I can’t find or think of any such reasoning. But I’m open to learning if someone can explain it to me.
