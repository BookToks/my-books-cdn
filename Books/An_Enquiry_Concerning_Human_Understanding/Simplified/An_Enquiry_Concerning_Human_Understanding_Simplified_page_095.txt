But maybe the very thing that makes it seem harmless is also what causes people to dislike it so much. Since it doesn’t appeal to strong emotions, it doesn’t get many supporters. And because it goes against lots of bad habits and mistakes, it makes a lot of enemies who call it wild, disrespectful, and against religion.

We don’t need to worry that this way of thinking, which focuses only on everyday life, will destroy our ability to think or act. Nature will always keep its place and win over any complicated ideas. For example, even if we find that some steps in our thinking aren’t based on clear reasons, it won’t ruin most of what we know. If our mind can’t be convinced by logic to take these steps, it will be guided by some other strong rule. That rule will keep working as long as people are the same. It’s worth trying to understand what that rule is.

Imagine someone born with a very smart mind but who suddenly appears in the world. They would see things happening one after another but wouldn’t be able to figure out why. They wouldn’t understand the idea of cause and effect at first because the forces behind natural events can’t be seen. Just because one thing happens before another doesn’t mean the first caused the second. Their connection might be random. Without more experience, this person couldn’t guess or reason about anything beyond what they directly see or remember.

Now, imagine this person has more experience and has seen certain things always happen together. What happens then? They quickly start to believe that one thing causes the other. But even with all this experience, they don’t know the secret power that makes one thing cause the other. And no amount of reasoning forces them to believe this connection is real.
