For a young beginner, general advice and rules don’t always come at the right time, and they can’t be used calmly or clearly right away. Actually, someone without any experience can’t really reason at all. When we say someone is inexperienced, we mean they have some experience, but just less or less perfect experience.

Some people say that when we feel resistance from objects and have to use all our strength, that’s how we get the idea of force and power. They think the feeling of trying hard is the first impression that creates this idea. But first, we think of power in many things where there’s no resistance or effort, like God, who faces no resistance; or the mind, which can control ideas and movements easily; or objects that don’t feel anything. Second, the feeling of trying to overcome something doesn’t always connect to what happens next. We know the results from experience, but we couldn’t guess them without it. Still, this feeling of effort is part of the common, though not exact, idea of power.

I don’t need to explain much about “vis inertiae,” a term often talked about in new science and linked to matter. We see that a body at rest or moving keeps doing that until something else makes it change. Also, when one body pushes another, the second gets as much motion as the first had. These are facts. When we say “vis inertiae,” we just describe these facts without really understanding this “inert power.” It’s like when we talk about gravity—we mean the effects but don’t fully understand the force behind it. Sir Isaac Newton never meant to say that causes have no power or energy. Some people tried to use his name to prove that, but he didn’t. Actually, he used the idea of an invisible fluid to explain attraction everywhere, but he was careful to say it was just a guess that needed more tests.
