A horse that is used to being in the field learns how high it can jump and won’t try to jump higher than it is able.

An old greyhound lets the younger dogs do the hardest part of the chase and waits where it thinks the hare will run. The guesses it makes come from what it has seen and learned before.

Animals can be trained to do things that go against their natural habits by using rewards and punishments. For example, a dog learns to be afraid when you raise a whip to hit it. It also learns to come when it hears its name because it has learned that the sound means it is being called.

In these cases, the animal understands something more than what it just senses. It expects the same results from things it recognizes because of what it has experienced before.

But animals don’t figure this out by thinking or reasoning like humans do. If there were complicated reasons behind it, only very smart people could understand them. Animals, children, and even most adults don’t use complex logic in everyday life. Nature must have given a simpler, easier way to learn from experience. Since this is true for people, it makes sense it is also true for animals.
