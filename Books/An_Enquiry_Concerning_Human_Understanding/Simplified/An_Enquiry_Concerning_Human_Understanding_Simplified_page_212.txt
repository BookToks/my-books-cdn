And the people who support them—why do they do it? Just to make a living and to get power and money in this world. So, their energy and hard work actually argue against their cause.

Isn’t it cruel and unfair that all we care about and all we know is just this life, if there’s actually another life waiting for us that’s way more important? Should we blame a kind and wise being for this trick?

Look at how perfectly nature matches tasks with the abilities needed. Humans have much more reason than animals, but they also have many more needs. All their time, skills, energy, bravery, and feelings are spent trying to deal with the problems of life. And often, they still don’t have enough to handle everything.

Maybe a pair of shoes was never made perfectly, even though it could be. But it’s still important to have politicians, moral teachers, math experts, historians, poets, and thinkers among people.

Humans’ abilities aren’t really better than their needs in this life, just like foxes and rabbits have powers matched to their needs and short lives. So, it makes sense to think the same way about us.

If the soul dies with the body, it’s easy to explain why women’s abilities are seen as less: their home life doesn’t need higher mental or physical skills. But if the soul lives forever, both men and women have the same job to do. Their reasoning and strength should have been equal and much greater than they are now.

Every effect has a cause, going back to the first cause—the Deity. Everything that happens is planned by this being, so nothing is punished or punished by chance.

How are punishments and rewards decided? What is the divine rule for what’s good or bad? Should we think that God has human feelings? Even if that’s a bold idea, we can’t imagine anything else.

By human feelings, qualities like sense, bravery, good behavior, hard work, carefulness, and talent are important parts of being worthy. So, should we make a paradise only for poets and heroes, like old myths did? Why give all rewards to just one kind of good behavior?

Punishment without a real reason doesn’t fit with what we think is good and fair. And no punishment can help once life is over.
