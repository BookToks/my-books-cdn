We are limited beings, so our clear and logical thinking might not reach very far. But since philosophers have been able to find understandable laws of nature, it shows that reason can work beyond just math and help explain how the physical world works. Locke, being careful, said that even our scientific knowledge is only probably true, not absolutely certain like math. Still, this kind of probable knowledge is good enough for what we need in real life. Our reason helps us understand chances and possibilities, not just sure facts. God gave us the right abilities for our place in the world, somewhere between animals and angels. Even if our thinking can make mistakes and is limited, it is what makes us better than animals.

Most early modern philosophers agreed with Plato, who thought reason was the main job of the soul, and with Aristotle, who said humans are unique because they can think.

The Design Argument wasn’t the only way science helped religion. Earlier, we saw that gravity’s mysterious nature—how it can’t be explained by simple machines—was used as proof for God’s existence. The mechanical view of the world made people think of it as a perfect clock made by a master clockmaker. It also suggested that matter has limits, which helped religious ideas. Descartes was the first to say that matter is different from the mind, so the soul must be non-physical and could live after the body dies. Locke agreed and argued that thinking can’t come from just the basic parts of matter. But Locke also said God might add thinking to matter if He wanted. This upset many people because thinking is an active power, but the mechanical view, based on inertia, said matter is completely passive or inactive.
