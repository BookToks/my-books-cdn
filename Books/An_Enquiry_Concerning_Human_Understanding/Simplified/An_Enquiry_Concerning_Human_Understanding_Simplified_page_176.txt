It is known that many of the things we see or feel don’t come from outside us, like in dreams, madness, or sickness. It’s really hard to understand how the body can make the mind see an image, especially since the mind and body seem so different.

The big question is whether what we sense actually comes from real things outside us that look like those senses. How can we figure this out? By experience, like with other questions. But here, experience can’t help at all. Our mind only ever knows the senses themselves and can’t actually see if they connect to real things outside. So, thinking they do connect isn’t based on any real proof.

Some people say we should trust our senses because God wouldn’t lie to us. But that’s a strange way to prove it. If God’s truth mattered here, then our senses would never be wrong. Also, if we start doubting the outside world, it becomes really hard to prove God or anything about him exists.

Because of this, smart and careful doubters often win when they try to make us doubt everything we know. They say, do you trust your senses because it feels natural? But that just means you think what you sense is the real thing outside. Or, if you don’t believe that and instead think your senses only show you pictures of things outside, then you’re going against what feels natural. Even then, you can’t really prove with experience that your senses connect to real things outside.

There’s another deep doubt like this from serious philosophy that’s worth mentioning, even if it’s not very useful for everyday life. Most modern thinkers agree that things like hardness, softness, heat, cold, colors, and so on aren’t really qualities in objects themselves. Instead, these are just how our mind senses things, and there’s no real version of these qualities out there in the objects themselves.
