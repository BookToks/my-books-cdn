I admit that this argument has been talked about so much by everyone, and it has confused even smart people with tricky ideas. So, it’s not surprising if a sensible reader just ignores this question because it doesn’t seem to teach or entertain them. But the way this argument is presented here might get their attention again because it’s a bit new, promises to settle the debate, and won’t bother them with complicated or confusing ideas.

I hope to show that all people have always agreed on the ideas of both necessity and freedom, if we understand these words in a reasonable way. The whole argument so far has been just about words. We will start by looking at the idea of necessity.

Everyone agrees that matter, in everything it does, moves with a necessary force, and every natural result is exactly decided by its cause. No other result could happen in the same situation.

The amount and direction of every movement are set by the laws of nature so exactly that a living thing could not move differently from what actually happens. So, to understand necessity correctly, we must think about where this idea comes from when we talk about how bodies act.

It’s clear that if everything in nature changed all the time so that no two events were alike, and every object was totally new, we would never understand necessity or how things connect. We could only say that one thing follows another, not that one causes the other.

People would not know about cause and effect.

Thinking and reasoning about nature would stop, and only memory and senses would help us know anything really exists. So, our idea of necessity and cause comes completely from seeing the same things happen again and again in nature, and our minds learn to expect one thing when we see the other.
