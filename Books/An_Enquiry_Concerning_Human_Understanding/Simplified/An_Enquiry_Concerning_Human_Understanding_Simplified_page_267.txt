Notes to Pages 98–111 203 11.7 fill all . . . white beans: in ancient Greece, beans were commonly used for voting, with white beans signifying agreement and black beans disagreement.
 
 11.11 argument drawn . . . to causes: see §17of the Introduction, above.
 
 11.13 ZEUXIS: a celebrated Greek painter of the late fifth century bc.
 
 11.14 JUPITER: the supreme god of the Romans, based on the Greek god Zeus (though the Roman name would have been more familiar in the eighteenth century). By portraying the speech as made by Epicurus to the Athenians, Hume is able to avoid any direct reference to the God of Christianity, and thus reduces the overt impression of impiety.
 
 11.17 ill appearances of nature: Hume introduces a brief discussion of the Problem of Evil, dealt with at far greater length in his Dialogues, Parts X and XI.
 
 11.21 this life . . . porch: ‘the porch view’, whose irrationality Hume quickly demonstrates.
 
 11.23 the field . . . senate . . . school . . . closet: ‘the field’ alludes to battle, ‘the senate’ to government, ‘the school’ to education, and ‘the closet’ to private study.
 
 11.27 who discovers himself: who reveals himself.
 
 11.27 my apology for EPICURUS: my defence on behalf of Epicurus.
 
 11.29 enthusiasm: see explanatory note to 10.17.
 
 SECTION XII 12.1 Atheists: in the Enquiry Hume never overtly expresses support for atheism, though a hint might be detectable here in his association of atheism with scepticism (cf. also 5.1). By far the best evidence for Hume’s atheism is the general tendency of his arguments, especially in Sections VIII, X, and XI of the Enquiry; ‘Of the Immortality of the Soul’; The Natural History of Religion; and the Dialogues concerning Natural Religion. For a brief review of this evidence, see chapter 1, §3 in my Reading Hume on Human Understanding(OUP, 2002).
 
 12.3 scepticism, antecedent: see §18of the Introduction, above for an outline of Hume’s discussion of the varieties of scepticism.
 
 12.3 DES CARTES: see Glossarial Index.
 
 12.3 diffident: mistrustful, lacking confidence.
 
 12.4 education or rash opinion: the word ‘education’ often, in Hume, carries connotations of indoctrination.
 
 12.6 the evidence of sense: ‘scepticism with regard to the senses’ is covered in far greater detail in Treatise1.4.2, but with a very differentfocus. The Enquiry’s argument is summarized in the Introduction above, pp. liii–liv.
 
 12.10 cavils: quibbling arguments.
