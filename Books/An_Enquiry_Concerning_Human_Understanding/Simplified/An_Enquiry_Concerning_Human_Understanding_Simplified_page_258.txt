194 Notes to Pages 44–56 SECTION VII

7.0 Of the IDEA... CONNEXION: In the first two versions of the Enquiry (1748 and 1750), Section VII was called ‘Of the Idea of Power or Necessary Connexion’. In this section, Hume treats ‘power’ and ‘connexion’ as almost the same thing. He did this before in the Treatise, where he said words like power, force, energy, necessity, connexion, and productive quality all mean almost the same.

7.2 EUCLID: See the note for 4.1.

7.2 chimera and conceit: Both words mean something made-up or imaginary. In Greek myths, a chimera is a monster with a lion’s head, a goat’s body, and a snake’s tail.

7.4 all our ideas... impressions: Hume is talking about his Copy Principle from Section II. See notes for 2.5 and 2.9.

7.5 let us search... derived: For a full explanation of Hume’s argument here, see §13 of the Introduction above.

7.6 outward... inward impression: Hume follows Locke (see Introduction p. xvii) by separating sensation (outside senses like sight and touch) from reflection (inside sense—knowing our own feelings).

7.8 n. 12 Mr. LOCKE: See Glossary; this refers to Locke’s Essay, II. xxi.

7.8 n. 12 simple idea: Hume assumes the idea he looks for is simple (also at 7.4). This is probably because he focuses not on a very detailed idea, but on the general idea of one thing following another—the basic idea of connexion (see Introduction, p. xlii n. 24).

7.13 palsy: paralysis.

7.14 animal spirits: A supposed fluid that carries signals inside the nervous system.

7.21 n. 14: A Greek phrase like the more common Latin deus ex machina, meaning ‘god out of a machine’. It refers to old plays where a god would suddenly appear on stage to solve a problem in the story, often in a way that didn’t make much sense.

7.21 many philosophers: Hume talks about Malebranche and other occasionalists.

See Glossary and §6 of the Introduction.

7.28 this... necessary connexion: For a discussion about this tricky but important idea, see p. xliv of the Introduction.

7.29 we may define a cause: About Hume’s two famous definitions, see pp. xlv–xlvi of the Introduction. When Hume ‘defines’ a cause, he accepts that the idea is real, even if his earlier arguments made it seem unsure. In Treatise 1.4.5.32, he says clearly: ‘all objects which are always found together are the only ones to be seen as causes and effects’.
