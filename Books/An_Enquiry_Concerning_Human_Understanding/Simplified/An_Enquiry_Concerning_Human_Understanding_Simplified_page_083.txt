They might even be helpful because they make us curious and break the blind trust and comfort that stop us from thinking freely and asking questions. If we find mistakes in common ideas, it won’t make us give up. Instead, it will push us to try to come up with better and clearer ideas than what we already have.

All thinking about facts is based on the idea of Cause and Effect. This idea helps us believe things we don’t see or remember. For example, if you ask someone why they believe their friend is in the country or in France, they’ll give a reason. Maybe they got a letter or know their friend planned to go there. If someone finds a watch on a desert island, they’d guess people were there before. All our thinking about facts works like this.

We always assume there is a connection between the fact we see and the fact we guess from it. Without something linking them, our guess would be just a wild guess.

Hearing a voice or talking in the dark tells us someone is there. Why? Because those things happen only because of a person’s body and mind, and they are closely connected.

If we look closely at other reasons like this, we’ll see they all depend on cause and effect. Sometimes the connection is close, sometimes far, sometimes direct, sometimes indirect. For example, heat and light both come from fire, so if we see one, we can guess the other is there too.

If we want to understand why we trust facts, we need to ask how we learn about cause and effect.

I’m going to say something important: we never learn about cause and effect just by thinking without experience. Instead, we learn it by seeing things happen together again and again. Even a very smart person, seeing something new for the first time, can’t figure out its causes or effects just by looking at it. For example, Adam, even if he was perfectly smart, couldn’t have guessed that water would make him drown or fire would burn him just by how they looked or felt.
