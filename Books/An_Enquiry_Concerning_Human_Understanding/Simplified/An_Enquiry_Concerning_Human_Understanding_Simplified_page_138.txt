Feelings focus more closely on things around us and, in a way that fits how human minds work, care mostly about what seems good or bad for ourselves.

The same idea applies to moral problems as to physical ones. It doesn’t make sense to think that far-off reasons, which don’t affect us much personally, would matter more for morals. People’s minds are made so that when they see certain behaviors or traits, they immediately feel approval or blame. These feelings are a basic part of how we are.

We like people who help keep peace and safety in society, and we blame those who cause harm or trouble. So, it’s fair to say that our moral feelings come, directly or indirectly, from thinking about how things help or hurt society. Even if philosophers say that everything is actually right for the whole world, and that bad behaviors might somehow be useful too, does that really change how we feel?

If someone steals a lot of money from you, do you stop being upset just because you think about complicated ideas? 

So, why shouldn’t someone feel angry about a crime? Or why can’t we accept that there really is a difference between right and wrong, just like we know the difference between being good-looking and ugly? Both ideas come from our natural feelings, and no fancy philosophy can change that.

The second problem is harder to answer. It’s tricky to explain how God can cause everything people do without causing sin and bad behavior. These are mysteries that our natural thinking isn’t really good at solving. No matter what ideas we believe, we’ll run into confusing problems and contradictions when we try to figure this out.
