Trying to understand how people can act freely while everything is already known, or how God can make rules but not cause sin, has been too hard for philosophy to figure out.  

It's better if philosophy realizes itâ€™s too risky to dig into these deep mysteries. Instead, it should step back with some humility and focus on everyday life.  

There are plenty of problems in normal life to study without getting lost in endless confusion and doubt.
