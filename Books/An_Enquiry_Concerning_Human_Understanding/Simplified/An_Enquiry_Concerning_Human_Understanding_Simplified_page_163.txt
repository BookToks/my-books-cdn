You agree that this is an argument that goes from effects back to causes. From the way something is made, you guess that the maker planned it carefully. If you can’t prove this point, then your conclusion doesn’t work. You also admit that you won’t claim more than what nature’s evidence supports. These are the things you accept. I want you to notice what this means.

When we guess a cause from an effect, we have to make sure the cause fits the effect exactly. We can’t say the cause has more power than needed to make the effect happen. For example, if a weight of ten ounces lifts something, we know the other side must weigh more than ten ounces, but that doesn’t mean it weighs a hundred. If the cause we pick can’t make the effect, we have to reject it or add qualities that make it fit. But if we say the cause has extra qualities or can do more, we are just guessing without real proof.

The same rule works whether the cause is just matter or a smart being. If we only know the cause because of the effect, we shouldn’t give it qualities beyond what it needs to make that effect. We also can’t assume the cause can do other things that we haven’t seen. For example, just by looking at one of Zeuxis’s paintings, we can’t know he was also a sculptor or architect. We only know the artist is skilled at painting. The cause must match the effect perfectly. If it does, we won’t find any extra qualities or clues about other things the cause might do. Those extra qualities would be more than what is needed to make the effect we are studying.

So, if we say gods made the universe and put it in order, then they have exactly the power, intelligence, and kindness shown in their work. But we can’t prove anything more than that unless we start exaggerating or flattering to cover up weak arguments.
