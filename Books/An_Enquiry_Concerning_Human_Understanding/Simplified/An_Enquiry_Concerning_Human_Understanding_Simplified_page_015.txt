Locke was a big thinker whose ideas about knowledge and politics influenced people for a long time, even into the 1800s and beyond. In 1690, he wrote a famous book called *Essay concerning Human Understanding*. In it, he looked at how we think and what we can know, setting up ideas that another thinker, Hume, would later follow.

Locke believed that all our ideas come from experience, meaning everything we know comes from what we see, hear, or feel. He strongly disagreed with the idea that some knowledge is built into us from birth, like some earlier thinkers said. For example, Descartes thought we had an inborn idea of a perfect God, but Locke said no, we only get ideas from what we experience.

He explained that simple ideas come directly from experience, and more complex ideas are made by putting these simple ideas together. Experience can come from the outside world, like seeing a red rose, which gives us an idea of its color. Or it can come from inside our minds, like feeling desire for the rose or fear of its thorns. Since all experiences are about specific things, our ideas start as specific too.

But we can create general ideas, like the idea of "red" in general, by ignoring the small differences in different red things and focusing on what they all have in common. This process is called "abstraction," and it helps us think about groups of things instead of just one.

Because all ideas come from experience, Locke thought that our knowledge of the world also comes from what our senses tell us. This made him more careful than Descartes, who claimed to understand the true nature of matter and mind just by thinking about them. Locke said that the real nature of things is hidden from us, and the best we can do is come up with a good guess that might change with new experiences.

Locke supported the idea that everything physical is made of tiny particles called corpuscles. These particles have basic properties like size, shape, and motion, plus solidity, meaning they take up space and can't be passed through. But even with this, we can't really know the true essence of physical things.
