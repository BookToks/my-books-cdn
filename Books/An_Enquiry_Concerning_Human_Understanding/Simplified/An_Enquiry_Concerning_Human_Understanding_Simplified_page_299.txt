For the first Enquiry, only editorial references to specific paragraphs are included here. For other works, all references are included.

A Treatise of Human Nature has general references like i, x-xi, xxiii, lxiii, and specific parts such as 1.3.11.9–12, 199, 133, 161–4, 167, 170, 171, 185, 186, 1.3.12.5, 195, 187, 192, 201, 206, 209, 210, 223, 1.3.13.4, 205, 224, 226, and 1.3.14.31.

Specific references are found in places like 1.3.14.4, 194, and Book I Part i (which talks about ideas, where they come from, how they are made, and connected). Other parts include Book I Part iv (which covers skeptical and other philosophy systems) and Book I Part ii (which talks about ideas of space and time).

There are also parts about knowledge and probability in Book I Part iii, and the will and feelings in Book II Part iii. Book III Part i talks about right and wrong in general.

In the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, references are to sections and paragraph numbers. For example, 3.0 means the title of Section III. Section I discusses different types of philosophy, with references like 1.8, 1.11, 1.2, 1.3, and so on.

Section II talks about where ideas come from and has the number 5 among its references.

These are all references to Hume’s works.
