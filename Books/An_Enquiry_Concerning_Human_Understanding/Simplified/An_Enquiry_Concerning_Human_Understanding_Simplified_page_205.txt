I see one billiard ball moving toward another. I can’t tell if it’s spinning on its own axis or just sliding across the table. 

If it’s spinning, I know it won’t stop after hitting the other ball. If it’s sliding, it might stop. Spinning is more common, so I expect that to happen. But I can also imagine the sliding case as possible and connected to the cause.

If these two ideas didn’t feel different, then there wouldn’t be a difference between them.

We have been talking only about cause and effect when it comes to how things move and work in the physical world.

But the same idea applies to how the mind works. Whether it’s moving our body or controlling our thoughts, we can’t predict what will happen just from knowing the cause without experience. Even after we have experience, it’s habit, not reason, that makes us expect the usual result. When we see the cause, our mind quickly jumps to expecting the usual effect. This expectation is different from just thinking about it. It doesn’t add any new idea, but it makes the thought feel stronger and more real.

After explaining this important point about cause and effect, the author looks again at the idea of that connection. When we think about one ball hitting another, we only find that they touch, that one happens first, and that they always happen together. But people usually believe there is a necessary connection between cause and effect, and that the cause has some power or energy.

The question is, what do we actually mean by power or energy? If all our ideas come from what we sense, this power should be something we can sense or feel inside.

But we don’t really sense any power in how matter works. Some thinkers even say matter has no energy at all, and that all action comes from the power of a supreme Being. But then we have to ask, what idea do we have of that power in the supreme Being? People who say we have no built-in ideas believe that all our ideas of God come from thinking about how our own minds work.

But our minds don’t really give us a clear idea of power either. When we think about our will without experience, we can’t predict what it will cause. And with experience, we only see things happening one after another, always together.

So, in the end, either we have no real idea of force or energy, and those words don’t mean anything, or they just mean that our mind is used to moving from cause to effect because of habit.
