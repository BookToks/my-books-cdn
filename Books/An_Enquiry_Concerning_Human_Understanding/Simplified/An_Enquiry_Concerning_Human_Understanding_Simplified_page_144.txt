People living in places with weather like ours would usually expect better weather in June than in December, and that makes sense based on what they’ve seen before. But sometimes, they might be wrong. Still, they shouldn’t blame their past experience, because experience often teaches us that things can be uncertain, especially when different events don’t always follow the same pattern.

Not all results happen for sure just because we think they should. Some things always happen together everywhere and always, but others change and don’t always match what we expect. So, when we think about facts, there are many levels of certainty—from completely sure to just kind of likely. A smart person believes something only as much as the evidence supports it. If their past experience is very reliable, they expect the same to happen again.

In other situations, they are more careful. They look at all the different results and see which side has more proof. They lean toward the side with more evidence but still feel unsure. When they make a decision, it’s mostly based on what’s likely, not guaranteed. Probability means there are some results that go one way and some the other, but one side is stronger. For example, if 100 experiments show one thing and 50 show the opposite, we can’t be super sure. But if 100 show one thing and only 1 shows the opposite, we can feel pretty confident.

We always have to compare the opposite results and subtract the smaller number to understand how strong the evidence really is.

To apply this idea, one of the most common and important ways we learn is by listening to what other people say and what witnesses report. This kind of reasoning might not be about cause and effect, but it works because we usually trust people to tell the truth and because facts often match what witnesses say.
