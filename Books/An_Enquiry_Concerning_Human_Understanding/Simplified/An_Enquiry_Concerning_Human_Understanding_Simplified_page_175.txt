Even animals seem to believe in the outside world, and this belief guides everything they think and do.

People also naturally think that the images they see with their senses are the real objects themselves. For example, the table we see as white and feel as hard is believed to exist on its own, outside our minds. It doesn’t stop existing just because we’re not there to see it. It stays the same no matter if anyone is around to notice it.

But this common belief is challenged by simple philosophy, which tells us that the mind only ever has access to images or perceptions. Our senses bring these images to us, but they don’t connect us directly to the real object. When we move away from the table, it looks smaller, but the real table doesn’t change. So, what we actually have in our minds is just a picture of the table, not the table itself. Anyone who thinks carefully accepts that what we call “this house” or “that tree” are really just images or copies in our minds of things that exist on their own.

Because of this, we have to give up our natural instincts and accept a new way of understanding what our senses tell us. But philosophy runs into big problems when trying to explain this new idea and answer skeptics who doubt it. It can’t rely on natural instinct anymore, because that instinct supports the old, now-questioned belief. And proving this new system with clear and convincing reasons is beyond what any human can do.

How can anyone prove that the images in our minds must come from real external things that are different from those images, instead of coming from the mind itself, or from some invisible spirit, or from some other cause we don’t understand?
