In the argument above, we assumed that the proof behind a miracle might be strong enough to fully convince us, and that if the proof was false, that would be a real surprise. But it’s easy to show that we’ve been too generous in this idea, and that no miracle has ever been proven with such complete evidence.

First, in all of history, there isn’t a miracle confirmed by enough people who are very smart, educated, and clear-minded enough to make sure they aren’t mistaken. These people would also have to be honest, so no one suspects them of trying to trick others. They would need to be well-respected, with a lot to lose if caught lying. At the same time, the miracle would have to happen in a very public and famous place, so that it couldn’t be hidden or denied. All these things are needed to fully trust what people say.

Second, we can see something in human nature that actually makes us less sure about believing any strange and amazing event just because people say it happened.

Usually, we think that things we haven’t seen before are like things we have seen. We believe what usually happens is more likely, and when there are different ideas, we should trust the ones based on the most past experience. So, we often reject stories that seem very strange or unbelievable. But, when something is said to be totally crazy or miraculous, our minds sometimes believe it more because it’s so surprising. The feeling of wonder from miracles is exciting and makes us want to believe in them. Even people who can’t believe these stories themselves still enjoy hearing about them or making others amazed.
