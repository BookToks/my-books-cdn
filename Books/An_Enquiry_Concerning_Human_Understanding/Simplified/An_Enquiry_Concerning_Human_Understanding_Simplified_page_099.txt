The difference between fiction and beliefs is about a feeling that comes with beliefs but not with fiction. This feeling isn’t something we can just turn on or off by choice. It happens naturally, based on the situation our mind is in at the moment. Whenever we remember or see something, our imagination automatically connects it to something else that usually goes with it. This connection comes with a feeling that is different from just daydreaming. This feeling is what belief is all about. For example, if I see a billiard ball moving toward another on a smooth table, I can imagine it might stop when they touch. That idea doesn’t contradict anything. But the feeling I get when I imagine the ball hitting and moving the other ball is different.

Trying to clearly define this feeling of belief might be really hard or even impossible—kind of like trying to explain what cold or anger feels like to someone who’s never felt them before. The word “belief” is just the name for this feeling, and everyone knows what it means because we all feel it all the time. Still, it might help to describe it a bit so we can understand it better by comparing it to other things. Belief is basically a stronger, clearer, and more steady way of imagining something than just using imagination alone. These words are just trying to explain how belief makes real things feel more present and important to us than made-up ones, and how belief affects our feelings and imagination. As long as we agree on what we’re talking about, the exact words don’t really matter.

Our imagination can control all its ideas and mix them in any way it wants. It can even imagine made-up things with all kinds of details about where and when they happen.
