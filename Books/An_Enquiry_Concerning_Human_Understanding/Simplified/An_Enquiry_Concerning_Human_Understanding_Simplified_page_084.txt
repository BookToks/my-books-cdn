No object can figure out, just by what we see or feel, where it came from or what will happen because of it. Also, our thinking alone, without any experience, can’t really tell us what’s true or real.

People agree that we learn about causes and effects through experience, not just by thinking. For example, if you show two smooth marble pieces to someone who doesn’t know science, they won’t guess that the marbles will stick together strongly in one way but slide easily in another. Weird things like this, which don’t match what we usually see in nature, are only understood through experience. No one expects to figure out things like gunpowder exploding or magnets attracting objects just by thinking without seeing it happen. Also, when something depends on a complicated system or hidden parts, we know only experience can teach us about it. For example, no one can explain exactly why milk or bread is good food for humans but not for lions or tigers without experience.

But this idea might not seem so clear when it comes to things we’ve known since we were born, things that happen all the time in nature, and things we think depend on simple qualities without any hidden parts.

We often think we could understand these things just by thinking, without needing to see or experience them first. We imagine that if we suddenly appeared in the world, we could guess that one billiard ball would make another move when it hits it, without waiting to watch it happen. The reason this seems obvious is because we are so used to these events happening that our past experience hides the fact that we really needed it to understand them.
