This book was written by Mons. Montgeron, a judge in Paris who was known for his strong character. He believed deeply in his cause and is now said to be locked up in a dungeon because of his book.

There is another book in three volumes called Recueil des Miracles de l’Abbé Paris. It talks about many miracles and includes well-written introductions. But throughout the book, there is a silly comparison between the miracles of Jesus and those of the Abbé. It claims the proof for Abbé’s miracles is just as strong as for Jesus’ miracles. This is wrong because you can’t compare human stories to God’s truth, which inspired the Bible writers. If those writers were just human witnesses, the French author might be right to say the Jansenist miracles have even better proof.

Many of Abbé Paris’s miracles were proven right away by witnesses in a church court in Paris. This happened while Cardinal Noailles, a very honest and respected man, was in charge.

The next archbishop didn’t like the Jansenists and was picked because of that. Still, 22 church leaders in Paris begged him to check the miracles, which they said were well-known and clearly true. But he wisely chose not to get involved.

The Molinist group tried to prove one miracle, involving Madamoiselle le Franc, was fake. But their investigation was unfair—they only questioned a few Jansenist witnesses and tried to mess with them. Soon, they were overwhelmed by 120 new witnesses, most of whom were respected people in Paris, who all swore the miracle was real. They even made a formal request to the parliament, but the government told the parliament not to get involved.

People noticed that when others are very excited and passionate, they can come up with proof for even the most ridiculous things. Anyone who tries to find small mistakes in their stories usually ends up confused. If a fake story can survive that kind of test, it must be a very clever trick.
