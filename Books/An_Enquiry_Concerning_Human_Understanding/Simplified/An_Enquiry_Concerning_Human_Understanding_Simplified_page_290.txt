Berkeley’s idea called immaterialism is actually quite similar to a view called occasionalism, which was supported by a thinker named Malebranche. Hume, another philosopher, probably thought about both immaterialists and occasionalists when he talked about ‘modern metaphysicians.’ One of these occasionalists was Andrew Baxter, a Scottish philosopher who lived near Hume and had strong opinions about how matter doesn’t move on its own and what that means for religion.

The Scottish Common-Sense Philosophers wrote most of their important work after Hume, but some like Kames, Reid, and Beattie were alive during his time. They are all mentioned in letters included in this book.

Henry Home, also known as Lord Kames, was related to Hume and helped him when he studied in Edinburgh. He became a judge in 1752. Kames is famous for his ideas about feelings and beauty, but his writings about morality and religion are most important here. He believed that God gave us natural senses and instincts that we can trust to know what’s true.

Thomas Reid, a friend of Kames, agreed with him about trusting common sense. Reid was the biggest critic of Hume while Hume was alive. In 1764, Reid wrote a book that argued against the popular ‘theory of ideas’ and said that Hume’s extreme doubt about knowledge was wrong. Reid mainly focused on Hume’s earlier, more radical work called the Treatise. James Beattie also criticized the Treatise in his harsh essay from 1770, which might have made Hume publicly distance himself from that earlier work in 1775.

Nicolaus Copernicus was a Polish scientist and mathematician who came up with the first modern idea that the sun, not the Earth, is at the center of the solar system.
