When someone thinks deeply like the Stoics do, and feels really inspired by doing what’s right or helping others, even the worst pain can’t stop them from doing their duty. Sometimes, they might even smile or feel happy while going through terrible suffering. If this can happen in real life, it’s even easier for a philosopher, alone or at school, to imagine being strong and brave through the worst pain or disasters they can think of. But how can they keep feeling that strong all the time? Their mind can get tired and lose focus. Other things distract them, bad luck can hit suddenly, and slowly, the philosopher becomes more like an ordinary person.

“I get your comparison between Stoics and Skeptics,” said Philo. “But notice that even if the Stoic mind can’t always stay so high and perfect, it still keeps some of its strength. You can see this in how a Stoic acts in everyday life. The old schools, especially Zeno’s, showed amazing examples of courage and goodness that seem almost unbelievable today. 

“Similarly, someone used to thinking skeptically about how uncertain and limited our reason is won’t completely forget that idea when thinking about other things. But in what they believe and how they act, they might still be different from people who never thought about these things or who trust human reason more.

“No matter how far someone takes skeptical ideas, they still have to live and act like everyone else. They don’t need any special reason for this except that it’s simply necessary. If they go beyond this and study nature or morals for fun, it’s because they enjoy it. Also, everyone uses some philosophy in daily life without realizing it. From being babies, we learn more general rules about how to live and think. The more experience and reasoning we have, the better these rules get. Philosophy is just doing this thinking in a more organized and careful way. Thinking about big questions isn’t really different from everyday thinking, but philosophy tries to be more steady and maybe more accurate because it’s more careful.
