If you pause for a moment or try to come up with a deep or complicated reason, you are basically giving up on the question. You're admitting that it’s not logical thinking that makes us believe the future will be like the past and expect the same results from similar causes.

This is the main idea I wanted to explain here.

If I’m right, I’m not claiming to have found something amazing. But if I’m wrong, then I have to admit I’m a pretty slow learner, since I can’t find an argument that I have actually known since I was a baby.
