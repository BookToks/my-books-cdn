When he wakes up from his dream, he will be the first to laugh at himself and admit that all his complaints were just for fun. He will realize that people are strange because they have to act, think, and believe things, even though they can’t fully understand why or solve all the problems that come up.

There is a softer kind of doubt called academic philosophy, which can last longer and be helpful. This kind of doubt comes from extreme skepticism but is softened by common sense and thinking carefully. Most people naturally want to be sure about their opinions. Since they only see one side and don’t know any arguments against it, they quickly believe in what they like and don’t accept others’ views.

People get confused or upset when they hesitate or have mixed feelings. They want to get out of that uncomfortable feeling fast, so they become very sure and stubborn in what they believe. But if these confident people understood how weak human thinking really is, even when it’s careful and smart, they would be humbler and less sure of themselves. They would also be kinder to people who disagree with them.

Uneducated people can see that even smart people, who study and think a lot, often still doubt themselves. And if some smart people are proud and stubborn, a little bit of skepticism could help lower their pride by showing them that the few things they know better than others don’t matter much compared to how confusing and mixed-up human nature really is.
