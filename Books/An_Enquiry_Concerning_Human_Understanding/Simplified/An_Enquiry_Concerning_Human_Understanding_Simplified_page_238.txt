I once thought about living there forever.

In 1765, I got the job of secretary at the embassy. That summer, Lord Hertford left because he became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. I was in charge until the Duke of Richmond arrived near the end of the year. At the start of 1766, I left Paris and went to Edinburgh the next summer, hoping to live quietly and study. I came back not richer, but with more money and a bigger income thanks to Lord Hertford’s help. I wanted to see what having extra money could do since before I had only enough to get by. But in 1767, Mr. Conway asked me to be Under-secretary, and because of him and my connection with Lord Hertford, I couldn’t say no. I went back to Edinburgh in 1769, with a good income of 1000 pounds a year, healthy, a bit older, and ready to enjoy life and watch my reputation grow.

In spring 1775, I got sick with a stomach problem. At first, I wasn’t worried, but now I think it might be deadly and can’t be cured. I expect to die soon. I have had little pain, and strangely, even though my body is getting weaker, my spirits are still high. If I had to pick a time in my life to live again, I might choose now. I am still excited to study and happy with friends. I know that dying at 65 means missing only a few years of weakness. I also see my literary fame growing even more, but I know I won’t have many years left to enjoy it. Right now, I feel very calm about life.

To finish by saying something about myself: I am, or rather was (because now I have to talk about myself this way), a calm and gentle person. I kept my temper, was friendly and cheerful, could form close bonds, but didn’t hold grudges, and was very balanced in my feelings. Even my love for fame, which was my main passion, never made me bitter, even after many disappointments. Young and carefree people, as well as serious learners, liked being around me. I especially enjoyed spending time with modest women, and they welcomed me warmly.

In short, many famous people have had to deal with lies and attacks about their lives, but I was never hurt or attacked by such things. Even though I sometimes annoyed both political and religious groups, they didn’t treat me as harshly as usual.
