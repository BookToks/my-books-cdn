The idea that empty space without stuff is impossible means the whole universe must be filled with matter, so the universe is like a solid mass. Because of this, for one piece of matter to move, another piece has to move out of the way. When that piece moves, something else has to fill its spot. So, everything moves in circles, and Descartes thought the universe is made of spinning whirlpools of matter called vortices. This explains why planets keep moving around the Sun in circles instead of flying off in straight lines. The Sun is at the center of a huge vortex, with smaller ones inside it, like the Moon’s vortex around Earth, and tiny vortices inside our bodies that make them work.

Aristotle’s old science tried to explain nature by saying things have purposes, but these explanations started to seem useless compared to the new science. For example, in Molière’s play Le Malade imaginaire, a character asks why opium makes people sleep. The answer is that opium has a “dormitive virtue,” which just means it has some mysterious power that causes sleep. This kind of explanation just uses fancy words to cover up the fact that we don’t really know why.

People realized these explanations didn’t really explain anything and wanted to avoid weird, mysterious causes. So, natural philosophers focused on causes that show how things actually happen, not why they have a purpose. They tried to explain things using qualities we can observe and understand, like size, shape, and movement. This is why Cartesian physics became popular—it explained everything using mechanical causes, like matter pushing and hitting other matter. This kind of cause feels familiar because we see it in everyday things like water and billiard balls, and it makes sense since it works through physical contact and simple shapes.
