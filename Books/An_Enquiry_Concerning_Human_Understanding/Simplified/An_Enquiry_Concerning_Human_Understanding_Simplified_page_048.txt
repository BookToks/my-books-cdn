Hume’s main idea in Part i of Section X is that when we judge how believable a story is, we have to think about more than just the people telling it. We also have to think about what the story is about. 

If the event in the story goes against everything we’ve ever seen or seems like a miracle, then our experience tells us it probably didn’t happen. So, when we decide if the story is true, we have to balance how trustworthy the witnesses are with how unlikely the event itself is.

Hume says, “No story is strong enough to prove a miracle unless it would be even more surprising if the story was false than if the miracle actually happened.” Even then, the arguments against and for the story cancel each other out, so we can only be as sure as the remaining evidence allows.

Hume is pointing out something important that people still use today: when checking evidence, you have to think about how likely the event is in the first place.

Hume’s rule makes it really hard for any story to prove a miracle. Then, in Part ii, he gives four reasons why this rule usually isn’t met, especially for miracles linked to religion.

First, no miracle has ever been backed up by enough reliable witnesses. Second, miracle stories are exciting and surprising, which makes people want to believe them more.
