If we accept this idea about secondary qualities, then the same must be true for what people call primary qualities like size and hardness. These primary qualities aren’t any more real than the secondary ones. We learn about size from what we see and feel. If all qualities we sense are actually in our minds and not in the objects themselves, then size must also be something in our minds because it depends on what we sense.

The only way to avoid this is by saying we get ideas of primary qualities by something called Abstraction, but if we think about that carefully, it doesn’t make sense. You can’t imagine size without seeing or feeling it. And you can’t think of something that has size but isn’t hard or soft, or isn’t any color at all. For example, try to imagine a triangle that isn’t any specific type like isosceles or scalene, and that doesn’t have any particular side lengths or angles. You’ll see how impossible that is. This shows how wrong the old ideas about abstraction and general ideas are.

The first philosophical problem with trusting our senses or believing in things outside us is this: if our belief comes from natural instincts, it goes against reason. But if it comes from reason, it goes against our natural instincts. Also, this belief doesn’t have solid proof to convince someone who looks at it fairly.

The second problem goes even further. It says this belief goes against reason if we accept that all qualities we sense are only in our minds, not in the objects. If you take away all the understandable qualities of matter, both primary and secondary, you basically destroy it. Then all you have left is some unknown, unexplainable thing causing our sensations. This idea is so unclear that no skeptic would even bother arguing against it.

Some people might think skeptics are being extreme by trying to destroy reason with arguments, but this is actually what they aim to do.
