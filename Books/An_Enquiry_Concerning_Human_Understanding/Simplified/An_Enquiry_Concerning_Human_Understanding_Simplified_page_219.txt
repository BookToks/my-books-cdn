But when we think about things beyond human life and the stuff around us—like what happened before and after everything we know now, how the universe was made, the existence of spirits, and the idea of one all-powerful, all-knowing spirit that has always existed and will always exist—we have to admit that these ideas are way beyond what our minds can fully understand.

When we stick to topics like business, morals, politics, or criticism, we can use common sense and what we’ve experienced to support our ideas. This helps us trust our conclusions more and makes us less doubtful, even if some of the reasoning is very detailed or complicated. But when we talk about religious ideas, we don’t have this kind of help. These topics are so huge and hard to understand that it’s like being a stranger in a new country, where everything feels confusing and you’re always worried about breaking the rules. We don’t really know if we can trust our usual way of thinking here because even in everyday life, we often rely on instincts or habits we can’t fully explain.

Skeptics say that if we think about reason in the most basic way, it actually argues against itself. They believe we wouldn’t be able to be sure about anything if it weren’t for the fact that skeptical arguments are so detailed and complicated that they can’t fully cancel out the stronger, more natural arguments that come from what we see and experience.

But it’s clear that when our arguments don’t match everyday life, the most detailed skeptical arguments can stand up to them and balance each other out. Neither side is stronger. Our minds get stuck in the middle, not sure what to believe, and that’s what skepticism wins by.

But I notice, Cleanthes says to Philo and other skeptical thinkers, that what you say and what you actually do don’t match, whether it’s in complex theories or everyday life.

Whenever there is clear evidence, you believe it, even though you claim to be skeptical. And I see some skeptics are just as sure about some things as those who say they are certain.
