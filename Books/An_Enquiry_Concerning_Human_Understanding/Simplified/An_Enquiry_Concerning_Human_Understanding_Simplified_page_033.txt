At first, Hume used a tool called the Copy Principle to show that some ideas don’t have real impressions behind them (E 2.9). But later in the Enquiry, he uses it in a less harsh way. Instead of rejecting ideas, he uses it like a “new microscope” (E7.4) that helps make ideas clearer by showing where they come from and what impressions they copy.

We’ll see that in Section VII, he mainly uses this “microscope” to explain the idea of necessary connection. There are also small hints of it in Section XII, where he talks about ideas like extension (E12.15), space, and time (E12.20 endnote [P]).

Section III talks about how our ideas naturally follow and join each other in patterns. Originally, this section was longer, but Hume cut it down after 1772, removing a big part about how ideas connect in literature (see pp. 178–83). He explains that all these connections come from three main types: Resemblance, Contiguity (being near in time or place), and Cause or Effect.

The section ends simply, with Hume saying he can’t find any other types of connections but also can’t prove there aren’t more. This doesn’t bother him much because it doesn’t affect the rest of his argument. The main point of talking about associations is to compare them to how custom works. In Section V (E5.20), Hume says custom, which is like an instinct we have for understanding facts, works kind of like the way ideas connect.

Section IV is where things get serious. Hume starts his famous skeptical argument here. In his earlier work, the Treatise, he used the Copy Principle to reject many fake ideas, like material substance (T1.1.6.1), existence (T1.2.6.2–5), solidity (T1.4.4.12–14), mental substance (T1.4.5.3–4), and the self as a simple, individual thing (Appendix,11).
