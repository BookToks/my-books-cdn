Using his new math tool called calculus, he showed that a force following his second law would make objects move in elliptical orbits in space. It also explained why projectiles near Earth follow a curved path and speed up as they fall. Plus, the number needed in both cases was the same, which strongly proved his theory and Galileo’s idea that the same laws apply to things both in space and on Earth.

Even though this worked well, many people found the idea of gravity acting over a distance without anything connecting objects hard to understand and kind of mysterious. Newton answered this in the second edition of his book Principia by saying he didn’t make up any guesses about why gravity works. He believed that if his formulas matched what we see happening, then his theory was good enough. He thought it wasn’t necessary to guess about the true cause of gravity unless new evidence showed up.

This practical way of thinking later influenced the philosopher Hume, who applied it to all causes, not just gravity. Among scientists, Newton’s theory won because it was accurate and could predict things well. But people still wanted to fully understand how it worked.
