A CHRONOLOGY OF DAVID HUME

1707 The kingdoms of England and Scotland joined together to make the new Kingdom of Great Britain with one parliament, led by Queen Anne.

1711 David Hume (originally spelled Home) was born in Edinburgh on April 26. He spent most of his childhood at Ninewells, the family home in Chirnside, near Berwick upon Tweed.

1713 Hume’s dad, Joseph Home, died, leaving his wife Katherine and their three kids: John, Katherine, and David.

1714 George I became king of Britain, starting the Protestant House of Hanover.

1715 The first Scottish Jacobite Rebellion happened to support James Francis Edward Stuart, the Catholic son of James II, known as ‘The Old Pretender’.

1723 Hume started studying at Edinburgh University and stayed there until 1725 or 1726 but did not finish a degree.

1726–33 He studied Law until 1729 but then got interested in new ideas and focused on Philosophy.

1734 After being sick for a long time, Hume tried working in banking in Bristol. He changed his last name from ‘Home’ to ‘Hume’ so English people would say it right.

1734–7 He lived in France, first in Rheims and then in La Flèche, writing his book Treatise of Human Nature.

1739–40 The Treatise of Human Nature was published without his name. Books I and II came out in January 1739, Book III in November 1740, and an Abstract was published in March 1740.

1741–2 The first edition of Essays, Moral and Political was published in two volumes and became more popular than the Treatise.

1745 Hume tried to get a teaching job at Edinburgh University but failed because an anonymous pamphlet said he was a ‘Universal Sceptic’ and believed in ideas that led to atheism. He responded with a letter called A Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend in Edinburgh.
