Objects are too detailed to stay the same for long, so we have to notice them quickly using natural skill that gets better with practice and thinking. Because of this, it’s pretty important in science to just know how the mind works, to separate its different actions, put them in the right groups, and fix the confusion that happens when we think about them carefully.

Organizing and telling these actions apart is easy when it’s about things we see and touch, but it becomes way more valuable when it’s about the mind because it’s harder and takes more effort. Even if we only manage to map out the different parts and powers of the mind, that’s still something to be proud of. And the more this topic seems simple (which it isn’t), the more people who pretend to be smart but don’t understand it should be looked down on.

There’s no reason to think this kind of study is unsure or fake unless we doubt everything, even thinking and doing things.

It’s clear that the mind has many abilities, that these abilities are different from each other, and that what we can notice clearly can be understood better by thinking about it. So, there are true and false ideas about the mind, and these truths and lies can be understood by people. Some differences, like between choosing to do something and understanding, or between imagining and feeling emotions, are easy for anyone to get. More complicated differences are also real and true, even if they’re harder to understand. Recent discoveries in this area show how solid and dependable this kind of knowledge is.

Should we think it’s more important for a philosopher to explain the planets and their order in space than to value those who explain the parts of the mind that we all use every day?

Maybe, if philosophy is studied carefully and people pay attention, it can go even further and discover, at least a little, the hidden causes and rules that make the mind work the way it does.
