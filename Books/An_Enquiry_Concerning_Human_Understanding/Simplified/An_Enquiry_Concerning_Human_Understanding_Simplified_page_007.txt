In the 1600s and 1700s, a way of thinking called scholastic Aristotelianism, which had been popular for hundreds of years, started to lose its hold. A new, modern scientific way of looking at the world began to take over. René Descartes (1596–1650) was the first big thinker to challenge Aristotle’s ideas, building on discoveries made by Galileo and others.

Then, in the next generation, John Locke (1632–1704) created a new view of the world that included scientific ideas from England, especially those from Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton. By the end of the 1600s, scholasticism was mostly fading away, but philosophers still argued a lot as they tried to understand the world and our place in it, keeping up with the new discoveries.

Some of these arguments were about science, but many were about knowledge itself—how we know things—and the philosophy of science. Some debates also involved religion. Descartes and Locke both tried to connect these ideas. Later, other thinkers like Nicolas Malebranche (1638–1715) and George Berkeley (1685–1753) built on their work in new ways.

Even with all these different ideas, these philosophers agreed on some important points. They believed the world was created by a divine reason (like a smart creator) and that humans could understand the world because of this. David Hume was important because he was the first major philosopher to question these beliefs.

Hume argued that human reason is really like animal instinct, not some special divine insight. Because of this, science should be based on experiments and carefully studying what we observe, not just on guessing or thinking about things without proof. This was a very new idea at the time.

Later, in the 1900s, science like relativity and quantum mechanics showed that even if something is hard for us to understand, it can still be true. This proved that Hume’s way of thinking about science was right.
