My friend says you admire philosophy’s lucky ability to come up with ideas that seem natural and true across all times and places. But the stubborn blind belief you complain about, which hurts philosophy so much, actually comes from it. This belief teams up with superstition and then turns against philosophy, becoming its worst enemy.

In the early days, people didn’t have books or schools, so they made simple ideas about religion that fit what they could understand. Their beliefs were mostly based on stories passed down, not on careful thinking or arguments. After the first shock from new philosophical ideas, teachers and superstition seemed to get along well. They divided people between them—philosophers took the smart and educated, while superstition kept the common and uneducated.

I say, it looks like you ignore politics and never think that a smart leader might worry about some ideas in philosophy, like those of Epicurus. He denied that gods exist, and that there is a future life or divine care. That could make people care less about right and wrong, which might be bad for society’s peace.

He replied that these attacks on philosophy never came from calm thinking or proof that philosophy is harmful. They came from anger and bias. But what if I said Epicurus could have defended himself well if accused by the troublemakers back then? He could have shown that his ideas were just as good for people as those of his enemies, who wanted everyone to hate and fear him.

I said, I wish you would try to speak up for Epicurus on this surprising idea. Make a speech that wouldn’t just convince the noisy crowd in Athens—if that city even had a crowd like that—but the more thoughtful people who could really understand his reasons.
