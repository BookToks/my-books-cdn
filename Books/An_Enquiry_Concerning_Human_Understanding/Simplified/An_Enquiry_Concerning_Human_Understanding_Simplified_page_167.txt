What should a philosopher think about people who, instead of focusing on the world we live in now, completely flip the idea of nature? They see this life as just a small step to something bigger, like a porch leading to a huge building, or a prologue that only sets up the real story. Where do you think these people get their ideas about gods? Probably from their own imagination. If they got their ideas from what actually happens around us, those ideas wouldn’t point to anything beyond this life—they would match what we see exactly.

It’s possible that gods have qualities we haven’t seen yet, or act in ways we can’t understand. That’s okay to think about, but it’s only a guess. We can only believe in qualities or actions of gods based on what we actually see happening.

Is there any sign of fairness in the world? If you say yes, then it means fairness is real and works here. If you say no, then there’s no reason to think gods are fair like we understand fairness.

If you say gods are fair only sometimes but not fully, then you don’t have a reason to believe in any specific amount of fairness—only as much as you actually see.

So, my friends, I want to make this clear for those who disagree with me. We all see the same world and use what happens every day to guide how we act. We can’t use anything else to prove our ideas in court or government, or even in school or private thinking. Our minds can’t go beyond what our experience allows, no matter how much we wish it could.

When we look at nature and guess there is some smart force that created and still keeps everything in order, we are accepting something that is both uncertain and useless. It’s uncertain because it’s way beyond what humans can experience. It’s useless because, since we only understand this force from what happens in nature, we can’t use it to learn anything new or change how we behave.
