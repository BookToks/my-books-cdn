Wouldn’t it be silly if someone refused to accept Newton’s explanation of the rainbow just because it goes into detailed science about light, which they think is too complicated for people to understand? And what would you think of someone who doesn’t disagree with Copernicus and Galileo’s idea that the Earth moves, but still won’t believe it because they think it’s too amazing and far-fetched for humans to figure out?

There is a kind of ignorant doubt, as you noticed, that makes people reject anything they don’t easily understand. This kind of doubt stops people from learning new things, but it doesn’t stop them from believing in religion. In fact, some people who seem very doubtful still believe in strange ideas like witches, even though they won’t accept simple math proofs from Euclid.

On the other hand, smart and thoughtful doubters study the hardest parts of science carefully. They believe what the evidence shows them, even if it’s complicated or hard to imagine. They accept that things like light can be explained in detail, and that we understand how planets really move. But some things, like how food gives us energy or why matter sticks together, are still mysteries.

These careful doubters look at the proof for each idea separately and believe it as much as the evidence supports. They do this in science, math, morals, and politics. So why shouldn’t they do the same with religion and theology? Why should religious ideas be rejected just because people assume that human reason isn’t good enough, without even checking the evidence? Acting like that shows clear bias and strong feelings, not fair thinking.

The skeptic might try to say that science and everyday life, or one kind of science and another, are different. But the reasons and proofs used in all of them are pretty much the same and just as strong.

If there is any difference, theology and natural religion actually have the strongest reasoning. Many ideas in mechanics are based on very complex thinking, yet no one who knows science seriously doubts them. The idea that the Earth moves (the Copernican system) is very surprising and goes against what we naturally think and see. Still, even religious leaders who used to fight against it have had to accept it now.
