The Sceptical Argument About Induction is probably the most famous idea in English philosophy.

Imagine you see one loose billiard ball hit another one. You’d expect the second ball to move, right? But how do you really know that it will? Hume says that when we believe this, it’s because we think one thing causes the other to happen.

So, where do these ideas about cause and effect come from? They come from experience, because we can’t know them just by thinking about them. But to learn from experience, we have to be able to guess things beyond what we’ve actually seen. For example, we assume that billiard balls we haven’t seen will act like the ones we have seen, and that the rules of cause and effect won’t suddenly change.

This means all our beliefs about things we haven’t seen are based on the idea that the future will be like the past. But this idea needs a good reason to believe it. Hume asks if anyone can explain this reason, especially if they say it’s based on logic. 

Hume looks at all possible ways to justify this idea that the future will be like the past. Around the same time, a letter explained that philosophers usually divide evidence into four types: obvious, proven by logic, based on what we see or sense, and based on habits or past experience.

Hume says the idea that the future will be like the past can’t be based on obvious truth or logical proof, because we can imagine the future being different. It also can’t be based on what we sense, because our senses don’t show us the true powers or causes behind things. We only learn about these powers by seeing how things act in real life, not by just looking at them.
