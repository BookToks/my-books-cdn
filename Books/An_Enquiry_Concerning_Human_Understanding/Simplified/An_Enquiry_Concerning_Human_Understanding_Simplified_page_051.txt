The idea of a god is probably weak (E 11.25–7). Hume also points out two other problems: it’s hard to say anything for sure about a cause we only see once (E11.25‒6), and it’s even harder if that cause is something totally unique (E11.30).

In Section XII, called ‘Of the Academical or Sceptical Philosophy,’ Hume talks about many skeptical ideas and explains his own careful view of them. He agrees that many skeptical points can’t be easily disproved, but he doesn’t want to go too far and become extremely skeptical just for the sake of it. For example, he briefly compares extreme doubt, like Descartes’ method (E 12.3–4), which tries to question everything, with a more balanced and humble approach that he supports.

Next, Hume looks at different kinds of skepticism that come from specific problems instead of just doubting everything from the start. These take up most of Part i and all of Part ii.

First, he talks about how we believe in the world around us through our senses. Hume says this belief comes from a “blind and powerful instinct of nature” (E 12.8). But this leads us to confuse real objects with the pictures our minds create. This is tricky because our mental images are quick and changeable (E12.9). To explain this, philosophers like Locke say that real physical objects cause those mental images but are different from them. Hume uses his ideas about cause and effect to show that this explanation can’t really be proven.

Since we only ever experience our own mental images and never directly see their causes, we can’t observe any real connection or “constant conjunction” between them (E7.28, 8.5). Even worse, an argument from Berkeley (E 12.15) shows that Locke’s theory isn’t just unproven but actually makes no sense.

Descartes used extreme doubt to get rid of old beliefs and claimed he found firm truths that no one could doubt.
