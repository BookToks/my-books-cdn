After the religious wars caused by these different groups, smart thinkers moved toward a kind of Christianity that accepted science and focused more on reason than just faith.

They stopped believing in the old idea of God doing miracles and special secrets. Instead, they saw God as the Great Designer. Christian ideas like Jesus becoming human and coming back to life were still based on the Bible, with miracles in the Bible helping prove Jesus and others were real. But newer, more controversial ideas were less important. They focused more on natural theology—understanding religion through reason and science.

From this view, the famous scientist Isaac Newton helped religion by showing how amazing God’s creation really is.

That’s why the poet Alexander Pope wrote: Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in night: God said, Let Newton be! and all was light.

Unlike some thinkers before and after, Enlightenment people in Britain didn’t see science and religion as enemies. They thought new discoveries showed how smart and kind God’s work was. Science became a way to understand God, like reading a big book of nature instead of just the Bible.

Many believed the Design Argument, which says God’s existence can be proven by the complexity of nature, was the strongest proof of natural religion.

Seeing God as the Great Designer and our reason as special made people think our ability to think is almost godlike, matching the Bible’s idea that we are ‘made in the image of God’.

While some of our actions come from instincts or feelings, like animals, our reason is unique. It helps us see truths, especially in math, that seem as clear as God’s own understanding.
