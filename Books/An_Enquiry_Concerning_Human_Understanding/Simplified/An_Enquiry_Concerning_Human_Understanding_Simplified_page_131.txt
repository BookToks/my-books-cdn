I have often thought about why everyone, even though they accept the idea of necessity in how things happen, still find it hard to admit it openly and instead like to say the opposite. I think this can be explained like this.

If we look at how the body works and how causes lead to effects, we see that we only know that certain things always happen together. Our minds get used to seeing one thing and then expecting the other to follow. But even after careful thinking, people still like to believe that they understand more, and that there is some real connection between cause and effect.

When people think about their own minds, they don’t feel the same kind of connection between reasons and actions. This makes them think that the way things happen in the body is different from how thoughts and choices work. But once we realize that we don’t actually know more about causes than just seeing things happen together and expecting the next thing, and that this happens in actions we choose too, it becomes easier to accept that the same necessity applies to all causes.

Even if this idea goes against what many philosophers say about free will, they usually only disagree in words, not in what they really believe. The kind of necessity I mean has never been truly rejected by any good thinker, and probably never will be.

Some might claim that the mind can see a deeper connection between cause and effect in the physical world, one that doesn’t happen in choices and thoughts. Whether this is true or not can only be found out by careful study, and those who say this need to explain clearly what this deeper necessity is and show it in how physical things happen.
