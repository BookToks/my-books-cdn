There are two main things that make us believe matter works in a certain way. First, we always see the same things happening together. Second, because of that, we expect one thing to follow another. Other than this, we don’t really understand any other reasons why things happen the way they do.

If it turns out that everyone agrees these two things happen not just in the world but also in human actions and thoughts, then everyone actually believes in this idea of necessity. People have only argued because they didn’t understand each other.

About the first thing, the regular way events happen: we can think about it like this. People’s actions are very similar everywhere and in all times. Human nature doesn’t change much. The same feelings and desires always lead to the same actions. Things like ambition, greed, self-love, vanity, friendship, generosity, and caring for others have always been the reasons behind what people do.

If you want to understand how the Greeks and Romans thought and acted, just look at how the French and English behave now. You’ll find they are pretty similar. People are mostly the same everywhere and at all times. History doesn’t show us anything totally new or weird about human nature. Its main job is to help us see the steady rules that guide how people act by showing us many examples from different situations.

Stories about wars, plots, fights, and big changes are like experiments. Politicians and philosophers use these stories to understand how people behave, just like doctors or scientists study plants and minerals by doing experiments.
