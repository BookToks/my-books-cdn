What we said about miracles also applies exactly the same to prophecies. In fact, all prophecies are real miracles. Because of this, only prophecies can be used as proof of a divine message. 

If it were normal for humans to predict the future, it would make no sense to use prophecy as proof of a mission or authority from heaven. 

So, in general, we can say that the Christian Religion not only started with miracles but even today, no reasonable person can believe it without a miracle. 

Just using logic is not enough to convince us itâ€™s true. Anyone who believes because of faith feels like a miracle is happening inside them. This miracle changes everything they understand and makes them decide to believe something that goes against their usual experience.
