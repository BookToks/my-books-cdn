But there is nothing in one event that is different from every other event that seems exactly the same, except that after seeing many similar events, our mind gets used to expecting one event to be followed by the other. This habit makes us believe they are connected. 

This feeling in our mind, where we jump from one thing to the next like we usually do, is the reason we get the idea of power or necessary connection. There is nothing else behind it. If you think about it carefully, you won’t find any other reason for this idea. 

This is the only difference between seeing one event, which never gives us the idea of connection, and seeing many similar events, which do. The first time someone saw one billiard ball hit another and make it move, they wouldn’t say the two events were connected, only that they happened together. But after seeing this many times, they say the events are connected. What changed to make them think this? Nothing except that now they imagine the events are connected and can easily expect one to happen after the other. 

So, when we say one thing is connected to another, we only mean that they have become linked in our minds and make us believe one proves the other will happen. This idea might seem strange, but it has good reasons behind it. And even if people doubt or question new and strange ideas, these conclusions fit well with doubt because they show how limited and weak human understanding really is.

What better example can we find of how weak and ignorant our understanding is than this? 

If there is any relationship between things that we really need to know perfectly, it is the cause and effect connection. All our reasoning about facts or what exists depends on this. Only because of it can we be sure about things that are not happening right now or that we don’t directly remember or see.
