Nature keeps most of her secrets hidden from us. We can only know a few obvious things about objects, like how they look or feel. But the real powers behind these objects, the things that make them work or affect us, are hidden. For example, our senses can tell us the color, weight, and texture of bread, but they can’t explain why bread can nourish and support our bodies. We can see or feel objects moving, but we don’t really understand the invisible force that keeps them moving without stopping unless they hit something else. 

Even though we don’t understand these hidden powers, we still expect things with similar looks and feels to act the same way. If we see bread that looks like the bread we ate before, we assume it will also give us nourishment. This is how our mind works, but it’s hard to explain why. There’s no clear connection between what we sense and the hidden powers, so it’s strange that our mind makes this kind of guess.

Experience only tells us about things we have seen or felt in the past, at that time and place. But why do we think this experience can tell us about the future or other things that just look similar? This is the big question. The bread I ate before gave me energy because it had certain hidden powers then. But does that mean every bread I see later will do the same? It doesn’t have to be true. Still, our mind makes this jump and assumes it will be true. This is a kind of thinking or guess that needs to be explained better.
