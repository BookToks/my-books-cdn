The queen in charge of France didn’t like the Port-Royal at all. She sent her own doctor to check out a supposed miracle, and the doctor ended up completely convinced it was real. The miracle was so clear and true that it saved the famous monastery from being destroyed by the Jesuits for a while. If it had been fake, these smart and powerful enemies would have found out and it would have ruined the people who faked it even faster.

Our religious leaders can make a big deal out of even tiny things. Imagine what they could have done with this miracle and other events I didn’t even mention! We would have heard a lot about famous people like Pascal, Racine, Arnaud, and Nicole. But if they want to be smart, they should accept the miracle because it’s worth way more than all their other stories. Plus, it could help their cause a lot. The miracle really happened when someone touched a holy thorn from the crown of thorns, and so on.

In general, if we only know a cause by what it does, we can’t guess that it will do something new or different. To make new things happen, the cause would need to have different or stronger powers than what we already know. We can’t just assume it has these new powers. Saying the cause keeps working the same way doesn’t help either because it’s impossible for it to be exactly the same at a different time or place. This idea is just a guess, and we have no proof of it from what we already see.

If the cause matches the effect exactly, it can’t have any powers that would make new or different things happen.

This idea comes from Dr. Berkeley. Actually, many of his writings teach us to doubt and question things, and he’s one of the smartest thinkers, even compared to old and new philosophers like Bayle. He says in his book’s title that he’s writing against both skeptics and people who don’t believe in God or have wild ideas.
