Section 4 of the Introduction says that people have completely free choice, but God still knows in advance what anyone would do in any situation. This “middle knowledge” lets God decide which possibilities to make real, without taking away the freedom of the people He creates.

Anne Le Franc was said to be cured of blindness and paralysis after praying to Abbé Paris.

Thibaut de Sylva: The healing of Marguerite Thibault was confirmed by Montgeron and the Recueil, and a doctor named Jean-Baptiste Silva looked into it because Hérault asked him to.

The Jews didn’t believe in the miracles of Jesus and his apostles; they thought it was witchcraft.

Jericho and St. Paul: The Bible story in Joshua (6:1–20) says the walls of Jericho fell down after the Israelites blew ram’s horn trumpets, following God’s orders. Then the Israelites killed almost everyone and even the animals, following God’s harsh rules from Deuteronomy (7:2, 20:16–17). In the Acts of the Apostles (16:25–26), an earthquake opened the prison doors and freed St. Paul and Silas.

Duc de Chatillon: Paul Sigismond de Montmorency (1663–1731) is mentioned in the Recueil.

Port-Royal: The Abbey of Port-Royal near Paris became a center for Jansenism in the 1630s, led by Jean Duvergier de Hauranne. It became famous for its teaching and books, especially Logic or The Art of Thinking (1662) by Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, which mixed Cartesian and Aristotelian ideas. When King Louis XIV and the Pope ended Jansenism, Port-Royal was shut down in 1709. Its buildings were destroyed, and even the bodies in the cemetery were dug up and thrown into a common grave.

Pascal: Blaise Pascal (1623–62) was a famous mathematician and religious thinker who often visited Port-Royal. His sister Jacqueline was a nun there from 1651. Pascal is best known for ‘Pascal’s Wager,’ which says it’s smart to believe in God because if you’re right, you get heaven, and if you’re wrong, you lose nothing.

Racine: Jean Racine (1639–99) went to school at Port-Royal. He was one of the most famous French playwrights of the 1600s, along with Molière and Corneille.
