A craftsman who works only with objects that don’t think or feel might get frustrated if things don’t go as planned, just like a politician trying to control people’s actions.  

Regular people often think that events are uncertain because the causes behind them fail to work properly, even though nothing is stopping them. But philosophers notice that in nature, there are many hidden forces and reasons that are so small or far away that we don’t see them. They realize that different events might happen not because the causes are random, but because opposite causes are secretly working against each other.  

This idea becomes clear when they look closely and see that different effects always come from opposite causes fighting each other.  

For example, a farmer might say a clock stops because it just doesn’t work right. But an expert knows that the clock’s spring or pendulum always pushes the gears the same way. If it stops, it might be because a tiny speck of dust is blocking the movement. From many examples like this, philosophers learn that every cause always leads to an effect, and when things seem uncertain, it’s because hidden opposite causes are interfering.  

In the human body, when health symptoms don’t show up as expected, or medicine doesn’t work like usual, doctors and philosophers aren’t surprised or confused. They understand that the body is a super complex machine with many secret powers we can’t fully understand. So, even if things seem uncertain on the outside, the natural laws inside the body are still working perfectly and regularly.  

Philosophers who think carefully must use the same idea when looking at people’s actions and choices. Strange or unexpected decisions can often be explained by understanding all the details about a person’s character and situation.
