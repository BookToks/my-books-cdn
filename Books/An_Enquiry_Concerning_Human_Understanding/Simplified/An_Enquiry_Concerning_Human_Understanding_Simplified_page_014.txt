So, the idea of this ‘mechanical philosophy’ wasn’t just popular with Descartes’ followers.

A different kind of mechanism came from the old Epicurean idea of atoms and was first supported by a French guy named Pierre Gassendi. But it became more popular in Britain, where scientists didn’t fully trust Descartes’ way of using only reason to discover science. Instead, they followed Francis Bacon, who believed experiments were really important.

Robert Boyle, a famous scientist from the 1600s, supported something called ‘corpuscularianism.’ He picked this name to avoid the atheist ideas linked to Epicurean atomism. Boyle was interested in chemistry and thought that all materials are made of tiny, invisible particles called ‘corpuscles.’ These particles and how they interact explain the properties we see in objects.

Boyle believed all corpuscles come from one ‘universal matter.’ Different things look and behave differently because their tiny particles have different sizes, shapes, movements, and arrangements. He said only the ‘primary’ qualities, like size and shape, really belong to an object. ‘Secondary’ qualities, like color, taste, or smell, are just how our senses react to the object, not real features of it.

Because primary qualities are about shapes and sizes, which can be described with math, this theory, like Descartes’, promised to explain how objects work using simple mechanical rules that could even be calculated. But unlike Descartes, Boyle thought that matter’s key features included not being able to be passed through (impenetrability) separate from size. This idea allowed for the possibility of space without matter in it, so atoms could be different from empty space, avoiding Descartes’ idea that space is completely filled with matter.

Boyle’s corpuscularianism became the main philosophy in Britain thanks to his friend John Locke, a philosopher who was very important later on.
