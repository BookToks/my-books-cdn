When we study gold, we can’t see its tiny building blocks directly. Instead, we understand gold by its visible features, like its color, weight, how it melts, and how it stays the same over time. These qualities help us recognize gold and give it its name. So, science has to be based on careful observation and experiments, not guessing about what’s inside things.

Sometimes Locke thought that if we had super detailed senses, we could figure out how tiny parts of anything move and fit together without doing experiments. He said if we knew the exact shape, size, texture, and movement of these tiny parts, we could predict how things would interact, like we know the properties of shapes like squares and triangles. But this idea is just a guess, and unlike Descartes, Locke didn’t try to figure out physical laws just by thinking alone.

Descartes wanted to explain everything perfectly with math and reason, especially in France where his ideas were popular. But his plan didn’t work well in real life. He tried to use geometry to explain how things move, but he couldn’t predict how things like flying objects or planets actually behave. Scientists like Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler showed that planets move in oval shapes, not circles, which didn’t fit Descartes’s vortex theory. This theory basically died in 1687 when Isaac Newton proved that a vortex couldn’t cause elliptical orbits.

Newton’s book, the Principia Mathematica, became one of the most important science books ever. It replaced Descartes’s ideas by creating laws that explained how things move on Earth and in space very accurately. Newton kept the idea that things keep moving unless a force stops them, which he called inertia. But unlike Descartes, Newton said space is mostly empty. He also introduced the idea of gravity, a force that pulls objects toward each other depending on their mass and how far apart they are.
