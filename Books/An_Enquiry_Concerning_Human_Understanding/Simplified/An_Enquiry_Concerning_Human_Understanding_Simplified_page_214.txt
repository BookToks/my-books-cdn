The physical reasons based on nature strongly suggest that the soul dies, and these are really the only logical arguments we should accept about this question or any fact.

When two things are so closely connected that every change in one causes a similar change in the other, we should expect that if the first thing is completely destroyed, the second will be destroyed too.

Sleep, which only slightly affects the body, causes the soul to become confused or even temporarily disappear.

The weakness of the body and mind in babies matches perfectly; their strength in adults; their shared sickness; and their slow decline in old age. The next step seems clear: both must die together.

The last signs the mind shows are confusion, weakness, numbness, and dullness—signs that it is about to end. The same causes that bring these on will eventually completely destroy the mind.

By looking at nature, no living form can keep going if it is put into a very different condition than the one it started in. Trees die in water; fish die in air; animals die in dirt.

Even small changes like moving to a different climate can be deadly. So why would we think the soul could survive the huge change caused by the body breaking down?

The soul and body share everything. The body’s parts are also the soul’s parts. So the soul must depend on the body to exist.

People accept that animals’ souls die, and animal souls are very similar to human souls. Their bodies don’t look more alike than ours do, but no one ignores the facts about their bodies. So the idea that souls move from one body to another is the only theory like this that makes sense.

Nothing in the world lasts forever. Everything, even things that seem solid, is always changing and breaking down. The whole world shows signs of aging and falling apart. So it doesn’t make sense to think that one thing, the soul—probably the weakest and most easily damaged—is immortal and can’t be destroyed. That idea is bold and careless!

Also, thinking about all the endless lives after death is confusing for religion. We can imagine every planet in the universe filled with smart, mortal beings. At least, that’s the only reasonable guess.
