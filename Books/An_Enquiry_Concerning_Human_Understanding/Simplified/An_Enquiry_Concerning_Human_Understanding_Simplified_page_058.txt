I have made it extremely correct; at least I believe that, if I were to live twenty Years longer, I shoud never be able to give it any further Improvements. (HLii.322) Hence the policy followed here, of carefully reproducing that 1777 edition, including its distinction between footnotes and endnotes, with footnotes being used for references to ‘Authorities’ and other relatively short comments, and endnotes generally containing the longer material. Whether the distinction has any deeper significance is now open for the reader to judge, but since the footnotes at E5.17 and E 7.8 are both longer than one or more of the endnotes, this at least suggests that length was not Hume’s only criterion.
 
 References to Other Editions The vast majority of the existing secondary literature on Hume refers to the Enquiryusing page numbers from the Selby-Bigge and Nidditch editions (Enquiries concerning Human Understanding and concerning the Principles of Morals (Clarendon Press, 1888, 1902, and 1975)).
 
 Hence page references to the 1975edition have been indicated throughout this text, using numbers in the outer margin. Beauchamp’s recent Clarendon edition has moved to a different method of reference,using section and paragraph numbers, which seems likely to become standard and is used here in the editorial material. Accordingly, paragraph numbers are also provided throughout the text, preceding every paragraph except the first of each section. Use of both methods of reference is already standard amongst Hume scholars, and required by the Hume Society’s journal Hume Studies. Hence this edition has been designed to accommodate both.
 
 I should like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the debt that I and other Hume scholars owe to Tom Beauchamp, for the painstaking work that he put into his excellent critical edition of the Enquiry.
