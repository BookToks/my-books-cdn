I think I have made it very accurate; at least, I believe that even if I lived for twenty more years, I wouldn’t be able to improve it any further. Because of this, we carefully copied the 1777 edition, including its way of using footnotes and endnotes. Footnotes are for short comments and references to ‘Authorities,’ while endnotes usually have longer information. Whether this difference means something more is up to the reader to decide. But since some footnotes are longer than some endnotes, it shows that length wasn’t the only rule Hume followed.

Most books and articles about Hume use page numbers from the Selby-Bigge and Nidditch editions of the Enquiry (published in 1888, 1902, and 1975).

That’s why this text shows page numbers from the 1975 edition in the outer margin. Beauchamp’s newer Clarendon edition uses a different way to refer to parts of the book, with section and paragraph numbers. This way is probably going to become standard and is used here in the editorial notes. So, paragraph numbers are also shown before every paragraph except the first one in each section. Using both page numbers and paragraph numbers is common among Hume experts and is required by the Hume Society’s journal, Hume Studies. This edition is made to support both ways.

I want to thank Tom Beauchamp for his hard work on his great critical edition of the Enquiry, which has helped me and other Hume scholars a lot.
