SECTION VII 60 Of the Idea of Necessary Connection* PART I

The big advantage of math over subjects like ethics is that math deals with clear and simple ideas you can see or imagine easily. The smallest difference between shapes or numbers is easy to notice, and the words we use always mean the same thing. For example, you won’t confuse an oval with a circle, or a hyperbola with an ellipse. Shapes like isosceles and scalene triangles have exact rules that separate them, unlike ideas about right and wrong, which are less clear. When a word is defined in geometry, your brain automatically remembers that definition every time. Even if there’s no definition, you can just picture the shape clearly in your mind. But when it comes to feelings, thoughts, or emotions, things get tricky. These ideas are different but hard to keep track of, and we can’t always bring them back clearly when we want to think about them again. Because of this, our thinking can get mixed up. We might think two things are the same when they’re not, and our conclusions can end up very different from what we started with.

[2] Still, you can say that math and moral ideas both have their good and bad points, and they kind of balance each other out. The mind can hold math ideas clearly, but solving hard math problems means you have to think through a long chain of steps and compare ideas that are very different. On the other hand, moral ideas can get confusing if you’re not careful, but the arguments are usually shorter and have fewer steps than math problems. In fact, even the simplest statement in Euclid’s geometry has more parts than most moral arguments that don’t get too complicated or dreamy.
