Now, there’s a question that helps solve this problem. When we see or remember one thing, does our mind also think of the related thing more clearly and strongly than usual? This seems to happen with cause and effect. If it’s true for other connections too, then it might be a general rule for how our mind works.

For example, when we see a picture of a friend who isn’t there, the idea of that friend feels more alive because of the resemblance. Any feelings we have, like happiness or sadness, become stronger. This happens because there’s both a connection and something we’re seeing at the moment. But if the picture doesn’t look like the friend or wasn’t meant to be them, it won’t make us think of them. And if both the picture and the friend are missing, even if the mind jumps from one thought to the other, the idea feels weaker, not stronger. We like looking at a friend’s picture when it’s right in front of us, but if it’s gone, we’d rather think about the friend directly than just remember their image.

The ceremonies in the Roman Catholic religion show this too. People who follow these ceremonies say that the actions, movements, and postures help keep their devotion strong. Without these, their feelings of faith might fade because they’re thinking about things that are far away or invisible. They use physical symbols and images to make their faith feel more real and close to them than just thinking about it. Things we can see or touch usually affect our imagination more than just ideas, and this feeling easily spreads to the related thoughts and images. From these examples, we can see that resemblance and something present together often make ideas feel more alive, proving this idea works in many cases.
