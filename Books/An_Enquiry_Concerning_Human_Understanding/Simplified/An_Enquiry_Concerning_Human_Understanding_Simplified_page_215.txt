For these ideas, a new universe would have to be made every generation, outside the one we live in now. Or, a universe huge enough to allow new beings all the time must have been created at the very start. Should any philosophy accept such wild ideas just because they might be possible?

When people ask if Agamemnon, Thersites, Hannibal, Nero, or every foolish person from places like Italy, Scythia, Bactria, or Guinea are still alive, can anyone really believe that studying nature would give strong proof that they are? The lack of good reasons, without any special revelation, clearly shows the answer is no.

Pliny says it’s easier and more certain to believe what you can test and see for yourself. Our unconscious state before we were born seems to naturally prove that we will be unconscious after we die too.

If being scared of death was something we were born with, not just because we want to be happy, it would actually prove the soul dies.

Since nature never does things without a reason, it wouldn’t make us afraid of something impossible. Nature might make us afraid of something that’s going to happen for sure, like death, especially because we can sometimes delay it. Death will happen eventually, but humans wouldn’t survive if nature didn’t make us afraid of it.

We should be careful about believing ideas that just match what we want to feel.

The hopes and fears behind this idea are pretty obvious.

It’s a big advantage in any argument to prove that something doesn’t exist.

If a question is about something nobody has ever seen before, that alone almost proves it’s not true. How can we prove anything about a state of being no one has ever experienced or seen anything like? Who would trust any so-called philosophy enough to believe in such an incredible story?

We would need a new kind of logic for that, and new ways of thinking to understand it.

This really shows how much people owe to divine revelation because no other way could prove this important truth.
