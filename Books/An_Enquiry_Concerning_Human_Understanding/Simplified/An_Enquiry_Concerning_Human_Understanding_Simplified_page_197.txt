This is a useful guide that clearly and simply explains some of Hume’s main ideas. It also shows which ideas he thought were the most important for his philosophy.  

It’s interesting that the way this summary is organized looks more like a different book Hume wrote later, called the first Enquiry, even though that book wasn’t published for another eight years. For more details about this, you can read my essay ‘The Context, Aims, and Structure of Hume’s First Enquiry’ (chapter 1 of Peter Millican’s book, Reading Hume on Human Understanding, OUP, 2002).

The text here comes from the original version, with numbers in the margin matching pages from the standard Selby-Bigge and Nidditch edition of the Treatise and Abstract (OUP, 2nd edition, 1978).

AN ABSTRACT OF A BOOK lately Published; called A TREATISE OF Human Nature, where the MAIN ARGUMENT of that BOOK is explained more clearly.

PREFACE

My goal with this short summary might seem a bit unusual—I want to make a bigger, harder book easier to understand by making it shorter. People who aren’t used to deep thinking often lose track when an argument is very long and full of details, objections, and examples.

These readers will find it easier to follow a simple and clear chain of ideas, where only the main points are connected, shown with easy examples, and supported by a few strong reasons. When the ideas are closer together, it’s easier to compare them and see how the first ideas lead to the final conclusion.

The original work, which I’m summarizing here, has been called confusing and hard to understand. I think this is as much because it is very long as because the ideas are deep.
