Sometimes, the true nature of things and how they affect us can change, even if nothing about how they look or feel changes. This happens with some things, so why couldn’t it happen with all things? What reason do you have to be sure this can’t be true? You say your experience proves me wrong, but you don’t understand what I’m really asking.

As someone who acts in the world, I’m fine with that answer. But as someone curious about how things really work, and maybe a little doubtful, I want to know why you think that. No book or research has helped me understand this problem or made me feel sure about it. Maybe the best thing I can do is ask everyone about it, even if I don’t expect an answer. At least we’ll realize what we don’t know, even if we don’t learn more.

I have to admit, it’s really arrogant for someone to say an idea doesn’t exist just because they can’t figure it out. Also, even if smart people have looked for answers for a long time and found nothing, it might still be wrong to say humans can’t understand it at all. Even if we check all the ways we learn things and find them useless here, we might have missed something or made a mistake. But about this question, there are some reasons that make me think it’s not arrogant or wrong to doubt.

It’s clear that even the dumbest people, babies, and animals get better by learning from experience. For example, when a baby touches a candle and feels pain, they learn not to touch candles again. They expect the same thing to happen with anything that looks or feels like a candle. If you say the baby understands this because of some kind of reasoning or argument, then you need to show me what that argument is. You can’t just refuse to explain something fair like that.

You can’t say the argument is too hard to find, since you admit even a baby understands it.
