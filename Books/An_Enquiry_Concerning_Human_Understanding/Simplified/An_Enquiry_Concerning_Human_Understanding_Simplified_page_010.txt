The Reformation started in 1517 when Martin Luther challenged the Church of Rome. This caused a lot of religious wars because people disagreed about what was true. Some trusted the Church’s authority and traditions, while others believed that God worked directly inside each person. This made many people question old ideas, and scientists began to study the world more carefully.

Aristotle’s ideas about physics and space said that everything is made of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. Each element tries to move to its natural place in the universe. Earth is at the center, water surrounds earth, then air, and fire is the farthest out. So, stones fall down because they are mostly earth, and fire rises up. The stars and planets move in circles around the Earth because they are made of a special fifth element called “ether,” which Aristotle thought was a kind of crystal. These movements have a purpose: heavenly bodies move in circles because this is how they get closest to God, who never changes.

Around the Earth, the Moon, planets, Sun, and stars are arranged in rings made of crystal, like a giant clock in the sky. The outermost ring turns constantly, making the planets dance as seen from Earth. But the planets don’t move in perfect circles all the time. Sometimes they move backward for a while before going forward again.

To explain these strange movements, people added complicated ideas like epicycles, which are orbits inside orbits. The Greek scientist Ptolemy made this system around 150 AD, and it was accepted in Europe for almost 1,500 years.

In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus suggested that the Earth is actually a planet that moves around the Sun. But it wasn’t until the early 1600s that enough evidence was found to really challenge the old ideas of Ptolemy.
