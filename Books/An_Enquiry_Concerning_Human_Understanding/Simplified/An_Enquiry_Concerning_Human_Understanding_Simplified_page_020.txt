But 300 years ago, this was even harder to figure out because it was tied up with lots of religious ideas.

For example, not only did people believe that everything happens for a reason (causal determinism), but also that God creates and keeps the world going every moment (an idea Descartes talked about a lot). This made it seem like God was responsible for everything, even when people did bad things. Saying that not everything is decided might help with this problem, but then it would make people question if God is all-powerful (because some things would happen by chance) and all-knowing (because how could God know the future if it isn’t set yet?). Another problem was about grace and being saved, which became a big deal with the Protestant Reformers. They believed everyone is born with 'original sin' from Adam and Eve and is totally bad inside, so everyone deserves to be punished forever. Like Augustine said, Reformers believed only God’s grace can save us, given freely through faith in Jesus, not because of anything good we do. But then, if some people get this saving faith and others don’t, and it’s not based on how good they are, it seems like God must choose who gets it. If God chooses, then isn’t this grace impossible to resist?

Because of these ideas, many Protestants—especially John Calvin—believed in predestination. This means God decided from the very start who would go to heaven and who would go to hell, no matter how people lived their lives.

People who didn’t agree with Calvin thought this was horrible. It meant most people (even good Christians from other groups) were doomed to hell forever because of Adam’s sin, while God could easily save them by giving them faith but chooses not to, saving only a few.

Since eternal heaven or hell was at stake, religious arguments got very heated and sometimes angry. Hume, who lived in Calvinist Scotland, was careful not to openly criticize religion, even hiding his own risky ideas. The Roman Catholic Jansenists had similar beliefs, though most Catholics believed good deeds also helped save people.
