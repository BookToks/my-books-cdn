He didn’t write anything himself, and the works of his followers—like most ancient philosophers except Plato and Aristotle—were ignored during the early Christian times. Their ideas were mostly saved through a summary called Outlines of Pyrrhonism by Sextus Empiricus, a Greek from the third century AD. This was found again in the sixteenth century and had a big impact on making people question the beliefs of the Middle Ages. Descartes used these skeptical ideas to reject anything that can’t be seen clearly as true, including the old medieval philosophy, and this probably came from finding Sextus’s work again.

Plato (427–347 BC) was one of the most important ancient philosophers. He was very influential because he started the Academy in Athens. Later, his ideas became important to Christianity, especially through Augustine of Hippo (AD 354–430). After Plato, leaders like Arcesilaus (c. 315–242 BC) and Carneades (c. 213–129 BC) made the Academy famous for skeptical thinking. Their type of skepticism was less extreme than the Pyrrhonians’, accepting that some things seem more likely than others, even if nothing is certain. These ideas lasted into modern times mainly through Marcus Tullius Cicero, a Roman who studied briefly at the Academy and was also influenced by Stoicism.

It’s not clear how accurate Hume’s description of Pyrrhonian skepticism is compared to the original ideas. He sees a difference between ‘excessive’ Pyrrhonian skepticism, which he thinks means rejecting all beliefs, and ‘mitigated’ Academic skepticism, which is less extreme. According to him, Academic skepticism just refuses to accept absolute certainty but still allows us to judge which beliefs are more or less likely.

Hume also talks about another kind of ‘mitigated skepticism,’ which means we should only study things that fit within what humans can understand. He mostly calls himself an Academic skeptic in Part III of Section XII, but he also agrees with some skeptical ideas in other parts of his work. However, he clearly rejects extreme skepticism, both the Pyrrhonian kind and Descartes’s version, saying they don’t work and defeat themselves.

Epicurus and Epicureanism: Epicurus (341–271 BC) believed everything is made of atoms moving in an endless empty space. People live and die as part of nature, with no supernatural rules to follow and nothing to hope for or fear after death.
