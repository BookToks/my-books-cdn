Be a thinker, but while you think deeply, remember to stay human. Most people prefer easy ideas over complicated ones and don’t look down on the harder stuff. If everyone just liked their own way of thinking without judging others, it might be okay to let everyone have their own opinions. But since many people completely reject deep thinking or what we call metaphysics, we should think about why these deep ideas are actually important.

One big benefit of deep and detailed philosophy is that it helps the simple and kind ideas become clearer and better. Without deep thinking, simple ideas can’t be as exact or strong. All good books and stories show us different parts of human life and make us feel things like praise, blame, or laughter depending on what’s happening. A good artist needs not just talent and quick understanding but also a deep knowledge of how the mind works, how emotions work, and what makes people good or bad. Even though looking inside ourselves like this can be hard, it’s needed to describe life and behavior well. 

Think about an anatomist who studies the body and shows us things that might seem ugly. But this knowledge helps a painter create beautiful pictures of people like Venus or Helen. The painter uses bright colors and makes the figures look graceful, but they still need to know how the muscles, bones, and body parts really work. Being accurate always makes things more beautiful, and clear thinking helps us feel things more deeply. We can’t praise one and ignore the value of the other.

Also, in every job or skill, even those that involve action or practical things, having a careful and exact spirit helps us get closer to doing our best and makes our work better for everyone.
