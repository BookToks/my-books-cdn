When we watch how things happen in the world, all we ever see is one event happening after another. We don’t see any power or force that makes one event cause the next. It’s the same when we think about how the mind controls the body. We see that the body moves after the mind decides to, but we can’t see or understand any connection or energy that links the mind’s decision to the body’s movement. Even how the will controls our thoughts and actions is just as hard to understand. So, it seems like in all of nature, there is no connection we can actually understand. Events just happen one after another, but we never see a real link between them. They look connected, but they aren’t.

Since we can’t imagine anything that we haven’t seen or felt, the only conclusion is that we don’t really have any idea of connection or power at all. These words don’t really mean anything when we use them in philosophy or everyday life.

But there is one way to avoid this problem, and one idea we haven’t looked at yet. When we see something happen, no matter how smart we are, we can’t guess what will happen next without experience. Even after seeing one event follow another once, we can’t say for sure that it will always happen that way. It’s crazy to decide how everything in nature works based on just one example, no matter how clear it is. But if one type of event always happens with another type, every single time, then we stop doubting and start expecting one to follow the other. This is how we learn to predict things and use that to know facts about the world. We call the first event the Cause, and the second the Effect. We believe there is some connection or power that makes the cause always produce the effect, working with certainty and necessity.

So, this idea of a necessary connection between events comes from seeing many examples where these events always happen together. But this idea can never come from looking at just one event, no matter how carefully we examine it.
