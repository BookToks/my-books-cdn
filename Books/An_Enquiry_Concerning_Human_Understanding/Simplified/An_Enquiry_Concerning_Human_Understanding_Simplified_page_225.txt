APPENDIX IV Excerpts from Hume’s Letters

These excerpts help us understand different parts of Hume’s Enquiry and its background. Some talk about the Treatise of Human Nature, Hume’s first book, published in 1739 (Books I and II) and 1740 (Book III). Hume was not very happy with that early work. As he says in ‘My Own Life’ (see Appendix V), he decided to rewrite the material to make the two Enquiries and the Dissertation on the Passions. The first Enquiry kept what was left from Book I and the Book II parts about ‘Liberty and Necessity.’

Other excerpts focus on the religious parts of the Enquiry, especially the controversial Section X about miracles. Hume knew these skeptical ideas would upset some people, and it’s interesting to see how his attitude changed over time in these letters.

To Henry Home, from London, 2 December 1737

Hume wrote this letter to his relative Henry Home (later called Lord Kames) about some parts he was removing from his Treatise of Human Nature before publishing it. He says he is cutting out parts, probably about religion, that might offend Dr Joseph Butler, an Anglican bishop who had published an important book on religion the year before. Hume wanted to give Butler a copy of the Treatise, hoping for a good opinion.

The letter shows that the Treatise wasn’t finished and that Hume cared about what his philosophy said about religion right from the start. It also shows that Hume had written about miracles more than a year before the Treatise came out. This goes against the old idea that the religious parts were added later just to make the book more interesting or to cause a stir. Instead, it shows he was seriously thinking about these topics.

Having a frank letter, I decided to use it, and I’m sending you some thoughts about miracles. I once wanted to publish them with the rest, but I’m afraid they might offend people, especially with how the world is now. Some ideas and the way I wrote them might not seem right because they’re missing the rest of the book. But you can judge how strong the argument is on its own. Let me know what you think. Is the style too long-winded?
