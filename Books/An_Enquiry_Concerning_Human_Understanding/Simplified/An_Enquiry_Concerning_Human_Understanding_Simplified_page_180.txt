Sometimes, things disappear quickly, like smoke, and even the biggest doubters end up in the same situation as everyone else.

So, a doubter should stick to their area and focus on deep questions. Here, they seem to have a lot to say. They rightly point out that all our proof about facts beyond what we see or remember comes from cause and effect. We only understand cause and effect as two things that often happen together. But we have no real reason to believe that just because two things happened together before, they will always happen together. The only reason we think that is because of habit or a natural feeling inside us. This feeling is hard to ignore, but it can be wrong. When doubters talk about this, they show how weak we all are in knowing the truth. For a while, it might seem like nothing is certain. These ideas could be explained more, but only if they helped society in a lasting way.

The biggest problem with being too doubtful is that it doesn’t help anyone in the long run. We can ask a doubter what their point is or what they want to achieve with all their questioning. Often, they don’t have a clear answer. Someone who supports the Copernican or Ptolemaic view of space hopes to convince others with their ideas. A Stoic or Epicurean has beliefs that can last and guide how people live. But a Pyrrhonian skeptic can’t expect their ideas to have a lasting effect on anyone’s mind or to help society. In fact, if everyone believed in total doubt like that, life would stop. People would do nothing and just wait to die because their basic needs wouldn’t be met.

Luckily, this terrible result is unlikely. Nature is stronger than any idea. Even if a Pyrrhonian skeptic can confuse people for a moment with deep thoughts, the smallest event in life will clear away their doubts and make them act just like anyone else, whether they believe in a philosophy or not.
