2.1 When Hume talks about different parts of the mind, he mainly separates ‘understanding’ (or ‘reason’) and ‘will’. But he also mentions other parts like the senses (sight, touch, etc.), memory, imagination (also called ‘the fancy’), and feelings (called ‘passions’). Saying these are different parts doesn’t mean the mind is actually split up that way. In fact, John Locke said it would be wrong to think the mind has clear divisions like that. Hume uses these terms in a flexible way, especially when talking about reason and imagination.

2.3 Hume talks about ‘force and vivacity’ to explain the difference between impressions (like strong feelings or sensations) and ideas (thoughts). It’s not clear if he means this as the main difference or just a way to describe how feelings are stronger than thoughts.

2.5 Hume’s famous Copy Principle says that all our ideas come from past experiences. He doesn’t believe in ideas that we are born with.

2.7 A Laplander is someone from a cold area in northern Scandinavia, and a negro is a person with dark skin, usually from Africa. Back in Hume’s time, people from these places probably hadn’t tasted wine.

2.8 Hume gives an example called the ‘missing shade of blue’ to show that sometimes ideas don’t come directly from experiences. But he doesn’t seem too worried about this exception to his Copy Principle.

2.9 Hume uses his Copy Principle to help explain unclear ideas. He says the meaning of a word comes from the idea it represents. Later, he will use this idea to look at words like ‘power’, ‘force’, or ‘necessary connection’.

SECTION III  
3.0 Hume talks about how ideas connect with each other. John Locke and other philosophers thought this connection was random or crazy because it’s based on habit, not reason. But Hume wants to prove that this habit, or custom, is actually how we learn new things beyond what we remember or sense.
