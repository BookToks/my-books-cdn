Malebranche’s occasionalism means that God is the one who causes everything to happen in the world. This includes not just objects, but also how we see and move. For example, when we see an apple or reach out to grab it, God is the one who creates the images we see in our minds and moves our arm by constantly recreating it in new positions based on what we want to do.  

Because of this idea, it might seem like there’s no real need to believe in a material world at all. The material world doesn’t seem to affect what we experience or explain what happens. For example, it’s not the power of billiard balls that makes them move, but God’s choice to recreate them following certain “laws of motion.” Some philosophers, thinking matter can’t act on its own, ended up saying that matter doesn’t really exist. This idea is called immaterialism or idealism. According to this view, material objects only exist as ideas in our minds or as ideas in God’s mind that He creates in ours.  

One of the most famous immaterialists was George Berkeley. His ideas are similar to Malebranche’s but focus more on different points because he followed the ideas of Locke instead of Descartes. Locke said there’s a difference between ideas, which are only in our minds, and material things, which cause these ideas. Our ideas show things like shape, size, and motion (called primary qualities) and also color, taste, and smell (called secondary qualities). But the best science of Locke’s time said only the primary qualities really match what material things are like.  

Berkeley agreed that what we immediately perceive is mental. His main goal was to argue against Locke’s idea that there’s something material behind the ideas we have, like a real apple behind the apple we see.  

In a way, God’s choice about the laws of motion could be random, but Malebranche believed God would always create the best possible world because He is wise and good. So, God’s laws would reflect His goodness and wisdom.
