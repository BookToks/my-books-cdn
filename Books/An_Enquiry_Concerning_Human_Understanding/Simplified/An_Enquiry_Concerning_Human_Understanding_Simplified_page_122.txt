SECTION VIII 80 Of Liberty and Necessity PART I

You might think that in questions debated for thousands of years, everyone would at least agree on what the words mean. This would help us move from just talking about words to actually understanding the real issue. It seems like it should be easy to clearly define the words we use when arguing and then focus on those meanings.

But if we look closer, we’ll see the opposite is true. The fact that the argument has gone on for so long without an answer shows that the words are unclear. People use the same words but mean different things. Since everyone’s mind works pretty much the same way, it wouldn’t make sense for people to have different opinions about the same thing if they really meant the same by the words. Especially when they share ideas and look for reasons to prove their point.

It’s true that if people argue about things way beyond what humans can understand, like how the world began or how spirits work, they might argue forever without solving anything. But if the question is about something normal and familiar, the only reason the argument keeps going is because people don’t agree on what the words mean. This keeps them from really debating each other.

[2] This is exactly what has happened with the long debate about liberty and necessity. I think that almost everyone, smart or not, has actually shared the same opinion all along. And if we just had a few clear definitions, this whole argument would end right away.
