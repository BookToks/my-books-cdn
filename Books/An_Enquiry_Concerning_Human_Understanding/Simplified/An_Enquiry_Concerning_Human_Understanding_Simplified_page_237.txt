In 1756, two years after the first volume was published, I released the second volume of my History. It covered the time from the death of Charles I until the Revolution. This book didn’t upset the Whigs as much and was better liked. It not only did well on its own but also helped the first volume.

Even though I learned that the Whig party controlled all the important jobs in government and literature, I didn’t want to give in to their noisy complaints. When I made over a hundred changes to the parts about the first two Stuart kings, I always made them more favorable to the Tories. It’s silly to think England’s government before then was a perfect system of freedom.

In 1759, I published my History of the House of Tudor. People complained about it almost as much as they did about my history of the Stuarts. The reign of Elizabeth was especially unpopular. But by then, I didn’t care much about public opinion. I stayed quietly in Edinburgh to finish the earlier part of English history in two volumes, which I published in 1761. It had okay success, but nothing amazing.

Despite all the ups and downs my books faced, they kept getting more popular. The money I made from selling copies was more than anyone in England had ever earned before. I became rich and independent. I went back to Scotland, my home, and decided never to leave again. I was proud that I had never asked any powerful person for help or tried to make friends with them. I was over fifty and planned to live quietly and thoughtfully for the rest of my life.

Then in 1763, the Earl of Hertford, whom I didn’t know, invited me to go with him to Paris as part of his embassy. He hinted I might become the secretary there. At first, I said no because I didn’t want to start connections with important people, and I thought the fancy life in Paris wouldn’t suit me at my age and personality. But when he asked again, I accepted. I’m glad I did because I had good experiences with him and later with his brother, General Conway.

If you have never seen how fashion and trends work, you wouldn’t believe how people in Paris treated me. The more I tried to avoid their extreme politeness, the more they kept being nice to me. Still, living in Paris was truly enjoyable because of the many smart, educated, and polite people there. Paris has more of these kinds of people than anywhere else in the world.
