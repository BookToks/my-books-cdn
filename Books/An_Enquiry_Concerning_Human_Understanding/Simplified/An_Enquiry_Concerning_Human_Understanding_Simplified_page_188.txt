I have to admit, there’s something strange about how people’s opinions change over time. DesCartes suggested that only God has real power, but he didn’t push it too hard. Later, Malebranche and other followers of DesCartes made this idea the main point of their philosophy.

But in England, this idea wasn’t accepted. Thinkers like Locke, Clarke, and Cudworth didn’t even mention it. They all believed that matter, or physical stuff, has some real power, even if it comes from something else. So how did the idea that only God has power become so popular among modern philosophers?

According to some explanations, the idea of power is connected to the idea of cause, and both relate to the effect or result they produce. When we look at something unknown about an object that decides how strong its effect is, we call that its power. All philosophers agree that the effect shows how much power something has. But if they really understood power itself, why can’t they measure it directly? For example, there’s a debate about whether the force of a moving object depends on its speed or the square of its speed. This shouldn’t need to be figured out by looking at effects over time, but by measuring the power directly.

People often use words like Force, Power, and Energy in everyday talk and in science, but that doesn’t prove we actually understand how causes make effects happen. These words usually have vague meanings, and the ideas behind them are confusing. Every animal can move things around because it feels a push or effort, and it can also feel when something hits it. These feelings come from animals only, and we can’t assume inanimate objects feel the same. But we often imagine that objects have feelings when they move or get moved.

When it comes to energy that doesn’t involve motion, we just notice that some events always happen together. Because of this, we start to feel a connection between the events and then think the objects themselves have this connection. It’s very common to apply our own feelings to objects around us.

The idea of freedom, or liberty, became popular for another reason: sometimes we feel like we have freedom or can choose between options when we act. This feeling can be false or just seem real, but it strongly influences how we think about liberty.
