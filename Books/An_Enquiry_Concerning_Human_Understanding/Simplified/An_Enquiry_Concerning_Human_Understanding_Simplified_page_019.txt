Most of the big thinkers in the 1600s and 1700s, like Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke, Leibniz, Hume, and Kant, believed in determinism. That means they thought every event happens because of something before it, so if you know everything that came before, you could predict what will happen next.

Determinism worked fine for physical things, but it caused problems when it came to people. It made it hard to believe in freedom and moral responsibility. Punishment only makes sense if someone did something wrong on their own, by choice. So how could a judge be fair punishing someone if their actions were just the result of unstoppable causes, and even God could have known what they would do before they were born?

Many people avoided this tough question. For example, Descartes wasn’t clear about whether determinism applied to the mind, which he thought was not physical. The solution called compatibilism was most clearly explained by Thomas Hobbes, who was the first big English philosopher and believed everything was physical. He said that even if everything is caused by previous things (which he called “the doctrine of necessity”), people can still be free. He explained freedom as not being stopped by outside forces from doing what you want.

Hobbes said that when people do things because they want to, those actions come from freedom. But since desires and choices are also caused by other things in a chain, they also come from necessity. David Hume agreed with Hobbes and used similar ideas in his own work about freedom and necessity.

Today, many people accept compatibilism, but it’s still a topic that causes lots of arguments. Questions about free will are some of the oldest and most debated in philosophy.
