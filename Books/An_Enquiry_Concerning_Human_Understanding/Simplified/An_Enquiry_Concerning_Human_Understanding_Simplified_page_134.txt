There is a very common way people argue about big ideas, but it’s also a bad way. They try to prove a point wrong by saying it could be dangerous for religion or what’s right and wrong. If an idea leads to silly or impossible things, then it’s definitely wrong. But just because an idea might have bad consequences doesn’t mean it’s false. So, these kinds of arguments should be avoided because they don’t help find the truth. Instead, they just make the other person look bad. I say this honestly and without trying to win. I’m okay with being checked on this and will say that the ideas about both fate and free will, as I explained, not only fit with what’s right but are actually very important for it.

Necessity can be explained in two ways, based on two ideas of cause. It means either things always happening together or the way our mind connects one thing to another. Actually, these two meanings are really the same. Everyone, whether in schools, churches, or everyday life, has accepted that people’s choices follow this kind of necessity. No one has said we can’t guess what people will do because we see patterns in their actions, reasons, and situations. The only difference is some might not want to call this “necessity.” But as long as we understand what it means, the word doesn’t hurt. Or some might think there’s more to learn about how physical things work. But whatever that is, it doesn’t matter for what’s right or religious beliefs. We might be wrong about saying there’s no other kind of necessity in how bodies act, but we definitely don’t add anything strange to how the mind acts. We don’t change what religion says about free will, just what science says about physical things. So, this idea is at least harmless.

All laws are based on rewards and punishments, and it’s assumed that these always affect people’s minds in a steady way. Both rewards and punishments help encourage good actions and stop bad ones.
