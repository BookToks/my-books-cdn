Wise people tend to believe any story that supports what the storyteller wants to be true. Whether it makes their country, family, or themselves look better, they are quick to accept it. But what’s more tempting than to seem like a missionary, a prophet, or a messenger from heaven? Who wouldn’t face many risks just to be seen as someone so important? And if someone first convinces themselves to believe it, using their imagination and pride, they usually don’t hesitate to use little lies to support such a holy and important cause.

Even the smallest spark can turn into a huge fire because the right materials are always ready. People who love hearing gossip and strange stories will believe anything that feeds their superstition and makes things more exciting.

Many stories like this have been found out and proven false early on. Many others were popular for a while but then forgotten. So when these kinds of stories spread, the explanation is clear. We should use what we know about how people easily believe and get fooled, instead of thinking that a miracle broke the natural laws of the world.

It’s hard to catch a lie in any private or public story, especially where it supposedly happened. It’s even harder when the place is far away. Even courts, with all their power and careful work, often struggle to tell truth from lies in recent events.

Things only get worse when people argue and rumors spread, especially when emotions are involved on both sides.

When new religions first start, smart and educated people usually think the stories are too silly to care about. And when they want to prove the trick later to help people see the truth, it’s often too late.
