15)—the main reasons—that cause that behavior.

See §8 of the Introduction, above.

1.14 the compass of human understanding: the range of what people can think about and understand (this phrase was used by John Locke in his Essay, IV. xxi. 1).

1.14 closely connected: in the first two editions of the Enquiry (1748 and 1750), a note here gave credit to Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746) and Joseph Butler (1692–1752) for important ideas: see Textual Variants, above (pp. 177–8), and also p. 210.

1.15 secret springs and principles: the hidden causes behind how the human mind works. Hume compares this to astronomy in these two paragraphs, showing that studying the mind can be as detailed and complex as how Kepler organized the movement of planets. Finding these ‘secret springs and principles’ is a huge achievement, like Newton’s big discoveries. If we think about Hume’s work this way, his discoveries—like how custom plays a key role in how we think—are part of this ‘mental geography’. The Enquiry seems less ambitious than the Treatise, which suggested that the way ideas connect is a basic force like gravity (1.1.4.6).

1.15 Till a philosopher: a reference to Isaac Newton, see Glossarial Index.

SECTION II 2.0 the ORIGIN of IDEAS: Hume follows Locke’s example by starting his study of understanding with the question of where our ideas come from. Their answer is often seen as the main difference between ‘rationalists’ and ‘empiricists’ (see pp. 223–6). Like in the Treatise (1.1.1.4), Hume’s Copy Principle (2.5) puts him with Locke as an empiricist, meaning he denies that we have ideas we're born with (cf. 2.9 endnote [A]). In Book I of the Treatise, Hume then asks how we get different ideas, like memory, imagination, relations, abstractions, space and time, cause and effect, body, and the self. But in the Enquiry, he quickly moves to a different question: how do we get information about the world? He focuses on factual reasoning (Section IV). Only after showing this involves the idea of cause and effect, and necessary connection, does he return to where that idea comes from (in Section VII), then goes back to other knowledge questions for most of the rest of the Enquiry.

2.1 perceptions of the mind: Hume uses ‘perceptions’ for what Descartes and Locke called ‘ideas’, and then makes his own difference between two types of perceptions: ‘ideas’ and ‘impressions’. See §9 of the Introduction, above.
