If experience, watching things happen, and comparing them are really the only ways we can make smart guesses about stuff like this, then both the cause and effect should be similar to other causes and effects we already know. We have seen many times that certain causes and effects happen together.

I want you to think about what this idea means for yourself. I will just say that people who argue against Epicurus often think the universe is a one-of-a-kind result, and they use that to prove there is a God, who is also one-of-a-kind.

Your way of thinking about this idea deserves some attention. I admit itâ€™s a bit tricky to understand how we can start from the cause and then figure out the effect, or how thinking about the cause can tell us something new about the effect.
