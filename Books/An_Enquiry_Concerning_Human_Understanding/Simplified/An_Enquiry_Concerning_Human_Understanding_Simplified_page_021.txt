Back in the late 1600s and early 1700s, religious persecution in Britain had gotten a lot less harsh after the terrible Civil War and Cromwell’s strict government. But it was still possible for someone to get in big trouble for their religious beliefs. For example, in 1697, Thomas Aikenhead, a 19-year-old student, was hanged for saying things that were seen as blasphemous. Even in 1733, Thomas Woolston, a Cambridge theologian, died in prison because he was convicted of blasphemy years before.

David Hume, a famous philosopher, faced less dangerous kinds of prejudice. In 1745, he was turned down for a philosophy job because his book, *Treatise of Human Nature*, was thought to promote atheism, even though it didn’t directly talk about religion. In 1756, the Church of Scotland almost kicked him out because of what he wrote in another book, *Enquiry*, but they decided not to. By that time, kicking him out would have made the Church look bad. Still, Hume had to be careful about criticizing Christianity openly because it could upset people and cause trouble.

Even in Edinburgh, known as the ‘Athens of the North’ for its smart thinkers like Hume, most people still strongly believed in traditional religion.

Among the smarter and more educated people during the Scottish Enlightenment, religion was different from before. They didn’t take Roman Catholicism seriously because of its fancy ceremonies and beliefs like miracles—they thought it was just superstition. They also looked down on the strict and intense Protestant groups. Hume wrote an essay called ‘Of Superstition and Enthusiasm’ in 1741 where he talked about these problems, and it was safe to publish because it was more reasonable and careful.
