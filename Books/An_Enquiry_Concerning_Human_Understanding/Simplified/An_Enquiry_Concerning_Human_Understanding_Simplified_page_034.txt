In this introduction, Hume talks about what he calls ‘reasoning about facts,’ which we’ll just call ‘factual reasoning.’ But before we get into that, there’s something really important to understand.

Hume makes a big distinction between two types of knowledge: ‘relations of ideas’ and ‘matters of fact.’ This is often called ‘Hume’s Fork.’ Relations of ideas are things we can know just by thinking about them, without needing to check the real world. For example, knowing that one plus one equals two or that a square has four sides. We can figure these out by using our mind and logical steps, like in math proofs. These truths are completely certain.

On the other hand, matters of fact can only be known by looking at past experience. They are about how things actually are in the world, not just about how ideas relate to each other. For example, whether there really is a golden mountain. There’s no contradiction in imagining these facts being different, so we can’t know them for sure just by thinking—they need to be checked in the real world.

Here are some simple examples: Relations of ideas include things like Pythagoras’ Theorem, 3×5=½×30, all bachelors are unmarried, and a meter has 100 centimeters. Matters of fact include things like the sun rising tomorrow, the sun not rising tomorrow, stones falling when dropped, and billiard balls moving when hit.

Even though relations of ideas come before experience in a way, it doesn’t mean the ideas are born in us or come without experience. According to Hume, all ideas, like the idea of a bachelor, come from experience.
