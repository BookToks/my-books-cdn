Doubts about what we know come from being completely unaware of anything except what we see or remember right now. If that were true, we wouldn’t know how to use our abilities to achieve goals or make things happen. There would be no action or much thinking at all.

But it’s important to say that even though we learn about things beyond what we see or remember directly, some fact must always be in our memory or senses first. For example, if someone finds old fancy buildings in a desert, they would think that people used to live there long ago. But if they never saw those buildings, they wouldn’t have that idea. We learn about the past from history books, but to believe what’s written, we need to check the facts carefully, going back to those who actually saw the events. In short, if we don’t start with some fact we know from our memory or senses, all our reasoning would just be guesses without any real proof. If I ask why you believe something, you have to give a reason connected to another fact. You can’t keep doing this forever, so eventually, you must end with a fact you know for sure, or admit your belief has no basis.

So, what’s the conclusion? It’s simple, but different from what many philosophers think. All belief about facts or real things comes from something we know through our memory or senses, plus a habit of linking that thing with something else.

In other words, because we’ve seen things like flame and heat, or snow and cold, always go together, when we see flame or snow again, our mind expects heat or cold. We believe those qualities really exist and will show up if we look closer.
