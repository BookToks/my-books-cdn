Hume sent this text to his printer William Strahan with a letter dated 26 October 1775. In the letter, he mainly talked about two writers: Thomas Reid and James Beattie. You can find more about them under ‘Scottish Common-Sense Philosophers’ in the Glossarial Index of Major Philosophers and Philosophical Movements.

Hume called the Treatise ‘never acknowledged’ because he published it without putting his name on it.

The ‘Advertisement’ part, which is now usually included with the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, was originally meant for the second volume of Hume’s Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects (published in 1772 and 1777). This volume also had A Dissertation on the Passions, the Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, and The Natural History of Religion.

SECTION I  
1.1 Moral philosophy: Here, ‘moral’ means things related to humans, like how people behave, not just ethics like we think of today. So, Hume uses ‘moral philosophy’ to mean ‘the science of human nature.’

1.1 two different manners: Hume explains that there are two styles of philosophy: the ‘easy’ kind that’s simple to understand, and the ‘abstruse’ kind that’s more complicated. You can see more about this in section 8 of the Introduction above.

1.2 his understanding: The word ‘understanding’ here is a noun, meaning a mental skill or ability. It’s like the power of reason that helps us find out truths, which is different from the will, which is what makes us want or choose things. You can also check notes for more details.

1.3 plebeian: This means a regular or ordinary person. It comes from an old Roman way of dividing people into noble families called patricians and common people called plebeians or plebs.

1.4 CICERO... LOCKE: Hume says Aristotle, Malebranche, and Locke were ‘abstruse philosophers’—the more complex thinkers. Cicero, La Bruyère, and Addison were ‘easy philosophers’—more popular and easier to understand. For more info about Aristotle, Malebranche, Locke, and Cicero, check the Glossarial Index. Jean de la Bruyère was a French writer who mostly wrote about moral issues. Joseph Addison was an English essayist and politician who helped start The Spectator magazine in 1711–1712 with Richard Steele.
