I want you to know that I have no problem admitting when I’m wrong in an argument. More importantly, I need to admit a big mistake I made in my actions. I shouldn’t have published my book, *Treatise of Human Nature*, at all. This book tried to change the most important parts of philosophy, but I wrote it before I was 25 years old.

What bothers me most is the confident tone in the book, which I think came from my youthful excitement. It annoys me so much that I can’t even bring myself to read it again. But whether the same ideas, explained better, might do well is still up for debate.

The booksellers in London are reprinting my philosophical essays, but the second edition isn’t very different from the new one. I’m not sure if these essays are too bold or too complex for your country, though some French writers recently have taken similar risks.

I want the author to think about whether the way we reason about what people say is different from how we understand their other actions. In other words, do we use the same experience-based knowledge of human nature in both cases? For example, do we decide that an honest man won’t lie to us the same way we decide he won’t cheat us?

About how young people tend to believe things too easily but learn from experience, it’s clear that children just accept all the opinions, feelings, and stories of their elders without question. This isn’t any more surprising than a hammer making a mark on clay.
