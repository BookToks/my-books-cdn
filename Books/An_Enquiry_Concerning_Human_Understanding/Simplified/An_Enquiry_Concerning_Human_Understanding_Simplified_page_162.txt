This wouldn’t be hard, if we agree on these terms, he said. If you want, I can pretend to be Epicurus for a bit and imagine you as the people of Athens. I’ll give a speech that will fill the whole urn with white beans and leave no black ones for my enemies.

Alright, go ahead with that idea.

I’m here, Athenians, to explain what I taught in my school. But instead of calm listeners, I face angry opponents. You should be talking about what’s best for everyone, but instead, you’re caught up in deep, complicated philosophy. These fancy ideas might be interesting, but they don’t help with everyday problems. I’ll try to stop this. We won’t argue about where the universe came from. We’ll only ask if those questions matter to the public good. If I can show you they don’t affect peace or government, I hope you’ll let us go back to our schools to think about these big, but tricky, ideas in peace.

Some religious thinkers aren’t happy just trusting the old traditions and priests’ teachings, which I accept. They get curious and try to prove religion using reason alone. But this only makes people doubt more. They talk about how amazing and well-ordered the universe is and ask if it could just be random atoms bumping into each other or if it must be made by some smart power. I won’t argue if their point is strong. I’ll even agree it’s solid. What matters is that this argument is just a theory. When I say there’s no god or afterlife, I’m not breaking society’s base. Instead, I’m offering ideas that even my opponents should accept if they think carefully about their own points.

So you, my accusers, admit that the main proof for a god — which I never denied — comes from how ordered nature looks. You think it’s crazy to say that chance or random matter made it all without a guiding mind.
