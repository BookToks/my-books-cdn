People are naturally creative and love to make up stories, especially when it comes to religion. History shows that some religious people might lie about miracles to support their faith, to show off, or because they easily believe convincing speakers. Many miracle stories come from less educated or rough societies, which suggests these stories are more imagination than real events.

Also, since different religions have miracles that don’t agree with each other, if one religion’s miracle is true, the others can’t be. David Hume points out that we often don’t believe some well-supported miracles from history, like those about the Roman emperor Vespasian, so we shouldn’t just believe Christian miracles without question either.

All these ideas together show that no proof of miracles is strong enough to be likely true, let alone certain. Because religions often spread fake miracle stories, no human story about a miracle can be strong enough to build a whole religion on. Outside religion, some miracles might have enough proof, but when a miracle is linked to a new religion, that is a big sign it might be a trick.

This doesn’t mean miracles are impossible, just that we have lots of experience showing religious miracle stories are usually not reliable. Even if God is all-powerful and could do miracles, we have to judge these stories by comparing how trustworthy the witnesses are against how usually nature works. For believers, experience and what usually happens are still the best ways to figure out what’s true.
