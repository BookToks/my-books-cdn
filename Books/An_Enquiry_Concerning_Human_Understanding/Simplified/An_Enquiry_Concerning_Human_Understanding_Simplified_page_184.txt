Experience is the only way we learn how cause and effect work, and it helps us figure out that one thing exists because of another. This is the main idea behind moral thinking, which makes up most of what we know and guides how we act and behave.

Moral thinking is about either specific facts or general facts. When we make decisions in life, we focus on specific facts, and the same goes for studying history, dates, places, and space.

Sciences like politics, nature, medicine, and chemistry deal with general facts. They explore the qualities, causes, and effects that apply to whole groups of things.

Religion or theology tries to prove that God exists and that souls live forever. It uses both specific and general facts. Itâ€™s based on reason when supported by experience, but its strongest base is faith and what God reveals to us.

Morals and judging things like art or behavior are more about feelings and taste than pure understanding. Beauty, whether moral or natural, is something we feel more than see. If we try to explain it, we look at what most people like, which can be studied and thought about.

When we look through books, knowing these ideas, we have to be careful. If we pick up a book about religion or complicated philosophy, we should ask: Does it use clear reasoning about numbers or amounts? No. Does it use experiments to prove facts and reality? No.

If not, then burn the book, because it only has tricks and false ideas.
