[24] I noticed (I said, after he finished talking) that you use the same tricks as old demagogues. Since you wanted me to represent the people, you try to make me like you by agreeing with ideas I have always cared about. But if we only use experience—the way things actually happen—to judge this and other facts, I think we can also use that same experience to prove your argument wrong, which you said came from Epicurus.

For example, if you saw a half-built house with bricks, stones, and tools around it, wouldn’t you think someone planned and designed it? And couldn’t you guess the building will soon be finished and improved? If you saw one footprint on the beach, you’d know a person walked there and probably left another footprint that got washed away. So why don’t you use the same kind of thinking when you look at nature?

Think of the world and life like an unfinished building. From that, you can guess there’s a smart mind behind it. And if that mind is smart enough to not leave things unfinished, why can’t you believe there’s a better plan that will be completed sometime in the future? These ways of thinking are really the same. So why accept one and reject the other?

[25] The huge difference between the things we’re talking about, he answered, is why I come to different conclusions. When it comes to human-made things, it makes sense to go from the result back to the cause, and then think about how the result might change or has changed. But why can we do this? It’s because humans are beings we know from experience. We understand what they want and plan because their actions follow certain natural rules that we’ve seen before.
