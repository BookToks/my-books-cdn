10.13 deducting the inferior: Hume explains how this kind of ‘deduction’ works in his book Treatise1.3.11.9‒12. When you look at simple chances based on equally likely options or past results, he thinks the strength of the evidence can be measured by comparing the number of positive cases to negative ones, then dividing by the total cases. This way of measuring makes sense, but it gives a scale from 1 to -1 instead of the usual 1 to 0 we use now.

10.17 an enthusiast: ‘enthusiasm’ means strong religious faith where someone really believes God has personally shown Himself to them. You can read more about this in §5 of the Introduction.

10.18 aTULLY or aDEMOSTHENES: ‘Tully’ is another name for Cicero, whose full name is Marcus Tullius Cicero (see p. 221). Demosthenes (384–322 BC) was a famous speaker from Athens. Both their speeches are talked about in Hume’s essay called ‘Of Eloquence’ (1742).

10.21 wonderful historians: These are historians who tell stories about many miracles or amazing events.

10.22 ALEXANDER . . . PAPHLAGONIA . . . LUCIAN: Around AD 160, Alexander of Abonouteichos from Paphlagonia (a region in northern Asia Minor) tricked people into thinking the god of healing, Asclepius—who looked like a snake with a human head—was born from a goose egg. Lucian of Samosata (about AD 120–180), a Greek writer known for funny dialogues, wrote a piece called Alexander, or the False Prophet, exposing this trick.

10.22 MARCUS AURELIUS: Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (AD 121–180) became Roman emperor after his adoptive father, Antoninus Pius. He was famous for being wise and good, and his book Meditations is a classic work of Stoic philosophy (check the Glossarial Index).

10.23 his impostures: Before 1768, editions of the Enquiry included a note saying some might think Hume was too quick to judge Alexander based only on Lucian, who was against him. It would have been better if writings from Alexander’s followers had survived. Usually, the stories from friends and enemies are very different, especially in religious matters—like the difference between Alexander and St. Paul. See a Letter to Gilbert West Esq; about St. Paul’s conversion and work as an apostle.

10.24 MAHOMET: Mahomet, also called Muhammad or Mohammed (about AD 570–632), was the founder and main prophet of Islam.
