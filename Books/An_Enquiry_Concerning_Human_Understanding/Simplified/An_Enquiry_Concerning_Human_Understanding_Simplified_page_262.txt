Our reasoning from experience is mostly based on an instinct, kind of like animals have. It’s not always fully logical.

The “real presence” is a Roman Catholic idea that during a church ceremony, the bread and wine actually change into the body and blood of Christ. John Tillotson, a Protestant preacher, argued against this because the only proof comes from what the disciples said they saw, but our own senses show this can’t be true. Hume uses a similar argument to say that stories of miracles don’t make sense when compared to what we experience every day.

“Moral evidence” means evidence that isn’t 100% certain but comes from seeing cause and effect happen over time.

Hume says that a smart person should use probability to figure out what to believe. He explains this more in the Introduction.

When Hume talks about experiments, he means just watching and learning from experience, not necessarily doing science experiments.

“Proof” here means a very strong argument based on things we always experience, like knowing fire is hot or snow is cold. It doesn’t mean a formal math proof.

Cato the Younger was a Roman politician known for always telling the truth.

The story about the Indian prince comes from another writer, Joseph Butler, who got it from Locke. Locke’s story was actually about the King of Siam.

Hume thinks a miracle means something that goes against how nature usually works, caused by some invisible spirit or force.
