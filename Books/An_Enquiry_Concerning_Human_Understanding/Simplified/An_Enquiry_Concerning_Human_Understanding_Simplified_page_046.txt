This argument, even if we accept it, doesn’t really solve the big problem between determinism and moral responsibility. If everything I do was already decided before I was even born, how can I be truly responsible for my actions? It might seem like the idea of moral responsibility doesn’t make sense because it both depends on and doesn’t fit with determinism.

Hume talks about a way to solve this problem when he discusses religion and his ideas. His solution is based on a moral theory that focuses on feelings and emotions, not just logic. For example, if someone steals a lot of money from a man, does thinking deeply about the cause of the crime make the man less upset? No. So why should feeling angry about the crime stop just because we understand the cause behind it?

If morality is based on natural feelings of blame that come up when something bad happens, like a crime, then these feelings won’t just disappear when we think about the chain of events that caused it. Hume only briefly mentions this idea here; he explains his full moral theory based on emotions in another book called the Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals.

Section IX: ‘Of the Reason of Animals’

After Darwin’s ideas about evolution, it’s no surprise that animals and humans think in similar ways. But in the 1700s, this idea was pretty shocking. People back then often believed human reason was almost divine or angel-like, connected to a special immaterial soul. They thought human reason gave us clear understanding of the world and worked separately from animal instincts.

(Darwin’s notebooks from 1838–9 show he read Hume’s section about animal reason right when he was coming up with his theory of evolution.)
