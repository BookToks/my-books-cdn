Punishment should fit the crime. So why would someone be punished forever for temporary mistakes, especially when people are weak and make mistakes? Imagine Alexander the Great getting so angry that he wanted to destroy a whole nation just because they took his favorite horse, Bucephalus. That doesn’t seem fair.

People often think there are two kinds of people: good and bad. But most people are somewhere in between, not totally good or totally bad.

If you traveled around the world trying to give a nice dinner to the good people and punish the bad ones, it would be hard to decide who deserves what. Most people’s good and bad actions are almost equal.

Thinking about punishment in a way that’s different from how humans feel would confuse everything. We only know what is right or wrong because of how we feel inside.

Usually, people don’t punish others just because they feel angry or upset. Even judges and juries try to think about what’s best for everyone before deciding on punishment.

In ancient Rome, people who killed their own parents and admitted it were put in a sack with a monkey, a dog, and a snake, then thrown into a river. But if they denied the crime, even if it was proven, they were only put to death. Once, Emperor Augustus tricked a criminal into denying he killed his father, showing some kindness even to serious criminals.

This kind of kindness fits our natural ideas of what’s right, even for the worst crimes, and it only causes a small problem.

Even very strict priests would probably agree with this, unless the crime was about religious beliefs. Those crimes hurt their own interests, so they might be less forgiving then.

Most of our ideas about right and wrong come from thinking about what helps human society. But should short and small problems be punished forever? Sending one person to hell forever is a much bigger disaster than destroying many kingdoms.

Nature makes babies very weak and fragile, so much so that many die before they can even understand right and wrong. This shows that life isn’t just about testing people’s choices.
