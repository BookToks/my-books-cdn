The two essays were replaced with ‘Of the Standard of Taste’, and the collection came out in 1757 called Four Dissertations. The essays that were taken out were later published after the author died and without his name in 1777. But this version—like the usual one by Miller (1987)—uses the 1755 version. A proof copy of it is in the National Library of Scotland with twenty corrections written by Hume himself. The page numbers on the side match Miller’s edition to help you find things easily.

If talking about immortality wasn’t so risky, the Enquiry would probably have talked about it more clearly, especially since Section XI is clearly about ‘a future state’. Besides that, the essay’s style fits perfectly with the Enquiry and shows how Hume thinks. The first and last paragraphs also show the kind of ‘theological lying’ that was common back then. This means that writers who didn’t really believe in religion still tried to sound respectful and follow religious rules. The Enquiry has other examples of this too—in Sections VIII and X, at the start of Section XI, and at 12.32.

By just using reason, it’s hard to prove that the soul lives forever. The arguments usually come from ideas about metaphysics (the study of what exists) or morals. But really, it’s only the gospel that has shown us life and immortality.

Metaphysical ideas assume that the soul isn’t physical and that thinking can’t happen in something physical.

But metaphysics also teaches us that the idea of “substance” is confusing and unclear. We only think of a substance as a bunch of qualities that belong to some unknown thing. So, matter and spirit are both unknown at their core, and we can’t say for sure what qualities belong to either.

Metaphysics also says we can’t decide anything about causes or effects before we experience them. Since experience is the only way we can judge these things, we don’t know if matter, because of how it’s made or arranged, might cause thought.
