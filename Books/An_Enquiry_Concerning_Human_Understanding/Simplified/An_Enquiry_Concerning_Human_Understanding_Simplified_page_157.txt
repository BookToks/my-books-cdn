I shouldn’t doubt that she faked her death or the other public events that happened after it. I would only say that it was fake and couldn’t have been real. You might try to argue that it’s hard or almost impossible to trick the world about something so important, or that the famous queen was too smart for that, or that she had no good reason to lie. That could surprise me, but I would still say that people can be so sneaky and dumb that I’d rather believe something strange happened because of them than believe in something that breaks the laws of nature.

If this miracle was said to come from a new religion, people have been tricked by silly stories like that throughout history. That would actually prove it’s a lie and make smart people reject the story without even checking it out. Even if the miracle was done by an all-powerful being, that doesn’t make it more likely. We can’t really know what this being can do except by what we’ve seen happen in nature. So, we have to look at past experience and compare how often people lie about miracles to how often nature breaks its own rules. Since people lie about religious miracles more than about other things, we should trust those stories less and decide not to believe them, no matter how convincing they sound.

Lord Bacon seemed to think the same way. He said we should keep a record of all strange and amazing things in nature, like monsters and unusual births, and write down everything new and rare we find.
