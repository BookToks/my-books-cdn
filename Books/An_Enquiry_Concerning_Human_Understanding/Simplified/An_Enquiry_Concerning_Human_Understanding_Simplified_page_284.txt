The summaries below are meant to help with this, while also giving a quick reminder and an organized list of Hume’s mentions of other philosophers in the Enquiry.

Aristotle and the Medieval ‘Schools’

Aristotle (384–322 BC) is often called the greatest philosopher of ancient times. He made important ideas in logic, language, metaphysics, art, ethics, and politics. He also came up with big theories in physics, psychology, and biology. He was a student of Plato and later became the tutor of Alexander the Great. In 355 BC, he started his own school near Athens called the Lyceum. For more about his ideas on the world and their long-lasting effects, see §1 of the Introduction above.

By medieval times, the old pagan schools of philosophy were banned. Aristotle’s ideas became part of Christian teaching and were so popular they were often just called the philosophy of ‘the schools’. People even called Aristotle ‘the Philosopher’. Still, not all of his works were accepted as the final truth. Some important medieval ideas were later changes of Aristotle’s work, like Ptolemy’s model of the heavens and Galen’s medicine.

Aristotle is mentioned twice in the main text of the Enquiry. He is used as an example of an ‘abstract reasoner’ whose ‘fame is utterly decayed’ (1.4) and whose theory about the elements is outdated (8.7). His ideas on literary criticism are also mentioned in a long deleted part from Section III (3.10 variant). The medieval ‘schools’ are mentioned twice in Section VIII (8.22 endnote [F], 8.27), and the ‘schoolmen’ appear at 2.9 endnote [A]. Most famously, at the end of the Enquiry, Aristotle’s ‘school metaphysics’ is the type of philosophy that should be destroyed by fire (12.34).

Pyrrhonian and Academic Scepticism

Pyrrho of Elis (around 365–270 BC) was the most famous sceptic of ancient times. He didn’t believe there was a good reason to think carts, cliffs, or wild animals would harm him. People say he needed friends to be with him for safety because of this.
