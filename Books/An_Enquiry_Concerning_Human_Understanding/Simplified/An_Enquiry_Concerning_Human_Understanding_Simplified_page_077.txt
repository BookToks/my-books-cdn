By "impression," I mean all the strong feelings we get when we hear, see, touch, love, hate, want something, or decide to do something. Impressions are different from ideas, which are the weaker feelings we have when we think back on those strong sensations or emotions.

At first, it might seem like our thoughts can go anywhere without limits. They don’t follow any rules or have to stick to what’s real or natural.

Our imagination can easily create weird creatures or mix up strange shapes just as easily as it thinks about normal things. While our body is stuck on one planet, moving slowly and with effort, our mind can instantly travel to faraway places in the universe—or even beyond it, into total chaos where everything is mixed up. We can imagine things we’ve never seen or heard of, and there’s nothing our mind can’t think of unless it’s totally impossible.

But even though it seems like our thoughts can do anything, if we look closer, we’ll see they actually have limits. Our creative power is really just about mixing, changing, or adding to the stuff we get from our senses and experiences. For example, when we think of a golden mountain, we’re just putting together two ideas we already know: gold and mountain. We can imagine a good, kind horse because we know about virtue from our feelings, and we know what a horse looks like.

In short, everything we think about comes from what we feel outside or inside ourselves. How we mix and put these ideas together is up to our mind and will. In fancy words, all our ideas or weaker feelings come from copies of our stronger impressions. To prove this, there are two main points. First, when we break down our thoughts—even the complicated or fancy ones—we always find they come from simple ideas copied from earlier feelings. Even ideas that seem far from this actually come from it once we look carefully.
