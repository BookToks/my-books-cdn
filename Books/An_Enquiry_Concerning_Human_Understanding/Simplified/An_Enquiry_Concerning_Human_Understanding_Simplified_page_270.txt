John Locke was a philosopher who wrote a famous book where he argued against the idea that people are born with certain ideas already in their minds. Hume is mostly thinking about Locke when he talks about people who don’t believe in “innate ideas.”

The “schoolmen” were medieval thinkers you can look up in the glossary.

Tiberius and Nero were Roman emperors who ruled a long time ago. They were known for being very bad and abusing their power.

“Vis inertiae” means the idea that things don’t change their motion unless something forces them to. For example, if something is still, it stays still until something moves it.

Hume is trying to explain cause and effect like how science does, using ideas about forces and powers in physics.

In his earlier work, Hume focused more on how specific events relate to each other, not on the math behind how things interact. This might explain some differences in his ideas later on.

Isaac Newton was a famous scientist, and Hume talks about how Newton and his followers thought about causes. Newton’s “second causes” are natural causes, not God’s direct action. Some of Newton’s followers believed only God really causes things to happen, which Hume didn’t agree with.

Descartes, Malebranche, and Locke are other important thinkers you can find in the glossary.

Samuel Clarke was an English philosopher and religious thinker who defended Christianity and had debates with other famous philosophers. He supported Newton’s ideas about space and time. Clarke’s argument for God’s existence probably inspired a similar argument in Hume’s book called Dialogues concerning Natural Religion.

Ralph Cudworth was a leader of a group called the Cambridge Platonists. They were influenced by the ideas of Descartes and believed in a mix of atom theory and Platonic philosophy, which they thought came from ancient Moses and Pythagoras.

Cudworth argued against Hobbes, who believed everything, including human actions, was determined by cause and effect. Cudworth wanted to prove that moral truths are eternal and come from Platonic ideas, not from the government or society like Hobbes said. Cudworth’s daughter, Lady Masham, was friends with Locke and talked with Leibniz, another important philosopher.
