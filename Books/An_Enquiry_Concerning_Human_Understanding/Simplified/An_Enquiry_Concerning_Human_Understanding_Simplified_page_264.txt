 10.26 vouched by. . . the church: attested or endorsed by the approved Roman Catholic criteria or canonsfor assessing the authenticity of a miracle.
 
 10.27 Abbé PARIS, the famous JANSENIST: François de Paris (1690‒1727), famed for his saintliness, founded a small religious community in the Saint-Marceau quarter of Paris. He died young, weakened by rigorous fasting and ‘mortification’ (e.g. self-torture by wearing a hair shirt with bristling iron wires, and a spiked metal belt). While the body was on display, parts of his nails, hair, and clothes were taken as relics, and an elderly woman who kissed his feet was supposedly cured of a paralysed arm. The celebrity of this miracle brought crowds of sick people to his tomb, with the results that Hume describes. Abbé Paris supported the theology of Cornelius Jansen (1585‒1638), Bishop of Ypres, whose posthumous book Augustinus(1640) emphasized divine grace and strict predestination (see the Introduction, p. xxii), along with rigorous moral austerity. In France, the rise of the Jansenists provoked intense dispute with the Jesuits (see explanatory note below), whom they accused of moral laxity and Pelagianism (the heresy that man can earn salvation through good works). The controversy was sufficientlyfierce to provoke three papal decrees against Jansenism, in 1643,1653, and 1713. The last of these, Unigenitus, was issued by Pope Clement XI under pressure from the French king Louis XIV, keen to insist on theological unity to promote the unity of the state. Hume’s focus on Jansenism may be motivated by the thought that both Protestants and orthodox Roman Catholics would be opposed to it, so the vast majority of his readers can be expected to favour a sceptical attitude towards the Jansenist miracles.
 
 10.27 Jesuits: members of the Society of Jesus founded by Ignatius Loyola (1491‒1556), a Roman Catholic order committed to serving the Pope Notes to Pages 90–94 201 and noted for its intellectual orientation and for its commitment to educationand missionary work.
