He knew that it’s usually impossible to be sure about something that happened far away in time and place. Even if you are right there, it’s still really hard because many people can be close-minded, ignorant, sneaky, or dishonest. So, he decided that if a miracle is only supported by people’s stories, it probably isn’t true. Instead of arguing about it, people should just laugh at it.

There were probably more miracles said to have happened to one person than those recently claimed in France at the tomb of Abbé Paris, a famous religious man who many people believed was holy for a long time. People talked about sick people getting better, deaf people hearing, and blind people seeing, all because of that special grave. What’s even more surprising is that many miracles were proven right there in front of judges who were honest and trustworthy, with reliable and important witnesses, in a time when people were very educated. 

Also, a list of 125 miracles was published and shared everywhere. Even the Jesuits, a smart and powerful group who didn’t believe in these miracles and were against the ideas connected to them, couldn’t clearly prove the miracles wrong. Where else can you find so many details that support one story? And what can we say against so many people agreeing on these events, except that the events themselves seem impossible or miraculous? Most reasonable people would think that this alone is enough to prove the stories false.

Is it fair to say that because some stories told by people are very strong and believable, like stories about the battles of Philippi or Pharsalia, that all stories by people must be equally true? Imagine if the two sides in those battles each said they won, and their historians always said their side was better. How could anyone know the truth now? The same kind of conflict exists between miracle stories told by ancient writers like Herodotus or Plutarch and those told by later writers like Mariana or Bede.
