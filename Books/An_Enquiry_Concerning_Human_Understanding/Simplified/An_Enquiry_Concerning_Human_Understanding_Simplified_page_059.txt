SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY

My 2002 book, *Reading Hume on Human Understanding: Essays on the First Enquiry* (OUP), has a long section called ‘Critical Survey of the Literature on Hume and the First Enquiry’ (pages 413–74). It talks about and explains around 250 important books and papers, all sorted by topics. You can also find this survey online at www.davidhume.org, along with other useful resources. So, this short list doesn’t try to point out every detailed study about parts of the Enquiry.

About Hume’s Life and Background

The usual biography to read is *The Life of David Hume* by E. C. Mossner (OUP, 2nd edition, 1980).

John Gribbin’s *Science: A History* (Penguin, 2002), chapters 1 to 5, explain how science grew from Copernicus to Newton.

Edward Craig’s *The Mind of God and the Works of Man* (OUP, 1987), chapters 1 and 2, says that Hume mainly wanted to argue against the popular idea that reason is like a ‘Image of God’.

Books on the Enquiry

Peter Millican’s *Reading Hume on Human Understanding* (OUP, 2002) gives a general overview of the Enquiry and includes essays by famous Hume experts on its main parts.

These essays are also summed up in an introduction.

Terence Penelhum’s *David Hume: An Introduction to his Philosophical System* (Purdue University Press, 1992) has parts of the Enquiry with helpful explanations.

Stephen Buckle’s *Hume’s Enlightenment Tract* (OUP, 2001) focuses on the Enquiry, giving history and a different view than the one here.

Antony Flew’s *Hume’s Philosophy of Belief* (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1961) was the first big book on the Enquiry. It’s old and hard but still worth reading.

Easy-to-Understand Talks on Specific Topics from the Enquiry

Edward Craig wrote ‘Hume on Thought and Belief’ in a book edited by Godfrey Vesey called *Philosophers Ancient and Modern* (CUP, 1986), pages 93–110.

Wesley Salmon wrote ‘An Encounter with David Hume’ in a book edited by Joel Feinberg called *Reason and Responsibility* (Dickenson, 3rd edition, 1975), pages 190–208, which talks about induction.
