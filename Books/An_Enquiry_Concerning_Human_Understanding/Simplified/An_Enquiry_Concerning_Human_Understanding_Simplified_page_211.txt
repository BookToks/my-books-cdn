Abstract thinking can't prove any fact or whether something really exists.

But if we accept that there is a spiritual substance spread all over the universe, like the "etherial fire" some ancient philosophers talked about, and that this is the only real thing that can think, then we can guess by comparison that nature uses it like it uses matter. Nature shapes this spiritual stuff into different forms and beings, breaks them down after a while, and then builds new forms from the same substance. Just like the same material can make up the bodies of all animals one after another, the same spiritual stuff might make up their minds. When animals die, their thoughts and awareness might dissolve and they wouldn’t care about the new form they become. Even those who strongly say the soul dies don’t deny that its substance lasts forever. And if the soul is immaterial, it can lose memory or awareness, which we see happening in some way from experience.

If we think about how nature usually works, and don’t assume any special action from a supreme being (which philosophy usually avoids), then what can’t be destroyed also can’t be created.

So, if the soul is immortal, it existed before we were born. And if what happened before birth doesn’t matter to us, then what happens after death probably won’t either.

Animals definitely feel, think, love, hate, choose, and even reason, though not as well as humans. Do they also have souls that are immaterial and immortal?

Now, let’s look at moral arguments, especially those based on the idea that God is just and cares about punishing bad people and rewarding good ones.

But these ideas assume God has qualities beyond what we see in the world around us. Where do we get the idea that God has these extra qualities?

It’s safe to say that whatever God has actually done is the best thing, but it’s risky to say God must always do what seems best to us. Many times, this way of thinking would fail when we look at the world now.

If nature has a clear purpose, we can say that the main goal of making humans, as far as natural reason can tell, is just for this life. How little interest do people naturally have in life after death? How weak and uncertain is the idea of an afterlife compared to any fact we experience in daily life.

Some people do get scared about what happens after death, but these fears would disappear quickly if they weren’t encouraged by what they’re taught and told.
