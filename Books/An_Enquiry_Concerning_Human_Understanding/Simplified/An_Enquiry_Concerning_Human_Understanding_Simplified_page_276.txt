GLOSSARY

Many of Hume’s words are now hard to understand, and some have different meanings today. Some words also mean different things in different parts of his text. Here, only the less common meanings are included. For example, under ‘affect’, some uses of ‘affected’ are listed, but not the ones that use the word like we do today. To keep it short, small differences in meaning are ignored, and similar words like ‘actuate’ and ‘actuated’ are grouped together. For verbs, the explanation usually starts with ‘to’ (like ‘to motivate or cause activity’). References to the text show the section and paragraph number, or the endnote letter and paragraph number. If a word is used too many times, it is marked as passim (which means scattered).

If you find Hume’s language hard to understand in the Enquiry, it might help to look at the modern English version by Jonathan Bennett. You can find it at www.earlymoderntexts.com. Reading this version alongside the original can help you enjoy and understand Hume’s writing better and reduce the need to keep checking the glossary or a dictionary.
