Doubts about these ideas can be solved in a simpler way than we usually think.  

Imagine you suddenly see the son of a friend who has been gone for a long time or even dead. Right away, your mind brings back memories of your friend, making those memories feel more real and clear than they usually would. This shows how our minds connect things.

When this happens, we always believe the person or thing we remember actually existed. For example, seeing a picture of a friend only works if we believe that friend was real. Being near home only makes us think about home if we believe it really exists. This belief, even when it goes beyond what we remember or see, works in the same way as the strong thoughts we just talked about.

For example, when I throw dry wood into a fire, I immediately think it will make the fire bigger, not put it out. This thought doesn’t come from logic but from habits and past experience. Because I’m seeing the wood and fire right now, the idea of the fire feels very strong and real, stronger than just imagining it without seeing anything. If someone points a sword at me, I instantly think of pain and getting hurt much more than if I suddenly get a glass of wine, even if the wine comes first. What makes these ideas so strong is just seeing something now and being used to connecting it with something else. This is how our minds work when we believe things are real. The idea connected to what we see now feels stronger and more real.

So, there is a kind of natural connection between how things happen in the world and how we think about them. Even though we don’t really understand how nature works, our thoughts still follow the same pattern as everything else in nature.
