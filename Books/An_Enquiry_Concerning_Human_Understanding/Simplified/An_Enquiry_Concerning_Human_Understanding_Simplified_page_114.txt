Section VII: Making Something Out of Nothing

This means a power so big that at first, it seems like no being less than infinite could have it.

We can’t really feel or understand this power. We only notice the result—that an idea appears because we want it to. But how this happens or what power makes it happen is totally beyond what we can understand.

Second, our control over our mind and body is limited. We don’t know these limits by thinking or reasoning, but by experience—watching how things really happen. We have less control over our feelings than over our thoughts, and even our control over thoughts is very small. Can anyone say why these limits exist or why power is missing sometimes and not others?

Third, this control changes at different times. A healthy person has more control than a sick one. We control our thoughts better in the morning than at night, and when we’re hungry rather than after eating a lot. Can we explain these changes except by experience? So where is the power we think we have? Maybe there’s some secret part inside us, spiritual or physical, that we don’t know about but that decides how much control we have. Because we don’t know it, the power of our will is also unknown and hard to understand.

Choosing to do something is definitely a mental action we know well. Think about it carefully from every angle.

Do you see anything in it like a creative power that makes a new idea from nothing, like a “fiat” or command, copying the all-powerful creator who made everything in nature? Far from knowing this power in our will, we need just as much proof as anything else to believe that such amazing effects ever happen just by deciding to do something.

Most people don’t have trouble explaining common natural things, like why heavy things fall, plants grow, animals are born, or food nourishes us. But imagine if in all these cases, they could actually see the real force or power that connects cause and effect and always works perfectly.
