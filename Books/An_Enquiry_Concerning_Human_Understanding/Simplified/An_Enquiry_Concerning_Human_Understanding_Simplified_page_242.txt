These two examples help us understand what this type of philosophy is about and why it’s important.

Instead of going into too many complicated details, we will look at how this connection affects our feelings and imagination. This might be more interesting and helpful than the other way.

Since people are reasonable and always want to be happy, they usually do, say, or think things for a reason. They always have a goal in mind. Even if the way they try to reach their goal isn’t the best, they don’t forget what they want to achieve. They also don’t waste time on thoughts that won’t make them feel good in the end.

So, when someone creates something smart or creative, they need to have a plan or goal. Sometimes they might get carried away or lose focus, like in a poem or essay, but there should be a clear purpose at the start. If there isn’t, their work would just seem crazy instead of smart and thoughtful.

Because this rule always applies, stories or histories have to connect the events in a way that makes sense. The events must link together in our minds and form a single idea or plan, which is the goal the writer had when they began.

This way of linking events can be very different depending on what the writer wants to do. For example, Ovid made his plan based on things that are similar to each other. Every magical change caused by gods fits into his story.
