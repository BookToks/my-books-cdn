Hume thinks it’s wrong to use the word ‘idea’ for two very different things—feeling sensations and thinking about thoughts. He believes only the second one, thinking, should be called ‘ideas’ in the usual way.

So, he decides to use ‘idea’ just for thoughts. For sensations and feelings, he makes up a new word: ‘impression.’ He also uses the word ‘perception’ to mean both impressions and ideas together. This means that what Locke called ‘ideas,’ Hume calls ‘perceptions.’ Usually, impressions feel stronger and more lively than ideas, but this can change if someone is sick or crazy. For example, a mad person might find their thoughts just as strong as their sensations and might not be able to tell the difference.

Hume also talks about simple and complex perceptions, a point he got from Locke. Simple ones can’t be broken down into parts, but complex ones can. For example, an apple combines different qualities like color, taste, and smell, which are simple and different from each other. The idea of the apple is complex because it includes all these parts. But in his later work, Hume only gives examples of complex ideas like a golden mountain or a good horse, which themselves include other complex ideas.

This might mean Hume isn’t sure if any ideas are truly simple anymore, although he hints that ideas about color might be simple.

The words ‘force’ and ‘vivacity’ don’t really explain the difference between feelings and thoughts well because sometimes thoughts can be very strong, like thinking about someone you love or a key move in chess, and sometimes sensations can be boring, like watching paint dry. Luckily, the exact meaning of ‘force and vivacity’ doesn’t affect much in Hume’s work.
