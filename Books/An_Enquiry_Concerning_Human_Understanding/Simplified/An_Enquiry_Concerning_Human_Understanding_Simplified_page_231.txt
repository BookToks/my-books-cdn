You might think that I would try to avoid your strong arguments and keep my old opinion about the topic we disagree on. But I can’t help but notice how clever your work is and how much knowledge you’ve shown against me.

I feel very honored that someone as talented as you took the time to answer me. Since many people agree that your work is smart and well-written, I hope you won’t regret responding to someone like me, who you might have easily ignored. I admit that I feel a strong urge to defend myself now that you have openly challenged me. I think I could come up with some points to support my side. But when I was young, I decided to always let the public judge between me and my opponents without replying. I have to stick to this rule, or if I stay silent in the future, people might think I can’t answer and use that to win against me.

You might find it interesting to know where I first got the idea for the argument you criticized so much. I was walking in the covered walkways of the Jesuits’ College of La Flèche, where I spent two years of my youth. I was talking to a smart Jesuit who was telling me about a strange miracle at their convent. I wanted to argue against him, and since I was working on ideas for my Treatise of Human Nature at that time, this argument popped into my head. I thought it really confused him. But then he pointed out that the argument didn’t work because it went against both the Gospel and Catholic miracles. I accepted that as a good answer. I think you’ll agree that it’s pretty unusual for such a free way of thinking to come from a Jesuit school—though you might say the trickiness of the argument fits the place it came from.

But before we finish, I want to say something more as an author.
