Habits form because we get used to things happening over and over. That’s why calling it a ‘habit’ makes sense when talking about human nature.

But Hume usually uses the word ‘custom’ instead. Locke used this word too, but he thought of it in a negative way. Hume, however, sees it differently.

Custom is very important in how people live. Hume agrees with Bishop Joseph Butler, who said that “Probability is the very guide of life.” This means we rely on what probably happens to understand the world. But unlike Locke and Butler, Hume thinks this doesn’t come from logical thinking about why things should happen the same way.

Instead, it comes from custom, which is a natural, automatic part of being human that makes us expect things to happen the same way again.

So, what does this mean? Basically, all the beliefs we have about the world beyond what we see or remember come from habits of thinking based on past experiences.

Hume says this process happens automatically in our mind and we don’t control it with reason.

When Hume talks about the ‘soul,’ he just means the ‘mind.’ He’s not talking about religion.

In his earlier work, Hume tried to explain belief as a strong idea connected to a real feeling. Later, he admitted belief is more complicated than just how lively the idea feels.

When Hume says something ‘shadows out’ an idea, he means it shows or represents it, but in an imperfect way.

There’s a passage from Cicero that Hume mentions. It talks about why we feel more connected when we visit places where famous people once were, compared to just hearing stories or reading about them. Seeing the place makes those people seem more real in our minds. For example, looking at a bench where a philosopher once sat can make us think about him as if he were there.
