1.6 Difficult ideas . . . shared: This description of what happens to “hard-to-understand philosophy” seems to be kind of like Hume’s own story. At the end of the first part of his book, Treatise of Human Nature, Hume feels very unsure and sad, saying he is in “the worst state possible.” He also says in “My Own Life” that his book was a failure when it was first published, comparing it to something that was never alive.

1.6 Be a philosopher . . . man: This saying sounds like Hume is saying it himself. But actually, it’s nature that “seems” to say it. Hume will spend most of the rest of this section arguing the opposite—that deep, difficult philosophy is actually useful when done the right way.

1.8 pictures: Here, an “easy philosopher” is compared to a painter who makes pictures of human life. Knowing about human nature helps this painter, just like knowing how the body works helps someone paint a good portrait.

1.8 a VENUS or an HELEN: Venus is the Roman goddess of love, also called Aphrodite by the Greeks. Paris, a prince from Troy, picked her as the most beautiful goddess. Because of this, Venus gave him the love of Helen, the most beautiful woman, who was married to King Menelaus. This caused the Trojan War, where the Greeks, led by Agamemnon, attacked Troy and eventually destroyed it. After ten years, the Greeks tricked the Trojans by hiding soldiers inside a big wooden horse that looked like a gift, which let them sneak into the city.

1.11 popular superstitions: Here, “superstition” means irrational religious beliefs. It can also mean magic and rituals. Back then, some people called Roman Catholicism “superstition” to criticize it.

1.12 too sensible an interest: This means having a very strong reason to do something. “Sensible” here doesn’t mean smart, but something you can feel or notice. People like priests or frauds who use fake ideas for profit want those ideas to continue.

1.12 catholic remedy: A cure or solution that works for everyone.

1.12 careless: Not worrying or paying much attention.

1.13 mental geography: A way to describe how the mind works on the surface, instead of finding its deep secrets and reasons.
