Some people will say that this is the whole idea of necessity. But if that’s true, they need to prove that we have an idea of something different in how matter acts, which, based on what was said before, is impossible.

Throughout this book, the author talks a lot about making new discoveries in philosophy. But if anyone can call him an inventor, it’s because of how he uses the idea of how our thoughts connect with each other. Our imagination is really powerful and can mix and match ideas to create all kinds of stories.

Even though imagination is strong, there’s a hidden link between certain ideas that makes our mind connect them more often. This is why one idea can make us think of another right away. This is how conversations flow, how writing stays connected, and how we keep a train of thought even when daydreaming. These connections come from three main rules:

First, resemblance – like when a picture reminds us of the person it shows. Second, contiguity – when one thing is mentioned, it makes us think of something nearby or related, like Paris when we hear about St. Denis. Third, causation – thinking about a son often makes us think of his father.

These connections are super important for understanding human nature. They are the only links that hold our thoughts together and connect us to people or things outside ourselves. Since only thoughts can affect our feelings, these connections are like the glue of the universe, and most of how our minds work depends on them.

APPENDIX II ‘Of the Immortality of the Soul’ (1755)  
(This essay was supposed to be part of a 1755 collection called Five Dissertations, but Hume decided not to publish it because it included some ideas about religion and suicide that were too risky at the time.)
