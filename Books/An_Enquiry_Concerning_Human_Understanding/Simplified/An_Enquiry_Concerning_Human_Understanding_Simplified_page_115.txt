People get used to thinking in a certain way, so when they see something happen, they immediately expect the usual result and can’t imagine anything else happening. But when something really strange like an earthquake, a disease, or a weird event occurs, they don’t know what caused it or how it happened.

In these confusing cases, people often think some invisible smart force is behind it, because they believe normal natural powers can’t explain it. But philosophers who think deeper realize that even normal events are just as mysterious as strange ones. We only learn from experience that certain things happen together often, but we never truly understand how or why they are connected.

Because of this, many philosophers believe that the same smart force is behind everything, not just unusual events. They say that mind and intelligence are the real causes of all things and events in nature. What we usually call causes are really just occasions, and the true cause is the will of a Supreme Being who decides that certain things always happen together.

For example, instead of saying one billiard ball moves another because of a force it got from nature, they say it’s actually God who moves the second ball by choosing to do so, triggered by the first ball’s movement, following the rules God set for the universe.

But as philosophers study more, they find out that just like we don’t understand how bodies affect each other, we also don’t understand how the mind and body affect each other. We can’t figure out the basic principle behind either from what we see or feel.
