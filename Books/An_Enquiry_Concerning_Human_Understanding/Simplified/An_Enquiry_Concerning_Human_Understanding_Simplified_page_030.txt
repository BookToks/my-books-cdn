After his strong criticism, Hume quickly goes back to his main topic about science, pointing out the many clear benefits that come from carefully studying how human nature works.

Some people might say that this kind of science is uncertain and unrealistic. But Hume argues that at least some kind of "mental map" or clear description of the different parts and powers of the mind is definitely possible and something we can understand.

He also believes we can go beyond just organizing and separating how the mind works. Maybe, if philosophy is done carefully, it can discover some of the hidden reasons and rules that make the mind work the way it does. Just like how Brahe, Kepler, and others organized the movements of the planets, which helped Newton find the hidden laws behind those movements, philosophers can first make a clear mental map and then try to find the secret causes that explain how the mind behaves.

Sections II and III: The Origin and Association of Ideas

Section II of the Enquiry explains the basic ideas of Hume’s “Theory of Ideas,” which mostly comes from Locke’s Essay concerning Human Understanding. Locke’s attack on the idea that some ideas are inborn might be why Hume focuses a lot on where ideas come from. But this focus can be misleading because it only becomes very important in a later part of the Enquiry (Section VII). Even here in Section II, Hume only briefly mentions the debate about inborn ideas.

Ideas and Impressions

Locke, like Descartes, used the word “idea” in a broad way to mean “anything the mind thinks about.” For example, if someone sees the blue sky or feels pain, they have an idea of that color or feeling in their mind. And if they just think about the sky or pain, they also have those ideas in their mind.
