Whether an action is necessary or not isn’t really a quality of the person doing it, but depends on someone thinking about the action. Necessity means that this person’s mind is set on connecting the action to something that happened before. Freedom, which is the opposite of necessity, just means not having that connection, and feeling free to switch from one idea to another without any pressure.

When we think about people’s actions, we usually don’t feel that freedom or looseness because we can often guess their actions based on their reasons and personality. But when actually doing the action, we sometimes do feel a bit of that freedom. Since we tend to confuse similar things, this feeling has been used as a strong proof that people have free will.

Most of the time, we feel like our actions depend on our will. We even think our will isn’t controlled by anything else because when we try to stop it, we feel it can easily move in any direction. This creates a small mental image or wish of doing something different, which schools call a “Velleity.” We convince ourselves that we could have done the other thing because if we try again, we find we actually can. But we don’t realize that our desire to prove we have freedom is what drives these actions.

It seems clear that even if we feel free inside, someone watching us can usually guess what we will do by understanding our reasons and character. And if they can’t guess, they still believe they could if they knew everything about our situation and personality. This idea is exactly what necessity means, according to what was explained before.

If we say a cause is something that makes something happen, then making something happen means causing it. If we say a cause is what something depends on to exist, this idea has a problem. What do we mean by “depends on”? If we said a cause is what always comes before something, then it makes more sense. This “always comes before” is what necessity really means, and that’s all we really understand about it.

Since all thinking about facts or causes comes from habit, it’s natural to ask why people think better than animals, and why some people think better than others.
