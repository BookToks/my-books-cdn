SECTION IX 104 About How Animals Think

All our ideas about facts come from noticing patterns. We expect the same results from causes that look alike. When causes are exactly the same, the pattern is perfect, and we are sure about what will happen. For example, no one doubts that a piece of iron will be heavy and stick together because we have always seen that before. But when things aren’t exactly alike, the pattern is weaker, and we aren’t as sure, though it still helps us guess based on how similar they are.

When scientists study the body of one animal, they use this idea to guess things about other animals. For example, if blood moves in one animal like a frog or fish, it’s very likely that it moves the same way in all animals. We can use these guesses even to understand how the mind works or how feelings start in humans. If the same idea explains these things in all animals, it makes the idea stronger. We will try this with the idea we talked about before, to see if it helps explain how we learn from experience. Hopefully, this will support what we said earlier.

[2] First, it’s clear that animals, like people, learn many things from experience. They expect the same results to happen from the same causes. Using this, they learn about things around them like fire, water, earth, stones, heights, and depths, and what happens when they interact with these things. You can see the difference between young animals who don’t know much and older ones who have learned by watching carefully to stay away from things that hurt and go toward things that feel good or help them.
