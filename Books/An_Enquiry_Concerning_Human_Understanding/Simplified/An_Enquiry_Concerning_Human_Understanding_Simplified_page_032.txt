Hume says that even though it feels like our minds can come up with any idea, actually we can only create new ideas by mixing, changing, or making bigger or smaller the stuff we get from what we see, hear, or experience.

In simpler terms, all our ideas are copies of things we have already felt or experienced. This is called Hume’s Copy Principle. Hume gives two reasons for this. The first one is that if you look closely at all our ideas, you’ll see they come from impressions we have had before. For example, the idea of God, as someone all-knowing and good, comes from thinking about our own mind and imagining those qualities as bigger and better. This idea is not something we are born with, but something built from what we already know.

If all our ideas come from impressions, then why believe in ideas that are supposed to be inborn or natural? Hume thinks the Copy Principle helps us get rid of fake ideas that people might claim exist but don’t really come from experience.

There is one example, called the ‘missing shade of blue,’ where the mind might mix ideas to make something new. This shows that not every simple idea has to be a direct copy of an impression, but overall, all our thoughts come from things we have experienced.
