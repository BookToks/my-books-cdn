Material things were seen as complicated but lifeless machines, with parts that don’t move unless something else makes them move. This idea would change if matter itself had a real power—like thought or gravity. If that were true, things might not need an outside power to make them move. This could cause big questions about whether God and a soul really exist. So, the idea that matter is lifeless became very important in many philosophical talks, and stayed that way even in Hume’s time (like in the work of Samuel Clarke and Andrew Baxter).

Some thinkers took this idea even further and said matter might not cause anything at all, or might not even be real. Nicolas Malebranche, a famous thinker from the late 1600s, built on Descartes’s idea that God has to keep recreating the world all the time to keep it going. Malebranche said that nothing really causes anything except God. For example, when one billiard ball hits another, the second ball moves not because of the first ball’s force, but because God chooses to move the second ball in the right way. The balls hitting each other don’t cause the movement; they just give God a chance to make it happen, following the rules He set.

This idea is called occasionalism, and Hume talked about it too (E7.21–5). Malebranche also argued that real causes should be easy to understand. He said that a cause really causes something only if it’s impossible to imagine the effect not happening after the cause. So, the first billiard ball hitting the second can’t be the real cause of the second ball moving, because it’s easy to imagine the second ball not moving after the hit. The only cause that fits this rule is God’s will, because God is all-powerful and always gets what He wants. So, Malebranche’s big point was that God is the only true cause of anything that happens.
