The earth, water, and other elements studied by Aristotle and Hippocrates are no more like the ones we see today than the people described by Polybius and Tacitus are like the leaders we have now.

If a traveler came back from a faraway place and told us about people totally different from anyone we’ve ever known—people with no greed, no desire for power, no revenge, who only cared about friendship, kindness, and helping others—we would immediately know they were lying. It would be just as obvious as if they told stories about centaurs, dragons, or miracles. When we want to prove a history story is fake, the best way is to show that the actions described go against human nature, and no one would act that way.

For example, we doubt Quintus Curtius when he says Alexander the Great had superhuman courage and strength, attacking many enemies alone. We know people don’t act that way because human motives and actions are pretty consistent.

Because of this, living a long life and meeting many people helps us learn about human nature. This experience teaches us to understand why people do what they do by looking at their actions, facial expressions, and body language. It also helps us guess what people might do based on what we know about their feelings and reasons.

The general lessons we learn from experience give us a better understanding of people and how they think and act.

We stop being fooled by excuses and appearances. Public statements often just make a cause look better than it really is. Although we respect virtue and honor, true selflessness is rare among groups, their leaders, and even most individuals. If people acted completely unpredictably, it would be impossible to learn anything about human nature or use experience to help us in the future.
