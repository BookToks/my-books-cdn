People are really eager to hear stories from travelers about sea and land monsters, amazing adventures, strange people, and weird customs.

But when religion mixes with a love for amazing stories, common sense goes out the window. People’s stories can’t be trusted anymore. A religious person might be so excited they believe things that aren’t true. Sometimes they even know their story is false but keep telling it because they want to support their holy cause. Or even if they don’t fool themselves, pride and personal gain can make them lie more than others would. The listeners usually don’t have the skill to check if the story is true. Even if they do, they choose not to question things about big, mysterious topics. And if they try, their emotions and imagination mess up their thinking. Their belief makes the storyteller bolder, and the storyteller’s boldness makes them believe even more.

When someone speaks really well, it leaves little chance for people to think clearly. Instead, it grabs their imagination and feelings, making them listen without questioning. Luckily, this doesn’t happen very often. But what great speakers like Cicero or Demosthenes could barely do to Roman or Athenian crowds, anyone like a wandering monk or local teacher can do easily by appealing to simple emotions.

Many fake miracles, prophecies, and supernatural stories have been shown to be false because of proof against them or because they are just too ridiculous. This shows how much people want to believe in amazing things and should make us doubt all such stories. We naturally think this way, even about everyday news. For example, rumors about marriages spread super fast, especially in small towns. If two young people meet twice, the whole neighborhood quickly assumes they’re a couple. People love sharing exciting news and being the first to tell it, so the stories spread quickly.
