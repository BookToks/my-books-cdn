Liking philosophy, like liking religion, can sometimes cause problems. Even though it tries to help us behave better and get rid of bad habits, if not handled carefully, it might just make us focus more on what we already like or feel naturally.

When we try to be as strong and calm as wise philosophers, and keep our happiness only inside our own minds, we might end up making philosophy like the Stoics did. Their ideas could turn into a fancy way of being selfish, making us ignore both goodness and enjoying life with others. When we think a lot about how life is empty and how money and fame don’t last, we might actually be just giving our laziness an excuse. This laziness hates busy work and the stress of life, so it uses these ideas to relax without limits.

But there is one kind of philosophy that doesn’t have this problem. It doesn’t mix with any strong feelings or natural likes. This is Academic or Sceptical philosophy. Academics always talk about doubting, being careful before deciding, limiting our understanding, and avoiding ideas that don’t help with everyday life. This kind of philosophy is totally different from laziness, overconfidence, big claims, or blind beliefs. It stops all feelings except the love of truth, which can never be too strong. So, it’s surprising that this harmless philosophy gets so much unfair hate and blame.
