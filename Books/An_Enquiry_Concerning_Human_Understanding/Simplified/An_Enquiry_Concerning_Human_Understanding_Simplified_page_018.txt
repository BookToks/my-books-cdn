Even Newton himself thought that gravity might be caused by some kind of invisible fluid filling space, like an ‘etherial active fluid’ (as Hume mentioned). But Newton and his followers also suggested that the mystery of gravity shows that God must exist, because only an all-powerful being could keep the world running with rules that no one can fully explain.

During this time, religion had a huge impact on all philosophy and science. No thinker could ignore how their ideas might affect religious beliefs, and many were attacked for being heretics or ‘unfaithful’ to religion.

The most famous example is Galileo, who was punished by the Church for saying that the Earth orbits the Sun. This went against the Bible, which says the world never moves (Psalm 93:1) and that the Sun was created after the Earth (in Genesis). When Descartes heard about Galileo’s punishment, he decided not to publish his own book, The World, and made sure his writings didn’t offend the Church. Still, his works were banned by the Catholic Church in 1663. He was accused of denying transubstantiation—the idea that during the Eucharist, the bread and wine turn into the actual body and blood of Christ. This idea made sense with old physics, but didn’t fit with newer science like Descartes’s or Locke’s, which explained things like color and taste by their physical makeup.

Another tricky religious issue was free will. Science was growing, and mechanical philosophy especially focused on natural laws and how physical events can be predicted like clockwork.
