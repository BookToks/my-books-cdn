Some parts of nature cause changes in other parts. But can we really say that what happens in small parts applies to the whole thing? For example, can watching a hair grow teach us how a whole person is made? Or can knowing how a leaf moves tell us how a whole tree grows?

...

That’s a great point! Right now, things like stone, wood, brick, iron, and brass are arranged by humans. So some say the universe must have been made by something like human art. But is one small part of nature really a good example for the whole universe? Can a tiny part show us how everything works? Is nature in one place the same as nature in a very different place?

...

When two things are always seen together, I can guess one is there if I see the other. This is called learning from experience.

But how does this work when the things are unique and don’t have anything similar to compare? And can anyone seriously say that the universe must be made by a mind like a human’s just because we’ve seen humans make ships and cities? To prove this, we’d need to have seen how worlds begin, but we haven’t.

Cleanthes said that we shouldn’t misuse words or popular ideas to mess up careful thinking. People often think reason and experience are different, even when the question is about facts. But if you look closely, reason is just a type of experience. Using experience to prove the universe started from a mind isn’t more strange than using experience to prove the Earth moves. Some people might argue against the idea that Earth moves, just like they argue against my reasoning. They might ask, “Have you seen other Earths move?”

...

“Yes!” said Philo, interrupting. “We have other Earths. The moon is like another Earth, and we see it move around its center. Venus is another Earth where we see the same thing happen.”
