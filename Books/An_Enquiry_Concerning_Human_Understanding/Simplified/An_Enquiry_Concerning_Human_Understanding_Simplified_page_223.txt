It is an active cause, by which some particular parts of nature, wefind, produce alterations on other parts. But can a conclusion, with any propriety, be transferred from parts to the whole? Does not the great disproportion bar all comparison and inference? From observing the growth of a hair, can we learn any thing concerning the generation of a man? Would the manner of a leafâ€™s blowing, even though perfectly known, afford us any instruction concerning the vegetation of a tree?

 Admirable conclusion! Stone, wood, brick, iron, brass, have not, at this 149 time, in this minute globe of earth, an order or arrangement without human art and contrivance: therefore the universe could not originally attain its order and arrangement, without something similar to human art. But is a part of nature a rule for another part very wide of the former? Is it a rule for the whole? Is a very small part a rule for the universe? Is nature in one situation, a certain rule for nature in another situation, vastly differentfrom the former?
 
 . . .When two speciesof objects have always been observed to be conjoined together, I can infer, by custom, the existence of one, where-ever Iseethe existence of the other: and this I call an argument from experience.
 
 But how this argument can have place, where the objects, as in the present case, are single, individual, without parallel, or specific resemblance, may be difficult to explain. And will any man tell me with a serious countenance, 150 that an orderly universe must arise from some thought and art, like the human; because we have experience of it? To ascertain this reasoning, it were requisite, that we had experience of the origin of worlds; and it is not sufficient surely, that we have seen ships and cities arise from human art and contrivance.
 
 . . .What I had to suggest, said Cleanthes, is only that you would not abuse terms, or make use of popular expressions to subvert philosophical reasonings. You know, that the vulgar often distinguish reason from experience, even where the question relates only to matter of fact and existence; though it is found, where that reasonis properly analysed, that it is nothing but a species of experience. To prove by experience the origin of the universe from mind is not more contrary to common speech than to prove the motion of the earth from the same principle. And a caviller might raise all the same objectionsto the COPERNICANsystem, which you have urged against my reasonings. Have you other earths, might he say, which you have seen to move? Have. . . . . . . . . . . .
 
 Yes! cried Philo, interrupting him, we have other earths. Is not the moon another earth, which we see to turn round its centre? Is not Venus 160 Appendix III another earth, where we observe the same phenomenon?
