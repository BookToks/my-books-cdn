What do we really know? How can we understand these ideas better and make them clear in our minds? We need to look at the original feelings or impressions that these ideas come from. These impressions are strong and easy to notice. They are clear and can help us understand the ideas that are confusing. This way, we might get a new way to see small and simple ideas clearly, just like we can see big and obvious things.

To fully understand the idea of power or something always happening together, let’s look for the original feeling behind it. To find this feeling, we should check everywhere it might come from.

When we watch things around us and see how causes work, we never actually find any real power or force that makes one thing definitely cause another. We just see that one thing happens after another. For example, when one billiard ball hits another, the second ball moves. That’s all we see with our senses. Our mind doesn’t feel any special impression from these events. So, no single cause and effect moment shows us the idea of power or a necessary connection.

At first, when we see something, we can’t guess what will happen next. But if we could see the power behind a cause, we could predict what will happen without needing to learn from experience. We could just think and know for sure.

In truth, no part of matter shows any power or force by itself. Nothing about its qualities tells us it can cause something else. Things like being solid, having size, or moving are complete on their own and don’t point to anything else happening. The world keeps changing, and one thing follows another without stopping, but the power that makes everything work is hidden from us. It never shows itself in the physical qualities of objects.
