Hume’s idea, which used to shock people, is now almost accepted as common sense in science. But outside of science, people still believe old ideas and don’t realize why they should change or what could happen if they do. That’s why Hume’s effort to create a way of understanding the world based on experience is still important today.

Hume’s first book, *A Treatise of Human Nature* (1739–40), started as a way to use scientific thinking on moral questions. But young Hume got excited and mixed smart ideas with some unrealistic guesses about psychology and some confusing doubts, especially in the first part. He later felt sorry for this, and even before the last part was published, he was already changing his approach in a shorter summary written in 1740 (which is included in this book as Appendix I). 

By 1748, he wrote another big book, *Enquiry concerning Human Understanding*, which followed the summary’s style. This book focused more on his main ideas, explained them better, and kept his guesses about psychology simple. The doubts he raised were less extreme, but this actually made his arguments stronger. 

If you read the *Treatise*, you might be confused and not convinced because it suggests even trusting logic or believing in things outside ourselves might not make sense. When everything seems doubtful, most people just stick to what feels safe. Although these big doubts might shake people’s beliefs a bit, they usually don’t change their minds for good. 

The *Enquiry* is more powerful because it’s more careful. It shows the simpler and more realistic reasons behind what we believe.
