HUME’S ENDNOTES

Endnote [A] to 2.9, p. 151

People who said we don’t have ideas from birth probably just meant that all our ideas come from things we experience. But they didn’t explain this very clearly, so some people got confused.

What does “innate” even mean? If innate means natural, then all the thoughts and feelings we have are natural, no matter how you look at it. If innate means “from the moment we’re born,” then arguing about it doesn’t really make sense. It’s also not really important to ask if thinking starts before, at, or after birth. 

The word “idea” is often used in a loose way by Locke and others. It can mean any kind of mental experience, like feelings or thoughts. So, if that’s true, how can anyone say things like self-love or anger aren’t innate?

But if we use the words “impressions” and “ideas” the way I explained—where innate means something original that doesn’t come from anything else—then we can say all our impressions are innate, but our ideas are not.

Honestly, I think Locke got confused because of old school debates where people used unclear words and argued for a long time without really getting anywhere. That kind of confusing talking seems to happen a lot with Locke and his ideas.

Endnote [B] to 5.5, p. 328

It’s very common for writers, even in moral, political, or science topics, to separate reason and experience and think these two ways of thinking are totally different.

Reason is usually seen as using our mind to figure things out by thinking about how things naturally work and what must happen because of them. Experience, on the other hand, comes from what we see and observe in the world, learning what actually happens and guessing what will happen next based on that.
