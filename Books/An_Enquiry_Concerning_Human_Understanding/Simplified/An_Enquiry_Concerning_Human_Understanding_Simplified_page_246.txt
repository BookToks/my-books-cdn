The Peloponnesian War is a good topic for history, the siege of Athens works well for an epic poem, and the death of Alcibiades fits a tragedy.

The difference between history and epic poetry is mostly about how connected the events are. It’s hard to say exactly where one ends and the other begins. This is more about personal taste than strict rules, and sometimes you can find unity in a story where you wouldn’t expect it.

For example, Homer goes beyond his main story by showing Achilles’ anger. His anger causes Hector’s death and also brings problems to the Greeks. These events are closely linked, the story moves quickly between them, and the contrast between peace and conflict among the leaders keeps the reader interested. This creates enough unity to hold the story together.

Some people say Milton took things too far by connecting the angels’ rebellion to the fall of man through many events that seem random and far apart. Also, the creation of the world isn’t really the cause of the fall, just like it isn’t the cause of other historical events. But if we think about it, the rebellion, the creation, and the fall are all unusual events that happen close together in time. They stand out because they are original facts from religious stories. Because of this, they naturally link together in our minds and form a complete story.

Also, the rebellion of the angels and the fall of man are similar because they both teach the same lesson: we should obey our Creator.

These ideas are meant to get thinkers interested and maybe make them realize that this topic is very rich. Many things in our minds depend on how ideas connect or link together, which is what this is all about.
