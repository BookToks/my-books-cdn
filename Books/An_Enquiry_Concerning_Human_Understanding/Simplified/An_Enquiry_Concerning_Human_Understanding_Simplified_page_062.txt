He then becomes the tutor to the crazy Marquess of Annandale for a year, which is a tough and unhappy time for him.

In 1745, the Second Scottish Jacobite Rebellion happens. It’s for Charles Edward Stuart, also called ‘Bonnie Prince Charlie’ or ‘The Young Pretender’ (he is the son of ‘The Old Pretender’ from 1715). Hume watches from London but does not support the Jacobites.

In 1746, Hume joins General St Clair as Judge Advocate on a silly military trip to Brittany during the War of the Austrian Succession.

In 1748, Hume’s first Enquiry is published in April, called Philosophical Essays concerning Human Understanding. At the same time, he becomes secretary to General St Clair on diplomatic trips to Vienna and Turin.

In 1750, the second edition of the Philosophical Essays is published, with a third edition coming out in 1756.

In 1751, after living two years back in Edinburgh, Hume publishes An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals—the second Enquiry.

In 1752, Hume’s Political Discourses come out and are much more popular than his philosophy books. They help start the new science of Economics. However, he does not get the job as Chair of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow University.

From 1752 to 1757, Hume is the Keeper of the Advocates’ Library in Edinburgh, which helps him work on his History of England. This history is published in six volumes between 1754 and 1762.

In 1756, someone tries to kick Hume out of the Church of Scotland.

In 1757, Hume publishes Four Dissertations. These include The Natural History of Religion, A Dissertation on the Passions, ‘Of Tragedy’, and ‘Of the Standard of Taste’. He leaves out ‘Of Suicide’ and ‘Of the Immortality of the Soul’ because he plans to publish those after he dies.

In 1758, the Philosophical Essays are renamed An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding. The fourth edition appears as part of Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects.

Between 1763 and 1765, Hume becomes Secretary to Lord Hertford, the British Ambassador in Paris. He becomes very popular in the social circles and with French thinkers.

In 1766, Hume invites Jean-Jacques Rousseau to England because Rousseau is running away from trouble in his home city Geneva. But Rousseau, who is very suspicious, accuses Hume of betrayal. This makes Hume publish a story about what happened to clear his name.
