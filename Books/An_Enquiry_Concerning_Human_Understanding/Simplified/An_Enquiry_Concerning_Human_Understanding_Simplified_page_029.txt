The ‘easy philosophy’ is clear and poetic. It uses simple and interesting ideas about life to make being good seem attractive and help us behave better.

On the other hand, ‘abstruse’ philosophy is more complicated. It tries to satisfy the mind instead of the imagination. Its goal is to find the real reasons behind human nature by careful and logical study. At first, Hume seems to like the easy philosophy more because it feels more down to earth, but most of the section actually supports abstruse philosophy, explaining why it is important.

Hume’s support for abstruse philosophy has two main parts: a scientific side and a critical side. The scientific side shows how careful, exact thinking is needed to find general truths about people and morals. In this way, abstruse philosophy can help the easy one, like how an expert on the body can help an artist. It also offers the fun of discovering new things.

But some people say this hope of finding truth is just an illusion. This is where the critical side comes in. The biggest objection is that much of metaphysics (deep philosophy) is not a real science. Instead, it comes from human pride trying to understand things beyond our reach or from superstitions that hide their weakness by using confusing ideas.

Still, Hume asks, should philosophers stop trying to study these things? Or should they do the opposite? He says the best way to get rid of confusing ideas is to study how human understanding really works and show that it is not made for such hard and distant subjects. We need to carefully study true metaphysics to get rid of false and mixed-up ideas. Only clear and fair thinking can destroy the confusing philosophy that mixes with superstition and makes it seem like real knowledge.
