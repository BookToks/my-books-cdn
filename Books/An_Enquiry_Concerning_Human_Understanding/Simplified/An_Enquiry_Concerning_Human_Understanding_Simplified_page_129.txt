In all these ideas, people base their beliefs on what they have seen happen before, just like when they think about things outside themselves. They strongly believe that people and everything else will keep acting the same way they always have. A boss counts on his workers to do a job just as much as he counts on his tools, and he would be just as surprised if things didn’t go as expected.

Basically, this way of learning from experience and guessing how others will act is such a big part of life that no one, while awake, ever stops doing it. So, don’t we have good reason to say that everyone has always believed in the idea of necessity, as explained earlier?

Philosophers have never really thought differently from regular people about this. Almost everything they do depends on this idea. For example, history wouldn’t work if we didn’t trust that historians tell the truth based on what people usually do. Politics wouldn’t be a real science if laws and governments didn’t affect society in a steady way. Morals wouldn’t make sense if people’s characters didn’t lead to certain feelings, and those feelings didn’t always lead to actions. And how could we judge a poet or author if we couldn’t say whether their characters act naturally or not in different situations? So, it seems almost impossible to do any science or action without believing in necessity and understanding how motives lead to choices and how character leads to behavior.

Also, when we see how natural facts and moral ideas fit together like one chain, it’s easy to agree they come from the same basics. A prisoner with no money or connections knows he can’t escape, whether he thinks about the guard’s stubbornness or the walls and bars around him. When trying to get free, he tries to change the guard’s mind rather than break the strong walls and iron.
