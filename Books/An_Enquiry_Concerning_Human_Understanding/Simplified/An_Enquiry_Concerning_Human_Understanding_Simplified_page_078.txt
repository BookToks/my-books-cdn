The idea of God, as a super smart, wise, and good Being, comes from thinking about how our own minds work and then imagining those qualities being even bigger and better.

We can keep thinking about this as much as we want, but we’ll always find that every idea we have comes from something we’ve experienced before. If someone says this isn’t always true, they need to show an idea that doesn’t come from an experience. Then, if we want to keep our point, we have to show the experience or feeling that matches that idea.

If a person can’t sense something because of a problem with their body, they also can’t have the idea of it. For example, a blind person can’t imagine colors, and a deaf person can’t imagine sounds. If you give them back that sense, they can understand those ideas easily. The same happens if someone has never experienced something. For example, a person from a place where wine isn’t common might not know what it tastes like. Also, people who are gentle can’t really imagine deep hatred, and selfish people can’t easily understand true friendship. We also accept that other creatures might have senses we don’t even know about because we’ve never felt those things ourselves.

There is one strange example that might show ideas can come without a matching experience. We agree that different colors we see or sounds we hear are not exactly the same, even if they look or sound similar. So, different shades of the same color also create different ideas. If you don’t agree, then by slowly changing one shade into another, you end up with two very different colors being the same idea, which doesn’t make sense.
