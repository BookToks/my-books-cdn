His biggest impact was bringing back Epicurean atomism, but with some changes. For example, unlike Epicurus, he thought space was the same in every direction, with no real ‘up’ or ‘down’. This idea influenced important people like Boyle, Locke, and Newton, and helped shape modern science, as explained earlier in the Introduction.

John Locke (1632–1704) is often called the greatest English philosopher ever (though Hume was Scottish). He had a huge influence on Hume. Locke is best known for his ideas about knowledge, but he also wrote important works on politics, property, education, and religion. He became a key figure for liberalism and tolerance. In the early 1700s, he was probably the most famous thinker in the Western world, and his ideas lasted throughout that century. For example, the American Declaration of Independence in 1776 uses words and ideas from Locke. Locke is mentioned many times in the Enquiry.

For more on Locke’s ideas about knowledge, see sections 3 and 6 of the Introduction. His ideas are similar to Descartes in some ways, like attacking old Aristotelian views and separating qualities into primary and secondary types. He also believed we understand the world by how it seems to us. These ideas were common among the ‘modern’ philosophers of his time, unlike the ancient Aristotelians. When Hume talks about ‘modern philosophy’ or ‘the new philosophy,’ he’s mostly thinking about Locke’s ideas, especially about things like solidity being a primary quality.

Locke’s way of thinking about knowledge is different from Descartes because he focuses more on experience and what is likely true, instead of believing in certain ideas that come from pure reason alone.

George Berkeley (1685–1753) was an Anglican bishop in Ireland from 1734. He is often called the second of the three main British Empiricists, along with Locke and Hume, who were against the three Continental Rationalists: Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz. But this is a simple way to look at things and misses some important details. Berkeley’s ideas mainly respond to Locke’s arguments, and Hume also uses some of Berkeley’s points, especially against the idea that primary and secondary qualities are different.
