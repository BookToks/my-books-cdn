Belief is like having a stronger and clearer idea of something than just imagining it. When we see or think about something many times, it sticks in our mind more. This makes our feelings about it stronger and helps us trust it more. That trust is what belief and opinion are all about.

The same idea applies to how likely things are to happen because of causes, or just by chance. Some causes always lead to the same result and never fail. For example, fire always burns, and water always drowns if you can’t get out. Gravity and pushing things always make them move the same way, and this rule has never been broken.

But other causes don’t always work the same way. For example, rhubarb doesn’t always make you go to the bathroom, and opium doesn’t always make people sleepy. When these causes don’t work as expected, scientists don’t think nature is acting weird. Instead, they believe something hidden inside the body stops the cause from working.

Even so, when we think about what will happen next, we act like nothing strange is going on. We expect the future to be like the past because we are used to thinking that way. If something has always happened the same way before, we are very sure it will happen again and don’t expect anything different.

But if the same cause has caused different effects before, we remember all those possibilities when guessing what will happen next. We usually expect the most common result but also keep in mind the other less common outcomes. We give each possible result a certain chance based on how often it happened before.

For example, in most parts of Europe, it’s more likely to freeze in January than to have warm weather all month. This chance depends on where you live and is almost certain in northern countries. So, when we predict what will happen, we think about all the past results and how often they happened, like one happening 100 times, another 10 times, and another only once.
