Some recent thinkers have questioned whether parts of Hume’s work really show that he believed in a kind of personal, subjective view of things. But his idea that cause and effect might not be real in the usual sense, along with his doubts about how we can know things from experience, have had a big impact on philosophy, especially in knowledge, reality, and science.

After figuring out why we feel there is a “necessary connection” between events, Hume tries to explain what a ‘cause’ really means. He gives two definitions of cause and explains the first one: [1] A cause is something that happens before another thing, and every time something like the first happens, something like the second follows.

Or, in other words [1′], if the first thing hadn’t happened, the second thing wouldn’t have happened either. [2] A cause is something that happens before another thing and always makes us think of that second thing.

Since Hume already said we can’t fully explain what necessity means just by defining it, these two definitions are not just straight dictionary meanings. Instead, they show when we usually think something causes something else. The first definition is about noticing that one thing always comes after another, which makes us believe they are connected. The second is about how seeing the first thing makes us expect the second.

Hume used to say a cause must be right next to its effect in space and time, but later he dropped the idea it must be next to it in space. This change might be because he wanted to allow things like gravity acting over distance or mental events causing things without taking up space.

Also, the way Hume explains his first definition is a bit confusing because it seems to mix up which thing depends on the other.
