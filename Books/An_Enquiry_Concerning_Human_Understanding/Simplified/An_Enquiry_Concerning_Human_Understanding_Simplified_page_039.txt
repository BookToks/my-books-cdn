According to Locke, we can never be 100% sure when we guess what will happen in the future based on what happened in the past, even if we've seen the same thing happen many times (like when I expect a stone to fall if I let go of it in the air).

Hume starts Section VI with an important note where he suggests changing Locke’s words a bit. He uses the word ‘proof’ for cases where past experience is always the same, and ‘probability’ for cases where past experience isn’t always the same. He isn’t changing his earlier ideas, but he thinks it feels wrong to call something like “all men die” just ‘probable,’ since we’ve seen it happen every time and it feels totally certain.

Section VI tries to explain what Hume means by ‘probability’ in this new, narrower way. He shows how the way we figure out causes (talked about in Section V) can also help us understand why we believe some things more strongly than others depending on mixed evidence. This helps his idea of how the mind works, by showing that ‘custom’ (or habits) makes us connect ideas more or less strongly based on the evidence we have. This explains both the ‘probability of chances’ (like guessing which number will show up on a die) and the ‘probability of causes’ (like guessing the next A will be a B because most past As were Bs, even if we don’t know why).

Later, in Section X, Hume will use this idea to talk about miracles. He wants to show not just how we actually reason, but how we should reason. He doesn’t fully explain why, but it seems he wants to give probability reasoning respect by showing it comes from a basic principle that is very important and impossible to ignore in how our minds work. From now on, one of Hume’s main goals in the Enquiry will be to explain what happens if we only trust custom as the way to be rational based on experience.
