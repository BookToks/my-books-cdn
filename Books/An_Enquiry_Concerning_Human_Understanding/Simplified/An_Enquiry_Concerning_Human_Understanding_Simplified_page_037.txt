All this means we are left with only one kind of argument called ‘moral’ argument, which is based on experience. But even if experience can tell us what powers things had before, it can’t prove anything beyond what we have already experienced unless we assume the thing we’re trying to prove, which would be a pointless circle.

So, after ruling out intuition, proof, sensation, and factual reasoning, the result is that none of these usual ways can give us a solid reason to believe that the future will be like the past. That’s why Hume says it’s not logical thinking that makes us expect the future to be like the past or causes to have similar effects.

This means we have no strong rational reason to trust anything beyond what we can directly see or remember, and this idea is what Hume’s famous doubt about induction is all about.

Section V of the Enquiry starts by praising philosophical doubt, which is very different from the usual view back then that saw doubters as enemies of religion and morals. Hume argues that even if there are strong philosophical reasons to doubt, in real life, we can’t stop ourselves from making guesses and forming beliefs.

He says if our mind can’t be convinced by logic to make a certain leap in reasoning, it must be pushed by some other strong and important principle.

Hume also wrote a letter defending himself against harsh attacks that called him a total skeptic, an atheist, someone who denied the soul’s existence, and someone who wanted to destroy morality.
