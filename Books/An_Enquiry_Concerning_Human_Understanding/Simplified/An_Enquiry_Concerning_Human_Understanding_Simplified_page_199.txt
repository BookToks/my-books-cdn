There’s a good reason to think we can understand things very clearly. If we look at many different events and see they all come from one main idea, and then follow that idea to another, we will finally find a few simple ideas that everything else depends on. Even though we might never find the very last truth, it feels good to get as close as we can.

This seems to be what recent thinkers have tried to do, including this author. He wants to study human nature carefully and only say things that experience proves. He doesn’t like guesses or guesses without proof. He thinks that some people who removed guesses from moral philosophy helped the world more than even Lord Bacon, who is called the father of experimental science. He also talks about people like Mr. Locke, Lord Shaftesbury, Dr. Mandeville, Mr. Hutcheson, and Dr. Butler. Even though they don’t agree on everything, they all try to understand human nature based only on experience.

Besides making us feel better knowing about ourselves, it’s safe to say that almost all sciences are part of the study of human nature and depend on it. Logic explains how we think and form ideas. Morals and criticism look at our feelings and tastes. Politics studies how people live together and rely on each other. So, this book about human nature seems like a guide to all sciences. The author has finished the part about logic and started the other parts by talking about emotions.

Monsieur Leibnitz noticed a problem with usual logic systems. They explain very well how we understand things to prove facts, but they don’t say enough about probabilities or how sure we are about things. These are very important because they guide our actions and even most of our thoughts. He included some famous works in this criticism. The author of this book seems to know about this problem and tries to fix it as much as possible. Since the book has many new and interesting ideas, it’s hard to explain everything. So, we will focus on how he explains reasoning about cause and effect. If we understand this, it can help us get an idea of the whole book.
