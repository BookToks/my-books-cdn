Reason doesn’t tell us that a cause will definitely lead to an effect. If it did, that would be like a proof based just on comparing ideas. But no cause-and-effect connection can be proven like that. Here’s why: our mind can imagine any effect coming from any cause, or any event happening after another one. If something is imaginable, it’s at least possible in a basic sense. But when there’s a real proof, the opposite can’t happen without causing a contradiction. So, there’s no solid proof that a cause will always lead to an effect. Most philosophers agree on this.

If Adam wasn’t inspired, he would have needed to see the effect happen after the cause many times. For example, he would have had to watch one ball hit another and then see the second ball start moving.

After seeing this happen enough times, whenever he saw one ball moving toward another, he would be sure the second ball would move too. His mind would expect it before he even saw it happen, based on what he had learned from experience.

So, all reasoning about cause and effect comes from experience, and all reasoning from experience assumes nature will keep working the same way. We believe that the same causes in the same conditions will make the same effects. It’s worth thinking about what makes us come to this important conclusion.

It’s clear that Adam, no matter how smart, couldn’t prove that nature will always stay the same and that the future will be like the past. Something possible can never be proven false, and it’s possible nature could change because we can imagine that. In fact, he couldn’t even prove with good reasons that the future must be like the past. All good reasons assume that the future will be like the past, so they can’t actually prove it. This idea is a fact, and if it needs proof, it can only come from experience. But past experience can only prove the future if we assume they will be similar. So, this is something we accept without any proof.

We believe the future will be like the past simply because we’re used to it. When I see one billiard ball moving toward another, my mind automatically expects the usual result and imagines the second ball moving before I actually see it.
