It’s a general rule that things don’t have any obvious connection to each other, and the conclusions we make come only from seeing them happen together all the time. So, we shouldn’t make an exception for what people say, because their connection to events isn’t any more certain than anything else.

If people didn’t usually remember things well, didn’t tend to tell the truth, didn’t feel bad when caught lying, or didn’t have honesty as part of their nature, we wouldn’t trust what they say at all. Someone who’s confused or known for lying and bad behavior has no authority with us.

Since evidence from witnesses and what people say comes from past experience, it changes depending on that experience. We see it as proof or just a possibility, depending on how often certain reports match real events. There are many things to think about when judging this kind of evidence, and the final way we decide is always based on experience and what we observe. When experience isn’t clear, our opinions can clash, just like with any other kind of proof. We often feel unsure about what others say. We compare the different reasons that cause doubt, and when we find one side stronger, we tend to believe it—but still with less confidence if the other side has strong points.

This disagreement in evidence can come from different reasons: opposite stories, who the witnesses are or how many there are, how they give their testimony, or a mix of all these things. We start to doubt something when witnesses don’t agree, when there aren’t many of them or they seem shady, when they have something to gain, or when they speak hesitantly or too strongly. There are many other things like these that can weaken or ruin the strength of any argument based on what people say.
