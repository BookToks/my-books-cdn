Section VII: ‘Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion’

Hume starts this section by saying it’s important to clear up our ideas, especially about things like power, force, energy, or necessary connection. These ideas are closely tied to causation, which is how we understand cause and effect based on what we experience. Hume’s way of clearing up confusing ideas is to use a kind of “new microscope” that helps us look closely at the impressions (or experiences) that create those ideas. So, he begins by trying to find the impression of necessary connection.

PART I: A Fruitless Search

Hume uses his favorite example of two billiard balls. We see one ball hit the other, see the second ball move, and hear a sound. But what we don’t actually see with our senses is the “necessary connection” that makes us think the first event had to cause the second. All we see is one event happening after the other. We don’t see any real “glue” or power that makes the first ball’s movement cause the second ball to move.

Hume then supports this idea with an important argument that he will use in different ways later. He says that when we first see something, we can’t guess what effect it will have. If we could actually understand the power or energy of a cause just by thinking, we would be able to know what will happen without having to experience it first. We could be sure about it just by using our mind and reasoning. This builds on an earlier idea that all knowledge about cause and effect comes from experience, meaning we can’t know causes and effects before we see them happen.

Hume treats “power” and “necessary connection” as the same thing, sometimes just calling it “connection.” He also links these ideas to words like “force” and “energy.” This means he’s really trying to find the source of the general idea of connection or how one thing leads to another. This fits with his view that the idea of probability comes from the same place.
