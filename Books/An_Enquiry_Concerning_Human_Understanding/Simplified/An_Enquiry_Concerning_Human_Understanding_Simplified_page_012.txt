René Descartes, often called the first big modern philosopher, took these ideas even further. His way of thinking, known as ‘Cartesian’ mechanics, was very popular in the seventeenth century.

Galileo and Descartes together created a new way to understand the physical world. They stopped thinking about things having a purpose or goal (which Aristotle called ‘final’ causes). Instead, they used math to explain everything with mechanical causes, meaning things happen because of forces pushing or pulling.

They saw objects as mostly passive. Objects only change how they move when something else pushes or pulls on them. If nothing acts on an object, it will keep doing what it was already doing—either staying still or moving in a straight line at the same speed. This idea is called inertia. It doesn’t matter if the object is still or moving; it doesn’t have a natural place to go. The object's motion only changes when a force acts on it, but people still argued about how strong that force needed to be.

Descartes’s idea of mechanics was simple and made sense. Instead of Aristotle’s idea that matter was made of five elements that had natural tendencies, Descartes said there is only one kind of matter. This matter’s main quality is that it takes up space (extension). All other properties of matter come from this idea. Because matter is just space-taking, it can’t start moving by itself, which explains why matter is passive and has inertia.

This way of thinking also helped explain how planets and cannonballs move. If matter is just about taking up space, then empty space is just space without matter. For example, air slows things down. In 1971, astronaut David Scott did Galileo’s famous experiment on the Moon and showed that a hammer and a feather fall at the same speed when there’s no air.

Descartes also believed the mind is very different from matter. The mind thinks, while matter just takes up space. Some philosophers, like Hume, didn’t agree with this idea and criticized it.
