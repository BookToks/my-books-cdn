Even though a philosopher might stay away from business, the smart ideas from philosophy, if learned by many people, will slowly spread through society and make every skill and job better. Politicians will get better at planning and balancing power; lawyers will have clearer methods and stronger reasons; and generals will be more organized and careful with their plans. Modern governments are more stable than ancient ones, and modern philosophy is more accurate, and both will probably keep getting better step by step.

Even if studying these things doesn’t give any practical benefit besides satisfying curiosity, that alone should not be ignored. It adds to the few safe and harmless pleasures people can enjoy. The nicest and easiest way to live comes through learning and science. Anyone who can clear obstacles or open new paths in learning should be seen as helping all people. Although studying might seem hard and tiring, some people’s minds are like strong bodies that need tough exercise and find joy in what others might find difficult. Confusion hurts the mind like darkness hurts the eyes; but bringing light to confusion, no matter how hard it is, must feel great and exciting.

But some people say that the confusion in deep and complicated philosophy isn’t just hard but also causes mistakes and doubt. This is the strongest and most reasonable complaint about much of metaphysics: it isn’t really a science. Instead, it comes from people’s useless attempts to understand things beyond human understanding or from tricky superstitions. These superstitions can’t defend themselves openly, so they create confusing ideas to hide their weaknesses. Like robbers chased out of open places, they hide in the forest and wait to attack any weak mind, filling it with religious fears and wrong ideas. Even the strongest person can be overwhelmed if they aren’t careful. Many people, out of fear or foolishness, open the gates to these enemies and accept them like they are the true rulers.
