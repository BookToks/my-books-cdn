The argument: Hume talks about the vis viva debate. Leibniz said that the power of a moving object should be measured by its mass times the square of its speed. Newton’s followers, like Samuel Clarke, thought it was better to use momentum, which is mass times speed.

Today, we know both ideas are partly right. Momentum is about how things push each other when they collide or attract due to gravity, but it doesn’t help much with things like how projectiles fly because changes in Earth’s momentum are too small to notice. Kinetic energy, which matches Leibniz’s idea, works well for calculating motion under gravity but only in perfect collisions where no energy is lost as heat.

Mensuration means measurement.

The note about “frequent” wasn’t in the 1748 edition of the Enquiry. In the 1750 edition, its last part was much shorter: “A Cause is different from a Sign; it means it happens before and near in time and place, as well as always together. A Sign is just an effect from the same cause.” 

“We shall here” refers to a part in the Enquiry that is very close to an earlier section called “Rules by which to judge of causes and effects.” See the note at the end of section [D].

Monsieur Montgeron: Louis-Basile Carré de Montgeron (1686–1754) was a Jansenist. He wrote a book called La Vérité des miracles, which talked about supposed miraculous healings. He gave the book to King Louis XV at Versailles and warned about the Pope and Jesuits’ political power. Because of this, he was arrested by the police chief René Hérault (1691–1740), who tried to stop Jansenist supporters like Abbé Paris.

Recueil des Miracles de l’Abbé Paris: This book was written anonymously and given by 23 priests to the archbishop of Paris on August 13, 1731. It was published, but the archbishop didn’t reply, so 22 priests sent another request for an investigation on October 4, 1731.

Cardinal Noailles: Cardinal Louis Antoine Noailles (1651–1729) tried to stop Jansenism from being condemned but failed when the French government forced a papal order called Unigenitus in 1713. This caused a big fight with lots of books and pamphlets on both sides. Noailles’s successor, Archbishop Vintimille of Aix, supported the Pope and helped Hérault go after the Jansenists.

Molinist... Mademoiselle le Franc: Molinism is a religious idea from the Spanish Jesuit Luis de Molina (1535–1600). The French Jesuits strongly supported it as they opposed the Jansenists who believed in predestination.
