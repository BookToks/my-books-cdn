SECTION XI 132 About a Special Kind of Care and Life After Death

I was recently talking with a friend who likes to challenge ideas and question everything. Even though he shared many ideas I don’t agree with, they seemed interesting and connected to the main topic we were discussing. So, I’ll try to remember and share them here as best as I can, so you can think about them too.

Our talk started when I said how lucky philosophy is. Philosophy needs complete freedom more than anything else, and it grows best when different opinions and arguments are allowed. It actually began in a time and place where people were free and tolerant. Even the most wild ideas were never stopped by strict rules or punishments. For example, except for the cases of Protagoras being banished and Socrates dying (which had other reasons too), ancient history doesn’t show much of the kind of strict intolerance we see today. Epicurus lived a long, peaceful life in Athens. People who followed Epicurean ideas were even allowed to become priests and take part in important religious ceremonies. Also, the smartest Roman emperors gave money and support to teachers of all kinds of philosophy.

It’s easy to understand why philosophy needed this kind of support when it was just starting out. Even now, when philosophy is stronger and tougher, it still struggles a lot against harsh criticism and unfair treatment.
