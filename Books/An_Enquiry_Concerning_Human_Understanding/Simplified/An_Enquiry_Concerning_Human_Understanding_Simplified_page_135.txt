We can call this influence whatever we want, but since it usually happens with the action, we have to see it as a cause and an example of the idea of necessity that we are trying to explain.

The only thing we should hate or want revenge on is a person or creature that can think and be aware. When bad or harmful actions make us angry, it’s because of how those actions relate to the person who did them. Actions themselves don’t last forever; they are temporary. If these actions don’t come from something real and lasting inside the person, they don’t make the person good or bad. The actions might be wrong and against the rules of morality or religion, but the person isn’t responsible for them if they don’t come from something steady inside. Since these actions don’t leave anything lasting behind, the person can’t be punished or hated for them. So, if we don’t believe in necessity or causes, a person is just as innocent after doing something terrible as they were when they were born, and their character has nothing to do with their actions because the bad actions don’t prove the person is bad.

People aren’t blamed for things they do by accident or without meaning to, no matter what happens. Why? Because these actions only happen once and don’t come from a lasting cause inside them. People are blamed less for acting quickly without thinking than for actions they plan carefully. Why? Because a quick temper, even though it’s part of the person’s mind, only shows up sometimes and doesn’t affect their whole character. Also, saying sorry and changing your behavior can erase past crimes. How does this make sense? Because actions only make a person guilty if they show the person has bad thoughts or feelings inside. When the person changes and stops having those bad thoughts, the actions no longer prove anything bad and aren’t wrong anymore. But without the idea of necessity, those actions were never really proof of a bad character and never really wrong.
