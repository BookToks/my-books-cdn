Introduction xlix instincts. Maybe because of this, Hume’s talk about instincts is pretty short, and he avoids the tricky ideas he explains more in his essay ‘Of the Immortality of the Soul’ (which you can find in Appendix II).

The main idea Hume wants to share is connected to his scientific way of thinking: since all our facts and reasoning depend on assuming things stay the same or are similar, how strong our conclusions are depends on how similar the things really are. Hume shows this by comparing humans and animals—he points out that animals use instincts to reason, which supports his idea (from Sections IV and V) that humans also use instincts when they think. But his idea applies more broadly.

Basically, reasoning by comparing things (analogy) is just a natural step from learning by habit or custom, just like how he showed that thinking based on chance (probability) works in Section VI.

16. Section X: ‘Of Miracles’ This part is mainly about miracles, but it’s important for more than that. Here, Hume’s idea about learning from habit helps us figure out how to judge different pieces of evidence, especially when we hear stories from people. He starts (E10.3–4) by reminding us about his idea of probability from Section VI, explaining that a smart person believes things based on how strong the evidence is. He says: A wise person matches their belief to the amount of proof they have. All probability means there are different tests and observations, and the side with more proof wins and gives stronger evidence (E10.4). Then, he says this rule should also apply when we listen to witnesses, so how much we trust what they say depends on how reliable they have been before.

But experience shows that witnesses aren’t always reliable for lots of reasons, like if there are other witnesses who say the opposite, how many witnesses there are, their honesty, how they tell their story, or a mix of all these things (E10.7). These are all things we naturally think about when deciding if we should believe a witness, and it depends on weighing all the good and bad reasons in each situation.
