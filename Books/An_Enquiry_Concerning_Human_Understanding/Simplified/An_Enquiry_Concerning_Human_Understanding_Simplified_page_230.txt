I wish your friend hadn’t called me an unbeliever just because of ten or twelve pages he thought sounded that way. I’ve written many books on history, literature, politics, trade, and morals that are completely harmless in that sense. Should a person be called a drunk just because they were seen drunk once in their life?

That said, your friend is very smart, though maybe a bit too passionate for a philosopher. Now, if I may say something to you: whenever we talked about common topics like literature or reasoning, I always enjoyed and learned from our talks. But when you changed the subject to your job, even though I know you meant well, I didn’t enjoy it as much. I often got bored, and you got upset. So, I hope that in the future, whenever we meet, we can avoid talking about those topics. I’ve stopped trying to learn about them, even though I know you’re really good at explaining.

You can share any part of this letter with your friend that you think is right. I remain, Sir, your humble servant, David Hume.

Dear Sir, it’s very rare that debates in philosophy or theology happen without turning into personal fights. So, I think it’s unusual that ours hasn’t. I want to thank you for being polite and kind while arguing with me about miracles.

Any small signs of anger I complained about when you first showed me the manuscript are now gone or explained, and you’ve been much kinder than I expected.
