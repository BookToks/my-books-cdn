SECTION XII 149 Of the Academical or Sceptical Philosophy PART I

There are more arguments about whether God exists than about any other topic. These arguments also try to prove that atheists are wrong. Still, even the most religious thinkers argue about whether someone can truly be a complete atheist just by thinking about it. How can we explain these disagreements? Long ago, knights who searched for dragons and giants never doubted these monsters were real.

The Skeptic is another kind of enemy to religion. This makes religious people and serious thinkers upset. But no one has ever met a person who has no opinion or belief about anything, whether it’s about actions or ideas. This makes us ask: What does it mean to be a skeptic? And how far can doubt and uncertainty go in thinking?

There is a type of skepticism that comes before any study or philosophy. Descartes and others taught this as a way to avoid mistakes and quick judgments. It suggests we should doubt everything—even our own senses. They say we must prove that our senses are trustworthy by using a chain of reasoning that starts from a basic idea that can’t be wrong. But there is no such basic idea that is clearly better than all others. And even if there was one, we would have to use the same senses we doubt to understand it. So, this kind of doubt can’t really happen in real life. If it did, we could never be sure about anything.

However, it’s true that a milder kind of skepticism can be helpful. It makes sense to doubt a little at first when studying philosophy. This kind of doubt helps us keep an open mind and stop us from believing things just because we were taught to or because we judged too quickly.
