Hume calls this idea of learning from experience “custom” or “habit.” He says it’s super important because without it, we wouldn’t know anything about facts unless we see or remember them right away. Custom helps us ignore doubts by making us naturally and quickly guess what will happen next based on what we’ve seen before. These guesses aren’t based on logic, so they can’t really be questioned by people who doubt reason. This might make it seem like Hume thinks we shouldn’t trust reason at all, but later we’ll see that’s not true.

Part two of Section Five talks about what belief is, but Hume says it’s not a big deal and we can skip it without missing much. Part one was like a map of the mind, showing that custom is one of the main mental powers. Part two tries to dig a little deeper into how custom works. The main idea is that custom is kind of like how ideas connect to each other, as explained earlier. This shows how studying the mind can work by breaking things down into simple rules and explaining many effects by a few causes, using comparisons, experience, and observation. Hume already said this kind of system is the best human reason can do because it’s impossible to fully understand why things happen just by thinking about them.

So, Part two of Section Five gives a quick example of Hume’s overall way of doing science, but applied to the human mind.

In Section Six, called “Of Probability,” we learn that Hume took an idea from Locke about two types of reasoning: one that is certain (demonstrative) and one that is more about guessing (probable). Hume usually calls this second type “moral reasoning” or thinking about facts and what exists.
