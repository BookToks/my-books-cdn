Part II starts by reminding us of what was said earlier, pointing out that the idea of a "necessary connection" between things is probably not real and the term doesn’t really mean much. But then Hume offers a different idea that makes more sense. Maybe the feeling of a necessary connection doesn’t come from actually seeing cause and effect happening, but instead from seeing the same things happen over and over again. Because of this repetition, our mind gets used to expecting one thing to follow another, and this habit makes us think there is a power or connection between them.

So, the idea of a necessary connection comes from how we realize we expect one thing to happen after another. When we have seen A always followed by B, we start to expect B whenever we see A. We know we are making this mental jump or guess. This guess is what gives us the idea of a connection between A and B. When we say A causes B, we usually think there is a real link that makes B happen after A. But Hume says it’s actually the other way around: it’s our habit of guessing that B will come after A that makes us believe in a connection.

Now, the idea of necessary connection is real, but it comes from something inside us—what Hume calls an "impression." This is really just being aware of how we think and make guesses. This means we don’t have a real idea of any kind of power or force in objects themselves. Instead, Hume famously concludes that when we say one thing is connected to another, we just mean that we have made a connection in our own thoughts. The idea of necessity, whether in matter or mind, isn’t a feature of the thing itself but something in the mind of the person thinking about it.
