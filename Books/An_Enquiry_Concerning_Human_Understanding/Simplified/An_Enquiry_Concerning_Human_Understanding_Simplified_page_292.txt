Boyle really liked the mechanical philosophy. This idea helped people discover some secrets of nature and imagine the rest. It made people feel proud and curious. He died in 1691 when he was 65 years old.

Isaac Newton (1643–1727) was one of the most famous scientists ever. He was an English mathematician and physicist. He invented calculus but waited a long time to publish it, which caused a big fight with a German philosopher named Leibniz. Newton used calculus to explain how things move on Earth and in space, as mentioned earlier.  

Hume’s History of England praises Newton a lot. It says Newton was careful to only believe ideas based on experiments but open to new and unusual ideas. He was humble and didn’t try to make his ideas easy for everyone to understand. He cared more about doing good work than becoming famous. Because of this, people didn’t know about him for a long time, but when they did, he became very famous.  

Even though Newton explained some mysteries of nature, his work also showed that the mechanical philosophy was not perfect. For example, gravity couldn’t be explained by machines or simple parts. This meant some secrets of nature would always stay mysterious. Newton died in 1727 at the age of 85.

Newton is mentioned in an important note [D] to a section called E 7.25. This note tries to separate Newton himself from some of his followers, who had religious ideas and believed in occasionalism, as explained earlier.
