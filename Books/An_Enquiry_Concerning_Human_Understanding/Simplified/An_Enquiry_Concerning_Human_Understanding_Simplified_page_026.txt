Berkeley says it’s impossible for anything we can sense to exist outside a mind. He also says that things we don’t perceive, like the supposed basic qualities of objects, can’t even be like the ideas we have in our minds.

He then argues that the difference between primary qualities (like shape) and secondary qualities (like color) doesn’t really make sense. This is because we always experience them together—like we only see an object’s shape by seeing its color. So, we can’t think about one without the other.

Even if objects like our ideas did exist outside the mind, those objects would have to be completely inactive. They wouldn’t be able to cause us to perceive them. So, Berkeley concludes that the only things that are truly active in the universe are minds or spirits, and everything we see is made up of inactive ideas.

It’s strange that a way of thinking inspired by physical science—which says matter is inactive—would lead to ideas like occasionalism and immaterialism. These ideas say physical objects don’t actually cause anything in the world we see.

But Berkeley worked hard to make his ideas fit with physical science. He built on Newton’s idea that science’s job is just to find rules that predict what we’ll perceive, no matter if the unseen things those rules talk about really exist. If immaterialism is true, then forces and material objects don’t actually exist. Instead, the complexity we see in the world comes from God’s direct action.

God kindly makes sure our perceptions happen in patterns that seem like they’re caused by physical objects and forces, even though they’re not.
