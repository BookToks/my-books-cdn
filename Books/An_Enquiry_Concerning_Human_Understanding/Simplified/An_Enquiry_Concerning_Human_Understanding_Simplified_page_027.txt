Introduction

God created the world with material rules so that we can learn to predict what will happen and live our lives based on that. Our senses give us ideas about objects, but these ideas are like signs from God that help us guess what will happen, not actual pictures of real things. This way of thinking doesn’t change how science works or how useful it is. Science can still work well and help us, even if it isn’t showing the real physical world exactly.

7. The Humean Revolution

Now we can understand why Hume’s ideas were so important and different. Basically, he agreed with Locke that ideas come from experience and that we learn facts this way. But Hume took these ideas much further. He rejected the idea that we have any pure, logical understanding of how things work and used strong doubts to question if we can really understand cause and effect.

Hume’s first big doubt shows that we only know cause and effect from experience, but experience doesn’t tell us why causes work. For example, the idea that one billiard ball hitting another causes it to move is just something we get used to, not something we truly understand. Then he looks at how we learn from experience. Locke thought we use reason to see what probably causes what, but Hume says that all learning from experience is based on a natural guess that what happened before will happen again, even though we can’t prove this guess is true. So, our ability to think about facts isn’t some perfect logical skill; it’s more like what animals do, just more advanced.

Hume’s next big point is about the idea of cause itself. He says cause doesn’t come from understanding the world but from how we connect ideas in our minds. This might sound bad for science, but Hume uses it as a chance to say that real cause should be understood this way. He finishes by giving his own definition of “cause” based on this idea.
