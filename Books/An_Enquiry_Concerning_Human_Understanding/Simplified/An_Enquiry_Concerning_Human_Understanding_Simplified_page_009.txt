Human reason works a lot like in Book I of the Treatise, but instead of pushing people to doubt everything, it takes human thinking seriously and uses it to support modern science. At the same time, it rejects old ideas that don't make sense, like traditional metaphysics and superstitions.

Hume’s achievement is huge when you think about how long the ideas he challenged had been around, going all the way back to ancient Greece. Even though by his time many old medieval beliefs had been rejected, they were replaced by new beliefs that were harder to notice because they were everywhere.

Once we understand the links between ancient, medieval, and early modern times, we can better appreciate Hume’s book, the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding. It’s one of the best works in philosophy and shows Hume’s mature ideas about knowledge.

1. From Ancient to Modern Cosmology  
Aristotle was highly respected in medieval times because his ideas fit well with Christianity, especially after Thomas Aquinas refined this blend. When the Roman Empire became Christian, it shut down all the old pagan schools of philosophy from ancient Greece, like the Epicureans and Stoics. These old ideas were mostly forgotten until the Renaissance, when scholars brought back ancient texts saved in Greece and the Muslim world. This sparked new ways of thinking and made people question old authorities.

At the same time, big changes like population growth, new technology (like gunpowder), and discovering new lands and cultures pushed people to rethink what they believed.  

The Roman emperor Theodosius I destroyed pagan temples and libraries in 391, and later Emperor Justinian shut down the remaining pagan schools in 529. For quick info about these old philosophies or tricky words, you can check the Glossarial Index or Glossary below.
