Places have a strong power to influence us, so it’s no surprise they help us remember things better. Hume is about to say that the way habits work is kind of like the way three ideas connect in our minds: things that look alike, things that happen close together, and things that cause other things. But first, he points out a difference: habits make us believe new things, while those three ideas just bring to life thoughts about things we already believe in.

Pre-established harmony is an idea from a famous German philosopher named Leibniz. He believed the world works in a special way, similar to another idea called occasionalism. Leibniz agreed with Malebranche that things don’t actually cause each other directly. But instead of God causing things every time they seem to interact, Leibniz thought each thing acts on its own, and God planned everything to work together perfectly ahead of time. Hume finds it funny that Leibniz’s religious idea is kind of like his own more natural explanation.

Final causes mean explaining why things change by saying they have goals or purposes. Aristotle used this idea, saying objects move because they want to reach their natural place in the world. Hume’s comment about this isn’t meant to be taken too seriously.

Hume is a determinist, which means he believes everything in the world follows fixed laws. If we knew everything about the world right now, we could predict what will happen next. But here, he says that because we don’t know all the causes, we have to guess based on probability, almost like when we roll dice and the results seem random.

Belief, Hume says, comes from thinking about chances in a way that’s a lot like how habits form. He’s not giving a detailed explanation here, unlike in his earlier work, but he suggests we can understand it a bit by seeing the similarities.

A purge is something that makes you poop, and a soporific is something that makes you sleepy.

“Received systems” are ideas most people accept, and “sensible of” means being aware of something.
