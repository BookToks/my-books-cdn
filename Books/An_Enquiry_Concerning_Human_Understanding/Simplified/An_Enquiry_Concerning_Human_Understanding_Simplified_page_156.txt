Section X and the records and witnesses that could have helped explain the situation have been lost forever.

There are no ways to find out the truth except by looking carefully at what the people who reported it said. These clues are usually clear enough for smart and experienced people, but they are often too tricky for most people to understand.

Overall, it seems that no testimony about any miracle has ever been likely enough to be true, let alone proven. Even if it were proven, it would be contradicted by other proof based on how things normally work. Experience is what makes us trust what people say, and it also teaches us about the laws of nature. So when experience about a miracle goes against experience about how nature works, we have to compare both and decide which makes more sense. For most popular religions, this comparison cancels everything out. So, we can say that no human testimony is strong enough to prove a miracle or make it the main reason for any religion.

I want you to notice an important point here: when I say a miracle can never be proven enough to be the foundation of a religion, I don’t mean miracles can’t happen at all. Maybe some miracles, or breaks in how nature usually works, could be proven by people’s stories. But it’s probably impossible to find any real examples in history. For example, imagine if all writers in every language agreed that from January 1, 1600, the whole world was in total darkness for eight days. Suppose people still remember this event clearly, and travelers from other countries tell the same story without any differences. Then, scientists today should accept it as true and try to understand why it happened.

The natural process of decay and breakdown is so likely that any event pointing to it can be trusted if many people tell the same story in the same way.

But now imagine if all historians of England said Queen Elizabeth died on January 1, 1600; that before and after her death, her doctors and the court saw her as usual; that her successor was chosen and announced by parliament; and that after being buried for a month, she came back, took her throne again, and ruled for three more years. I would be surprised by these strange stories happening together, but I would not believe such a miracle.
