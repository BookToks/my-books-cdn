His idea also applies to love, hate, and other feelings. These topics are interesting but hard to explain without a long discussion, so we will skip them here.

Maybe you’ll like to hear what the author says about free will. He builds his idea on what he said earlier about cause and effect.

“It’s well known that the actions of things outside us happen for sure, and when they move, attract, or stick together, there is no sign of choice or freedom.” So, anything like matter must also happen for sure. To understand if this is true for our thoughts and actions, we can look at matter and see why we think one thing always causes another.

It has been noticed that we never see the final link between objects by our senses or reason. We can’t understand exactly how things affect each other deep down. We only know they always happen together. Because they happen together all the time, our mind expects one thing to follow the other. So, the two important parts of necessity are the constant connection and the mind’s conclusion. Where we find these, we must accept necessity.

It’s clear that certain actions always happen with certain reasons. If actions don’t always match their reasons, this uncertainty is like what we see in matter, where causes can mix and effects can change. For example, thirty grains of opium will kill a person who isn’t used to it, but thirty grains of rhubarb won’t always make someone sick. Similarly, fear of death will always make a person change their path, but it won’t always make them do something wrong.

Because actions and their reasons often go together, the mind’s conclusion about them is as sure as any reasoning about objects. The stronger the connection, the stronger the conclusion. This is why we trust witnesses, believe history, and make decisions in life.

The author says this way of thinking changes the whole debate by giving a new meaning to necessity. Even the biggest supporters of free will have to admit this connection and conclusion happen with human actions.
