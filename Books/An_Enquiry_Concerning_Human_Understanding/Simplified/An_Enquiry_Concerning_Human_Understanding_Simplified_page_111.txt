We know that heat always comes with fire, but we have no idea how they are connected.

Because of this, we can’t get the idea of power just by watching things happen in the world. No object shows us power by itself, so we can’t base the idea of power on that.

Since things outside don’t show us power or a necessary connection, let’s see if this idea comes from thinking about how our own minds work. Some say we feel power inside us because we know we can move our body just by deciding to. When we want to move, our body moves or we think of something new. We know this because we are aware of it. So, we get the idea of power by thinking about how our mind controls our body and thoughts.

Now, let’s look closer at how our will moves our body. This is a fact we learn from experience, like other natural events. But we can’t predict it just by looking at the cause or see the power that links the cause and effect.

We know our body moves when we want it to, and we are aware of this all the time. But how exactly our will makes this happen, or the power behind it, is something we can never fully understand, no matter how hard we try.

Mr. Locke said that since we see new things happen in matter, we think there must be power causing them, and this gives us the idea of power. But no amount of reasoning can give us a new simple idea, as he admits. So, this can’t be where the idea of power really comes from.
