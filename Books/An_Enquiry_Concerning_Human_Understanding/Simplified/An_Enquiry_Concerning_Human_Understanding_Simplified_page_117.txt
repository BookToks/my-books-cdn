Even if the reasons leading to it seem very logical, we should still be very doubtful—maybe even sure—that the idea has gone way beyond what we can really understand, especially when it results in conclusions that are so strange and far from everyday life and experience. We’ve entered a kind of fantasy world long before we’ve finished our theory; and there, we can’t trust our usual ways of arguing or believe that our normal comparisons and guesses mean much. Our reasoning isn’t strong enough to explore such huge unknowns. No matter how much we think we’re using experience and things that seem true at every step, we can be sure that this “experience” doesn’t really help when we’re dealing with things totally outside what we know from experience. But we’ll talk more about this later.

Second, I don’t see any strong proof for this theory. It’s true we don’t understand how physical things affect each other—their power or energy is totally confusing to us. But aren’t we just as clueless about how a mind, even the greatest mind, works on itself or on a body? How, then, can we even get an idea about it? We don’t feel or know this power inside ourselves. We only understand the idea of a Supreme Being by thinking about our own minds. So if not knowing something were a good reason to reject it, we’d have to deny all power in the Supreme Being just like we do for physical matter. We really understand neither one. Is it harder to believe that motion happens because of a push than that it happens because of a decision? All we know is that we don’t understand either case.

To finish this argument, which is already too long: We have looked everywhere for an idea of power or necessary connection but couldn’t find it. It seems that, in single examples...
