There only needs to be one thing that connects everything to the writer’s original plan or idea.

A historian writing about Europe during a certain century would focus on events that happened in that time and place. Even if these events are different and not directly related, they still belong together because they happened there and then.

But the most common way events are connected in a story is through cause and effect. The historian follows actions in the order they happened, looks for the reasons behind them, and shows their results. They pick a part of the long chain of events in human history and try to include every link in their story. Sometimes, they don’t have all the facts and have to guess what happened. They know that the more complete this chain is, the better their story will be. Understanding causes is important because it helps us learn from the past and control what happens in the future.

This helps us understand what people mean by “Unity of Action,” an idea many critics have talked about since Aristotle. It means that in any story, there needs to be a clear connection between events. If our thoughts jump around too much, the story won’t hold people’s attention. Even someone writing about the life of Achilles, whether as a historian or a poet, would connect events by showing how they depend on each other. A person’s actions are linked throughout their whole life, from birth to death. You can’t remove even a small part of this chain without changing the whole story.
