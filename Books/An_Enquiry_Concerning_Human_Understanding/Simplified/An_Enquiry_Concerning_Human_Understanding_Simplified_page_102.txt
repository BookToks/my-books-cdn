We can make these experiments stronger by looking at the effects of things being close together and things being similar.

When something is far away, it doesn’t affect our thoughts as much. But when we get closer to something, even if we don’t see or hear it directly, it still feels like it’s happening right now in our minds. Thinking about one thing easily makes us think about things near it, but actually being near something makes those thoughts much stronger. For example, if I’m a few miles from home, I feel more connected to it than if I’m really far away. Even when I’m far, thinking about places near my family still makes me think of them. But when both things are just ideas in my mind, the connection between them isn’t as powerful because there’s no real experience to make it stronger.

No one can doubt that cause and effect works like similarity and closeness. People who believe in superstitions like to keep things that belonged to saints or holy people because it helps them feel closer to those people and their good lives. The best thing they could have is something the saint actually made or used. Things like their clothes or furniture are special because the saint touched and used them. These things are connected to the saint in a way that makes them more meaningful, like they’re effects of the saint’s life.
