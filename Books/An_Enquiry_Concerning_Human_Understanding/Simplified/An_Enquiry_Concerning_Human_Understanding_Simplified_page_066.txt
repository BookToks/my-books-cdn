He didn’t find much success at first and realized he made a mistake by sharing his work too early. So, he rewrote everything in the next pieces, fixing some mistakes in his ideas and especially in how he explained them.

Still, some writers who responded to his ideas only focused on his early work, which he never even accepted as his final thoughts. They acted like they had won by pointing out problems in that early version.
