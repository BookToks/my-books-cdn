A helpful person might give a grumpy answer: "But he has a toothache, or hasn’t eaten." A silly person might act very excited: "But he just got some good news!" Sometimes, people do things that no one really understands—not even themselves. We know that people’s behavior can be pretty unpredictable and change a lot.

This is actually a normal part of being human. Some people don’t have a clear way of acting and just do whatever they feel like at the moment. Even though their actions seem random, there are still some steady reasons behind what they do, just like how the weather changes but is still controlled by natural laws that we don’t always understand.

So, it seems that the reasons behind people’s actions and the actions themselves happen in a regular way, just like cause and effect in nature. Everyone agrees on this, and it’s never really been a big argument in philosophy or everyday life. Since we learn from experience, we expect things we’ve seen happen before to happen again in the future. Because of this, it might seem unnecessary to prove that people’s actions follow patterns.

But to look at this idea from different angles, we’ll also talk a little about this topic.

People depend on each other a lot in society. Almost no one does something completely on their own without thinking about what others will do. For example, a poor worker who works alone still expects the law to protect him so he can keep what he earns.

He also expects that when he brings his goods to sell, people will want to buy them at a fair price. Then, with the money he gets, he can buy what he needs to live. The more people interact with others, the more they expect different actions from others to work together with their own plans.
