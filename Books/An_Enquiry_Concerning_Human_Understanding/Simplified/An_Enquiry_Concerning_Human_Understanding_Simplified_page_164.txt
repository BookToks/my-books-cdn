We can only believe that certain qualities exist if we see signs of them now. Thinking there are more qualities we don’t see is just guessing. It’s even more guessing to think that far away in space or time, there have been or will be better displays of these qualities or a system that fits those imagined traits.

We can’t start with the effects we see in the universe, jump to a cause like Jupiter, and then guess new effects from that cause. The effects we see now are enough to show how great the qualities we give to that god are. Since we only know the cause from the effects, they have to match perfectly. We can’t use the cause to guess anything beyond what we already see.

You notice things happening in nature and look for a cause or creator. When you think you’ve found one, you get so attached to this idea that you believe it must create something better and more perfect than what exists now, which has problems and disorder.

You forget that this super-smart and kind creator is mostly made up in your mind or at least has no strong reason behind it. You have no reason to give it any qualities except those you can actually see in what it has made. So, philosophers, make your gods fit what we see in nature now. Don’t change what we see just to make them fit the qualities you wish they had.

When priests and poets, backed by your respect, Athenians, talk about a golden or silver age before the bad times we live in, I listen carefully and respectfully. But when philosophers who say they ignore authority and use reason say the same thing, I don’t give them the same respect. I ask: who took them to heaven, who let them join the gods’ meetings, who showed them the future, that they can boldly say their gods have done or will do anything beyond what we actually see?
