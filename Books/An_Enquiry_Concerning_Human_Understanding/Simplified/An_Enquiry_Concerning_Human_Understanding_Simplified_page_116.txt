Because they don’t understand, they come to the same idea. They say that God is the direct cause of the connection between the soul and body. They believe it’s not the senses that feel things when outside objects move them, but that God chooses to make us feel those sensations because of the movement in our body parts.

In the same way, it’s not our will that moves our body parts. Instead, God helps our weak will by ordering our bodies to move. People often think we do it ourselves, but really it’s God’s power.

Some philosophers take this even further. They say our thoughts and ideas don’t come from our will either. When we think about something or picture it in our mind, it’s God who shows us that idea and makes it clear to us.

So, these philosophers believe God is everywhere and in everything. They don’t just think that God lets things exist or have power, they think nothing has any power on its own. This way, they want to show that everything depends directly on God.

But they don’t realize this idea actually makes God seem less powerful, not more. It takes more power for God to give some power to other creatures than to do everything by himself. It shows more wisdom if God made the world so well at the start that it works on its own, instead of God having to control every little part all the time.

If we want to argue against this idea in a smart way, two thoughts might help.

First, this idea that God controls everything all the time is too extreme to convince anyone who knows how limited human thinking really is.
