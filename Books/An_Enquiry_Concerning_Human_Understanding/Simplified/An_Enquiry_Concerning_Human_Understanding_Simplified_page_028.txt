Understanding things completely isn’t always possible, but that’s okay because science’s main goal is to find and explain the rules that describe how things work (E4.12). So, causes in science should be seen as tools to explain things, just like Newton did with gravity and Berkeley expanded on. This idea is explained more in Section VIII, where Hume agrees with Hobbes that everything can be explained by cause and effect working together. Hume’s new way of thinking about causes shows that not fully understanding how things work in the moral world doesn’t stop real causes or the idea that human actions follow certain rules. Because of this, studying morals like a science—as Hume did in many of his essays—is possible. Then, Hume questions the logical reasons for believing in God (Sections X and XI) and suggests a “soft doubt” that doesn’t expect absolute certainty, keeps our scientific goals realistic, and focuses only on what we can experience (Section XII).

From this view, Darwin’s biology and modern science after 1900 prove Hume right. Darwin showed we are closely connected to animals. Then, theories like relativity and quantum physics proved that the world isn’t as easy to understand as famous philosophers like Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant thought. Because of this, Hume’s careful, experience-based, and practical approach to science has become common. So, the Enquiry might seem simple and harmless today. But it still has important lessons for modern scientists, who often don’t use their critical thinking outside the lab. Hume would say we should also question our religious and moral beliefs carefully since they guide our lives. To understand all this better, let’s now look more closely at the Enquiry itself.

Section I: The Aims of the Enquiry starts as an introduction but first compares two types of “moral philosophy” (which means the study of people).
