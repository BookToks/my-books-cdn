Hume’s footnotes use numbers instead of the original symbols. People used to mix up the ability to know what’s true or false with the ability to see what’s right or wrong. They thought morality was based on fixed rules, like math facts, that everyone would agree on.

But a later philosopher showed, with strong reasons, that morality isn’t about some fixed truth. Instead, it depends on how each person feels or what they like, just like how some things taste sweet or bitter depending on your own senses. So, moral feelings shouldn’t be thought of as logical thinking but more like personal tastes or feelings.

Philosophers used to split all feelings into two groups: selfish and kind. They thought these two groups were always opposite and that being kind meant giving up selfish feelings.

Selfish feelings included things like greed, ambition, and revenge. Kind feelings included love, friendship, and caring about the community. But now, philosophers see this split isn’t right. It has been proven clearly that even selfish feelings push us to focus on something outside ourselves. Although these feelings make us happy, the happiness doesn’t cause the feeling; instead, the feeling comes first. Without the feeling, the happiness wouldn’t happen. The same is true for kind feelings.

So, when someone wants their own fame or wants their friend to be happy, they are equally interested in the outcome. Also, when someone works hard for the public good or for their own ambition, they aren’t more or less selfless. This shows that the line between selfish and kind feelings is much blurrier than people used to think.
