He argues that Geometry isn’t exact enough to prove ideas about dividing things infinitely. All Geometry is based on the ideas of things being equal or not equal. So, if we have a perfect way to measure equality, Geometry can be very exact. But if we don’t, it can’t be that exact.

One way to measure equality is to think of quantity as made of tiny, indivisible points. Two lines are equal if they have the same number of points, and each point in one line matches a point in the other. But even if this idea is perfect, it doesn’t help because we can’t count the points in a line. Also, it assumes things can only be divided a limited number of times, so it can’t prove anything about dividing things infinitely.

If we don’t use this way to measure equality, we don’t have any exact way at all. People often say two lines longer than a yard are equal if they have an equal number of smaller parts like inches. But this doesn’t work because it assumes the inch in one line is equal to the inch in the other, which is the same question we started with. If we keep going smaller and smaller, we never get a real answer. So this isn’t a good way to measure equality.

Most philosophers say the word “equal” can’t be fully defined. They think it’s enough to show two equal things, like two diameters of a circle, so we understand the word. But this means we judge equality by how things look or feel, using our imagination and senses. This way can’t be perfectly exact and can’t prove anything against what we imagine or sense.

Whether this way of thinking is right or wrong is up to experts to decide. It would be great if there was a way to make philosophy and common sense agree, because they often clash when it comes to the idea of infinite divisibility.

Now we move on to the second volume of this work, which talks about the Passions. It’s easier to understand than the first, but has ideas that are just as new and unusual. The author starts with pride and humility. He notices that many different things can cause these feelings.

Pride or self-esteem can come from qualities of the mind, like being smart, brave, or honest. It can also come from qualities of the body, like being beautiful, strong, or good at dancing, riding, or fencing. Pride can also come from outside advantages, like your country, family, children, money, houses, gardens, horses, dogs, or clothes.

Later, the author tries to find what all these different things have in common that makes them affect our feelings.
