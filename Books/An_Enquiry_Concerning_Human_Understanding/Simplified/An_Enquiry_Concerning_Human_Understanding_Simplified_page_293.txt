HUME’S INDEX [This index was made from the 1777 edition, but I also checked the 1772, 1770, and 1764 editions to clear up any confusing parts or fix obvious mistakes (like entries that were clearly wrong, not just incomplete). The references point to places in this volume that seem to best match what Hume meant, showing first a paragraph (or endnote), and then the page number in brackets.

Sometimes, when Hume mentions two pages in one entry, you’ll see two references to the same paragraph or page here.

Hume’s own references are to the pages in his two-volume set called Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects. His original index includes many entries for those essays and other works, plus the first Enquiry, which are the ones listed here.

The way words are capitalized (and sometimes punctuation) mostly follows Hume’s style, except for words like ‘Fact’ and ‘Jansenists’, which he only capitalized because they were the first entries under ‘F’ and ‘I’. Hume treated ‘I’ and ‘J’ as the same letter, but here they’re sorted the way we do now.

Some entries might seem strange. For example, ‘Immortality of the Soul, on what founded’ and ‘Providence, particular, on what founded’ only point to paragraphs 11.21 or 11.22. Neither really explains why people believe in immortality or providence. But this isn’t a mistake: Hume is making a subtle hint about the sentence ‘From their own conceit and imagination surely’ in 11.21.

This shows that Hume’s index is useful not just for finding important topics he cared about, but also for hidden messages and ironic comments. One example is ‘Berkeley, Dr. a real Sceptic’.

Here are some example entries: Abstraction, what it is, Note[P] (131). Causation, a Reason of Association, Alexander the Imposter of Lucian, his 3.2(23); 5.16(37), and so on.

Artifice, 10.22(86). Chance, what it is, 6.3(41).

Animals, their Reason, 9.1(76), and others. Christian Religion is based on Faith, not Reason, 10.40(94). Atheism, whether possible, 12.1(109).

Cicero is quoted, 5.17n.9(38).

Bacon is quoted, 10.39(93). The belief in frequent and constant Conjunction (things happening together), what it is, 5.11(35), and others. The only way we know Cause and Effect, 7.21(51), 7.27(54), 7.30(56), and more.

Descartes is quoted, Note[D] (124). Connection is necessary for our idea of Cause and Effect, 7.1(44), and others.

Contiguity (things being next to each other) is a Reason of Association, 7.29(56), Note[G] (125). 3.2(16), 5.14(36).

One other tricky entry, not included here, jokes that most religious people are really sceptics. It refers to a passage where Hume says that religious people’s belief has always been more about feelings than real conviction.
