I have never thrown up so much while remembering that person. There is a short ad that I wish I had put at the start of the second volume of the Essays and Treatises in the last edition. I am sending you a copy of it.

Please check at the warehouse if there are still many copies of that edition left. If there are, I ask you to print the same number of this ad and not give out any more copies without adding it to the second volume. It answers Dr. Reid and that stubborn, silly guy, Beattie, completely.

I think I told you before that no new editions of my writings should be made without telling me first. I still need to make some corrections.
