People ask questions and argue about ideas. They try to find problems with both our general thinking and with facts about the real world.

The main problem with abstract ideas comes from the concepts of space and time. These ideas seem clear and easy in everyday life, but when studied deeply in science, they lead to strange and confusing ideas. No religious rules have ever been more confusing to common sense than the idea that space can be divided into infinitely small parts. This idea is shown by mathematicians and philosophers with pride, but it’s very hard to believe because it goes against how we usually think.

What’s even more surprising is that these strange ideas come from very clear and logical reasoning. We can’t accept the starting points without also accepting these weird results. For example, math shows us very clearly how circles and triangles work, but if we believe that, we also have to believe that the angle where a circle touches a straight line is smaller than any normal angle, and it can get even smaller forever. This leads to many infinite steps, which seems impossible to understand.

These math proofs are just as strong as the one that says the three angles in a triangle add up to two right angles. But while the triangle fact feels natural and easy to believe, the idea about the tiny angles between curves and lines feels full of contradictions and confusion. This makes reason feel unsure and confused. It can see some things clearly, but those things are next to very deep mysteries. This mix of light and darkness leaves reason feeling confused and unsure about what to believe.
