Knowing the truth about our situation can help us feel calm and peaceful. It helps us live balanced lives, appreciate friendship, and avoid hurting ourselves or others. Epicurus’ ideas were seen as dangerous because they didn’t believe in gods, so most of his writings were destroyed during the early Christian times. The best way we know about Epicureanism today is from a long poem called De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things) by the Roman Lucretius, which luckily survived in one copy. Hume even quotes it briefly. In later times, Epicurus was seen as the typical atheist, so when Hume’s ‘sceptical friend’ talks about Epicurus as an example, it’s clear what he means. Epicureanism is only mentioned briefly elsewhere in Hume’s work, and in a way that approves its moral ideas.

Stoicism started with Zeno of Citium, who taught in a place called the ‘painted Stoa’ in Athens. Stoicism is mentioned several times in Hume’s Enquiry, along with famous Roman Stoics like Epictetus, Marcus Cicero, and Marcus Aurelius. Stoicism shares some ideas with Epicureanism, like living moderately and controlling your emotions. But Stoicism is based on the idea that the world is ordered by God’s reason. Hume didn’t like this idea of a world guided by God’s plan, and he also didn’t agree with Stoic morality. He thought it was based on selfishness rather than care and sympathy for others. However, in eighteenth-century Scotland, ‘Christian Stoicism’ became popular. Thinkers like Francis Hutcheson, Hugh Blair, and William Robertson tried to mix Christian beliefs with a mostly non-religious moral outlook. Hutcheson especially followed Lord Shaftesbury by basing morality on feelings instead of just reason. This influenced Hume and later Adam Smith, who was a close friend of Hume and is now famous as an economist.

René Descartes, called ‘the father of modern philosophy’, helped end the old way of thinking called Aristotelianism. He used skeptical arguments to clear away doubts but wanted to build knowledge based on pure reason.
