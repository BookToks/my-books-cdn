Animals learn to expect one thing after seeing another because they get used to things happening together. This habit makes them imagine what usually comes next, and we call this belief. There is no other way to explain how both simple and complex animals do this, based on what we see and notice.

But animals don’t just learn from watching. Some knowledge comes from nature itself, which goes beyond what they usually can understand. This kind of knowledge doesn’t get better even if they practice a lot. We call these natural abilities instincts. People often think instincts are amazing and hard to explain with human thinking.

However, we might stop being so surprised if we realize that the way we learn from experience is also a kind of instinct or automatic skill that works without us knowing it. This instinct doesn’t use the same kind of thinking or comparing ideas that we usually do. Even though instincts can be different, they still teach a person to avoid fire just like they teach a bird how to take care of its eggs perfectly.
