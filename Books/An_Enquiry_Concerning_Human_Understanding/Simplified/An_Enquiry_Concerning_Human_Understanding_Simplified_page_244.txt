When you look at a story or history, the way events connect is different from how they connect in epic poetry. In epic poems, events are linked more closely and clearly. The story doesn’t cover a long time, and the characters move quickly toward an exciting moment that keeps the reader interested.

This happens because epic poetry uses imagination and strong feelings more than history or biography, which stick to real facts. Both the writer and the reader use their imagination more, and emotions run higher in epic poems than in true stories. Let’s think about how this excited imagination and strong feelings affect the story and why epic poems need to have a tighter, more connected plot.

First, poetry is like painting with words—it brings us closer to what’s happening than other kinds of stories. It shows small details that might seem unimportant to historians but make the story more vivid and fun to imagine. For example, in the Iliad, the poet tells us every time a hero puts on his shoes or ties his gear. But in a faster story like the Henriade, things happen so quickly we don’t get to know the scene well. If a poet tried to tell a very long story, like explaining Hector’s death by going back to events like the kidnapping of Helen or Paris’s judgment, the poem would become way too long. Readers would get tired because their feelings and imagination would get worn out from so much action and emotion.

Second, an epic poet shouldn’t go too far back to explain causes because of how emotions work. In a well-made story, all the feelings from different events build on each other. When all the heroes are part of the same big scene and the actions connect strongly, the reader stays interested, and emotions flow smoothly from one event to the next. When events are closely linked, it’s easier for the reader’s mind and feelings to move from one part of the story to another without losing focus.
