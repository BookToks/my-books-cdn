Every time we think something new has been added to nature, it also adds to what we believe about the Creator of nature. But since there is no real proof or good reason for this, we should only treat these ideas as guesses or guesses based on assumptions.

The main reason we mess up with this topic and make wild guesses is that we act like we are the Supreme Being ourselves. We think that God will always do what we would do if we were in charge. But nature shows us that things work by rules very different from ours. Also, it doesn’t make sense to compare human plans and reasons to those of a Being who is so different and way above us.

Humans usually act in ways we can understand because their thoughts and feelings connect in a clear way. So if we know one thing a person wants, we can often guess what else they might do. But this way of thinking doesn’t work with a Being who is so mysterious and unlike anything else in the universe. We only see small signs of this Being and have no right to say more about them than what those signs show.

What we think is a great quality might actually be a flaw. And even if it is a good quality, saying God has it when it doesn’t seem to show up in the world is more like giving false praise than using real logic or true philosophy. So, no matter how much philosophy or religion we have, they can’t take us beyond what we learn from everyday experience. They can’t help us predict new facts, foresee events, or expect rewards or punishments that we don’t already know from real life.
