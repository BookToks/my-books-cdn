A second edition came out in 1750, and it was printed again in 1751 and 1753. The 1753 version was part of volume two of Hume’s four-volume set called Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects. This setup stayed the same for the third edition in 1756, when only volume two was reprinted.

In 1758, the Essays and Treatises were combined into one volume. At this time, Hume changed the title of his Philosophical Essays to An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding. In the 1760 and 1770 four-volume editions, the Enquiry was in volume three along with A Dissertation on the Passions. 

In the two-volume editions from 1764, 1767, 1768, 1772, and 1777, the Enquiry was at the start of volume two. It was followed by A Dissertation on the Passions, An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, and The Natural History of Religion.

Hume worked hard to fix mistakes in his texts. The last two editions he prepared, in 1772 and 1777, are the most reliable. The 1777 edition includes changes he made just before he died in 1776, like removing a big part of Section III because it distracted from the main ideas.

For a long time, the standard modern edition, by Selby-Bigge and later Nidditch (Clarendon Press, 3rd ed., 1975), used the 1777 text. But it has many small mistakes, mostly in punctuation.

Tom Beauchamp’s recent Clarendon edition (2000) is much better. He chose to use the 1772 edition because it was the last one Hume personally supervised. This edition also includes the part of Section III that was taken out later.
