A miracle is when something happens that breaks the laws of nature. Since these laws are always proven true, it’s almost impossible for a miracle to really happen. For example, it’s very likely that everyone will die someday, that lead can’t float in the air by itself, and that fire burns wood but goes out when you put water on it. These things happen because they follow natural laws. To stop them from happening would require breaking those laws, which is what a miracle means.

If something happens often in nature, it’s not a miracle. For instance, if a healthy person suddenly dies, it’s not a miracle because it has happened many times before. But if a dead person comes back to life, that would be a miracle because it’s never been seen anywhere or at any time. So, for something to be called a miracle, there must be a lot of evidence showing it never happens naturally. This strong evidence makes it very hard to believe in miracles unless there is even stronger proof showing that the miracle did happen.

The main idea to remember is that no one should believe in a miracle unless the proof they give is even more unbelievable if it were false than the miracle itself. When someone says they saw a dead person come back to life, I think about whether it’s more likely that they are lying or mistaken, or that the miracle really happened. I compare these two possibilities and decide based on which one seems less strange. I always choose to believe the explanation that requires fewer miracles. Only if the person’s story being false would be more shocking than the miracle can I believe them.
