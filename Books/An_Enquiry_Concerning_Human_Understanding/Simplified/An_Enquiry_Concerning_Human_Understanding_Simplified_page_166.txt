So, where is the problem with the idea I teach in my school or talk about in my gardens? What is wrong with this whole question that affects good behavior or the peace and order of society?

You say I don’t believe in a higher power or ruler of the world who controls what happens, punishes bad people, and rewards good people with success and honor. But I don’t deny that things happen in a certain way that anyone can see and study.

I admit that right now, being good brings more peace of mind than being bad, and the world treats good people better. I know from human experience that friendship is one of the greatest joys and that being calm and balanced brings happiness. I don’t think being good and bad are equal; I know being good has many more benefits for a person who wants to live well. And what more can you say, even if I accept all your ideas? You say this way of things happens because of intelligence and design. But no matter where it comes from, the way things are, which affects our happiness or sadness and how we behave, stays the same. I can still use what I’ve learned from the past to guide how I act.

If you say that because there is a divine power and justice in the universe, I should expect special rewards for good people and punishments for bad people beyond what usually happens, I see the same mistake I pointed out before. You keep thinking that if we agree this divine power exists, you can safely guess extra things about how the world works based on what you believe about your gods. But you forget that all your ideas come from effects to causes, and any argument going from causes to effects is wrong. This is because you can’t really know about the cause unless you already fully understand it from the effect.
