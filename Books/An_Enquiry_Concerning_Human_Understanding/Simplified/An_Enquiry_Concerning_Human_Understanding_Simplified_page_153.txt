He acted normally with his friends and followers, never showing off like Alexander and Demetrius did by pretending to be divine. The historian who wrote about the miracle was honest and smart, one of the greatest thinkers from ancient times. He didn’t believe in easy miracles and was even called an atheist because he doubted so much. The people who told him about the miracle were honest and reliable, probably eyewitnesses. They confirmed their story even after the ruling family lost power and couldn’t pay them to lie. Since the event was public, it’s hard to imagine stronger proof that the story wasn’t fake.

There’s also a famous story told by Cardinal de Retz that’s worth thinking about. When he ran away to Spain to escape his enemies, he went through Saragossa, the capital of Arragon. There, in the cathedral, he saw a man who had worked as a doorkeeper for seven years and was known by everyone who visited the church. This man had been missing a leg for a long time but got it back after holy oil was rubbed on his stump. The cardinal said he saw the man with two legs. The church officials all confirmed this miracle, and the whole town was asked if it was true. The cardinal found that everyone strongly believed it.

The cardinal, who was smart and didn’t believe in miracles easily, lived at the same time as this event. The miracle was so unusual that it would be hard to fake, and many people saw it happen. What makes this story even more surprising is that the cardinal didn’t really believe the miracle himself, so he wasn’t trying to help spread a lie. He thought it wasn’t necessary to prove a miracle false by finding every trick or lie behind it to reject the story.
