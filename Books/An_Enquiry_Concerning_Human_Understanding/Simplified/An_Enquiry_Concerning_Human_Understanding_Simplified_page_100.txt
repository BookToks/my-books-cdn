Sometimes, when we imagine things, it’s like we see them clearly, almost like they’re real. But imagination alone can’t make us truly believe something. So, belief isn’t just about the ideas themselves, but how we think about them and how they make us feel. Honestly, it’s really hard to explain exactly what that feeling is.

We can use words to get close to describing it. The right word for it is “belief,” which everyone understands in everyday life. In philosophy, belief is something the mind feels that makes us treat some ideas as real and important, unlike just imaginary ones. Belief makes those ideas stronger in our minds and influences what we do. For example, if I hear a friend’s voice from another room, my mind immediately thinks of that person and everything around them. These thoughts stick to me more than ideas about a fairy tale castle. They feel very different and affect me more, whether by making me happy or sad.

So, let’s sum up this idea: belief is a stronger and steadier way of thinking about something than just imagining it. This kind of thinking happens because we’re used to connecting the object with something we remember or sense right now. If we accept this, then it shouldn’t be hard to find other mental processes like belief and understand how they work based on even more basic ideas.

We’ve already seen that nature links ideas together. When one idea pops into our head, it naturally brings up another related idea without us noticing. These connections happen in three ways: by things looking alike (Resemblance), by things being close together (Contiguity), and by one thing causing another (Causation). These are the only ways our thoughts stick together and create the normal flow of thinking or talking that everyone experiences.
