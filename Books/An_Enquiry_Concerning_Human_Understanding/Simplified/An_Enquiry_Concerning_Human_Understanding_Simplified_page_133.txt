Actions don’t always connect clearly with why we do them, what we want, or the situations we’re in. One doesn’t always follow from the other, and you can’t guess one just by knowing the other. This is a simple fact everyone agrees on.  

So, when we talk about liberty, we mean the ability to act or not act based on what we decide. For example, if we want to stay still, we can. If we want to move, we can do that too. This kind of liberty is something everyone has unless they are locked up or tied down. There’s no argument about this.  

When we define liberty, we have to be careful about two things: First, the definition must match real facts. Second, it must make sense and not contradict itself. If we do this, I believe everyone will agree on what liberty means.  

Everyone agrees that nothing happens without a cause. Also, “chance” isn’t really a thing; it’s just a word that means there’s no real power or reason behind something. Some people say that some causes must happen, and some don’t have to. This is where clear definitions help.  

If someone defines a cause without including that it must be connected to its effect, and if they can explain where this idea comes from, I’ll accept their point. But if we accept what I just explained, this can’t work. If things didn’t always happen in a regular order, we wouldn’t even understand cause and effect. This regular order is what lets us understand how things connect.  

Anyone trying to define cause without this connection will have to use confusing words or words that mean the same thing as cause. If we accept this definition, then liberty, when compared to necessity (not to being forced), is the same as chance—which everyone agrees doesn’t really exist.
