In 1747, eight years after publishing his Treatise, Hume wasn’t too worried about the problems that might come from releasing a book some people saw as against religion. He mentioned that his friend “Harry” (Henry Home) had read the manuscript of his Philosophical Essays (the first edition of the Enquiry) and didn’t approve.

In 1748, Hume wrote a letter to Henry Home making similar points. He said he was thinking about printing the Philosophical Essays he had left with Home. Harry didn’t want him to because he thought it was unwise. But Hume felt he was already too involved to stop now. He also didn’t see any harm in being called an “infidel” as long as a person behaved well in other ways. He asked for Home’s opinion.

Later, in 1748, Hume wrote from London that he was working on two projects: a new edition of his Essays and the Philosophical Essays, which Home had advised him against printing. Hume said he wouldn’t try to prove this was a smart choice, but he didn’t care about any problems it might cause.

By 1751, after publishing the Philosophical Essays, Hume told his close friend Gilbert Elliot that the Essays were much better than the Treatise, which he now regretted publishing. He explained that the Essays covered all the important ideas from the Treatise but in a shorter and simpler way. He admitted he had rushed the Treatise because he was young and eager, and that it had many flaws. He said he had regretted publishing it too soon many times.

In 1754, Hume wrote to John Stewart, who had misunderstood a point in the Treatise. After correcting him, Hume said he was only upset with himself for not explaining his ideas clearly. He also mentioned he wasn’t interested in making a second edition of the Treatise.
