Science is basically just a more organized and careful way of thinking about things. Thinking about science isn’t really different from thinking about everyday life. We can expect science to be more steady and reliable because it uses a more exact method.

Hume’s doubt means we can still do science by carefully observing and figuring things out, but there are limits. Everything we know about facts beyond what we see or remember depends on cause and effect. We can only learn about these cause-and-effect rules by experience. If we just think without experience, anything could seem like it can cause anything else. So, understanding the true nature of things just by thinking is impossible. Also, we can’t prove God or anything else just by reasoning alone.

Proof by thinking alone only works in abstract ideas, and it only really works well in math because math ideas are very clear. Because of this, the best areas to study are math, which is about ideas and reasoning, and science, which is about facts but isn’t 100% certain. Any work that claims to prove facts with total certainty just by thinking is wrong. Hume says if we look at books about religion or complicated philosophy and they don’t have math or real experiments, they’re full of nonsense and should be thrown away.

Hume’s first Enquiry was first published in 1748 in London under the title Philosophical Essays concerning Human Understanding.
