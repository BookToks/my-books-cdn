I have not yet thrown up so much all Memory of that Character. There is a short Advertisement, which I wish I had prefix’d to the second Volume of the Essays and Treatises in the last Edition. I send you a Copy of it.
 
 Please to enquire at the Warehouse, if any considerable Number of that Edition remain on hands; and if there do, I beg the favour of you, that you woud throw offan equal Number of this Advertisement, and give out no more Copies without prefixing it to the second volume. It is a compleat Answer to Dr Reid and to that bigotted silly Fellow, Beattie.
 
 I believe that I have formerly mention’d to you, that no new Editions shoud be made of any of my Writings, without mentioning it to me; I shall still have some Corrections to make. . . . (HLii.301).
