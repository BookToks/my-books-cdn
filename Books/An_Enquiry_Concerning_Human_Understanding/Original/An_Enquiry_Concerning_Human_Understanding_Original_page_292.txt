Boyle was a great partizan of the mechanical philosophy; a theory, which, by discovering some of the secrets of nature, and allowing us to imagine the rest, is so agreeable to the natural vanity and curiosity of men. He died in 1691, aged 65.
 
 Isaac Newton (1643‒1727), perhaps the most celebrated scientist in history, was an English mathematician and physicist. He invented the calculus (but delayed publication, provoking a bitter priority battle with the German philosopher Leibniz), and used it to give the first comprehensive account of terrestrial and astronomical motion, as explained in §3 of the Introduction, above. Hume’s History of England(vi.542) gives a glowing summary, highlighting the significant irony that Newton’s physics, while establishing accurate laws describing phenomena, at the same time seemed to make nature less ‘intelligible’ because gravity could not be explained mechanically: In Newton this island may boast of having produced the greatest and rarest genius that ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the species. Cautious in admitting no principles but such as were founded on experiment; but resolute to adopt every such principle, however new or unusual: From modesty, ignorant of his superiority above the rest of mankind; and thence, less careful to accommodate his reasonings to common apprehensions: More anxious to merit than acquire fame: He was from these causes long unknown to the world; but his reputation at last broke out with a lustre, which scarcely any writer, during his own lifetime, had ever before attained. While Newton seemed to draw offthe veil from some of the mysteries of nature, he shewed at the same time the imperfections of the mechanical philosophy; and thereby restored her ultimate secrets to that obscurity, in which they ever did and ever will remain. He died in 1727, aged 85.
 
 Newton is mentioned in the important endnote [D] to E 7.25, which aims to dissociate him from some of his ‘Newtonian’ followers who— as explained in §6of the Introduction—tended towards occasionalismwith a theological agenda.
