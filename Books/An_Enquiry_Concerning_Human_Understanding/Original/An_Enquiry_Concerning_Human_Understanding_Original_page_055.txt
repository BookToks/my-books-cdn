A second edition appeared in 1750, and this was reprinted in 1751and1753, the latter in the form of volume ii of Hume’s four-volume Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects. This arrangement was retained in the third edition of 1756, at which point volume ii was the only one of the four to be reissued. The next edition of the Essays and Treatises, in 1758, combined the constituent works into a single volume, and here Hume permanently changed the title of his Philosophical Essays toAn Enquiry concerning Human Understanding. In the four-volume 1760 and 1770 editions of the Essays and Treatises, the Enquiry appeared in volume iii with A Dissertation on the Passions. In the twovolume editions of 1764,1767,1768,1772, and 1777, it appeared at the beginning of volume ii, followed in order by A Dissertation on the Passions,An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, and The Natural History of Religion.
 
 The Final 1772and1777Editions Hume took great pains over correcting his texts, and there is no doubt that the last two editions of the Enquiry that he prepared, of 1772 and 1777, are the most authoritative. The latter incorporates corrections made shortly before his death in 1776, most notably a substantial deletion from Section III (well-motivated in my view, since the deleted material distracts from, rather than contributing to, the central thrust of the work). What was for many years the standard modern edition, by Selby-Bigge and later Nidditch (Clarendon Press,3rd edn., 1975), like the previously standard Green and Grose edition, follows the posthumous 1777 text, though with well over a thousand editorial intrusions or errors (mainly of punctuation).
 
 Tom Beauchamp’s recent Clarendon critical edition (2000) is vastly superior, but he instead takes the 1772edition as his copytext on the basis that this was ‘the last edition to be seen through the press with lviii Note on the Text Hume’s supervision’ (and he accordingly includes the deleted Section III material).
