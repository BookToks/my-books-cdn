The Jesuits set up many colleges including the one at La Flèche where Descartes studied, and near which Hume stayed when composing the Treatise (see pp. lxiii, 170). Jesuits were often accused by their enemies—notably the Jansenists—of devious reasoning to circumvent the rigours of Christian morality (particularly to placate wealthy donors)—hence the adjective ‘Jesuitical’.
 
 10.28 PHILIPPIorPHARSALIA. . . CAESAREANandPOMPEIAN: at the battle of Pharsalia (or Pharsalus) in Greece (48 bc), Julius Caesar defeated Pompey to end the Wars of the First Triumvirate and leave Caesar in sole charge of Rome (cf. explanatory note to 12.28). At the battle of Philippi in Macedonia (42 bc), Mark Antony and Octavian (later the Emperor Augustus) defeated Brutus and Cassius (Caesar’s murderers) to end the Wars of the Second Triumvirate.
 
 10.28 HERODOTUS: (c.484‒425bc) Greek writer sometimes known as ‘The Father of History’, though widely criticized for a tendency towards fabrication. His Historiescover the growth of the Persian Empire and Xerxes’ attempt to conquer Greece, which ended in defeat at Salamis (480bc) and Plataea (479bc).
 
 10.28 MARIANA, BEDE: Juan de Mariana (1536‒1624), a Spanish Jesuit, published in 1592a history of Spain reporting several miracles. Saint Bede(or The Venerable Bede, c.672‒735), a Benedictine monk living in Northumbria, wrote ‘The Life and Miracles of St Cuthbert’, which is replete with reported miracles. However his celebrated Ecclesiastical History of the English People, in virtue of which he has been called ‘The Father of English History’, is somewhat less fanciful, and volume i of Hume’s own History of Englanduses it extensively as a source.
 
 10.30 avidum genus auricularum: a Latin phrase meaning ‘a race with eager little ears’. It is an abbreviated version of a remark of Lucretius (De Rerum Natura,4.594, see p. 222), ‘humanum genus est avidum nimis auricularum’, which in context suggests that humans are eager to relate stories that attract listeners.
 
 10.35 has ever amounted to: in the first two editions of the Enquiry(1748and 1750), this was stated more strongly: ‘no testimony for any kind of miracle can ever possibly amount to a probability’.
 
 10.37 QueenELIZABETH: Elizabeth I was a popular queen of England from 1558 to 1603, bringing order and relative toleration to a country that had been divided by bitter religious controversy under her half-siblings Edward VI (a zealous Protestant) and Mary (an equally zealous Roman Catholic).
