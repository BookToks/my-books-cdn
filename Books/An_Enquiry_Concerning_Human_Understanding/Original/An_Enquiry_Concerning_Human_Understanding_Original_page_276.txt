GLOSSARY [MANYof Hume’s words are now relatively unfamiliar, and some have changed in meaning. A fair number also vary in meaning between different occurrences in his text; in such cases, only those senses that are less familiar have been included here (e.g. under ‘affect’, the occurrences of ‘affected’ in the Advertisement and at 10.25 are listed, but not those at 5.2 and 5.18 which use the word in its modern everyday sense). For the sake of brevity, subtle nuances of meaning are ignored, and cognate words (e.g. ‘actuate’, ‘actuated’, ‘actuates’) treated as one; in the case of verbs, the gloss is then usually prefixed by ‘to’ (e.g. ‘to motivate or cause activity of’). References to the text are by section and paragraph number, or, in the case of Hume’s endnotes, endnote letter and paragraph number; passim(i.e. scattered) indicates a word used in too many places for individual listing to be appropriate.
 
 Readers who experience difficulty with Hume’s language in the Enquirymight find it helpful to consult the ‘translation’ into modern English by Jonathan Bennett, available from the website www.earlymoderntexts.com. Reading this in parallel with the original can ease both appreciation and understanding of Hume’s elegant prose, and largely remove the need for repeated reference to a glossary or dictionary.] &c. etc. (passim) admonish to urge or warn (1.6,11.18) à priori knowable without experience adulterate spurious or corrupt (1.12) (see Introduction §10;4.6,4.7,4.9, adventures, at at random (3.1,10.17) 4.10,4.11,4.13,4.18,10.8,12.29, affect to give the appearance of B.1, C.1, E.2, I.1, Q.1) (Advertisement,1.14,7.22,10.25) abate to diminish (12.24) affections feelings or emotions (1.1, abound to be abundant or plentiful 1.3,1.3,2.2,5.1,6.3,8.31,8.34, (10.20,10.24,11.17) 10.18) abstruse deep and hard to understand afford to provide (1.12,1.16,2.5, (1.3,1.3,1.6,1.12,1.12,1.12,1.17, 4.16,4.17,5.12,6.2,8.11,8.23,10.4, 4.23,7.2,9.5) 11.2,11.12,11.13,12.18, C.1) abundance of many (5.1) agree to to conform to (7.28,10.12) abundantly plentifully (5.16) alchimy alchemy (10.39) academic of academic scepticism; allow to agree (passim) (see Glossarial Index; 5.1,10.29, alluring attractive or attracting 12.0,12.24) (1.1,11.29) accession addition (1.10) altercation dispute (10.32) acquiesce to raise no objection (11.10) annex to to attach to (2.9,5.10, actuate to motivate or cause activity 5.11, E.2) of (1.3,1.15,2.2,5.22,7.8,7.11, antecedent prior (7.4,11.20,12.3) 7.13,8.4,8.34,12.21) appellation name (2.3,10.12) Glossary 213 application diligence (1.
