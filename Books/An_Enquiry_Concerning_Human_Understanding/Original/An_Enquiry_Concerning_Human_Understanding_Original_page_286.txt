Morally, this recognition of our true situation can give us peace of mind, enabling us to live in moderation, valuing friendship and avoiding hurt to ourselves and others. Epicurus’ writings were understandably considered dangerously atheistical, and accordingly most of them were destroyed during the early Christian era. Our best source for Epicureanism is the long poem De Rerum Natura(On the Nature of Things), written by the Roman Lucretius (c.94‒55 bc), which fortunately survived in a single manuscript (and is briefly quoted by Hume at 10.30). In the early modern period Epicurus was considered the archetypal atheist, so when Hume’s ‘sceptical friend’ in Enquiry, Section XI chooses Epicurus as his model (11.2,11.4‒7,11.24, 11.27,11.30), the implication is clear. The only mention of Epicureanism elsewhere in the Enquiryis very brief, in an apparently approving allusion to its moral principles (12.23).
 
 Stoicism Stoicism, a movement originating with Zeno of Citium (334‒262bc), was named after the ‘painted Stoa’ (covered walk) in Athens where he taught.
 
 Stoicism is mentioned several times in the Enquiry(5.1,8.34,12.23), as are three of the most notable Stoics of the Roman period, the freed slave Epictetus (c.55‒135 ad, mentioned at 5.1), the orator Marcus Tullius Cicero (106‒43bc, at 1.4,5.17n.9,10.18) and the ‘wisest of all the Roman emperors’, Marcus Aurelius (ad 121‒80, at 10.22, 11.2). Morally, Stoicism has some resemblance to Epicureanism (cf. 12.23), emphasizing moderation, control of the passions, and self-discipline. Unlike Epicureanism, however, it bases this on a rational ideal, seeing the world as providentially ordered by God’s reason. Hume evinces a clear dislike both of such providentialism (cf. 8.34) and of the Stoic approach to morality (5.1), which he sees as being founded on refined rational selfishness rather than the generous human passion of sympathy or fellow feeling for others. However ‘Christian Stoicism’, which became prominent amongst the moderate clergy and others in eighteenth-century Scotland, differed from ancient Stoicism in precisely this respect. Thinkers such as Francis Hutcheson (1694‒1746), Hugh Blair, and William Robertson, all well known to Hume, sought to reconcile Christian belief with a broadly secular ethical outlook. But Hutcheson especially followed Lord Shaftesbury (1671‒1713) in basing his moral theory on ‘sentiment’ rather than pure reason, significantly influencing Hume and in turn Adam Smith (1723‒90), an admirer and close friend of Hume now best known as an economist.
 
 Descartes, Malebranche, and Occasionalism René Descartes (1596‒1650) is often called ‘the father of modern philosophy’, because he was so influential in the downfall of Aristotelianism. He used Glossarial Index of Major Philosophers 223 sceptical arguments to clear the ground (see above), but his own philosophy was rationalistic, aiming to build a solid edifice of knowledge on pure reason.
