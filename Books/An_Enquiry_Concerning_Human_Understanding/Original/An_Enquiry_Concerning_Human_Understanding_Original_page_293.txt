HUME’S INDEX [This has been produced from the index of the 1777edition, consulting also the 1772, 1770, and 1764 editions to resolve ambiguities or to correct manifest errors (i.e.
 
 entries that are clearly wrong rather than merely incomplete). References are given to the location in this volume that seems best to match Hume’s intention in each case, specifyingfirst a paragraph (or endnote), followed in brackets by a page number.
 
 Where Hume himself indicates two successive pages within a single entry, this sometimes results below in two references to the same paragraph, or to the same page.
 
 His own references, of course, are to the pages of the two volumes of his Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects, and his original index therefore includes many entries for his essays and the other works in that collection, as well as those for the firstEnquirythat are listed here.
 
 Capitalization (and also punctuation where possible) generally follows Hume’s own, except in the case of ‘Fact’ and ‘Jansenists’, which seem to have been capitalized only because they were the first entries under ‘F’ and ‘I’ respectively. Note that Hume treated ‘I’ and ‘J’ together, but modern alphabetical ordering is used here.
 
 Some entries might seem puzzling. For instance, ‘Immortality of the Soul, on what founded’ and ‘Providence, particular, on what founded’ can refer only to paragraphs 11.21or11.22, neither of which suggests any reason for the beliefs in immortality or providence. But this is no oversight: Hume appears to be making a subtle reference to the context of the sentence ‘From their own conceit and imagination surely’ in 11.21.
 
 This illustrates how Hume’s index can be of interest not only as a pointer to those topics that he viewed as particularly significant, but also for its various hidden messages and ironic glosses, an example of the latter being ‘Berkeley, Dr. a real Sceptic’.1] Abstraction, what, Note[P] (131).

 1 Another entry of this type, mischievously suggesting that most religious people are really sceptics, is the reference (not included here) from ‘Scepticism, Religious’ to a passage in the Natural History of Religionwhere Hume alleges that ‘the conviction of the religionists, in all ages, is more affected than real’.
