We already gave a clear example of how important a really strange dream can be. The dream about a Wagner concert that went on until 7:45 a.m., where the orchestra was led from a tower, is obviously trying to show something: The world is crazy and society is weird. People who deserve good things don’t get them, and people who don’t care get lucky. The dreamer is comparing her life to her cousin’s.

Dreams about a dead father were the first examples we saw of weird, absurd dreams, and that’s not a coincidence. When we are kids, we start to question our father’s authority because of his strict rules. We notice his flaws to protect ourselves. Still, after he dies, we think of him with respect, which stops us from fully admitting those criticisms in our conscious mind.

Here’s another strange dream about a dead father. I get a message from my hometown about hospital costs from 1851 because I had a seizure. I laugh because I wasn’t even born in 1851, and my father, who the message might be about, is already dead. I go to my father’s room and tell him. He surprisingly remembers that in 1851 he was drunk and had to be locked up once. He was working at a company then. I ask if he drank back then and if he got married soon after. I think I was born in 1856, right after that.

From what we said before, this dream’s weirdness shows there’s a strong and angry argument happening in the dreamer’s thoughts. It’s surprising that the dream makes fun of the father openly because usually, our mind censors these things. The reason is that the father in the dream is actually standing in for someone else. Usually, dreams hide who you’re upset with behind the father, but here, the father is just a mask for another person. This lets the dream talk openly about someone usually respected because the dreamer knows the father isn’t the real target.

We understand this by knowing when the dream happened. It came after I heard that an older coworker, who was seen as very wise, was surprised and didn’t approve that I had been treating a patient for five years. The start of the dream hints at this coworker, who had taken over duties my father used to do. When our friendship started to get worse, I felt the same conflict as if I was having a fight with my father. The dream shows how upset I am about being criticized for not making faster progress. I wonder if my coworker knows anyone who can do better. Does he know some cases just take a lifetime? Especially when the treatment actually made life easier for the patient.

The dream feels absurd because it jumps between different ideas without smooth connections. For example, the sentence about going to the father’s room suddenly changes the subject to when I told my father I was going to get married. The dream is reminding me how kind and selfless my father was then, to show a contrast with the new person in the dream. I see that the dream can joke about my father because deep down, I respect him and use him as an example for others.

The part about my father remembering he was drunk and locked up isn’t really about him anymore. The father is hiding someone important named Meynert, a man I respected but who later became hostile toward me. The dream reminds me of Meynert’s story: when he was young, he used to get drunk on chloroform and had to go to a sanatorium. I also had a bitter argument with him about whether men could have hysteria, which he denied. When I visited him before he died, he said he was one of the best cases of male hysteria, which surprised me because he had always denied it.

The reason I use my father to represent Meynert in the dream isn’t because they’re alike, but because the dream is showing a condition: “If I were the son of a professor or a high-ranking official, I would have done better.” In the dream, my father is made into a professor and official. The most confusing part is about the date 1851, which in the dream feels the same as 1856, like five years don’t matter at all.
