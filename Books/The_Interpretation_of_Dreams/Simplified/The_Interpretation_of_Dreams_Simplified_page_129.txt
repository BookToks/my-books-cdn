3. Here’s another example showing how dreams do math in a weird way, which makes people think dreams don’t make sense. A man dreams he’s sitting in the B family’s house (he used to know them) and says, “It was stupid that you didn’t give me Amy as my wife.” Then he asks Amy, “How old are you?” She answers, “I was born in 1882.” He says, “Ah, then you are 28 years old.” But since the dream happened in 1898, his math is totally wrong.

This bad math might mean the dreamer isn’t good at calculating, kind of like someone with brain problems. This man often thought about every woman he saw. The next person who came to see the doctor was a young woman he really wanted to impress. She’s the same woman he guessed was 28. That explains why he said that.

Also, 1882 was the year the man got married. He couldn’t stop talking to two older women he met at the doctor’s house. They didn’t seem interested and probably thought he was old and serious.

With examples like this, we can say: Dreams don’t really do math correctly or incorrectly. They just put together numbers that come from the dream’s thoughts, using them as clues for things that can’t be shown directly. Dreams use numbers like they use words or names, as tools to express ideas.

Dreams can’t make up new sentences on their own. Even if there are many speeches or answers in dreams that sound smart or silly, analysis shows the dream just takes pieces of real conversations the dreamer heard or said before. Then it messes with these pieces, cutting them out of their original meaning and putting them back together in new ways. A speech that sounds right in a dream might actually be made of three or four parts from different talks.

Sometimes the dream ignores what these words meant before and gives them a totally new meaning. If you look closely, you can see the main parts of the dream speech and other little parts that just connect them, kind of like how we fill in missing letters when reading. Dream speech is like a mix of different pieces stuck together.

Neurosis works like this too. I know a patient who hears songs in her head (hallucinations) but doesn’t understand why they matter to her feelings. She’s not crazy. When we analyze, we see she changed the meaning of the songs by mistake. For example, a Christmas carol line says, “Oh, thou blissful one! Oh, thou happy one!” But she stops before the word “Christmastide,” so she thinks it’s a wedding song instead. This kind of twisting can happen even without hearing voices, just in how she thinks.

Strictly speaking, this idea applies only to dream speeches that sound like real speech, like when you hear or speak words in a dream. Other thoughts in dreams, which don’t sound like spoken words, are just like normal thoughts we have when awake and they stay the same in dreams.

What we read also gives lots of random speech pieces that dreams use. But if a speech stands out in a dream, it usually comes from real talks the dreamer heard or said.

We’ve already seen examples of this in other dream analyses.

For example, in a simple market dream (chapter V., A.), the speech “That is no longer to be had” helps the dreamer identify with the butcher. Another part, “I don’t know that, I don’t take that,” makes the dream seem innocent. The day before, the dreamer told her cook, “I don’t know that, behave yourself properly.” Later, the dream took part of that speech to hint at the cook’s behavior, but in a way that wouldn’t give the dream away.

Here’s another example: A big yard where dead bodies are being burned. The dreamer thinks, “I’m going, I can’t stand the sight of it.” Then he meets two butcher boys and asks, “Well, did it taste good?” One answers, “No, it wasn’t good,” like they ate human flesh.

The real reason for this dream is: After dinner with his wife, the dreamer visits a friendly but not very nice neighbor lady. She’s eating and asks him to try her food. He says no, he’s not hungry. She insists, saying, “Go on, you can handle it.” He ends up tasting and praising it. When he’s alone with his wife, he complains about the neighbor and the food, saying, “I can’t stand the sight of it.” In the dream, this isn’t an actual spoken sentence but a thought about the neighbor’s looks, meaning he doesn’t want to look at her.
