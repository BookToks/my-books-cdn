It’s pretty easy to guess a few things:  

1. The boy had tried masturbating before, probably denied it, and was scared of getting punished for it (he said, “I won’t do it again,” but also said, “Albert never did that”).  
2. When he hit puberty, he felt the urge to masturbate again because of the changes in his body.  
3. But now, he was trying hard to stop himself, which made him feel anxious. This anxiety reminded him of the punishments he was scared of before.  

Now, let’s look at what the author thought (page 69):  

1. Puberty can make a boy who’s not very healthy feel very weak, and this can cause a type of brain problem called cerebral anemia.  
2. This brain problem can change his personality and cause scary hallucinations and strong feelings of anxiety, both during the day and at night.  
3. The boy’s feelings of being haunted and blaming himself came from his strict religious upbringing when he was younger.  
4. All these problems went away after he spent a long time in the countryside, got lots of exercise, and got stronger after puberty ended.  
5. It’s also possible that his brain problem was partly because of his family history, including his dad’s past illness.  

Finally, the author says this case fits into a type of mental state caused by lack of blood flow to the brain.

E. The Primary and Secondary Processes. Repression  

Trying to explain how dreams work is really hard, and I’m not sure I can do it well. It’s tough to describe something so complex step-by-step and make it clear without assuming you already know stuff.  

I didn’t explain my own ideas about dreams in the order I actually figured them out. Earlier research about mental illnesses helped me understand dreams, but I’d rather start with dreams and then connect them to mental illness. I know this might be confusing, but I don’t see a better way to do it.  

Since I’m not happy with how things are, I want to focus on another way of looking at dreams that makes my work more useful. At first, people had very different ideas about dreams, and many of those ideas were opposite. I’ve tried to include most of these ideas in my work, except two: that dreams mean nothing, and that they’re just physical processes.  

Besides those two, I found that each idea had some truth in it. For example, dreams do continue the thoughts and interests we have when we’re awake. Dreams are about important things to us, not random stuff.  

But dreams also include random bits from the day. Dreams can only pick up important things after stepping away from what we’re thinking about when awake. Because of how our brain works, dreams find it easier to use recent or unimportant stuff that isn’t blocked by our awake mind. Also, because of mental “censorship,” dreams move the strong feelings from important but “blocked” thoughts to unimportant ones.  

Dreams help us remember things better and bring up early childhood memories. In our theory, a wish from childhood is the main reason dreams happen. We don’t deny that things happening outside when we’re sleeping can affect dreams, but we think these outside things work like leftover thoughts from the day.  

The dream changes these outside things to make them less disturbing and more connected to the wish the dream is trying to fulfill.
