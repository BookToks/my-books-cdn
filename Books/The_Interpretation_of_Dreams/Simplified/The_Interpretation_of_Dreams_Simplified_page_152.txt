One worry people have about marriage is that it might take away their freedom. This idea shows up in a dream where a scene changes into one about being arrested.

If we go back to the idea that dreams often use stories we already know instead of making new ones from scratch, maybe we can understand a tricky problem about dreams. I told the story of Maury’s dream, where he got hit on the neck by a small board and woke up after dreaming a whole story about the French Revolution.

Since the dream made a clear story and matched the real event of the board hitting him—something he couldn’t have guessed—there’s only one possible answer: the whole dream happened really fast, between the moment the board hit him and when he woke up.

We usually don’t think our minds work that fast when we’re awake, so it seems like dreams can happen much quicker than normal thinking.

But some other experts don’t agree. They question if Maury’s story is right or say that our minds can think just as fast when we’re awake. This is a big question that’s still not solved. I don’t find their arguments strong, though. Here’s what I think: maybe Maury’s dream was about a story he remembered from a long time ago, one he had already made up in his mind. The board hitting his neck just brought that story back.

If he was awake when the board hit him, he might have thought, “This feels like being guillotined.” But since he was asleep, his dream used that feeling to make a wish come true, like the mind saying, “Here’s a chance to live out a fantasy I once had while reading.”

This dream fits what a young man might imagine after reading exciting stories. Lots of people, especially French students who study history, get fascinated by stories about the Reign of Terror. They imagine being brave young men saying goodbye to their girlfriends and going to the scaffold without fear.

Maybe Maury’s dream was about wanting to be someone important from that time—someone powerful who helped change Europe, even if they risked their own lives. The big crowd in the dream shows it was a bold, ambitious fantasy.

But Maury didn’t have to live the whole dream again while sleeping. The dream just needed a little trigger. Like when you hear a few notes of music and suddenly remember the whole song, even if you can’t recall it all the time. The board hitting Maury’s neck was that trigger, waking up the whole guillotine fantasy in his mind.

The dream isn’t actually replayed in sleep; it’s just remembered when he wakes up. He doesn’t know if he really dreamed it or just remembered it.

This idea can also explain other dreams, like Napoleon dreaming of a battle right before a bomb exploded.

There’s another story about a playwright named Casimir Bonjour, who wanted to watch his new play but fell asleep right as it started. In his dream, he saw the whole play with the audience’s reactions and even heard his name cheered. But when he woke up, the play had barely started, and he had only been asleep a couple of minutes.

That full dream of the play didn’t have to be made up while sleeping—it could be a replay of a story he already knew well.

Some researchers say dreams that seem to happen really fast are usually clear and easy to understand, not messy like other dreams. These dreams also feel like quick summaries instead of detailed stories. This fits the idea that dreams often use ready-made stories triggered by something in real life.

I’m not saying all dreams work this way or that this solves every problem about fast dreams.

Now, we have to think about how this kind of dream fits with other parts of how dreams work. Maybe the process goes like this?
