Her dad used to have a beard all around his face like a lion’s mane. Her English teacher’s name is Miss Lyons. Someone she knew sent her some ballads by Loewe (Loewe means lion). So, these are the three lions; why should she be scared of them?

She read a story about a Black man who got others to rebel and was chased by bloodhounds. He climbed a tree to save himself. Then there are some funny memories, like these instructions for catching lions: "Take a desert and put it through a sieve; the lions will be left behind." There’s also a funny, but a bit rude, story about an official who’s asked why he doesn’t try harder to please his boss. He says he tried, but his boss’s boss was already favored. This all makes sense when you know that on the dream-day, the lady had a visit from her husband’s boss. He was very polite and kissed her hand, but she wasn’t afraid of him, even though he is a big important person (called a “big animal”) and acts like a social lion in her country’s capital. So, this lion is like the lion in *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* who is actually a shy joiner named Snug; all these dream-lions are not scary.

As my second example, I will talk about a dream where a girl saw her sister’s little son lying dead in a coffin. But she didn’t feel pain or sadness. We know from analyzing the dream that she wasn’t upset because the dream was hiding her true wish to see the man she loved one more time. Her feelings matched her wish, not the dream’s story. So, she had no reason to be sad.

In some dreams, feelings stay connected to the ideas that replaced the original meaning.

In other dreams, the feelings are completely separated from their original ideas and fit into new parts of the dream. We’ve also seen this happen with judgments in dreams. If there’s an important conclusion in the dream-thoughts, the dream will have one too, but it might be attached to something totally different. Sometimes this change happens by using opposites.

I will show this with a dream I studied very carefully.

There’s a castle by the sea, but later it’s not right on the coast, just on a narrow canal leading to the sea. A man named Herr P is the castle’s governor. I’m with him in a big room with three windows, and outside the windows are wall parts that look like fortress battlements. I’m part of the castle’s soldiers, maybe as a volunteer navy officer. We are scared because enemy warships might come, since there’s a war. Herr P wants to leave the castle and tells me what to do if the enemy attacks. His sick wife and kids are still in the castle. When the attack starts, the big hall must be emptied. He’s breathing hard and tries to leave, but I stop him and ask how I can send him news if needed. He says more, then suddenly falls down dead. I probably stressed him too much with my questions. His death doesn’t affect me much. After that, I think about whether his widow should stay, if I must tell the higher-ups about his death, or if I should take over as commander. Then I look out the window to watch ships passing by; they are cargo ships rushing over dark water, some with more than one smokestack, others with big decks (kind of like train stations in an earlier dream I had). Then my brother stands next to me, and we both look out at the canal. We see one ship and get scared, shouting, “Here comes the warship!” But it’s just the same ships we saw before, coming back. Then a small, funny ship appears that looks cut off in the middle. On its deck are odd things like cups or little boxes. We shout together, “That’s the breakfast ship.” The fast ships, the deep blue water, and the brown smoke all create a strong, gloomy feeling.

The places in this dream come from trips I took to the Adriatic Sea (Miramare, Duino, Venice, Aquileia). A short, fun Easter trip with my brother was still fresh in my mind. Also, the naval war between America and Spain, and my worry about my family in America, influenced the dream. Feelings show up in two spots. One spot where you’d expect feelings is missing: I don’t feel anything when the governor dies. But later, when I see the warships, I feel real fear in my sleep. The way feelings are spread out in this well-made dream avoids any obvious conflict. There’s no reason for me to be scared about the governor’s death, but it makes sense to be afraid when I see the warship. Analysis shows that Herr P actually represents me in the dream (I’m his stand-in). I’m the governor who suddenly dies. The dream-thoughts are about what will happen to my family if I die too soon. No other bad thoughts appear in the dream-thoughts. The fear about the warship is moved to cover this unpleasant thought. On the other hand, the part of the dream-thoughts with the warship is full of happy memories. A year before, in Venice, we spent a magical day looking out from our room over the blue lagoon, where more boats than usual were passing. Some English ships were expected, and they were going to be celebrated. Suddenly, my wife happily shouted, “Here comes the English warship!” In the dream, I’m scared by the same words. This shows that what people say in dreams comes from what they heard in real life. I will soon explain that even the word “English” in the dream has meaning for the dream’s work.
