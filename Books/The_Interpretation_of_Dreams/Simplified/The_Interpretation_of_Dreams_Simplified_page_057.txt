If these parts help us understand the close connection between dreams and mental health problems, then they have done what I wanted by including them.

Sometimes, a dream is only told partly, and the missing parts come up later during the analysis.

When these missing parts are added, they always help explain the dream better. See Chapter VII about forgetting dreams.

Similar dreams where wishes are blocked have been told to me many times by people who came to my lectures and reacted to the idea that dreams are about wishes.

A big poet today, who doesn't believe in psychoanalysis or dream interpretation, still got a very similar idea from his own experience: dreams are “secret wishes showing up in disguise” (C. Spitteler, 1913).

CHAPTER 5 THE MATERIAL AND SOURCES OF DREAMS

After studying the dream about Irma’s injection, we saw that the dream was about a wish being fulfilled. This made us want to find out if this is true for all dreams. For now, we put aside other questions to focus on this one.

Now that we can find hidden meaning in dreams, which is more important than the obvious story, we want to go back and look at individual dreams again. Maybe the confusing parts can be explained better now.

We did not include what other writers think about how dreams relate to real life or where dream material comes from. But we can remember three strange things about dream memory that many have noticed but never explained: 

1. Dreams mostly use things from the last few days.  
2. Dreams pick out less important things instead of the big important stuff.  
3. Dreams can bring up very old memories from childhood, even tiny details we thought were forgotten.

These strange choices of dream material have been seen by others before.

A. Recent and Unimportant Impressions in the Dream

From my own experience, I think every dream includes something from what happened the day before. No matter whose dream I look at, this is true. So, when trying to understand a dream, it helps to first look at what happened the day before because it often explains the dream quickly.

For example, the dreams about Irma’s injection and the uncle with the yellow beard clearly connect to the day before, so no extra explanation is needed.
