In the morning, I saw a book in a shop window called The Genus Cyclamen. It looked like a detailed book about this plant.

The cyclamen is my wife’s favorite flower. I feel bad that I don’t bring her flowers as often as she wants. This made me remember a story I told some friends to show how people sometimes forget things without meaning to, and this forgetfulness can tell us something about how they really feel. A young woman who usually gets flowers from her husband on her birthday didn’t get any one year and started crying. The husband didn’t understand at first, but when she told him it was her birthday, he said, “Oh, I forgot!” and wanted to buy her flowers right away. But she was upset because she thought his forgetfulness meant she wasn’t as important to him anymore. This woman, Frau L, met my wife two days ago, said she was doing well, and asked about me. Years ago, she was one of my patients.

I once wrote a paper about a plant called coca, which got a scientist named K. Koller interested in its numbing effects. I suggested it could be used as an anesthetic but didn’t follow up on it. On the morning after a dream I had, I thought about cocaine in a kind of daydream. I imagined if I ever had an eye disease called glaucoma, I would secretly go to Berlin for surgery by a friend’s recommended doctor. The doctor would brag about how easy the surgery had become since cocaine was used, but I wouldn’t tell him I helped discover it. I also thought about how awkward it is for a doctor to ask a colleague for help. I’d pay the doctor like anyone else. Then I remembered something real: after Koller’s discovery, my father got glaucoma and had surgery with Dr. Koenigstein, an eye specialist. Koller handled the cocaine anesthesia and said it was special because all three people who helped discover cocaine were there.

A few days before, I got a special book made by grateful students to celebrate their teacher and lab director’s anniversary. In it, I saw that Koller was credited with discovering cocaine’s numbing power. Then I realized my dream was linked to something that happened the evening before. I had just gone to Dr. Koenigstein’s home and talked about something I get excited about. While we talked, Professor Gartner and his wife came in. I congratulated them on how healthy they looked. Professor Gartner helped write the special book, so he might have reminded me of it. And Frau L, who was sad about her birthday flowers, was mentioned in my talk with Dr. Koenigstein, but in a different way.

Now I want to explain other parts of the dream. A dried plant sample came with the book, like in a herbarium. Herbarium made me think of my old school, the Gymnasium. The school head once made the older students clean the herbarium because of insects called bookworms. He didn’t trust me much and gave me only a few pages. I still remember there were crucifer plants on those pages. I never cared much about plants. At a botany test, I had to identify a crucifer but failed and barely passed thanks to my book knowledge. Crucifers made me think of composites. The artichoke is a composite and actually my favorite flower. My wife, who thinks more about these things than I do, often brings home artichokes from the market.

I see the book I wrote lying in front of me. This reminds me of a letter from a friend in Berlin who wrote yesterday: “I’m thinking a lot about your dream-book. I see it finished and am flipping through the pages.” I envy him because I can’t see my book like that yet.

The folded colored picture in the book also connects to a memory. When I was a medical student, I loved studying detailed books with colored pictures. Even though I didn’t have much money, I subscribed to many medical magazines just for the pictures. I was proud of being thorough. Later, when I started writing my own books, I had to draw the pictures myself. One came out so badly that a kind colleague made fun of me. This also reminds me of a childhood memory. My dad once jokingly gave my sister and me a book with colored pictures about a trip through Persia and told us to destroy it. This wasn’t a good idea for learning. I was five and my sister less than three. I still remember us happily tearing the book apart, leaf by leaf, like an artichoke. This memory is one of the few strong ones I have from that time. Later, as a student, I really liked collecting and owning books, like my habit of studying detailed monographs, which came up in my dream about cyclamens and artichokes.
