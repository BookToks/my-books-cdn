The main dream shows the same idea but changes it to make a wish come true: "I am from a high-status family." Actually, it means: "Because I come from a low-status family, my life has been this way." 

Sometimes a dream is split into two parts that aren’t equal, but that doesn’t always mean one part causes the other. Often, the two parts show the same thing from different views. This happens when several dreams from one night end with a physical need, like needing to go to the bathroom, which makes the dream clearer and clearer. Or the two parts come from different parts of the dream but share some ideas, so what’s important in one part shows up as a hint in the other. 

But sometimes the short part of a dream causes the long part that follows. Another way a dream shows cause and effect is by changing one image into another, like a person or object transforming. We only say one thing causes another if we actually see the change happen in the dream, not just if one thing replaces another. Both ways of showing cause and effect really work the same: one thing happens after another. Most of the time, though, dreams don’t clearly show cause and effect because many different things happen one after another.

Dreams can’t show “either-or” choices. They usually put both options together like they both belong. For example, in the famous “Irma’s injection” dream, the hidden meaning is: I’m not to blame for Irma’s pain; it’s either because she won’t accept the treatment, or because of her bad sexual situation, or maybe her pain isn’t psychological but physical. 

The dream shows all these possibilities, even though they don’t really fit together, and it can add a fourth idea from what the dreamer wishes. After explaining the dream, I added the either-or choices in their right places in the dream’s thoughts.

When someone tells a dream and says “It was either a garden or a living-room,” there isn’t really a choice in the dream’s meaning. It’s more like “and,” meaning both places are there in some way. Saying either-or usually means something in the dream is unclear but might be figured out later. The rule is to treat each option as equal and connected by “and.” For example, I dreamed of getting a telegram with my friend’s address in Italy. The first word was blurry, maybe “via” or “villa,” and the second word was clear, like “Sezerno” or “Casa.” The second word reminded me of Italian names and showed I was annoyed my friend kept the address secret. But any of the first words could start a chain of ideas.

Before my dad’s funeral, I dreamed of a sign like the ones at train stations that say no smoking. The sign said either: “You are requested to shut the eyes” or “You are requested to shut one eye.” I think of this as “You are requested to shut eye(s).” 

Each version has a different meaning and leads to different dream interpretations. I planned a simple funeral because I knew what my dad wanted. But other family members didn’t like how simple it was and thought we should feel embarrassed in front of the guests. So one version of the dream asks for shutting one eye, meaning people should be kind and understanding. The unclear either-or shows the dream didn’t fully blend these ideas together. The two main thoughts stay separate even in the dream.

Sometimes a dream is split into two equal parts to show a choice the dream finds hard to explain.

Dreams ignore opposites and contradictions. The word “No” doesn’t seem to exist in dreams.
