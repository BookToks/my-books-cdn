If I put together the common dreams that seem to go against my idea—because they show the opposite of a wish or something unwanted—I call these counter-wish-dreams. They follow two main ideas, one of which I haven’t talked about yet but is important in both waking life and dreams.

One reason for these dreams is the wish to look like I’m wrong. These dreams often happen during therapy when the patient resists treatment. In fact, I can usually make someone have this kind of dream after I explain my theory that dreams are wish-fulfillments. I even expect some readers might have such dreams just to prove me wrong. The last example I’ll share shows this well. A young girl, who fought to keep up treatment despite her family and authorities opposing it, dreamed that her family said she couldn’t see me anymore. She reminded me of a promise that I would treat her for free if needed, but I said I couldn’t make exceptions about money. It’s hard to see how this dream shows a wish coming true, but there’s another question: where did she get the words I said? I never said that, but her brother, who influences her a lot, said something like that about me. So the dream’s point is to prove her brother right, which is also her real-life goal and the reason for her illness.

Another tricky dream was told by a doctor named Aug. Starcke. He dreamed, “I have and see on the tip of my left finger a sign of primary syphilis.” This seems clear and unwanted at first, so you might skip analyzing it.

But if you dig deeper, you find that “primary affection” can mean “first love,” and the sore actually stands for strong emotional wishes. The other reason for counter-wish-dreams is clear but easy to miss. Many people have a masochistic side, meaning they get some kind of pleasure from being hurt or humiliated, not just physically but mentally. These people are called ideal masochists. For them, even bad or painful dreams are wish-fulfillments that match their masochistic desires. For example, a young man who used to bother his older brother (towards whom he felt attracted) dreamed three parts: (1) his brother teased him, (2) two adults showed gay affection, and (3) his brother sold a business the young man wanted to manage. He woke up feeling bad, but this was actually a masochistic wish-dream meaning: “I deserve it if my brother sells the business, as punishment for how I treated him.”

I hope these examples help make it believable that even painful dreams can be wish-fulfillments. It’s not a coincidence that these dreams bring up topics we don’t like to talk or think about. The bad feelings from such dreams are the same feelings that usually stop us from dealing with these subjects. We all have wishes we don’t want to admit, even to ourselves. Also, the unpleasantness of these dreams shows that they are distorted and hidden because we strongly want to push away or hide the dream’s true meaning. So, dream-distortion is like a form of censorship.

Putting it all together: a dream is the hidden fulfilment of a wish that has been pushed down or suppressed. Otto Rank added to this idea by saying dreams often show current and usually sexual wishes in a disguised and symbolic way, based on repressed childhood sexual feelings.

I never agreed fully with Rank’s version. I think the simpler version I gave is enough. But just mentioning Rank’s idea made people wrongly accuse psychoanalysis of saying all dreams are about sex. This shows how careless critics can be and how quick they are to ignore facts that don’t fit their attacks. I already talked about children’s dreams that show simple wishes, like going on trips or making up for a missed meal. I’ve also talked about dreams caused by thirst, needing to go to the bathroom, or just wanting comfort. Even Rank doesn’t say all dreams are sexual.
