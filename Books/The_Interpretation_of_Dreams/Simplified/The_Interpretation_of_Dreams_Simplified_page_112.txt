I didn’t want anyone to analyze this dream. But since I knew some things about the dreamer’s personal life, I could figure out parts of it on my own. I knew she felt really sorry for a musician whose career ended early because he went crazy. So, I decided to think about the tower in the dream as if it were a person. It turned out that the man she wanted to see instead of Hans Richter was much taller than everyone else in the orchestra. This tower is like a symbol. The base shows how great the man was, but the top has a railing that makes it look like a cage, where he runs around like a prisoner or an animal trapped inside. This cage part refers to the musician’s sad fate. The name “Lunatic-tower” fits this idea perfectly.

Now that we understand how the dream shows things, we can try to figure out another strange part: the coal her sister gives her. In the dream, coal actually means secret love.

There’s a saying that goes: No fire, no coal glows as hot as secret love that no one knows about.

In the dream, she and her friend stay seated while her younger sister, who might still get married someday, hands her the coal because she didn’t know it would take so long. The dream doesn’t say what would take so long. If this were a story, we might guess it’s the performance, but in the dream, we can leave it open. We might even think it means “before she got married.” The idea of secret love is backed up by a cousin sitting in the audience with his wife, who is having an open love affair. The dream shows a contrast between secret love and open love, and between the dreamer’s passion and the coldness of the young wife. Also, there’s again someone important standing between the rich person and the musician, giving hope to the dreamer.

In this analysis, we found a third important idea: the dream changes thoughts into pictures that can be seen. The dream picks ideas that can be shown as images. It doesn’t mind changing hard-to-express thoughts into different words if that helps make pictures, which stops the mind from feeling stuck. Changing the thoughts like this can also mix different ideas together. Sometimes, one idea changes itself to connect better with another.

Herbert Silberer found a good way to watch how thoughts turn into images in dreams. When he was tired and almost asleep, he tried to think hard but the thoughts slipped away and pictures showed up instead. Silberer called this change “auto-symbolic,” though that name isn’t perfect. I’ll share some examples from his work and talk more about this later.

Example 1: I remember I need to fix a difficult part in an essay.

Symbol: I see myself smoothing a piece of wood.

Example 5: I try to remember the goal of some deep studies I want to do.

This goal is about exploring the basics of existence and reaching higher levels of awareness.

Symbol: I run a long knife under a cake as if I’m cutting a slice.

Interpretation: The knife cutting the cake means working through something carefully. Silberer explains that when he cuts cake at the table, it needs careful work with a long, bendy knife. Cutting neat slices is hard because the knife must go slowly under the cake. The cake itself is a dobos cake, which has many layers—just like the levels of thought and awareness.

Example 9: I lose my train of thought. I try to find it again but realize I’ve completely forgotten where I started.
