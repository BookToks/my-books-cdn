If someone thinks that dreaming is just a simple process that continues the day’s events during the night, they miss an important point. Dreams about the death of people we love don’t fit with the usual way dreams are explained. This means the problem of understanding these dreams stays unsolved when it really doesn’t have to be.

It’s helpful to look at how these dreams connect to anxiety-dreams. In dreams where loved ones die, a hidden wish manages to avoid the mental “censorship” and the changes it causes in dreams. That’s why these dreams often feel painful. Anxiety-dreams happen when this censorship is broken or weakened, and this is easier when the body already feels anxiety. So, the censorship’s job is to stop anxiety or other painful feelings by changing the dream.

Before, I talked about how children’s minds are very self-centered, and this idea also applies to dreams. All dreams are selfish; the dreamer’s self is always there, even if disguised. The wishes shown in dreams are always the dreamer’s own wishes. It may seem like a dream is about someone else, but it really isn’t. Now, I’ll look at some dreams that seem to go against this idea.

A boy under four years old told this dream: He saw a big fancy dish with a large piece of roast meat, which was suddenly eaten, but he didn’t see who ate it. Who is this person in the dream? The answer comes from what happened during the day. For a few days, the boy was only allowed to drink milk because the doctor said so. On the day of the dream, he had been naughty and was punished by not getting supper. He had been hungry before but didn’t complain this time. The dream shows that he wants the meat but knows he can’t have it, so the dream hides who ate it. The person is unknown because the boy doesn’t dare imagine eating it himself.

One night, I dreamed I saw a new book at a bookstore. It was part of a series I usually buy, about famous speakers. The first book was about Dr. Lecher. It’s strange because Dr. Lecher, a long-winded German speaker, isn’t someone I usually think about. But recently, I started seeing new patients and have to talk a lot every day. So, in the dream, I am thinking about being a long speaker myself.

Another time, I dreamed a university teacher I know said to me, “My son, the nearsighted one.” Then we had a short conversation. Later, my sons and I appeared in the dream. In reality, the father, son, and teacher in the dream were just symbols for me and my oldest son. I will look at this dream again later because it has something interesting about it.

Here’s a dream showing selfish feelings hidden behind care: My friend Otto looked sick, with a brown face and bulging eyes. Otto is my family doctor who has helped my children’s health for years and even given them gifts. He visited us the day of the dream, and my wife noticed he was tired. That night, I dreamed that Otto had some symptoms of a disease. If you ignore my rules for understanding dreams, you might think this dream shows I’m worried about Otto’s health. But that would go against the idea that dreams are wish-fulfillments and come only from selfish feelings.
