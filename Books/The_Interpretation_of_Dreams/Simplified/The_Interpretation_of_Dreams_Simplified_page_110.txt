Sometimes you want to move but can’t, or you want to do something but keep running into problems. Imagine a train is about to leave, but you can’t get on it. Or you want to raise your hand to defend yourself, but your arm feels weak. We’ve seen this feeling in dreams before, but haven’t really tried to explain it. Some say it’s because our body is paralyzed during sleep, which causes this sensation. But then, why don’t we always dream about being stuck like this? Maybe this feeling happens only when the dream needs it to show something important.

Not being able to do something doesn’t always feel like a physical thing in dreams; sometimes it’s just part of the story. I’ll share a shorter version of a dream I had where I seemed to be accused of lying. The dream takes place in a mix of a private hospital and other places. A servant comes to get me for an investigation. I know something is missing and they suspect I took it. The investigation also feels like a medical exam. Because I know I’m honest and work there, I calmly follow the servant.

At the door, another servant says, “Did you bring him? He’s a respectable man.” Then, alone, I enter a big room with many strange machines. It looks like a torture place. I see a coworker tied to one machine; he should care about me but ignores me. I understand I can leave now. But then I can’t find my hat, so I can’t go after all.

This dream is about wanting people to believe I’m honest and let me leave. So, there must be parts of the dream that go against that wish. Being allowed to leave means I’m cleared of blame. But the dream stops me by making me lose my hat. That means: “Maybe you’re not honest after all.” Not being able to do something in a dream shows a conflict inside—a “No” to what you want. So, dreams can actually show a refusal or denial.

In other dreams where you feel stuck or can’t move, this shows an even stronger conflict between what you want and what stops you. This feeling of being stuck during sleep is a key part of how our mind works when we dream. A will to do something meets a force that says “No.” This is also why feeling stuck is often linked to anxiety in dreams. Anxiety comes from deep inside your mind and is stopped by your conscious self. So, if you feel stuck and anxious in a dream, it probably involves a strong wish or desire, often connected to feelings about sex.

Sometimes in dreams, you realize, “This is only a dream.” This thought helps you see the dream as less real. There’s also the idea of a “dream within a dream.” A researcher named W. Stekel explained this by saying the part of the dream you know is a dream is meant to be unimportant or unreal. What you keep dreaming after that is what you really want to happen instead. So, the dream inside the dream shows the real memory, and the rest shows your wish. Saying something is “just a dream” is like wishing it never happened. In other words, if your dream shows an event clearly, it means you really believe it’s important. Using the dream itself to say “it’s not real” actually proves that dreams are about fulfilling wishes.

Now, let’s talk about how dreams show ideas. We learned that dreams change the original thoughts a lot. They cut out many details and mix things together. Sometimes one idea replaces another that’s connected to it, making the dream simpler. This is called displacement. There’s another kind too: sometimes the words used in the dream get swapped for different words, but the idea stays connected. Both types of displacement happen along chains of related ideas, but one swaps ideas and the other swaps words.
