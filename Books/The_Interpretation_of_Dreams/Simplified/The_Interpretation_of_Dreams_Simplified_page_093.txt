Even the big, extra, and exaggerated things that happen in dreams might be a childish trait. Kids really want to grow up and eat as much as adults do. They are hard to please and never feel like they’ve had enough. They always want to do or have again whatever they liked before. Kids only learn to be moderate, humble, and calm by being taught. People with nervous problems also often act this way, wanting too much or going overboard.

When Dr. Ernest Jones gave a talk about selfishness in dreams, a smart woman disagreed. She said he should only talk about the dreams of Austrians, not Americans. She believed her own dreams were always about caring for others.

Studying dreams and the mind helped us see that kids who like gymnastics and repeat moves during nervous attacks are not just enjoying the movement. There is also another hidden reason: memories of sexual acts they have seen in people or animals.

A young friend who isn’t nervous told me that when swinging, at the lowest point, he felt a strange feeling in his private parts. It wasn’t exactly fun, but it was a kind of exciting feeling. I’ve heard from patients that the first times they felt this kind of excitement as boys happened when they were climbing. Psychoanalysis shows for sure that early sexual feelings often start during childhood rough play.

Day of wrath.

CHAPTER 6 THE DREAM-WORK

Earlier attempts to understand dreams looked only at the dream as we remember it. People tried to explain dreams by just looking at the story or images we recall. But we have a new kind of information: the hidden thoughts behind the dream, which we find using special methods. We figure out the meaning of dreams from these hidden thoughts, not from the dream story itself. This means we have a new problem: we need to study how the hidden thoughts turn into the dream we remember.

The hidden thoughts and the dream story are like two ways of saying the same thing. The dream story is like a translation of the hidden thoughts, but in a special code we need to learn. Once we find the hidden thoughts, we understand them easily. The dream story is like a picture written in secret symbols that we have to translate into the hidden thoughts’ language. It would be wrong to just look at the pictures as they are, because they don’t make sense that way.

For example, imagine a picture puzzle with a house, a boat on the roof, a letter, and a headless running person. At first, this looks weird and wrong. Boats don’t belong on roofs, and people don’t run without heads. The man is bigger than the house, and letters don’t belong in nature scenes. If I judge it like a normal picture, it seems silly. But if I replace each image with a word or sound it might mean, the nonsense becomes a meaningful sentence or saying. A dream is just like this puzzle. People who tried to interpret dreams before made the mistake of judging the dream pictures as normal art. That’s why dreams looked silly and meaningless.

A. Condensation

The first thing you notice when you compare the dream story and the hidden thoughts is that the dream shortens a lot. The dream is small and simple compared to the many hidden thoughts behind it. The dream might fill half a page, but the analysis of the hidden thoughts can take six, eight, or even twelve times as much space.
