But he himself has a bad nose infection, which worries me. Maybe this is what the dream means when it talks about an infection spreading.

You don’t just give injections without thinking. This is a criticism aimed at my friend Otto. I think I felt this earlier when he seemed to be against me. I might have thought, “He’s too easily influenced and judges too quickly.” Also, this reminds me of my late friend who irresponsibly used cocaine injections. I never meant for drugs to be injected like that. When I blame Otto, I’m also thinking about the story of Matilda, which was part of why I was blamed before. I’m showing both my carefulness and my mistakes here.

Maybe the syringe wasn’t clean. This is another blame on Otto, but it came from somewhere else. The day before, I met the son of an old lady I give morphine injections to. She’s 82 and now sick with a vein problem. I thought this might be from a dirty syringe. I’m proud I’ve never caused this because I always make sure the syringe is clean. I’m very careful. Thinking about her illness reminds me of my wife’s health problems during pregnancy, and brings up memories of my wife, Irma, and the dead Matilda. It seems like I’m mixing their stories together.

Now, I’ve finished figuring out the dream. While doing this, I avoided ideas that come from comparing the dream’s story with the hidden thoughts behind it. But now I see what the dream means. It shows a goal I had, which caused me to dream it. The dream makes wishes come true that I got from things that happened the night before (Otto’s news and writing a medical report). The dream says I’m not to blame for Irma’s pain; Otto is. Otto annoyed me by saying Irma’s cure wasn’t good enough, so the dream turns the blame back on him. The dream clears me of responsibility for Irma’s condition and points to other reasons. It shows a situation I wish were true. The dream is about making a wish come true; that’s why I dreamed it.

This is clear at first. But many parts of the dream make more sense when I see it as wish-fulfillment. I get back at Otto not just for quickly judging me, but also for giving bad medicine that smells weird. The dream connects these complaints with the idea of an injection of a certain chemical. I’m still not happy and keep getting back at him by comparing him to a better doctor. It’s like saying, “I like that doctor more than you.” But Otto isn’t the only one I’m mad at. I also get back at a disobedient patient by swapping her for a better one. And I don’t forget Dr. M, who I think is clueless. The dream shows this by suggesting his advice will make things worse. It’s like I’m asking for someone smarter, just like I switched from Irma to her friend, and from Otto to Leopold. I’m saying, “Get rid of these three people, bring in my choices, and I won’t have to take blame I don’t want.” In my dream, it’s clear these complaints aren’t fair. Irma’s pain isn’t my fault because she won’t accept my help. Her pain is physical, so mental treatment won’t fix it. Her pain is explained by her being a widow, something I can’t change. Her illness comes from Otto’s careless injection with the wrong drug, not from me. It’s like a dirty syringe causing the old lady’s vein problem, but my injections never cause harm. I know these reasons for Irma’s illness don’t all fit together, and some even go against each other. The whole defense in the dream reminds me of a man accused of returning a broken kettle. He said first, he returned it fine; second, it already had holes; and third, he never borrowed it. It’s a complicated defense, but if any one is true, he’s not guilty.

Other things also appear in the dream that don’t clearly connect to me not being responsible for Irma’s illness: my daughter being sick, a patient with the same name, how bad cocaine is, a patient traveling in Egypt, my wife’s health, my brother, Dr. M, my own health problems, and worry about a friend with a nose infection. But thinking about all these together, they form one idea: worrying about health, both mine and others’, and being a careful doctor. I remember feeling a bit upset when Otto told me about Irma. I think this feeling is part of the dream’s thoughts. It’s like Otto said, “You don’t take your doctor duties seriously enough; you’re not careful; you don’t do what you say.” So the dream’s thoughts helped me prove how careful I really am and how much I care about my family, friends, and patients. Interestingly, there are sad memories too, which show Otto’s blame more than mine. The dream’s material seems fair, but the connection between the big picture and my wish to be innocent of Irma’s illness is clear.
