People have had these kinds of thoughts and feelings for a long time, and many religious and holy people have felt bad about themselves because of them. These opposite thoughts happen to most people, not just about right and wrong, but in other areas too. Sometimes, people don’t take these thoughts too seriously. For example, a writer named Spitta shared a quote from A. Zeller, who said that even the smartest people can’t control their minds all the time. Weird, silly, or confusing ideas often pop up and bother their deep thinking or serious moments.

Hildebrandt noticed that dreams sometimes show us parts of ourselves we don’t usually see when we’re awake. Kant thought that dreams might show us who we could have been if we grew up differently. Radestock said dreams reveal things we don’t want to admit to ourselves, so we often think dreams lie or trick us. J. E. Erdmann said dreams have helped him understand how he really feels about people, not just what he thinks he should feel. J. H. Fichte agreed, saying dreams show our true character better than when we watch ourselves while awake.

Benini pointed out that old feelings we thought were gone can come back in dreams. Volkelt said even tiny, forgotten ideas can show up in dreams. Schleiermacher added that falling asleep often brings unwanted images into our minds.

These unwanted images include all the surprising or strange stuff we see in bad or weird dreams. The main difference is that bad dreams often go against what we usually feel is right, while strange dreams just seem odd. We don’t fully understand why this happens yet.

Many experts think that the bad or unwanted thoughts in dreams come from parts of us that we usually keep hidden while awake. When we sleep, the control that hides these thoughts weakens, so they come out in our dreams. Dreams then reveal a part of who we really are inside. Hildebrandt believes dreams warn us about hidden problems in our minds, just like doctors use signs to find hidden health issues.

Spitta agrees and says that during puberty, lots of new feelings come in, and if someone lives a good and pure life during the day, they’ve done their best. If bad thoughts come up in dreams, it’s because they were kept hidden while awake. So, these unwanted images in dreams are real parts of our mind showing up.

Other experts don’t agree with this idea. Jessen thinks that unwanted ideas in dreams, waking life, or even during fever are just random mental activities. He says a bad dream doesn’t prove anything about a person’s true feelings; it only shows what ideas their mind made up. Another expert, Maury, says dreams let our mind act out different parts separately, instead of mixing everything up. He explains that in dreams, our bad habits or urges take over, and we act on them without feeling guilty or scared. When awake, we try to fight these urges, but in dreams, we give in.

Maury strongly believes that if dreams really show a hidden bad side of a person, then they reveal the person’s true self when their willpower is turned off. In dreams, we become slaves to all the feelings we fight against when awake. He says that dreams mostly show the instinctive, natural side of a person.
