This dream, if it happened at all, must have come from something that made my eyes excited. But what made my eyes get excited? It was a recent thing I saw that mixed with things I had seen before. The colors I saw first were from the toy blocks my kids had used to build a cool structure for me to admire the day before the dream. There was dark red on the big blocks and blue and brown on the small ones. Mixed with these were colors from my last trip to Italy: the pretty blue of the Isonzo river and lagoons, and the brown color of the Alps mountains. The nice colors in the dream were just copies of the colors I remembered seeing.

Let’s sum up what we learned about dreams: they can change ideas into pictures we see in our mind. We don’t fully understand how this works with what we know about psychology, but we call it the “regressive character.” This means that when our thoughts can’t move forward normally to our awareness, they get pulled back by strong memories. Dreams might do this easier because during sleep, we don’t get new information from our senses like we do when we’re awake. In some sicknesses, this going-backward process is different because it can cause full hallucinations, like seeing things that aren’t there. What we described about dreams choosing clear, visual memories happens because the dream thoughts pick certain remembered scenes to show.

About this going-backward idea, it’s important not just for dreams but also for understanding mental health problems. We can see three types of going backward: (a) going back to certain parts of the mind, (b) going back to older mental stages, and (c) using simple, old ways of showing or expressing things instead of the usual ways. These three types are really the same thing because older memories are also simpler and come from closer to how we first experience the world.

We can’t talk about going backward in dreams without sharing a strong feeling we keep getting: dreaming is mostly going back to early parts of the dreamer’s life. It’s like bringing back childhood feelings, urges, and ways of showing them. Behind a person’s childhood, we get a peek at the childhood of humanity itself, since a person’s growth is like a shorter version of how humans evolved. We think the philosopher Nietzsche was right when he said that in dreams, there is a very old part of humanity that we can’t reach directly. By studying dreams, we might learn about the old, built-in parts of our minds. It looks like dreams and mental illnesses keep more of our mind’s ancient history than we thought, so psychoanalysis is an important science for finding out about the oldest parts of human life.

We might not find this first step of understanding dreams very satisfying. But we should remember that we are trying to understand something unknown. If we don’t get it right now, we’ll probably find the same answers later from a different starting point, and then we’ll understand better.

C. The Wish-Fulfillment

The dream about the burning child helps us see how tricky the idea of wish-fulfillment in dreams is. Saying that every dream is just about fulfilling wishes sounds strange, especially because some dreams cause anxiety. After we learned that dreams hide meaning and feelings, we didn’t expect all dreams to only be about wishes. Aristotle said dreams are just thinking while we sleep. Since our thoughts during the day include many things like judgments, plans, and worries, why would our night thoughts only be about wishes? Many dreams show other feelings, like worry. For example, the father’s clear dream about the burning child is a worried dream. He sees a light while asleep and thinks a candle fell and might be hurting the child. He turns this thought into a dream by showing it as if it’s happening right now. So, where is the wish-fulfillment in this dream? And how can we ignore the fact that this dream is mostly about a thought from when he was awake or a new thing he saw?

These questions make us look more closely at what wish-fulfillment means in dreams and how waking thoughts continue while we sleep.

It’s the idea of wish-fulfillment that made us split dreams into two groups: some dreams clearly show wishes being fulfilled, and others hide the wish-fulfillment in many ways.
