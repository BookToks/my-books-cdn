So, to my surprise, he started apologizing for lying to me. He felt really ashamed. Then, he told me the one sexual cause I'd been expecting, which I needed to believe that a neurosis was real. That made me feel better but also embarrassed because I had to admit that my consultant, who wasn’t worried about missing details, had understood the case better. I decided that next time I saw him, I would tell him he was right and I was wrong.

That’s exactly what happens in the dream. But what kind of wish is it to say I’m wrong? Actually, that’s my wish—I want to be wrong about my fears. In other words, I hope my wife, whose fears I’ve taken on in my dreams, is wrong. The question of being right or wrong in the dream is closely connected to what the dream is really about. It’s about either a physical illness caused by a woman or sexual life, like paralysis, or a neurosis, which is linked to Lasalle’s problem.

In this well-made and clear dream, Professor N appears not just because of this connection and my wish to be wrong, or the mentions of Breslau and our married friend’s family there, but also because of a little talk we had after our meeting. After doing his job and making his suggestion, Dr. N started talking about personal things. “How many kids do you have now?” “Six.” He looked thoughtful and respectful. “Girls or boys?” “Three of each. They’re my pride and joy.” “Well, be careful; the girls are fine, but boys can be harder to raise later.” I said my boys had been easy so far, but I didn’t like his prediction about their future, just like I didn’t like his diagnosis that my patient only had a neurosis. These two ideas connect because they happened one after the other. When I put the story about the neurosis into the dream, I replace the talk about raising kids, which is even closer to the dream’s ideas since it relates to my wife’s worry. So even my fear that N might be right about raising boys is hidden in the dream, behind my wish to be wrong about those worries. The same fantasy shows both opposite possibilities at once.

Dreams about tests or exams are just as hard to understand as most typical dreams. The dreamer’s own thoughts don’t usually give enough clues for interpretation. To really get these dreams, you have to study many examples. Recently, I realized that comforting thoughts like “But you’re already a doctor” don’t just make you feel better—they also kind of scold you. They say, “You’re already so old and experienced, yet you still act foolishly or childish.” This mix of self-criticism and comfort fits with exam-dreams. So, it’s not surprising that the last examples of these dreams include scolding about repeated bad sexual behavior.

The way words change in dreams is very similar to how they do in paranoia, hysteria, and obsessive behavior. Kids often play with words like objects, even making up new languages or grammar, and this is a common cause of such word changes in dreams and mental disorders.

Studying nonsense words in dreams is a great way to see how much the dream compresses ideas. From the few examples here, you shouldn’t think this is rare or strange. It actually happens a lot, but since dream interpretation depends on psychoanalysis, very few examples get written down, and most reports are only understood by experts in brain diseases.

When a spoken sentence shows up in a dream, it always comes from a speech the dreamer remembers. The exact words might be the same or slightly changed. Sometimes dream-speech is made from bits of different remembered talks; the words stay the same, but the meaning can change or become unclear. Often, the dream-speech just hints at an event connected to the remembered talk.

Another important point is about displacement. We might notice that the parts of the dream that stand out don’t always play the same role in the dream-thoughts (the ideas behind the dream). Also, things that are central in the dream-thoughts might not show up at all in the dream. The dream is focused somewhere else; its content is built around things that aren’t the main point of the dream-thoughts. For example, in a dream about botany, the main focus in the dream is botany. But the dream-thoughts are about problems and tensions from favors between colleagues and about the complaint that I spend too much time on hobbies. Botany isn’t part of these main ideas, unless loosely connected because I never liked botany much. In a patient’s dream about Sappho, going up and down stairs is the focus, but the dream really deals with the dangers of sexual relationships with lower-class people. So only one part of the dream-thoughts appears in the dream, and that part is exaggerated.
