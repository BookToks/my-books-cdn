If you think about this topic right away, you might come up with some answers: like, maybe when we sleep, we just can’t express our dreams properly. But looking closely at some dreams makes us think differently. I’ll show this with another dream I had, which also involves some mistakes, but helps explain the problem well.

In spring 1897, I found out two professors at our university had recommended me for the job of assistant professor.

This surprised me and made me happy because it showed respect from two important men, and I knew it wasn’t because of personal favors. But I also told myself not to expect much. The Ministry had ignored these kinds of suggestions for years, and some of my colleagues, who deserved it as much as I did, were still waiting. I didn’t think I’d do better. So, I prepared myself for disappointment. I’m not very ambitious, and I was already doing well in my work without the title. Whether the chance was good or bad didn’t really matter because it seemed out of reach.

One evening, a friend came to see me. He was one of those colleagues still hoping for a promotion. Unlike me, he wasn’t ready to give up and often reminded the bosses about his chances. After one of these talks, he visited me. He said he had pushed a high-ranking official hard and asked if religion was the real reason his promotion was delayed. The official admitted that, because of public opinion, he couldn’t promote him right now. “Now I know where I stand,” my friend said, which didn’t surprise me but made me feel even more sure I shouldn’t hope for much. The same religious reasons would probably affect me too.

The morning after my friend’s visit, I had a dream that was interesting because of how it was made. It had two thoughts and two pictures, switching back and forth. I’ll only tell you the first half because the second half isn’t important here.

First, I thought my friend R was my uncle, someone I really liked.

Then, I saw his face, but it looked different. It looked longer, with a yellow beard around it that stood out clearly.

I won’t share the rest of the dream.

I figured out what the dream meant like this: When I remembered it that morning, I laughed and said, “This dream makes no sense.” But I couldn’t stop thinking about it all day. By evening, I told myself, “If one of your patients said ‘That’s nonsense’ about a dream, you’d tell them to think deeper because it probably hides something they don’t want to face. You should do the same. Saying it’s nonsense just means you don’t want to accept what it really means.” So, I started to understand the dream.

My friend R is my uncle. That’s strange because I only had one uncle, Uncle Joseph. His story was sad. Over 30 years ago, hoping to get rich, he got involved in illegal deals and was punished.

My dad said Uncle Joseph wasn’t a bad person but was a fool. So if my friend R is like my uncle Joseph, that means I think R is a fool. That’s hard to believe and not nice!

But the face I saw in the dream with the long shape and yellow beard was just like my uncle’s. My friend R usually has dark skin and hair, but as black-haired people get older, their hair changes color. His beard is now partly yellowish, like mine sadly is too. The face in my dream looked like a mix of my friend R and my uncle, like those photos that blend different faces together to show family traits. I’m sure now: I think my friend R is a fool, like my Uncle Joseph.

I still don’t know why my mind made this connection. It’s one I don’t like at all. But it’s not very deep because my uncle was a criminal, and my friend R isn’t—except once he was fined for hitting someone with his bike.
