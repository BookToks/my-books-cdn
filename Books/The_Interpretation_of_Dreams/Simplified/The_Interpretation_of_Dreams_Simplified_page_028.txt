Dreams happen because our minds get overloaded and need to let off some steam. Robert thinks that physical causes, like what happens in our bodies, are less important for dreams. He says dreams can’t happen if the mind doesn’t already have stuff from waking life to use. But he agrees that deep mental images can be affected by nervous system signals. So, according to Robert, dreams aren’t only about the body. Dreaming isn’t really a mental process like when we’re awake; it happens in the body’s mental system at night and helps protect the mind from getting too tired or messy.

Another thinker, Yves Delage, looks at dreams in a similar way but comes to different ideas. After losing someone close, he noticed we don’t usually dream about what we think about a lot during the day, or we only start dreaming about it after other things distract us. He checked with others and found this is common. For example, newly married people rarely dream about each other before or during their honeymoon, and if they do, it’s often about being unfaithful with someone they don’t like. So, what do we dream about? Delage says dreams are made of bits and pieces from recent and older experiences. These aren’t new creations but memories we don’t realize we have. Usually, these come from things that affected our senses more than our thoughts, or things we quickly stopped paying attention to. The weaker and less noticed an impression is, the more likely it is to show up in a dream.

Delage points out two types of impressions: unimportant ones and those we haven’t dealt with yet. He thinks these cause dreams not because we ignore them, but because we haven’t finished processing them. Even small impressions are like tight springs that relax during sleep. Stronger impressions that got delayed or pushed away on purpose also play a big role. The energy we hold back during the day becomes the driving force of dreams at night. In dreams, things we tried to hide come out. But Delage doesn’t explore this much and mostly sees dreams as random, wandering thoughts that stop at memories strong enough to catch the brain’s attention while it’s half-asleep.

A third group of dream theories says the dreaming mind can do special mental activities it can’t do, or does badly, when awake. These activities are thought to make dreams useful. Early psychologists mostly agreed with this idea. One of them, Burdach, said dreaming is the mind’s natural activity where it’s free from self-control and can just play around. He thought this free play helps the mind refresh and get ready for the day, like a vacation.

Burdach liked how the poet Novalis described dreams: as a way to fight the boring, serious parts of life. Dreams mix all life’s images and add a childlike fun that breaks the adult seriousness. Without dreams, we might get old faster. So, dreams can be seen as a gift or a fun exercise that keeps us company on life’s journey. Another thinker, Purkinje, said especially creative dreams help by letting imagination run free, without sticking to daily events. The mind wants to relax after a hard day and uses dreams to do the opposite of waking life. Dreams cure sadness with joy, worry with hope, hate with love, and fear with courage. They turn doubt into belief and empty hopes into real feelings. Sleep covers and protects the mind’s hurts, helping time to heal. We all feel that sleep helps our mental health, and many people think dreaming is one way sleep gives us this help.
