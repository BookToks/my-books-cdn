[88] People have talked a lot lately about paramnesia in dreams in recent issues of the Revue Philosophique.

[89] These new findings fix some mistakes I made before about how logical ideas show up in dreams (chapter VI., C.). I explained how dreams generally work, but I missed some of the more careful and tricky parts.

[90] Stanniol is a reference to Stannius and the nervous system of fish; see chapter VI., F. for more.

[91] The place in the hallway of my apartment where other people keep their baby strollers is very detailed and important in several ways.

[92] This description doesn’t even make sense to me, but I try to write down the dream exactly as the words come to me. The way I say it is part of how the dream shows itself.

[93] Schiller was actually born in Marbach, not one of the Marbergs, as every German schoolkid knows and I knew too. This kind of mistake happens instead of a purposeful lie somewhere else, which I explain in The Psycho-pathology of Everyday Life (see chapter VI., B).

[94] If I’m right, the first dream I got from my 20-month-old grandson shows that the dream changed his feelings into a wish-fulfillment, but the feelings stayed the same while he was sleeping. The night before his dad left for war, the kid cried, "Papa, Papa - Baby." This probably means he wanted his dad and him to stay together, while the crying shows he knew his dad was leaving. At that time, the child could understand being apart. The word "fort" (meaning "away") was his first word, said with a long drawn-out sound, and for many months before this dream, he played with toys pretending they went away, which showed he was learning to say goodbye when his mom left.

[95] See the dream about Count Thun, last scene.

[97] Since psychoanalysis split the mind into the ego and super-ego (Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego, p. 664), it’s been easier to see that punishment dreams are wish-fulfillments from the super-ego.

[98] I have also explained why witty jokes give us so much pleasure in a similar way.

[99] The unconscious dream-thoughts insist on saying "non vivit" (he does not live) instead of "non vixit" (he did not live). It means "You came too late, he’s already dead." This was mentioned in chapter VI., G.

[100] Make room for me.

[101] It’s clear that the name Josef is important in my dreams (like the dream about my uncle). I can easily hide my own self in dreams by using this name because in the Bible, Joseph was a dream interpreter.

[102] Reve, petit roman means a daydream or a short story.

[103] I studied a great example of a dream made from several fantasies mixed together in the Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria (Collected Papers, vol. III). I didn’t realize how important these fantasies are for making dreams when I mostly studied my own dreams, which were usually from arguments or mental struggles, not daydreams. For other people, it’s easier to show that dreams and daydreams are very similar. In people with hysteria, an attack can sometimes be replaced by a dream; this shows that daydream fantasies are the first step for both.

[104] Justine Tobowolska wrote about the illusions of time in normal sleep dreams (1900) p. 53.
