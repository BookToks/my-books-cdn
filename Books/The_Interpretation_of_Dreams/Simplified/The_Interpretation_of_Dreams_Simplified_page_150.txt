If we keep studying dreams the way we have been—by looking at where strange or obvious parts come from—we find some things that need a new idea to explain. Sometimes in dreams, people feel surprised, angry, or upset about parts of the dream itself. Most of these feelings aren’t really about the dream but are just part of the dream’s story, like I showed with some examples before. But sometimes, these feelings don’t come from the dream story at all. 

For example, dreams sometimes include thoughts like, “After all, it’s only a dream.” This is a real kind of criticism someone might say when awake. Often, it happens right before waking up, or after feeling upset that goes away when you realize you’re still dreaming. Saying, “It’s only a dream” in the dream is like trying to make light of what just happened and get ready for what’s next. It helps calm down a part of your mind that might want to stop the dream or wake you up. It’s easier to keep dreaming and accept the dream because “it’s only a dream.” I think this kind of comment shows that part of your mind, which usually watches over you, has noticed the dream but can’t stop it. So it tries to calm down any worry or bad feelings by saying this.

This example proves that not everything in a dream comes from the dream’s own thoughts. Another part of the mind, like the one we use when awake, can add things to the dream. The question is, does this happen just sometimes, or does this mind part always help make dreams?

We have to say it happens all the time. The part of the mind that acts like a censor, which we’ve seen can cut out or limit parts of a dream, also adds things to the dream. These added parts are often easy to spot because they start with words like “as if” or feel unsure. They don’t seem very strong on their own and usually connect two parts of the dream or make the story flow better. They are less likely to be remembered after waking up compared to the real parts of the dream. When we forget dreams, we usually forget these connecting bits first. Sometimes, these added parts don’t match anything from the dream’s own thoughts. But this is rare; usually, the censor mind uses some part of the dream’s thoughts that doesn’t fit well by itself. Only in rare cases does this mind part create something completely new. Mostly, it borrows from the dream’s existing material.

What makes this part of dream-making different is its goal. It works like a poet or philosopher who patches up holes in the dream’s story with whatever scraps it can find. Because of this, the dream seems less weird or confusing and more like a real experience. But it doesn’t always work perfectly. Some dreams seem very logical and clear, starting with a possible event, changing consistently, and even ending naturally. These dreams have been worked over a lot by this mind part, and they seem meaningful, but this meaning is far from the dream’s true meaning. When we analyze them, we see this extra work has changed the dream freely and lost much of its original connections. These dreams have been “interpreted” once inside the dream before we try to understand them when awake. Other dreams have only some logic, but then become strange or confusing, maybe getting a little clear again before they end. Some dreams fail completely, leaving us with a confusing mix of random parts.

I don’t want to say this fourth dream-making power, which we know from other situations, can’t add new creative ideas to dreams. But like the other parts, it mostly picks and chooses what’s already in the dream thoughts. Sometimes, it doesn’t have to work hard to fix the dream because the dream thoughts already have a kind of structure ready to use. I call this part of the dream thoughts “phantasy,” which is like daydreaming when awake. Psychiatrists haven’t fully understood how important these phantasies or daydreams are, though some, like M. Benedikt, have started to study them well. Poets have noticed the importance of daydreams, too. For example, Alphonse Daudet described daydreams in his book Nabab. Studying mental illnesses shows something surprising: these phantasies or daydreams often come right before symptoms of hysteria. This means hysterical symptoms don’t come from real memories but from fantasies built on those memories.
