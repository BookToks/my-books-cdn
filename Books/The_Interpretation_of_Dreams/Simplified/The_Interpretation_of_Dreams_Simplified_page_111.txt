The second type of change that happens in dreams is really interesting and helps explain why dreams often seem strange and weird. Usually, a dull and unclear idea in the dream is swapped for something more colorful and easy to picture. This change makes the dream easier to imagine because pictures are simpler to show in dreams than abstract ideas. It’s like trying to explain a serious article with pictures—it’s much harder than using words.

This switch to pictures also helps make the dream shorter and hides some parts from the dreamer, like a secret code. When an unclear idea is changed into a picture, it connects better with other parts of the dream because concrete things have more links to other ideas than abstract ones. A lot of the work in making a dream happens by changing and combining ideas like this. One main idea might even control how the other ideas are expressed, kind of like how a poet has to find words that rhyme while still keeping the meaning.

Sometimes, changing the way things are said helps the dream combine several ideas into one by using words that can mean more than one thing. This is like a joke or a pun, and dreams use this trick a lot. Words are special because they connect many ideas at once, so they’re perfect for hiding meanings in dreams and also in mental problems like obsessions or fears. This change in words can confuse us because one word can replace two clear ideas, and dreams never tell us if we should take things literally or as symbols. When trying to understand a dream, we often don’t know if a part means the opposite, is a memory, stands for something else, or depends on the exact words used. Even so, understanding dreams isn’t harder than reading ancient codes like hieroglyphics.

I’ve already shared some examples where the dream makes sense only because of the unclear language it uses, like “her mouth opens without difficulty” or “I cannot go yet after all.” Now, I’ll tell you about a dream where these picture-like expressions play a bigger role. This is different from interpreting dreams by symbols because symbols are guessed by the person explaining the dream, but in this case, the clues come from normal ways people talk. If you understand the right idea at the right time, you can figure out parts or even the whole dream without the dreamer saying much.

A lady I know dreamed she was at the opera. It was a Wagner show that lasted until 7:45 in the morning. People were sitting at tables in the seats and orchestra area, eating and drinking. Her cousin and his new wife, who just got back from their honeymoon, were at one table with a nobleman. The young wife had apparently brought this nobleman back with her from the honeymoon as easily as if she had brought back a hat. In the middle of the seats, there was a tall tower with a platform and iron railing. On top stood the conductor, who looked like Hans Richter, running around the railing and sweating a lot. He was leading the orchestra, which was arranged around the base of the tower. The lady was sitting in a box with her female friend. Her younger sister tried to pass her a big lump of coal from the seats, saying she didn’t know the show would be so long and thought she must be cold by now. (It was like the boxes should have been heated during such a long performance.) Even though the dream shows the scene pretty well, it’s really strange: a tower in the middle of the seats with the conductor on top, and especially the coal her sister gives her.
