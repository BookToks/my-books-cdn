Jones. She stood by the sea watching a little boy, who seemed to be hers, wading into the water. He kept going in until the water covered him, and she could only see his head popping up and down near the surface. Then, the scene changed to a busy hotel hall. Her husband left her, and she started talking to a stranger.

The second part of the dream showed her running away from her husband and getting close to someone new, who was clearly linked to a man mentioned in an earlier dream. The first part of the dream was a clear symbol of birth. In dreams and old stories, being born is often shown as a child going into water, like the stories of Adonis, Osiris, Moses, and Bacchus.

Seeing the boy’s head bobbing made her remember the quick movements she felt when she was pregnant. Thinking about the boy in the water made her imagine herself taking him out, carrying him to the nursery, washing and dressing him, and making him part of her home.

So, the second part of the dream means she was thinking about running away, which was part of the hidden meaning of the first part. The first part was about birth, linked to the second part of the hidden meaning. The order was mixed up in the dream. In the first part, the child went into the water, then his head bobbed; in the hidden thoughts, the quick movements happened first, then the child came out of the water. In the second part, her husband left her; in her hidden thoughts, she left her husband.

Another birth dream is about a young woman expecting her first baby. In the dream, a hidden channel under the floor leads to water (like birth fluids). She lifts a trapdoor, and a creature in brown fur, like a seal, appears. This creature changes into her younger brother, who she has only a physical connection with.

Rank showed that birth dreams use the same symbols as dreams about peeing. The sexual feelings show up in these dreams like they do in dreams about needing to pee. The meaning changes as we grow up.

Now, about how physical feelings during sleep affect dreams.

Dreams caused by these feelings often show clear wishes and are simple to understand. They also use clear symbols because waking up often happens after the dream tries to deal with the physical need in a disguised way. This is true with dreams about peeing or pooping. Dreams about ejaculation help reveal sexual symbols that people argue about. Many innocent-seeming dreams are actually symbols leading up to sexual scenes. These scenes usually only show up directly in ejaculation dreams, but often become scary dreams that wake us up.

Dreams caused by bladder feelings are easy to understand and have been noticed for a long time. Hippocrates thought dreaming of fountains or springs meant bladder problems. Scherner studied these dreams and said strong feelings from the bladder always turn into sexual feelings and symbols. Rank agreed and said many dreams caused by bladder feelings are really about sexual feelings that start from early childhood stages. Sometimes, these feelings wake the person up to pee, but the dream keeps going and shows clear sexual images.

Dreams caused by feelings from the intestines also show clear symbols, like how gold and poop are connected in many cultures. For example, a woman sick with an intestinal problem dreamed of a treasure digger burying treasure near a little wooden shed like an outdoor toilet. Another part of the dream showed her cleaning her little daughter who had pooped herself.

Dreams about rescue are connected to birth dreams. For women, dreaming of rescuing someone, especially from water, means giving birth. This meaning changes if a man has the dream.

Things like robbers, burglars, and ghosts that scare us before bed and sometimes wake us up come from childhood memories. They are like visitors who woke the child at night to make sure it didn’t wet the bed or to check how the child was sleeping. The writer was able to remember exactly these night visitors when analyzing some scary dreams.
