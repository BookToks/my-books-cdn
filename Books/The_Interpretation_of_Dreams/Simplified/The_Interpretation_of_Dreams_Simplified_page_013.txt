Johann Muller already said this before. Maury thinks that to have these experiences, your mind needs to be kind of passive and relaxed, paying less attention (p. 59). But you can see a hypnogogic hallucination anytime if you suddenly feel really tired for a moment, right before you fall asleep. After that, you might wake up, and this back-and-forth keeps happening until you finally fall asleep. Maury says that if you wake up soon after having this experience, you can often remember the images you saw before sleeping as part of your dream (p. 134).

For example, Maury once saw strange, weird-looking people with funny hair while falling asleep, and these images pushed themselves into his mind. When he woke up, he remembered seeing them in his dream. Another time, when he was hungry because he was on a strict diet, he saw a plate of food and a hand with a fork in a hypnogogic state. In his dream, he was sitting at a table full of food and heard the sound of forks. On a different night, after falling asleep with tired, painful eyes, he saw tiny letters in his hypnogogic hallucination, which he had to work hard to read. When he woke up an hour later, he remembered a dream where he was reading a book with very small letters and had to struggle to read them.

It’s not just pictures—sometimes you can hear words, names, or sounds in these hypnogogic states, and these sounds then show up again in your dreams, like a preview before the main event.

A more recent researcher, G. Trumbull Ladd, agrees with Muller and Maury. He practiced waking himself up a few minutes after falling asleep, without opening his eyes.

This helped him compare the fading images his eyes saw with the dream pictures he remembered. He says there’s always a connection because the glowing dots and lines his eyes see create the basic shape of the dream images. For example, he once dreamed of reading clear printed lines, and this matched spots of light arranged in lines on his retina. He explained it like this: the clear page in his dream looked like a real printed page seen through a tiny hole in paper, but from too far away to read. Ladd thinks almost every visual dream starts from these light patterns the eyes still sense inside the head. This is especially true for dreams just after falling asleep in a dark room. Dreams closer to morning are influenced by real light coming into the eyes in a bright room. The changing and random light patterns on the retina match the changing images we see in dreams. If we believe Ladd, these inner eye signals are super important because most dreams are mostly about pictures. Other senses, like touch or smell, don’t play a big or steady role, except maybe hearing.

3. Internal (organic) physical signals If we want to find where dreams come from inside our bodies, we have to remember that our organs usually don’t bother us when we’re healthy. But when they’re upset or sick, they can send painful signals, just like outside feelings of pain or touch. Strumpell says that during sleep, the mind notices the body more deeply than when we’re awake. It has to feel and react to signals from parts of the body that we don’t notice when awake. Even Aristotle thought that dreams might warn us about early signs of sickness we don’t see when awake because feelings in dreams can seem stronger. Some doctors, who didn’t believe dreams could predict the future, still thought dreams could help predict diseases. 

The Greeks had dream oracles to help sick people get better. Patients went to temples of gods like Apollo or Aesculapius. They went through ceremonies, were bathed and rubbed with perfumes. Then, feeling excited and ready, they lay down to sleep on a sacrificial ram’s skin. They dreamed of medicines or symbols that priests later explained.

Even today, there are real cases where dreams have helped diagnose health problems. For example, Tissie tells about a 43-year-old woman who seemed healthy for years but had anxiety dreams. Later, doctors found she had early heart disease, which eventually caused her death.

Serious problems with internal organs often cause people to have dreams about anxiety. Many writers have noticed this, especially in diseases of the heart and lungs. Because so many have talked about this, I will just point you to the books and articles about it (Radestock, Spitta, Maury, M.).
