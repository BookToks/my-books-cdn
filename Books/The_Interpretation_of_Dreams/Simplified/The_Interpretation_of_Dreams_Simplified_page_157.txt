[34] This talks about the many people who appear in her fantasies.

[35] It asks if it is okay to masturbate. The phrase "sich einem herunterreißen" means "to pull off" and is slang for masturbating. [36] The branch (Ast) has been used for a long time as a symbol for the male genitalia, and it also clearly hints at the dreamer’s last name.

[37] It refers to wedding precautions, just like the part that comes right after it.

[38] A similar dream related to someone’s life story is mentioned later in this chapter, as an example of dream symbolism.

[39] You can compare this with the work of Bleuler and his Zurich students, like Maeder and Abraham, and also with non-medical writers like Kleinpaul. But the most important ideas about this are in the book by O. Rank and H. Sachs, called *Die Bedeutung der Psychoanalyse für die Geisteswissenschaft* (1913), chapter 1.

[40] This idea is supported by a theory from Hans Sperber. He thinks early words only meant sexual things, but later lost that meaning and were used for other things that were seen as similar to sex.

[41] For example, a ship sailing on the sea might show up in dreams about peeing for Hungarian people, even though their language doesn’t use the word “to ship” to mean urinate (Ferenczi). In French and other Romance languages, the word for room can stand for woman, even though these languages don’t have a word like the German “Frauenzimmer.” Some symbols are as old as language itself, while new ones keep being created, like the airplane or the Zeppelin. [42] In the U.S., fathers in dreams are often shown as the President or the Governor—a title that people sometimes use for their dads in real life.

[43] A patient living in a boarding house dreamed he asked a servant girl her number, and she said 14. He had actually been involved with her and spent time in her room, which was number 14. The girl was worried the landlady might suspect something and had suggested they meet in a free room the day before. In the dream, the number 14 was on the woman herself. This clearly shows how the woman and the room were connected in the dream. (Ernest Jones, Intern. Zeitschr. f. Psychoanalyse, ii, [1914]). (Also see Artemidorus, *The Symbolism of Dreams* [German version by F. S. Krauss, Vienna, 1881, p. 110]: “For example, the bedroom means the wife, if you’re in the house.”) [44] See “the cloaca theory” in *Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex*.

[45] See pages 123-124 above.

[46] In the *Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse*, ii, 675, there is a drawing by a 19-year-old patient showing a man with a snake as a necktie, turning towards a girl. Also, in the story *Der Schamhaftige* (Anthropophyteia, vi, 334), a woman walks into a bathroom and meets a man who barely has time to put on his shirt. He’s very embarrassed but quickly covers his neck with his shirt and says, “Please excuse me, I have no necktie.” [47] Check Pfister’s work on secret codes and picture puzzles. [48] Even though Scherner’s ideas about dream symbols are different from these, he should still be recognized as the first person to discover symbolism in dreams. Psychoanalysis has made his book (published in 1861) famous after his death. [49] From “Nachträge zur Traumdeutung” in *Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse*, i, Nos. 5 and 6, (1911). [50] See Kirchgraber for a similar example (*Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse*, iii, [1912], p. 95). Stekel told about a dream where a hat with a feather standing up sideways symbolized a man who was impotent. [51] See the comment in *Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse*, i; and note (8) above. [52] Or “chapel” means vagina.
