Childhood shows up in dreams in different ways, like when time is shown as space. You might see people and scenes far away, at the end of a long road, or like looking through the wrong end of binoculars.

A man who usually uses vague words but is smart dreams that he gets to a train station just as a train arrives. But the platform moves toward the train instead of the train moving. This is a weird switch from real life. This shows something else in the dream is also flipped. When he thinks about this dream, he remembers picture-books where people stand on their heads and walk on their hands.

The same man once had a short dream that felt like a puzzle. His uncle kissed him in a car. He immediately said it meant auto-erotism, which is a joke about self-love. He probably wouldn’t have said this seriously when awake.

At a New Year’s dinner, the family’s oldest man made a speech. He said the past year was all good, with no problems, and called his kids an asset, not a liability. One son-in-law, a lawyer, didn’t take him seriously because he thought about his wife’s brother, who was a liar and a cheat. That night, the lawyer dreamed about the speech. Instead of talking, the old man opened a ledger showing his name under assets and his bad brother-in-law’s name under liabilities. But “liability” was changed to “Lie-Ability,” which fit the brother-in-law perfectly.

In another dream, someone treats a broken bone. This bone break stands for a broken marriage promise or something similar.

In dreams, the time of day often stands for a certain age in the dreamer’s childhood. For example, 5:15 a.m. meant to one person that they were five years and three months old when their younger brother was born.

Another way age shows up in dreams: a woman walks with two little girls who are 15 months apart in age. She can’t think of a family she knows like that. She thinks the girls represent herself and that the dream reminds her of two hard times in her childhood, which were also about 15 months apart.

People going through psychoanalysis often dream about it and show their thoughts and hopes about the treatment in their dreams. The treatment is usually shown as a journey, often in a car, which is a modern and complex vehicle. The speed of the car lets the dreamer joke about it. When the unconscious mind shows up in a dream, it often appears as underground places, which can also stand for the female body or womb. “Down” often means genitals, while “up” means the face, mouth, or chest. Wild animals in dreams usually stand for strong feelings or desires, either the dreamer’s or others’ that the dreamer is scared of. These animals can also represent people who have those feelings. Sometimes, wild animals show the scary father figure. You could say wild animals stand for sexual energy that the ego fears and tries to control. Even the illness itself can appear as a separate person in the dream.

Dreams use every way they can to show thoughts, even if these seem strange or wrong when awake. This makes dream interpretation hard and often misunderstood by people who only know about it from stories but have never tried it themselves. A book by Stekel has many examples but his way of interpreting dreams is not very reliable, so it’s better to be careful with his ideas.

From an essay by V. Tausk: (a) A man dreams his old governess wears a tight black dress that shows off her butt. This means he thinks she is lustful.

(b) Another dreamer sees a girl on the road to a place called X, glowing in white light and wearing a white blouse. This dreamer later started a relationship with a girl named Miss White on that road.
