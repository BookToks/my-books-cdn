The ratio changes with different dreams, but in my experience, it’s always about the same. Usually, people don’t realize how much has been squeezed or shortened in a dream. This is because the dream thoughts we find are thought to be everything, but if we keep interpreting, we’ll find even more hidden ideas in the dream. We’ve already said that you can never be completely sure you’ve understood a dream fully. Even if the explanation seems perfect, there might be another meaning hidden in the same dream. So, the amount of shortening is really impossible to measure exactly.

Some people might say it doesn’t make sense to say dreams squash a lot of mental stuff into a small space. They feel like they dream a lot all night but forget most of it when they wake up. The dream we remember is just a small part of all the dreaming we did. If we could remember everything, it would be as big as the dream thoughts. And it’s true, the best way to remember a dream is right after waking up because the memory fades as the day goes on. But often, the feeling that we dreamed a lot more than we remember is tricking us, and I’ll explain why later.

Also, forgetting parts of dreams doesn’t change the fact that dreams condense a lot. We can prove this by how many ideas come up when we analyze the parts of the dream we do remember. If a big part is forgotten, we lose some dream thoughts, but we shouldn’t expect the lost parts to only be about the thoughts we already found. Since each part of a dream brings up many ideas, the main question some readers have is: Can we count everything that comes to mind during analysis as part of the dream thoughts? In other words, did all these thoughts happen while sleeping and helped create the dream? Or are some ideas just new thoughts made up during analysis?

My answer is partly yes. It’s true that some new thought combinations appear during analysis, but you can see that these new connections only happen between thoughts already linked in the dream. These new links are like shortcuts based on more basic connections. Most groups of thoughts we find were active when the dream was made. If you follow a chain of thoughts that seem unrelated, you’ll find a thought that is actually in the dream and necessary to understand it, even if it’s only found through this chain. You can look at the dream about the botanical monograph, which shows a huge amount of condensation, even though I didn’t finish the full analysis.

But what was the mind like right before dreaming? Did all the dream thoughts happen at the same time, one after another, or were there different thought trails from different places that later met? I don’t think we need a clear picture of this now. Remember, we’re dealing with unconscious thinking, which could be very different from how we think when we’re awake and aware.

The fact is, dreams are definitely made by condensing thoughts. So, how does this condensation happen?

If we think about it, only a few parts of the dream thoughts show up in the dream itself. We might think condensation happens by leaving stuff out, meaning the dream isn’t a perfect copy of the dream thoughts but a very incomplete version. But this idea isn’t enough to explain it all. For now, let’s start with it and ask: If only a few parts of the dream thoughts appear in the dream, how are those parts chosen?

To figure this out, let’s look at parts of the dream that must meet certain conditions. The best example is a dream with a lot of condensation. I pick the dream from chapter five about the botanical monograph.

I.

Dream-content: I have written a book about a certain kind of plant. The book is in front of me. I’m turning a folded colored page. There’s a dried plant pressed inside the book, like in a plant collection.

The main thing in this dream is the botanical monograph. This comes from things I saw during the day; I had actually seen a book about the plant genus Cyclamen in a bookstore window. The dream doesn’t mention Cyclamen, only the monograph and its link to botany. The botanical monograph connects to a paper I once wrote about cocaine. From cocaine, my thoughts go to a special publication and to my friend Dr. Koenigstein, an eye doctor who helped introduce cocaine as a local anesthetic.
