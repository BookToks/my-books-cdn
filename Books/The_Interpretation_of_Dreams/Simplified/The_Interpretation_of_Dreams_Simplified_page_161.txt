Dreams are like stories our mind makes up while we sleep. When we wake up, our brain tries to make sense of these stories, just like it does when we are awake and notice things around us.

Sometimes, dreams are a mix of random images that don’t seem to connect. Our imagination works to link these images together and fill in missing parts to create a story.

I think that when we remember dreams, our imagination changes or improves them a bit. After waking up, our brain finishes the dream story started during sleep, making it seem faster or clearer than it really was.

When we dream, our mind uses both the strange images from the dream and ideas from our awake thoughts to put things together.

People used to think that dreams only happen right when we wake up, and that our awake thoughts create the dream from images we had while sleeping.

At first, it was hard for people to understand the difference between the obvious parts of a dream and the hidden thoughts behind it. Some ignored the need to figure out what dreams really mean.

Now, many agree that we should look for the meaning behind the dream, but they often make another mistake. They focus only on the hidden thoughts and forget about how the dream is formed. A dream is just a special kind of thinking that happens because we are asleep. The way the dream is made is what makes it unique.

Dreams often show us the problems and tasks our mind is working on, just like when we are awake. This thinking can also happen just below our full awareness.

One interesting dream was shared with me by a woman who heard it in a lecture. She liked it so much that she dreamed a similar dream herself to show she agreed with its message.

In this dream, a father watched over his sick child day and night. When the child died, the father slept in the next room but left the door open to see the child’s body surrounded by candles. An old man was there praying.

The father dreamed that the child stood by his bed, holding his arm and saying sadly, “Father, don’t you see I am burning?” The father woke up and saw a bright light from the next room. He ran in and found the old man asleep, and a candle had fallen, burning the sheets and the child’s arm.

The meaning of this dream is simple. The bright light shining through the door made the father think there was a fire near the body, just like if he were awake. He was probably worried that the old man might fall asleep and not watch properly.

There’s nothing wrong with this explanation. We can add that the dream’s meaning comes from many different feelings and memories. The child’s words in the dream were probably phrases the child had said before and were very important to the father.
