From studying dreams, I noticed that even when a dream seems easy to understand because its sources and wishes are clear, important ideas often go back to early childhood. This made me wonder if this connection to early years is a key part of dreaming. If I were to guess, I’d say every dream links to recent experiences on the surface, but deep down it connects to very old experiences. In cases like hysteria, these old experiences seem as fresh as recent ones. Still, it’s hard to prove this idea, and I’ll talk more about childhood’s role in dreams later (chapter VII).

We talked about three strange things about dream memory. One is that dreams focus on unimportant details, and we figured out this happens because dreams change things around. We also found that dreams pick recent and very old memories, but we can’t explain why this happens just by looking at what the dream wants. We need to remember these two things because we’ll try to explain them later, maybe when we study how sleeping works or how our mind is built. We’ll see that dream interpretation lets us peek inside the mind’s workings.

Another important discovery from recent dream studies is that dreams often have more than one meaning. They might show several wishes at once, or one meaning might hide another. At the deepest level, dreams can fulfill wishes from early childhood. In fact, it might not just happen often, but always.

If you ask an average person where dreams come from, they usually say it’s because of things like stomach problems, how you lie down, or small events while sleeping. They think they understand this part well. But even after thinking about these body-related causes, there’s still more to explain.

Earlier, we talked about how body sensations affect dreams. There are three types: things we sense from outside, feelings inside our senses, and signals from inside the body. Some experts focus only on body signals and ignore the mind’s role in making dreams. We learned that outside noises or touches during sleep can affect dreams, and that dreams often include weird images we see as we fall asleep. Also, feelings from inside the body, like hunger or needing the bathroom, influence dreams.

Many say nerve and body signals are the only real causes of dreams. But we found reasons to doubt this is the full story.

Even those who strongly believe in this body-based theory admit that the many ideas in dreams can’t come just from outside nerve signals. For example, a researcher named Mary Whiton Calkins studied her own and another person’s dreams for six weeks. She found that only a small percentage of dreams showed outside sensory input, and very few came from internal body feelings. This matches what we all notice in our own dreams.

Some people have tried to separate dreams caused by nerve signals from other types of dreams. For instance, Spitta divided dreams into nerve-stimulus dreams and association dreams. But this didn’t fully solve the problem because it didn’t explain how body signals link to the ideas in dreams.
