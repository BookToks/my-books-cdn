[53] A symbol for sex.

[54] The fatty area above the female private parts.

[55] Pubic hair.

[56] Demons wearing cloaks and hoods are seen by experts as symbols for male genitals.

[57] The two parts of the scrotum.

[58] Alfred Robitsek wrote about this in a psychology journal in 1911.

[60] When someone dreams about pulling out a tooth, it usually means castration, which is like losing power or control (similar to cutting hair). But you have to tell the difference between dreams caused by tooth pain and dreams about the dentist, which have been studied by experts like Coriat.

[61] According to C. G. Jung, women’s dreams about teeth can mean giving birth. E. Jones agreed with this idea. Both castration and birth dreams involve losing or removing a part of the body.

[62] See the earlier personal dream mentioned in this chapter.

[63] This part about dreams of movement is repeated because it fits the topic. See chapter 5, part D.

[64] This refers to the German slang word "vogeln," which means to have sex, and comes from the word for bird.

[68] W. Stekel wrote The Language of Dreams in 1911.

[69] Alfred Adler wrote about psychological hermaphroditism in life and neurosis in medical journals from 1910 and later.

[70] I shared a classic example of a hidden Oedipus dream in a psychology journal. Another detailed one was published by Otto Rank. Other hidden Oedipus dreams where the eye is a symbol can be found in Rank’s work. Articles about dreams involving eyes were written by Eder, Ferenczi, and Reitler. In the Oedipus story, being blinded stands for castration. Ancient people understood these dream symbols well. For example, Julius Caesar had a dream about having sex with his mother, which was seen as a good sign meaning he would take over the earth (Mother Earth). Another story says the first person to kiss their mother would rule Rome, meaning they got power from Mother Earth. These myths and interpretations show strong psychological ideas. People who feel loved or special to their mothers often are confident and optimistic, which helps them succeed.

[71] For the meaning of being born from water in myths, see Rank’s work about the birth of heroes (1909).
