Here’s the story of another dream I had, which I want to share because it has a clear main message that I’ll explain later when we talk about feelings in dreams. I dream very clearly: I go to Brucke’s lab at night, and when I hear a soft knock, I open the door to find Professor Fleischl, who has already died, coming in with some strangers. After saying a few words, he sits down at his table.

Then, I have a second dream: My friend Fl visits Vienna quietly in July. I meet him on the street, where he is talking with my dead friend P. We go somewhere together, and they sit facing each other like at a small table, while I sit at the narrow end. Fl talks about his sister and says, "In three-quarters of an hour she was dead," then something like "That is the threshold." Since P doesn’t understand, Fl asks me how much I have told P about his affairs. I feel strange emotions and try to explain that P can’t know anything because he’s not alive. Then I realize my mistake and say, "Non vixit" (he did not live). I look closely at P, and he turns pale and blurry, his eyes sickly blue, and finally he disappears. I feel very happy because now I understand that Ernst Fleischl is also just a ghost, and such a person can exist only as long as someone wants him to, and can be made to vanish by someone else’s wish.

This beautiful dream shows many strange things about dreams — like how I notice my own mistake in the dream, how I talk easily with dead people who the dream itself says are dead, how my conclusion is kind of silly, and how happy it makes me. I wish I could explain the whole meaning perfectly. But in real life, I couldn’t do what I do in the dream — I couldn’t give up close friends just for my own goals. If I tried to hide the real meaning of the dream, which I understand well, it would ruin it. So, I will only explain some parts of the dream now and some later.

The part where I make P disappear with a look is the main part of the dream. His eyes turn weird blue, then he fades away.

This part copies a real moment I lived through. I was working at the Physiological Institute, and once I was late to the student lab several times. One morning, Brucke came early and waited for me. What he said was short and clear, but what really hit me was his terrible blue eyes, which made me feel like I was melting away — just like P does in the dream, but in the dream P and I have switched roles, which made me feel better. Anyone who knew Brucke’s beautiful eyes, even when he was old, and saw him angry, can imagine how I felt that day.

For a long time, I couldn’t understand why I said "Non vixit" in the dream. Then I remembered these words weren’t said or heard — they were seen. I realized they came from an inscription on a statue of Emperor Joseph in Vienna’s Hofburg palace. The words say something like, "He lived for the good of his country, not for a long time, but completely." I had mixed up the word for “country” in my mind, which someone named Wittels probably guessed right.

From that statue, I took the phrase that fit a negative thought in my dream — meaning “That guy has nothing to say here, he’s not really alive.” I also remembered that I had this dream a few days after a memorial for Fleischl was revealed at the University, where I also saw Brucke’s memorial. I had probably thought sadly, without realizing it, that my talented friend P didn’t get a memorial because he died too soon. So in the dream, I made a memorial for him; Josef is P’s baptismal name.

According to dream rules, I shouldn’t just change "non vivit" (he does not live) to "non vixit" (he did not live), even though the statue gave me those words. Something else in the dream helped make this possible. I noticed that two opposite thoughts about my friend P meet in the dream — one angry, one loving — both shown by the same words: "non vixit." Since P did good for science, I build a memorial for him; but since he had a mean wish at the end of the dream, I destroy him. I made a sentence with a special rhythm, probably inspired by something I’ve heard before.

But where else can I find two opposite feelings about the same person, both true, that don’t cancel each other out? Only in one famous speech that really moves people — Brutus’s speech in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar: "As Caesar loved me, I weep for him; as he was lucky, I’m happy; as he was brave, I honor him; but as he was ambitious, I killed him." Isn’t that just like the dream’s thoughts? So in my dream, I’m playing Brutus.

If only I could find another clue! Maybe it’s this: My friend Fl comes to Vienna in July. That never actually happened, but July is named after Julius Caesar, so it might be a hint that I’m playing Brutus’s part. Funny enough, I once actually played Brutus in a play.
