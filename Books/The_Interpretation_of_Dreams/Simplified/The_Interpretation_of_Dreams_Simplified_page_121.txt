He must be this student himself; he doesn’t care much about his analysis, just like the student doesn’t care much about his synthesis. But the "he" in the dream who does the work is actually me. I must find him annoying because he doesn’t care about the results!

Also, he is the material for the analysis (or synthesis). The main question is whether the treatment works. The legs in the dream remind me of something from the night before. He met a girl at a dance class and wanted to impress her; he held her so close she once cried out. When he stopped pressing her legs, he felt her firm pressure on his thighs, just above the knees, which matches the dream. So, in the dream, the woman is like magnesium in a chemical test that’s finally reacting. He acts feminine towards me but manly towards the woman. If he succeeds with her, the treatment will work too. Feeling his knees means masturbation and links to his tiredness the day before. They had made a date for 11:30. His wish to oversleep and stay home to masturbate shows his resistance.

He says he likes the name "phenyl" because all words ending in "yl" are easy to use, like benzyl or acetyl. But that didn’t explain much. When I suggested the word "Schlemihl," he laughed and said he read a book by Prevost about "Les exclus de l’amour," where Schlemilies are outcasts. He thought, "That’s me." He would have been a Schlemihl if he missed the date.

It seems that sexual symbols in dreams have been proven by experiments. In 1912, Dr. K. Schrotter, following H. Swoboda’s idea, made hypnotized people dream about sexual things by giving suggestions. If told to dream about normal or abnormal sex, their dreams showed sexual ideas using common dream symbols. For example, when told to dream about a lady friend in a homosexual way, the friend appeared in the dream with an old travel bag labeled "For ladies only." The dreamer didn’t know about dream symbols or interpretations.

Sadly, this important study lost value because Dr. Schrotter later killed himself. He only gave a first report about his dream experiments in a psychoanalysis journal.

Only when we understand the importance of symbolism in dreams can we keep studying common dreams like we started earlier. I think we can divide these dreams into two groups: first, those that always mean the same thing, and second, those that look similar but have very different meanings. I already talked a lot about the exam dream, which is in the first group.

Because they feel similar, dreams about missing a train are like exam dreams. Their meaning supports this too. They are comforting dreams that fight another fear in dreams—the fear of death.

Leaving or going away is a common symbol for death. So the dream comforts you by saying, "Don’t worry, you’re not going to die (leave)," just like exam dreams say, "Don’t be scared; nothing bad will happen this time." The problem with both dreams is that the fear is tied to the comfort they try to give.

For a long time, I didn’t understand dreams caused by dental pain because my patients didn’t want to talk about them. But finally, lots of evidence showed me that for men, these dreams come from puberty’s masturbation desires. I will analyze two such dreams, one of which is also about flying. Both dreams were from the same young man who is clearly gay but has hidden it in real life.

He is watching the opera Fidelio from the seats; sitting next to L, a person he likes and wants to be friends with. Suddenly, he flies diagonally across the seats; then he puts his hand in his mouth and pulls out two teeth.

He says the flight felt like being thrown into the air. Since the opera was Fidelio, he remembers the line: "He who a charming wife acquires...." But he doesn’t want a wife. Two other lines fit better: "He who succeeds in the lucky (big) throw / The friend of a friend to be...." The dream shows a lucky big throw, but it’s not just about wishing for something to happen.
