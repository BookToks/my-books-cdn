So, the pictures we see in dreams mostly come from things we just experienced, but they mix together in a crazy and random way. As more brain cells become active, the dream makes a bit more sense. Some scientists and thinkers say dreams are like being partly awake, with different parts of the brain doing different jobs. But even if that idea is true, it still needs a lot of study.

This idea doesn’t explain what dreams are for. Binz, one of the main supporters, actually says dreams don’t matter at all. He calls dreams a physical process that’s useless or even unhealthy. When he says physical, he means dreams come from the body, like from drugs or other body signals. The theory says that when we fall asleep, we shouldn’t need to dream. Dreams only happen because our sleep is interrupted by things happening inside or outside our body. These interruptions wake parts of our mind for a bit, then we fall back asleep.

Dreams are just our mind’s reaction to these interruptions, but they don’t really do anything important.

Calling dreams a physical process also means they’re not real mental activities. Scientists who think this way compare dreams to someone who doesn’t know music randomly pressing piano keys. It’s just noise, not music. So, they believe dreams can’t be understood or interpreted.

Even old thinkers didn’t agree with the idea that dreaming is just being partly awake. Burdach said in 1830 that this idea doesn’t explain waking or sleeping and only says that some parts of the mind work while others don’t, which happens all the time.

Another theory, which gets some support, was made by Robert in 1866. He noticed two things: (1) we often dream about small, unimportant stuff from the day; (2) we rarely dream about things we care about a lot. Robert said we only dream about things our mind hasn’t finished dealing with. That’s why dreams are hard to explain—they come from random, unfinished thoughts.

Robert thought dreams are a way for the brain to get rid of unfinished or useless thoughts. Without dreaming, our brain would get overloaded and messy. Dreams help clear out this mental clutter and protect our memory.

Dreams, then, help us feel better and lighten the mental load.

But don’t ask Robert how dreams actually do this clearing out. He thought this happens in the body during sleep, and dreaming just shows us what’s being cleared out. Also, not everything is thrown away. The brain also works on the day’s events, and what can’t be cleared gets turned into harmless fantasy pictures in our memory.

Robert disagreed strongly with the idea that dreams come from outside or inside signals waking us up. Instead, he believed the reason we dream comes from inside our own mind.
