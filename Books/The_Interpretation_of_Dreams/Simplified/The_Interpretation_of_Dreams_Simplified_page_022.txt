Havelock Ellis thinks that dreams are like an old world full of big feelings and unclear thoughts. Studying dreams might help us understand how our minds started to develop. J. Sully agrees and explains this idea even better. He believes dreams keep old parts of our personality alive. When we sleep, we go back to old ways of seeing and feeling things, to urges and actions that once controlled us.

A thinker named Delboeuf says that during sleep, except for sensing, all the mind’s powers like intelligence, imagination, memory, will, and morality stay the same. But they focus on imaginary and changing things. He compares the dreamer to an actor playing all kinds of roles, from crazy to wise, from heroes to villains, and from tiny to huge.

Another writer, the Marquis Hervey, argues that the mind stays very active during sleep, only cut off from outside senses. He says dreaming is like when someone lets their thoughts wander with their senses blocked, but the ideas look so real that they seem like actual sensations or memories.

Maury disagrees a bit and says the mind in sleep isn’t as balanced as when awake. Vaschide, talking about Hervey’s ideas, says that the strange parts of dreams make sense if you follow the ideas behind them. Even the weirdest dreams have clear reasons when you analyze them.

J. Starke points out that in 1799, Wolf Davidson said the strange jumps in dreams happen because the mind connects ideas in hidden ways, so it seems like the imagination jumps around when it really doesn’t.

People have very different opinions about how important dreams are. Some think dreams don’t mean much, others think they might have secrets we don’t understand yet, and some even think dreaming is more powerful than waking life. Hildebrandt groups dreams into three types, showing both extremes: sometimes dreams show amazing creativity and deep feelings, but other times they can be weak and almost less than human.

He says dreams can have deep emotions, clever ideas, and funny or serious messages. They show the world in a special way, sometimes more beautiful or terrible than real life. After waking up, we might still feel strong about a dream’s message and think real life doesn’t offer such things.

You might wonder if the negative and positive descriptions really talk about the same kind of dreams. Maybe some people only notice silly dreams, while others only see the deep and meaningful ones. If both types exist, maybe it’s pointless to try to describe dreams in one way. Maybe dreams can be anything, from the worst to the most amazing experiences.

But many dream researchers believe there must be something true about all dreams that explains these differences.

In the past, when philosophy was more popular than science, people were more open to the idea that dreams free the mind from the outside world and lift the soul to a higher place. Schubert and others thought dreams let the mind soar. Today, these ideas seem strange and are mostly supported only by spiritual or mystical thinkers.
