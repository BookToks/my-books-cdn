1. External sensory stimuli The younger Strumpell, the son of the philosopher who studied dreams and helped us understand them better, watched a patient who couldn’t feel his skin and had some parts of his senses not working. This man would fall asleep whenever the few senses he still had were blocked. When we want to sleep, we try to do the same thing Strumpell’s patient experienced.

We close our eyes, the most important way to sense the world, and try to stop other senses from noticing anything new or different. That’s how we fall asleep, even though it’s never perfect. We can’t completely block our senses or stop them from reacting. If something strong happens, it can wake us up, which shows that our mind is still connected to the outside world even while we sleep. The things we sense during sleep can easily cause dreams.

There are many things that can trigger these feelings, from normal ones that happen during sleep to random ones that can wake us up. For example, a bright light might shine in our eyes, a loud noise could be heard, or a smell might bother our nose. When we move in sleep, we might uncover parts of our body and feel cold, or change position and feel pressure or touch. A mosquito might bite us, or several things might happen at once to our senses. People have noticed many dreams where what woke them up matches something in the dream, showing the dream came from that feeling.

I will share some dreams collected by Jessen that come from random things we sense.

Every unclear noise can make us dream about similar things: thunder can turn into a battle, a rooster’s crow might sound like people screaming, and a creaky door might make us dream about burglars. If a blanket slips off, we might dream we’re naked or falling in water. If we sleep with our feet hanging off the bed, we might dream about standing on a cliff or falling. If our head ends up under the pillow, we might imagine a big rock about to crush us. Certain body feelings can cause different dreams, like feeling pain might make us dream about being hurt or attacked.

Meier once dreamed he was attacked by men who pushed him down and stuck a stick between his toes. When he woke up, he felt a straw between his toes. Another time, when his shirt was tight around his neck, he dreamed he was being hanged. Hoffbauer dreamed he fell from a high wall and found the bed frame had broken and he had actually fallen. Gregory put a hot water bottle on his feet and dreamed of climbing a hot volcano. Another man with a sore head dreamed he was scalped by Indians, and someone with a wet shirt dreamed he was dragged through a stream. A patient with gout dreamed he was being tortured. These examples show that dreams can match what’s going on with our bodies.

Experiments show that if you create certain feelings on purpose, you can make dreams that match them. For example, Giron de Buzareingues left his knee uncovered and dreamed of riding a cold mail coach at night. Another time, he left the back of his head uncovered and dreamed of a religious ceremony where people don’t wear hats. Maury tried some experiments too:

1. He got tickled with a feather on his lips and nose and dreamed of a terrible torture where a mask was stuck to his face and ripped off.

2. He heard scissors sharpening and then bells and loud noises, reminding him of a revolution.

3. He smelled Eau de Cologne and dreamed he was in Cairo in a perfume shop, then had strange adventures he couldn’t remember.

These stories show how our senses can influence what we dream about.
