A few weeks ago, I took a night trip with him. He was better, and we were going to visit his relatives in the countryside because they asked me to come. Since we had a private compartment, we left all the windows open during the night. While I stayed awake, we had a really interesting talk. I knew that his sickness was connected to bad feelings he had about his dad when he was a kid, especially related to something sexual. By connecting with him, I wanted to admit something similar to myself.

The second part of the dream was like a wild fantasy. It made me think that my two older travel companions were rude to me because I stopped them from kissing and hugging each other at night, which they wanted to do. This fantasy goes back to when I was a kid and, probably because I was curious about sex, I sneaked into my parents' bedroom but was quickly told to leave by my dad.

I think giving more examples like this isn’t needed. They all show what we learned earlier: when we judge things in dreams, it’s just repeating a past judgment from the dream’s thoughts. Most of the time, this repetition doesn’t fit well and happens in the wrong situation. Sometimes, like in the last example, it’s done so cleverly that it almost feels like the dream is thinking on its own. Now, we should look at the part of our mind that tries to put the different parts of a dream together in a clear and meaningful way. But first, we need to understand the feelings in dreams and compare them to the feelings we find in the dream-thoughts during analysis.

H. The Feelings in Dreams

Stricker made a smart point that we can’t just ignore the feelings in dreams like we often do when we wake up. For example, if I’m scared of robbers in my dream, the robbers aren’t real, but the fear is real. The same goes if I feel happy in a dream. The feelings we have in dreams are just as strong as feelings when we’re awake. Dreams want us to take them seriously because of these feelings, not just the story. When we’re awake, we usually judge feelings based on the ideas behind them. If the feelings and ideas don’t match, it confuses us.

It’s always been weird that in dreams, the ideas don’t always cause the feelings we’d expect. Strumpell said that ideas in dreams lose their emotional meaning. But sometimes, the opposite happens. A strong feeling shows up in a part of the dream that doesn’t seem to deserve it. For example, I might be in a scary or gross situation in a dream but feel no fear or disgust. Or I might be scared of something harmless or happy about something childish.

This mystery goes away once we look deeper into the dream’s hidden meaning. Then we don’t need to explain it because it disappears. Analysis shows that the ideas in dreams get changed and moved around, but the feelings stay the same. So, it makes sense that the changed ideas don’t match the feelings anymore. When analysis puts the right meaning back, everything fits again. In cases where the mind is blocking things, like in mental illnesses, feelings stay the same and help us find the right meaning. This is even clearer in mental sickness than in dreams. There, feelings are always correct in their type, but their strength can get moved around. When a patient wonders why they are so scared or upset about something small, they are wrong to think the small thing is the main problem. They defend themselves by focusing on the small thing, but it doesn’t help because they started with the wrong idea. Psychoanalysis helps by showing that the feeling is right, and it looks for the real idea behind it, which has been hidden or replaced. We just have to believe that feelings and ideas aren’t always stuck together as one, and analysis can separate them. Dream interpretation proves this really happens.

Now, I’ll give an example where analysis explains why a strong feeling seems missing from a dream idea that should have caused it.

I.

The dreamer sees three lions in a desert, and one is laughing, but she isn’t scared of them. Then she seems to run away and tries to climb a tree, but finds her cousin, the French teacher, already up there.

The analysis showed that the dream came from a sentence in the dreamer’s English homework: “The lion’s greatest adornment is his mane.”
