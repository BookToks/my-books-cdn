Sometimes, people have a series of dreams that last for weeks or months, and these dreams are connected. When one dream happens after another, we can see that one dream focuses on something that is only hinted at in the next dream, and vice versa. This means the dreams fit together and help explain each other. I have already shown examples where different dreams from the same night should be understood as a whole.

When we try to understand dreams, we often find parts that are confusing and hard to explain. These tangled parts don’t add much to what the dream means. This confusing part is like the key point of the dream, where it reaches into the unknown. The thoughts in dreams don’t stop clearly but spread out in many directions, like a web in our mind. The wish behind the dream grows from a thick part of this web, like a mushroom growing from its roots.

Now, let’s think about why we forget dreams. So far, we haven’t learned much from this. Sometimes, when we wake up, we clearly want to forget the dream, either right away or during the day. We know this happens because our mind resists the dream, just like it did during the night. So, the question is: How did the dream happen if our mind was fighting it? The answer is that the mind’s resistance is weaker at night, but it’s not gone completely. This resistance changes the dream by twisting it. Dreaming happens because the mind’s guard is relaxed while we sleep, and when we wake up and the guard is strong again, it pushes the dream away like it never happened. This shows that sleep helps dreams form by lowering the mind’s inner censorship.

We could say this is the only explanation for why we forget dreams and think more about how strong our mind is when we are awake and asleep. But for now, we’ll stop here.

Later, when we understand dreams better, we might see that dreams can form in other ways. The mind’s resistance might be avoided, not just lowered. Both avoiding and lowering resistance could happen while we sleep. But we’ll pause and come back to this idea later.

Now, let’s talk about some problems people might have with how we interpret dreams. We look at each part of the dream one by one, letting our thoughts wander freely. We hope to find the original thoughts that made the dream. Critics say this is a problem because you can connect anything with anything else if you try hard enough. They think it’s just a trick where we fool ourselves into finding meaning by following random thoughts. If we start with one part of a dream and follow our thoughts until they stop, then start again with another part, it’s natural that the thoughts get narrower and start to connect. So, the critic says we just imagine we’ve found a link between the dream parts, but really, we’re making it up. They say this method is random and can be used to explain any dream in any way.

If people say this, we can answer by showing how our dream interpretations surprise us by connecting different parts of the dream perfectly. It seems unlikely this could happen if we were just guessing. Also, the way we interpret dreams is the same as how we solve problems with hysterical symptoms, where the method is proven right because the symptoms go away after the interpretation. But we don’t mind this problem – how can we find a real purpose by following random thoughts? We might not solve the problem now, but we will stop worrying about it later.
