The word "Frauenzimmer" in German adds "Zimmer," which means room, to "Frauen," meaning woman, to show a little disrespect.

Another idea is that he is one-eyed like Odin, the father of the gods. The comforting part of the scene is: I will buy him a new bed.

Here is more to think about: Holding the urine-glass reminds me of a story about a peasant who tried on different glasses at the optician’s but still couldn’t read. This connects to the peasant and girl-catcher in the earlier part of the dream. It also relates to how peasants treat a weak-minded father in Zola’s book, La Terre. It’s sad that in his last days, my father soiled his bed like a child, so in the dream, I am his nurse.

“Thinking and experiencing are the same” fits here. It reminds me of a radical play by Oscar Panizza where God is shown as an old, weak man who has to be stopped by an archangel from yelling because His curses would come true immediately. Planning and thinking are like a criticism of my father, coming from a time when I started to think critically. The whole rebellious dream is like a protest against my father’s authority. The father is the first boss for a child, and from him, all other authorities in society come.

The words “thinking and experiencing are the same” also explain why the male urinal (pee-glass) appears in the dream. People in Vienna know about Gschnas, a fun custom where people make fancy things out of silly objects, like armor from kitchen stuff and straw. I learned that people with hysteria do something similar: they mix real events with made-up, scary stories from small, harmless things. Their symptoms come from these made-up stories, not the real events. This helped me understand many things and made me happy. The “male urine-glass” in the dream connects to this because at the last Gschnas, there was a poison cup made from a men’s urinal like those used in hospitals.

Dreams have many layers of meaning, which makes understanding them hard but very interesting.

If you forget that dreams can have many layers, you might get confused and say wrong things about what dreams mean. But so far, this hasn’t been studied enough. Only Otto Rank has carefully studied how bathroom-related dreams have different layers of meaning.

I suggest everyone read the detailed records of dreams made during experiments by Mourly Vold. This shows how little the experiment conditions explain what the dream is about and how little these experiments help us understand dreams.

The two sources I know about this dream don’t fully agree on what happens in it. Rank has shown that some dreams that wake people up because of body needs (like needing to pee) show the fight between wanting to sleep and needing to go to the bathroom, and how this affects the dream.

The idea that you can’t interpret a dream without the dreamer’s thoughts about it isn’t always true. Sometimes, when a dream uses symbols, we can interpret it without those thoughts by using a second method.

In the fairy tale, a child also appears, suddenly shouting, “But he hasn’t anything on at all!”

Ferenczi recorded dreams of naked women that linked to a child’s joy in showing off, but these dreams are different in many ways from usual nakedness dreams. 

The whole family showing up in a dream means something important for obvious reasons.

Another way to look at this dream: Spitting on the stairs reminds me of “spuken,” which means ghosts haunting in German (like “spook” in English). This led me to think about “esprit d’escalier,” which means being too slow to think of a clever reply. I have to admit, I’m sometimes slow to respond quickly. But was the nurse in the dream bad at quick comebacks?
