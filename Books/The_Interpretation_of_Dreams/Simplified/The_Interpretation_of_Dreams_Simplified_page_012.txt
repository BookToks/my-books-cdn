It is a bright winter day, and the streets are covered in deep snow. I promised to go on a sleigh ride, but I have to wait for a while before I am told that the sleigh is at the door. Now I am getting ready to get into the sleigh. I put on my warm clothes, the foot-warmer is placed inside, and finally, I take my seat. But my trip is still delayed. At last, the reins are pulled, the horses start moving, and the sleigh bells ring loudly, breaking the peaceful feeling of my dream. Then I realize it’s just the sound of my alarm clock.

Here’s another example. I see the kitchen maid walking down the hall to the dining room, carrying a big stack of plates. It looks like she might drop them, so I shout, “Be careful, you’ll drop them all!” She tells me she’s used to carrying so many plates. I keep watching nervously, and just as she reaches the doorway, the plates fall and smash all over the floor. But soon I notice that the noise isn’t just a crash; it’s a ringing sound. That’s when I realize the alarm clock has done its job again.

The reason why our dreaming mind gets confused by real sounds is explained by Strumpell and Wundt. They say that when a sound or feeling tries to wake us up, our mind reacts in a mixed-up way. If the signal is strong, clear, and lasts long enough, we can understand it correctly based on past experiences. But if it’s weak or quick, our mind mistakes what it is and creates an illusion instead.

For example, if you’re walking in an open field and see a faraway shape, you might first think it’s a horse. Look closer, and it might turn out to be a resting cow. Finally, you might see it’s actually a group of people sitting on the ground. The sounds and feelings our mind gets while we sleep are similar — they’re unclear and cause illusions by mixing with memories. Which memories pop up depends on chance, as Strumpell says.

We can choose to believe that the way dreams form can’t really be explained any further, or we can think that real sounds and sensations from outside only play a small part in shaping dreams. Other things might decide which memories show up in our dreams.

When looking at Maury’s experiments with dreams, it seems like the real sounds he used only explain one small part of the dream. Most of the dream’s details don’t seem to come from that one sound. Sometimes, real sounds get turned into very strange dream images. For example, M. Simon dreamed of huge people eating loudly. When he woke up, he realized the sound was just a horse’s hooves outside his window. Maybe the sound reminded him of the giants in Gulliver’s Travels, but why his mind picked that particular story is hard to explain.

2. Internal (subjective) sensory stimuli

Even though some people doubt it, we have to admit that real sounds and feelings from outside do help cause dreams. But since these don’t explain all dreams, we should also think about internal or personal sensations as sources for dreams.

It’s not clear who first thought of this, but many recent ideas about dreams include these internal sensations. Wundt says that some of the strange sights and sounds we see or hear in dreams come from our own eyes and ears when we’re awake. For example, sometimes when it’s dark, we see tiny spots of light or hear buzzing sounds. These can turn into strange images in dreams, like lots of birds, butterflies, or colorful beads. Because these tiny lights move around, our mind imagines them as moving animals or objects.

Internal sensations have an advantage because they don’t depend on things happening outside us. They are always there to be used in dreams when needed. But unlike real outside sounds, it’s hard to prove that these internal sensations really cause dreams.

The best proof for internal sensations causing dreams comes from hypnogogic hallucinations — strange and vivid pictures that people often see as they fall asleep. Johann Muller called them “fantastic visual images.” They can stay even after you open your eyes. Maury, who often experienced these, studied them carefully and said they are very similar or the same as dream images.
