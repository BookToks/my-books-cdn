A traveler’s luggage can symbolize the burden of sin someone feels. But often, the luggage actually stands for a person’s private parts.

Numbers in dreams often have set meanings, according to Stekel, but these meanings aren’t always proven or true for everyone. Still, the number three often symbolizes male private parts. Stekel also said that many symbols can represent both male and female genitals, depending on the imagination. However, this isn’t always true. Some symbols mainly represent one sex, and some only mean male or female parts. For example, long, stiff objects or weapons don’t usually stand for female genitals, and hollow objects like boxes don’t usually stand for male genitals.

Dreams tend to use sexual symbols for both sexes because, as kids, we don’t really understand the difference between male and female genitals. Sometimes, dreams even switch the sexes, showing a male organ as female or the other way around. This can show a wish, like a woman wanting to be a man.

Private parts can also be shown in dreams as other body parts. For example, a male organ might be shown as a hand or foot, and female parts might be shown as a mouth, ear, or even an eye. Body fluids like mucus, tears, urine, and semen can also be mixed up in dreams.

Stekel’s ideas are mostly correct, but some critics have pointed out limits, especially about confusing important fluids like semen with less important ones.

These ideas might seem incomplete, but they can help others study dream symbols more carefully. I have written more about this in my book about psychoanalysis. Now, I will give some examples to show why understanding symbols is important for interpreting dreams. But, I also warn not to focus only on symbols and forget to listen to what the dreamer says. Both ways are important, but listening to the dreamer gives the final meaning.

1. A hat can symbolize a man or male genitals. For example, a young woman who was afraid to go outside dreamed she was walking in summer wearing a strange straw hat. The middle part of the hat was bent up, but the sides hung down unevenly. She felt happy and confident and thought, “You can’t do anything to me,” when she passed some young officers.

She didn’t connect the hat to anything, so I told her the hat actually stood for a man’s private parts, with the raised middle and hanging sides. It might seem weird, but there’s a saying in German meaning “to get married” that talks about getting under a hat. I didn’t explain the uneven sides yet, but I told her that if she had a husband with “such nice genitals,” she wouldn’t be afraid of the officers because she wouldn’t need anything from them. Her fear was really about temptation, which kept her from going out alone.

After I said this, she acted strangely. She took back part of her description and didn’t want to admit the sides hung unevenly. But I was sure she said it, so I insisted. After a moment, she asked if it was normal for one of a man’s testicles to hang lower than the other. That explained the hat’s uneven sides, and she agreed with my interpretation.

I already knew from other experiences that a hat can stand for private parts, and sometimes even female genitals.

2. In dreams, a “little one” can mean private parts, and being run over can symbolize sexual intercourse.
