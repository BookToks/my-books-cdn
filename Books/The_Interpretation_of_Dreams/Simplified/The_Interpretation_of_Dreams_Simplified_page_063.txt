From what I’ve explained, you can understand that I believe there are no dreams that are just random or meaningless. So, there are no completely innocent dreams. I strongly believe this, except maybe for children’s dreams or very short dreams caused by things happening at night. Besides these, whatever you dream about is either clearly important to your mind or it’s mixed up and only makes sense after careful thinking. Dreams don’t waste time on small, unimportant stuff. If a dream seems simple and innocent, it usually isn’t once you figure it out. I call this the “mark of the beast” in dreams. Since some people might disagree, I’ll show you some examples of these “innocent” dreams to explain how they are actually meaningful.

I.

A smart and quiet young woman, who usually keeps to herself, tells me this dream: “I got to the market too late and couldn’t buy anything from the butcher or the vegetable seller.” At first, it sounds like a simple dream, but it didn’t feel like a real one, so I asked her to tell me more. She said she went to the market with her cook, who carried the basket. The butcher told her, after she asked for something, “That is no longer to be had,” and tried to offer her something else, saying, “That’s good too.” She said no and went to the vegetable seller. The woman there tried to sell her a weird black vegetable tied in bunches, but she said, “I don’t know that, I won’t take it.” The dream connects easily to what happened the day before. She really went to the market late and couldn’t buy anything because the meat shop was closed. But wait, “meat shop closed” might mean something else related to a messy or careless way of dressing. She didn’t say this, but let’s look deeper at the dream’s details.

When something is said out loud in a dream, it usually comes from things people said when awake, but changed a little and taken out of the original context. So, where does the butcher’s phrase, “That is no longer to be had,” come from? It comes from me. A few days earlier, I explained to her that old childhood experiences can’t be brought back exactly but appear as feelings or dreams now. So, I’m the butcher in the dream, and she’s refusing to accept those old feelings coming back to her.

What about her words, “I don’t know that, I won’t take it”? We need to break this down. She hadn’t said this to her cook, with whom she argued the day before, but she had told him, “Behave yourself decently.” The dream uses the less important sentence but leaves out the serious one. The serious one fits better with the rest of the dream. It’s like telling someone making rude moves to behave properly—and maybe that person had been careless, like leaving their "meat shop" open. The weird vegetable tied in bundles and black is probably a mix of asparagus and black radish in the dream. Both can symbolize sexual things, which fits with the idea behind the “meat shop is closed” story. We don’t need to explain the full meaning now, but it’s clear the dream is full of meaning and not innocent at all.

II.

Here’s another simple dream from the same woman, which connects to the first one. Her husband asks, “Shouldn’t we get the piano tuned?” She answers, “It’s not worth it; the hammers need fixing too.” This comes from something that really happened the day before. Her husband asked this, and she gave that answer. But why dream about it? She thinks the piano is an old, gross thing with a bad sound; it belonged to her husband before they married. The key to understanding the dream is the phrase, “It’s not worth it.” It’s from a visit she made to a female friend the day before. The friend was asked to take off her coat but said, “Thanks, it’s not worth it; I have to leave soon.” I remember that during our talk, she suddenly grabbed her coat because a button was loose, like she wanted to say, “Don’t look too closely; it’s not worth it.” So, the piano (a box) in the dream becomes her chest, and the dream takes us back to when she was growing out of childhood and started to feel unhappy with her body. It also relates to even earlier times, thinking about the bad sound and how small parts of the female body can stand for bigger ones in dreams and hints.
