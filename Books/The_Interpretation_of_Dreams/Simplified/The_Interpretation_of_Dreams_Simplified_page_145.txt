If I’m talking to someone I have to be polite to, even if I want to treat them like an enemy, it’s more important to hide how I really feel than to change what I say. If I say nice things but show anger or hate with my face or body, it feels almost the same as if I was openly rude. So, the biggest rule is to hide my true feelings. If I’m good at pretending, I can even act the opposite of how I feel—smile when I want to be mad, or act like I care when I want to hurt.

We’ve already seen a good example of this in a dream I had about my uncle’s beard. In the dream, I felt a lot of love for my friend R, even though my thoughts in the dream called him stupid. This switch in feelings helped us prove there’s something called censorship in dreams. Usually, the dream doesn’t make up new feelings but finds ones that were already there and makes them stronger until they take over the dream. In my dream about my uncle, the loving feeling probably started from when I was a little kid, since my early memories about my uncle shaped how I feel about friends and enemies.

Another good example of this feeling switch is a dream told by Ferenczi. An old man was woken up at night by his wife because he was laughing loudly while sleeping. The man said his dream was about a friend coming into his room, and he tried to turn on the light but couldn’t. His wife tried to help but failed too, then got embarrassed and went back to bed. The man thought it was so funny he laughed a lot. His wife asked why he was laughing, but he just kept laughing until he woke up. The next day, he felt very sad and had a headache because he thought the laughter shook him up too much.

But if we look deeper, the dream wasn’t really funny. The friend in the dream actually symbolized death, which the man had been thinking about the day before. The man was old and sick, so the idea of death scared him and made him want to cry, but instead, the dream changed the crying into laughter. The light he couldn’t turn on meant life slipping away. It might also be linked to him failing to have sex recently, where even his wife couldn’t help. The dream turned these sad feelings into a funny scene, changing tears into laughter.

There’s a type of dream that seems fake or tricky, which really tests the idea that dreams show what we wish for. My attention was drawn to these when Dr. M. Hilferding shared a dream by Rosegger with the Psychoanalytic Society in Vienna. Rosegger wrote about this in his story “Fremd gemacht.” He said he usually slept well but sometimes couldn’t rest for many nights. Besides being a student and writer, he felt like he was living a dull life like a tailor’s apprentice he couldn’t escape.

He didn’t think much about his past during the day. He was a lively young guy who didn’t care about dreams. But later, when he started thinking more, he noticed that whenever he dreamed, he was always a tailor’s apprentice working for free. In the dream, he knew he didn’t belong there because he had a better life, but since he was on vacation or away, he just helped the master tailor. He often felt uncomfortable and regretted wasting time. If his work wasn’t good, the master would scold him. He never got paid. Sometimes, he wanted to quit and leave, and once he did, but the master ignored it, and next time he was back sewing beside him.

He felt happy waking up from those tiring dreams and decided he would fight the dream if it came again by telling himself it was just a dream and he wanted to sleep. But the next night, there he was again in the tailor’s shop.

This kept happening for years. Once, when working at a farmer’s house where he started his apprenticeship, the master was really mad at his work and asked where his mind was. The dreamer thought the best thing was to explain he was only helping as a favor and then leave.
