So far, we have talked about dreams and how they are connected to wishes. We looked at how these wishes come from the unconscious mind and relate to things we think about during the day. These daytime thoughts can be wishes, feelings, or just things we recently saw or experienced. This shows that what we do when we're awake affects the way our dreams form. Sometimes, dreams even help solve problems we couldn't figure out while awake. We just need a good example to understand how hidden or childhood wishes help with this. But we still don’t know why the unconscious mind only gives us dreams that fulfill wishes. To answer this, we need to understand what wishing really is, using the idea of the psychic apparatus.

We believe this psychic apparatus got better over a long time through evolution. Let’s imagine what it was like a long time ago when it was less developed. At first, it tried to avoid getting too many signals from the outside by quickly getting rid of them through simple reflexes, like automatic reactions. But life’s challenges, especially basic needs like hunger, made it change. When a baby is hungry, it cries or struggles, but this doesn’t fix the problem. The feeling of hunger stays until something happens to satisfy it. When the baby finally gets food, it remembers that food is linked to feeling better. So next time the baby is hungry, it tries to bring back the memory of food to feel better again. This desire to bring back the memory is what we call a wish. When the memory comes back, that’s the wish being fulfilled. At first, this wish might even feel like a real image in the mind, almost like a hallucination. The first mental activity tries to repeat the feeling of being satisfied.

But this simple way of wishing had to change because it didn’t work well in real life. Just imagining the wish didn’t actually satisfy the need, so the hunger stayed. To make the wish feel real, the mind would have to keep the image going all the time, which can happen in some mental illnesses. To handle this better, the mind learned to stop the wish from going all the way to a full hallucination and instead use the memory as a hint to find the real thing outside in the world. This stopping and redirecting is done by a second system in the mind that controls our actions and helps us remember how to get what we want. But this way is more complicated and slower. Thinking is just a way to replace the full hallucination of a wish. That’s why dreams are wish-fulfillments—they follow the short path straight to the wish without worrying about reality. Dreams keep alive the old, simple way the mind worked when it was young and weak. It’s like how kids still play with old toys adults don’t use anymore. Dreaming is a piece of our childhood mind.

In some mental illnesses, the mind goes back to these old ways that normally don’t work when we’re awake. The hidden wishes from the unconscious mind try hard to come out during the day too. Things like ‘transference’ and psychoses show that these wishes want to break through into our conscious mind and actions. So, between the unconscious and the part of the mind we’re aware of, there is a kind of ‘guardian’ that protects our mental health. But why does this guardian let these wishes come out at night in dreams? It’s not careless. When the guardian rests at night, it still keeps the door to our body’s movements closed. So, even if hidden wishes appear in dreams, they can’t make us do anything in real life. Sleep keeps us safe.

Things get worse when this guardian is weak or the unconscious wishes get too strong during the day. Then the unconscious wishes take over, controlling what we say and do or causing hallucinations. This is when someone has psychosis.

Now, we are ready to keep building our understanding of how the mind works, after adding the two parts we talked about: the unconscious and the preconscious.
