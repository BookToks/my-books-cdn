Some people dream about flying because they really wish they could be free, like a little bird. Others dream about being angels at night because no one has ever called them angels during the day. Flying is connected to the idea of a bird, so for many guys, flying dreams often have a strong sexual meaning. It’s not surprising when some dreamers feel proud of being able to fly in their dreams. A doctor named Paul Federn from Vienna had an interesting idea that many flying dreams are actually about erections, since erections seem to go against gravity, kind of like flying.

Even a careful researcher like Mourly Vold, who usually doesn’t like interpreting dreams, agrees that flying and hovering dreams have a sexual side. He says the feeling of the body shaking during these dreams and their link to erections shows the erotic part is very important. On the other hand, dreams about falling often make people feel anxious. For women, these dreams are usually easy to understand because falling often means giving in to sexual temptation. Falling dreams also come from childhood memories—kids fall sometimes and get comforted by adults, which is why falling feels familiar.

People who often dream about swimming and enjoying it usually were bed-wetters as kids. These dreams let them feel the pleasure they had to give up long ago. We will see soon how swimming dreams can mean different things.

Dreams about fire connect to the rule that kids shouldn’t play with fire, so they don’t wet the bed. These dreams also relate to childhood bed-wetting. In my study of hysteria, I explained a fire dream fully and showed how it connects to the dreamer’s childhood and later feelings. There are many common dreams that lots of people have, like walking through narrow alleys or rooms, dreams about burglars, being chased by wild animals, or being threatened with weapons. These last two types often happen to anxious people. Studying these common dreams more closely would be useful. Instead, I’ll share two points that apply to many dreams, not just common ones.

The more someone studies dreams, the more they realize that most adult dreams are about sex and show sexual wishes. Only people who deeply analyze dreams, going past the obvious story, can see this. Just writing down the dream as it is doesn’t help. It’s not surprising, though, because sexual feelings get pushed down a lot from childhood. Sexual desires leave many unconscious wishes that come out in dreams. This is very important in understanding dreams, but we shouldn’t think sex is the only thing dreams are about. Some dreams show bisexual feelings, meaning they include sexual wishes that don’t match the dreamer’s usual sexuality. But saying all dreams are bisexual, like some experts claim, is a wild guess without proof. Also, some people say every dream is about death or that dreams always move from feminine to masculine ideas. I think these ideas go too far.

The idea that every dream must be about sex is not true and doesn’t match my work on dreams. In fact, many innocent dreams hide simple sexual wishes, and many dreams that seem normal actually come from secret sexual feelings. For example, who would have guessed a certain dream had a sexual meaning before it was explained?
