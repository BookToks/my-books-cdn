One time, I got a deep look into the hidden thoughts of a young man who had a serious mental problem that made life nearly impossible for him. He was so scared he might kill someone that he wouldn’t even go outside. He spent his days making up stories to prove he wasn’t involved if any murders happened in the city. It’s important to know this guy was very moral and educated.

His therapy showed that his scary fear came from angry feelings he had toward his strict dad. He was surprised to find out he had these feelings since he was seven years old, but they actually started even earlier when he was a kid. After his dad got sick and died when he was 31, these fears got worse and started showing up as a fear of strangers. Because he thought anyone who could want to hurt their own dad might hurt others too, he locked himself in his room.

From what I’ve seen, parents are a big part of the early feelings that cause mental problems later. Kids often fall in love with one parent and hate the other. These feelings are common and shape future mental struggles. But I don’t think people with these problems are totally different from normal people. It’s more likely that they just show these feelings in a stronger way than most kids do. Old stories support this idea because they show these feelings have always been part of human life.

I’m talking about the story of King Oedipus, from the play Oedipus Rex by Sophocles. Oedipus was the son of King Laius and Queen Jocasta. When he was a baby, his dad tried to get rid of him because an oracle said the son would kill him. But Oedipus was saved and grew up in another kingdom. Later, he found out about the curse and was told to stay away from his home to avoid killing his dad and marrying his mom. On the way away, he accidentally killed his dad in a fight. Then he went to Thebes, solved a tricky riddle, became king, and married Jocasta, not knowing she was his real mom. He lived happily for a while and had kids with her until a plague hit the city.

The people asked the oracle how to stop the plague. The answer was to find and banish the man who killed Laius. But no one knew where he was.

The play is about slowly discovering that Oedipus himself killed Laius and that Jocasta was his mother. Shocked by this, Oedipus blinds himself and leaves the city. The prophecy came true.

Oedipus Rex is a tragedy about fate. It shows the fight between the gods’ power and humans’ helplessness. The lesson is to accept fate and realize we can’t control everything. Modern writers have tried to make similar stories, but people don’t feel the same emotions from them.

If Oedipus Rex still affects people today like it did the ancient Greeks, it’s because the story connects with something inside us. We feel the power of fate in Oedipus because the story’s feelings come from real human emotions, not just made-up plot.

There’s a part in the story that explains why it moves us: Oedipus’s fate could be ours. Before we were born, the same curse was on us too. Maybe all kids first feel attracted to their mom and jealous or angry at their dad. Our dreams show these feelings. Oedipus, who killed his dad and married his mom, is like a wish from childhood coming true. But most of us are lucky because we learned to stop these feelings and forget our jealousy.

We feel uncomfortable because the story makes us aware of our own hidden feelings, even though we try to push them away. When the story reveals Oedipus’s guilt, it forces us to face parts of ourselves we hide.

At the end, the chorus says:  
“Look at Oedipus,  
Who solved the great riddle and was king,  
Praised and envied by all;  
See how terrible his fall was!”
