I will stop the analysis of this dreamer for a moment to share a short, simple dream from a young man. He dreamed that he was putting on his heavy winter coat again, and this felt terrible. The reason for this dream was the sudden cold weather.

But if we look closer, the two parts of the dream don’t really match up. Why would wearing a thick coat in cold weather be so bad? The first thought that comes up is that a lady told him the day before that her last child was born because a condom broke. Now he thinks: a thin condom is risky, a thick one is bad. The condom is like a "pullover," something that goes over something else, just like a light coat in German. An experience like that would really be scary for an unmarried guy.

Now, let’s go back to our other innocent dreamer.

She puts a candle into a candle holder, but the candle is broken and won’t stand up. At school, the girls say she’s clumsy, but she says it’s not her fault.

There is a real reason for this dream; the day before she had actually put a candle in a holder, but that one was not broken.

The candle here is a symbol. It stands for male sexual power. Since the candle is broken and can’t stand, it means the man is not able to perform sexually. She says it’s not her fault. But does this young woman, who was raised carefully and knows nothing about sex, really understand this meaning? She actually learned about it by chance. Once, while paddling a canoe, a boat with students passed by, and they were singing loudly about “the Queen of Sweden behind closed shutters, with the candles of Apollo…” She didn’t hear or understand the last word. Her husband explained it to her. These words got mixed up in her dream with a memory of a time she clumsily did a task at school because of closed shutters. The link between masturbation and impotence is clear here. Apollo in the dream connects it with an earlier dream about the virgin Pallas. So, this dream is not as innocent as it seems.

To show that it’s not always easy to guess what a dream means about the dreamer’s real life, I’ll tell another dream from the same girl. She said, “I dreamed I was doing something I actually did during the day—I filled a small box with so many books that I had trouble closing it.” The dream was exactly like what really happened. She points out that the dream matched real life.

These comments about the dream belong to the hidden meaning of the dream, as later examples will prove. We are told the dream shows something that really happened during the day. Explaining this dream fully would take too long, but the idea is about a small box (like in chapter IV, the dream of the dead child in a box) that is so full nothing else can fit inside.

In all these “innocent” dreams, sex plays a big part in what the mind hides or censors. This is very important and we will talk about it more later.

B. Childhood Experiences as the Source of Dreams

The third special thing about dreams is that memories from childhood can appear in dreams, even if we don’t remember them when awake. It’s hard to say how often this happens because after waking, we don’t always recognize where parts of the dream came from. To prove these are childhood memories, we need clear evidence, which rarely happens.

There is a story told by A. Maury that is very convincing. A man decided to visit his hometown after 20 years away. The night before he left, he dreamed he was in a place he didn’t know and met a strange man to talk with. Later, when he returned, he found out that the place really existed near his home, and the man in the dream was a friend of his dead father who still lived there.

This proves that as a child, he had seen both the place and the man. The dream also shows his impatience, like the dream of a girl carrying a concert ticket, or a child whose dad promised a trip.

The reasons why these childhood memories come back in dreams can’t be found without careful study.

A colleague of mine, who said his dreams were usually clear, once told me he dreamed his old tutor was in bed with his nurse, who had stayed with the family until he was eleven. The exact place of this scene was clear even in the dream.
