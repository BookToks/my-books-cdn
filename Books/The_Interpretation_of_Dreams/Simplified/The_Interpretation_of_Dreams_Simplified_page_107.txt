In dreams, parts of the human body are often treated like objects. For example, in one dream recorded by Ferenczi, there was a strange mix of a doctor and a horse, and this mix wore a nightshirt. The nightshirt reminded the dreamer of her father from when she was a child. All three parts had something to do with her curiosity about sex. When she was little, her nurse often took her to see horses, where she could explore this curiosity freely.

I once said that dreams can’t show opposites or contradictions. Now, I have to admit I was wrong. Sometimes dreams do show contrast by swapping or mixing things. We’ve seen many examples of this. Other times, dreams show opposites in a clever way: they don’t directly show the opposite but twist part of the dream later on. It’s easier to understand with examples.

In the “Up and Down” dream, climbing is hard at first and easy later, but in the original story, it’s the other way around. Also, the idea of “above” and “below” gets switched when talking about the dreamer’s brother. This shows a kind of opposite or reversal between parts of the dream. In another dream about Goethe attacking someone, the dream flips the real situation, making it seem reversed. The dream wants to say that if you don’t get a book, it’s your problem, not the author’s.

These reversals also connect to the idea of “turning your back on someone.” Dreams that come from hidden feelings, especially about same-sex attraction, often use these reversals.

Inversion, or flipping things to their opposite, is one of the most common ways dreams work. It helps wishes come true even if the dreamer’s thoughts are against them. Sometimes the ego wishes “If only it were the other way!” Inversion also helps hide the real meaning of dreams, making them confusing at first. If a dream is hard to understand, trying to flip parts of it can help make sense of it.

Besides flipping ideas, dreams also play with time. They might show the ending of a story first, then show what led up to it later. If you don’t know this trick, it’s really hard to figure out what a dream means. Sometimes, you have to flip many parts of a dream to get its meaning.

For example, a young patient with obsessive thoughts dreamed about his father scolding him for coming home late. But really, the dream meant the patient was angry at his father because his father always came home too early. The patient wished his father wouldn’t come home at all, which meant he secretly wished his father was dead. When he was little, the patient was punished by being told, “Wait until your father comes home!” for bad behavior.

To understand dreams better, it helps to start with the dream itself and ask what parts of the dream mean compared to the dreamer’s thoughts. One big thing to notice is how clear or blurry parts of the dream are. Some dream images are super sharp, even sharper than real life, while others are fuzzy or hard to see. We usually feel blurry dream images last a short time, while clear ones seem to stay longer. We need to think about why some parts of dreams are clear and others are not.
