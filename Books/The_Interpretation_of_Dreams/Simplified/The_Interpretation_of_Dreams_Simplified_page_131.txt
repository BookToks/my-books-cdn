When I was fourteen, I acted out a scene between Brutus and Caesar from Schiller's poem for a group of kids. My nephew helped me; he was a year older and had come from England. He felt like a ghost because he reminded me of my old childhood friend. Until I was three, we were always together. We loved and fought with each other, and this childhood relationship shaped how I later felt about people my age.

My nephew John has changed a lot since then, bringing back different parts of a character I can’t forget. Sometimes he treated me badly, and I stood up to him. Later, I was told about a time when my dad, John’s grandfather, asked me, "Why did you hit John?" I replied, "I hit him because he hit me." This little scene probably explains why in my dreams, violence gets mixed up with strange words, like "wichsen," which means to polish but also to hit. My dislike for my friend P, who was better than me and could have been like a new version of John, likely comes from my confusing past with John. I will talk more about this dream later.

Now, about strange dreams. We’ve seen that dreams often don’t make sense, which some people use to say dreams are just random and meaningless.

I’ll start with some dreams that seem strange at first but make sense when studied closely. These dreams are about the dreamer’s dead father.

1. A patient dreamed about his father, who died six years earlier in a bad train accident. In the dream, the father lies on a bed with a wound above his left eyebrow. The dreamer is surprised because he knows his father is already dead. The father’s eyes look very clear.

Usually, people say this dream happens because the dreamer forgot his father was dead while dreaming but remembered during the dream. But that’s not really necessary.

The dreamer had asked a sculptor to make a statue of his father and had seen it two days before the dream. The dream seems to be about the statue, which had a flaw. The sculptor never met the father and worked only from photos. The day before the dream, the dreamer sent an old family servant to check the statue, and he agreed it looked too narrow between the temples.

The father used to press his temples with his hands when stressed, as if his head was too big. When the dreamer was four, a pistol went off by accident, and his father’s eyes got blackened (but in the dream, the eyes are clear). When the father was sad, he had a deep wrinkle on his forehead, like the wound in the dream.

In the dream, the wrinkle turns into a wound, which connects to another memory. The dreamer took a photo of his little daughter, but the photo plate cracked across her forehead. He felt scared because the day before his mother died, her photo negative was also cracked.

So, the weirdness in the dream happens because the dream mixes up the statue or photo with the real person. We often say, "That looks just like your dad," without meaning the real person. This kind of dream confusion might even be wanted.

2. Here’s another dream of my own (my father died in 1896): After his death, my father became important in Magyar politics, bringing people together. In my dream, I see a blurry picture of men like in a parliament. One man is standing on chairs, and others are around him.
