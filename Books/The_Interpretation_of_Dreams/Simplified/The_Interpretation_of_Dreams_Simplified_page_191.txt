We explained how two systems relate to each other and to consciousness by saying that the system called Pcs acts like a screen between the system Ucs and consciousness. The Pcs system not only blocks access to consciousness but also controls voluntary movement and manages the flow of a kind of energy, part of which we know as attention. We should avoid confusing the ideas of the super-conscious and the subconscious because that mix-up makes it seem like what is psychic is the same as what is conscious.

So, what role does consciousness have now, since it used to seem so powerful and important?

Its role is simply to be a kind of sense organ for noticing psychic qualities. The basic idea is that conscious perception belongs to a special system called Cs. This system works like the perception system P, meaning it can be excited by qualities but can’t remember changes—it has no memory. The psychic system that, with the P system, faces the outside world is itself the outside world for the Cs system’s sense organ. This makes sense for the system’s purpose. We see again that the system works in steps. The Cs sense organ gets signals from two places: first from the P system, where the signals are changed so they become conscious; and second from inside the system itself, where feelings of pleasure and pain are sensed once they reach consciousness after some changes.

Philosophers noticed that complicated thoughts can happen without consciousness and found it hard to say what consciousness actually does. It seemed like consciousness just shows what’s already done inside the mind. But if we compare the Cs system to perception systems, it helps us understand better. When we perceive through our senses, we focus attention on where the sensory signals spread. The P system’s quality signals help control how energy moves in the psychic system. We think consciousness does the same. By noticing new qualities, consciousness helps guide and spread the energy in the mind. Through feelings of pleasure and pain, it influences how energy moves inside the mind, which mostly works without us knowing, just by shifting amounts of energy. Pain probably controls these energy shifts automatically, but consciousness might add a second, more subtle control that can even go against pain’s rule. This makes the system work better, sometimes even paying attention to things that cause pain. Neuro-psychology shows that these controls from sensing qualities are important. The basic pain rule, which limits how the mind works, can be broken by these sensory controls, which are also automatic. We see that repression, which starts as helpful but later causes problems, affects memories more easily than perceptions because memories don’t get extra energy from the sense organs. An idea might not become conscious because it’s repressed, but it can also be repressed later because it was kept out of awareness before. These clues help us in therapy to undo repressions.

The importance of extra energy, controlled by the Cs sense organs, is shown clearly by how it creates new qualities and new controls, which is what makes humans different from animals. Mental processes themselves don’t have qualities except for pleasure and pain feelings, which must be kept small so they don’t disturb thinking. To give thoughts qualities, humans connect them with verbal memories. These memories have qualities that draw attention, and attention then gives thoughts new energy.

Only when we look closely at hysterical mental processes do we see how complex consciousness really is. It seems that moving from the preconscious to conscious energy involves a kind of censorship, like the one between Ucs and Pcs. This censorship works only when energy reaches a certain level, so weak thoughts get through more easily. All cases where things are kept out of consciousness or get in only partially are part of psychoneurotic problems. They show how closely censorship and consciousness are connected. I’ll end these ideas by sharing two examples.

Once, during a consultation, a smart-looking girl came in who seemed natural and simple. She was dressed strangely—one stocking was falling down and two buttons on her blouse were undone. She complained of pain in one leg and showed her calf without being asked. But her main complaint was this: she felt like something was sticking into her body, moving back and forth and shaking her all over. Sometimes this made her whole body stiff. When my colleague heard this, he looked at me—he knew right away what was wrong. It was strange that the girl’s mother didn’t notice, even though she must have been in the same situation many times. As for the girl, she didn’t understand what she was saying or she never would have said it out loud.
