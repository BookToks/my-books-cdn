Havelock Ellis says that the strong feelings and big questions we think about when we’re awake don’t usually show up right away in our dreams. Instead, dreams often bring back small, unimportant things from daily life that we’ve mostly forgotten. Our mind is very active when we’re awake, but those parts of the brain rest deeply when we sleep.

Because of this, Binz wonders why our dreams don’t always focus on the important things we thought about during the day. Instead, dreams often bring up random, forgotten memories from long ago. This makes it hard to see how dreams connect to what we experience while awake. For example, Miss Whiton Calkins found that 11% of her and her friend’s dreams didn’t seem related to their waking life at all. Hildebrandt believed that if we spent enough time tracing all dream images back, we could explain them all, but it would be a boring and difficult task because dreams pull from many forgotten memories. Still, exploring this could help us better understand dreams.

How memory works in dreams is very important for any theory about memory. It shows us that nothing we’ve ever experienced is truly lost. Even the smallest impression leaves a lasting trace in our minds, and it can come back in dreams. This amazing power of memory makes it hard to accept some dream theories that say dreams are confusing because we forget parts of our daily experiences.

Some people might think dreaming is just remembering, and that dreams happen because our mind keeps replaying memories all night. This idea fits with the idea that dreams during deep sleep are from long ago, while dreams near morning are about recent events. But this idea doesn’t work well because dreams don’t just repeat experiences exactly. Instead, dreams show bits and pieces, often in new or changed ways. However, there are rare exceptions where a dream repeats an event exactly, like a close call while driving or a recent experience, or even a childhood memory.

Now, about what causes dreams: there’s a popular saying, "Dreams come from the stomach," which means dreams happen because something disturbs our sleep. We wouldn’t dream if nothing disturbed us, and the dream is our mind’s reaction to that disturbance.

A lot of research has been done to figure out what excites dreams. Ancient people thought dreams were messages from gods or spirits, so they didn’t look for causes. But science asks if dreams are caused by one thing or many things, and whether these causes are physical or mental.

Most experts agree that dreams can be caused by many things that disturb sleep, including physical or mental reasons. They don’t all agree on which cause is the most important.

When all dream causes are listed, they usually fall into four groups: (1) outside sensory things, like sounds or sights; (2) inside sensory things, like feelings inside the body; (3) physical body causes; and (4) purely mental or psychological reasons.
