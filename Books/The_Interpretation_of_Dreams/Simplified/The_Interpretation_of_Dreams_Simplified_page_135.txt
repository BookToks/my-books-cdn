But it’s this one dream-thought that really needs to be explained. Four or five years—that’s exactly how long I had the support of the colleague I mentioned at the start. It’s also how long I made my fiancée wait before we got married. And by coincidence, which the dream-thoughts love to use, it’s also how long I’ve had my oldest patient waiting for a full cure. The dream-thoughts ask, “What’s five years? That’s nothing to me. It’s no big deal. I have plenty of time ahead, and just like you wouldn’t believe, something finally came true, so I’ll get this done too.” 

Also, the number 51 shows up a lot in the dream, but in a different way. It’s the age where people seem to be at special risk. I’ve seen colleagues die suddenly at that age, including one who had just been given a professorship he’d waited a long time for.

Another strange dream plays with numbers. An acquaintance of mine, Herr M, got attacked in an essay by none other than Goethe, and we all think it was really harsh and unfair. Herr M was crushed by this attack and complained about it bitterly at a dinner party, but he still respected Goethe. I tried to figure out the timing because it didn't seem to make sense. Goethe died in 1832, so the attack must have happened before that, when M was young—maybe 18 years old. But I wasn’t sure what year it was now, so the whole thing got confusing. The attack is found in Goethe’s famous essay on “Nature.” 

There’s a reason this dream makes sense. Herr M had recently asked me to check his brother, who showed signs of general paralysis. That guess was right, but the sad part was that the patient accidentally revealed his brother by talking about his young days, even though I didn’t ask about it. I asked the patient his birth year and made him do small math problems to show how weak his memory was—he actually did pretty well. Now I realize that in the dream, I act like the patient with paralysis because I don’t know what year it is.

Another part of the dream comes from a friend who edits a medical magazine. He accepted a very harsh review of a book by my Berlin friend, Fl. The reviewer was young and not very good at judging books. I felt I had to step in and called out the editor, who regretted accepting the review but wouldn’t fix it. So, I stopped working with the magazine and said I hoped it wouldn’t hurt our friendship.

A third part of the dream comes from a story a female patient told me. Her brother had a psychotic episode where he kept crying “Nature, Nature.” The doctors thought it came from Goethe’s essay and his hard work studying natural science. But I thought it was more about the sexual meaning of “Nature,” which even less educated people use. The brother later hurt himself in a related way, which made me think I might be right. He was 18 years old during this episode.

Also, my friend’s book, which got so much criticism, is about how life works over time. It talks about Goethe’s life in a way that relates to biology. So, in the dream, I feel like I’m standing in for my friend. I try to figure out the timing, but I act like the patient with paralysis, and the dream is full of nonsense. The dream-thoughts seem to say, “Of course he’s the fool, the crazy one, and you all know better. Or maybe it’s the other way around?”

The dream shows this “other way around” in many ways—like Goethe attacking a young man, which is silly, but today a young person can criticize Goethe. Also, in the dream I count from the year Goethe died, but the patient counts from his birth.

I promised to show that all dreams come from selfish reasons. That’s why I explain why in this dream I defend my friend and act like him, even though when I’m awake, I don’t really agree with him.

The story of the 18-year-old patient and the different ideas about his “Nature” cry relate to how I’ve argued against most doctors by saying many mental illnesses come from sexual causes. I might think, “You’ll get criticized just like your friend did. You already have to some extent.” So, I change “he” in the dream to “we.” “Yes, you’re right, we both might be fools.” 

This is clear from mentioning Goethe’s short but beautiful essay, because a talk on that essay made me want to study natural sciences when I left high school and didn’t know what to do next.

I also have to show that another dream where I don’t appear is still about me. In chapter V., D., I talked about a short dream where Professor M says, “My son, the myopic…” I said that was just a small dream before another one where I appear.
