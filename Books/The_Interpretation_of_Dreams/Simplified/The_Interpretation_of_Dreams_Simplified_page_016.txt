If just being interested while awake, along with things happening inside and outside our bodies during sleep, was enough to explain where all parts of dreams come from, then we could fully understand all dreams. We would only need to figure out how much of a dream comes from our mind and how much comes from our body. But actually, no one has ever completely explained a dream. People who try to understand dreams often find many parts they can’t trace back to anything. The things we care about during the day don’t seem strong enough to say that every dream is just a continuation of what we do when awake.

There aren’t many other known mental sources for dreams. So, except for one explanation by Scherner, most ideas about dreams don’t fully explain where the main images and thoughts in dreams come from. Because of this, many writers tend to downplay how much the mind influences dreams since it’s hard to figure out. They usually split dreams into two types: nerve-stimulus dreams and association-dreams. They say association-dreams come only from memories, but they still wonder if these dreams happen without any signals from the body. Even the special quality of association-dreams seems to disappear.

Volkelt says that in association-dreams, there isn’t a clear main idea. Instead, the dream feels random and messy because our imagination isn’t controlled by reason or important mental or physical signals. Wundt also tries to reduce the mind’s role by saying that dreams might not be real hallucinations but illusions caused by small body signals that never stop during sleep. Weygandt agrees and says dreams mostly start from body signals, with memories added on. Tissie goes even further and says purely mental dreams don’t exist; our dream thoughts come from outside. Some thinkers like Wundt take a middle path and say most dreams come from both body signals and mental triggers, which we may not fully understand or might relate to daytime interests.

Later, we will learn that dreams are caused by a surprising mental source that no one expected.

For now, it’s easy to think body signals are the main cause of dreams. This is because body signals are easier to find and test. Also, modern psychiatry focuses a lot on how the brain controls the body. Psychiatrists don’t like the idea that the mind can act on its own without clear physical changes. They worry that admitting this would bring back old ideas about the soul and metaphysics. This fear makes psychiatrists treat the mind like it needs to be controlled and say the mind has no power on its own. But this just shows they don’t fully trust how physical and mental causes connect. Even when the mind is the main cause of something, better understanding in the future will link it back to something physical. But just because we don’t know how yet doesn’t mean we should ignore the mind’s role.

D. Why Dreams Are Forgotten After Waking

It’s well known that dreams usually fade away after we wake up. We can remember dreams, but often only a little bit. Many times, we feel like the dream was longer or clearer during the night than what we recall in the morning. Sometimes, the memory of a dream is strong when we wake up but disappears during the day, leaving just small pieces behind. Often, we know we dreamed but can’t remember what the dream was about. We’re so used to forgetting dreams that we don’t think it’s strange to say we dreamed even if we can’t remember it at all in the morning.

But sometimes dreams stay in our memory very well. I’ve talked with patients who remember dreams from more than twenty-five years ago. I also remember a dream of mine from at least thirty-seven years ago, and it still feels fresh in my mind. This is very surprising and hard to explain.

Strumpell studied why we forget dreams in detail. Forgetting dreams is complicated and happens for many reasons.

First, the same things that make us forget stuff when we’re awake also make us forget dreams. When awake, we quickly forget many feelings and sights because they aren’t strong enough or don’t have much emotion attached to them.
