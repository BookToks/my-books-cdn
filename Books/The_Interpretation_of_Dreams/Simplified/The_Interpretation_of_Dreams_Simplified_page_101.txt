In my uncle’s dream, the fair beard seems to be the main thing, but it doesn’t really connect logically with his wish to be great, which is the main idea behind the dream. Dreams like this often feel mixed up or shifted around.

On the other hand, in the dream about Irma’s injection, the important parts of the dream match the important thoughts behind it. This shows that the link between what we think about and what we dream isn’t always the same or clear. At first, this might surprise us.

Usually, when we pick one idea from many and focus on it, we think that idea must be really important to us. But in dreams, the ideas that seem most important in our thoughts might not be the ones that appear in the dream. Sometimes, less important ideas show up more.

It might seem like what appears in a dream is just what’s mentioned a lot in our thoughts, not what really matters. But this doesn’t explain much. Usually, the most important ideas are also the ones we think about most. Still, dreams can skip these and focus on less important ideas instead.

This is confusing, but we can understand it better by thinking about how dreams are made. Some people might think it’s normal for ideas in dreams to connect in many ways because that’s how we study them. But I don’t fully agree.

When analyzing dreams, we find many thoughts connected to the dream, some of which seem far from the main idea and feel forced or added on. These added thoughts help link the dream to our real thoughts, even if the connection is weak or strange. If we removed these, the dream wouldn’t be as clear or complete.

So, this idea of many connections is important, but it might not be the main reason dreams form. Instead, it might come from another unknown mental force. Still, this force is important because when ideas don’t connect easily, the mind works harder to make those connections.

It’s likely that this mental force changes how important ideas are in the dream. It lowers the importance of some strong ideas and raises the importance of weaker ones. This swapping of importance causes the difference between what we think and what we dream.

This process is a key part of how dreams are made and is called dream-displacement. Dream-displacement, along with dream-condensation (combining ideas), shapes most dreams.

We can guess what this mental force is. Dream-displacement makes dreams look very different from the original thoughts and changes the dream to hide the real wish behind it. We already know dreams get twisted or hidden because part of our mind, like a censor, blocks some thoughts.

Dream-displacement is one way this censor works. It protects us by changing dream ideas so they don’t bother us. There’s a saying: “He who benefits did it.” This means the censor helps protect us.

Someone once said they never dream nonsense because they are honest and good, so their dreams make sense. But they also thought maybe everyone dreams clearly like that, and no one dreams nonsense.

A dream you remember clearly and can tell someone about always means something. Dreams that don’t make sense can’t come together as a whole idea. Even if time and place get mixed up in dreams, that doesn’t change the real meaning.

We do this too when we’re awake, like when we tell fairy tales or imagine stories. Only someone who doesn’t understand would say, “That’s nonsense because it can’t happen.”

“I wish it were always possible to understand dreams as well as you just understood mine!”
