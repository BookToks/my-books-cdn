Sometimes, a person might tell a story about two Chinese officials having a problem, but really, they are thinking about officials from their own country. The stricter the censorship, the harder it is to understand the real meaning, so people use clever ways to hint at the truth.

The way censorship works is very similar to how dreams get changed or distorted. We can think that in every person’s mind, two forces are at work when a dream is made. One force creates the wish the dream wants to show, and the other force acts like a censor, changing the dream to hide that wish. The big question is: how does this censor have the power to do this? 

We know that the true thoughts in a dream are not clear until we analyze them, but the part of the dream we remember is clear. So, it makes sense that the censor controls what reaches our conscious mind. Nothing from the first force can get into our awareness without passing the censor’s check, and the censor changes it to fit what it likes. This helps us understand what consciousness really is—it's like a special part of our mind that lets us see certain ideas and changes them first. This idea is important for understanding mental health problems, but we will talk more about that later.

Thinking about these two forces reminds me of politics. Imagine a country where the ruler and the people don’t agree. The people want an unpopular official removed, but the ruler shows he doesn’t care by giving that official a special award. This is like how my mind’s censor shows extra affection to my friend R in dreams, even when the first force wants to make him look silly. This shows how dreams can teach us about how our mind works, more than philosophy can.

Now, about dreams that seem unpleasant but are actually wish-fulfillments: these bad parts are there because the censor doesn’t like them, so it changes the dream to hide the real wish. The bad parts help disguise what the first force really wants. The censor only defends itself; it doesn’t create the dream. If we only looked at what the censor does, we’d never understand dreams.

Every dream has a secret meaning that shows a wish being fulfilled, but we have to prove this by analyzing each dream carefully. I will look at some dreams that seem painful and try to explain them. Some come from people with hysteria, which makes the explanation longer and more complicated, but it’s necessary.

When I work with patients in therapy, we often talk about their dreams. I explain the psychology behind their symptoms, but they usually don’t agree with me about dreams being wish-fulfillments. They often give me examples of dreams that seem to prove me wrong.

For example, a smart female patient said: “You always say dreams are wishes coming true. But I had a dream where my wish didn’t happen. I wanted to throw a dinner party but only had smoked salmon. I decided to go shopping, but it was Sunday and the shops were closed. I tried to call caterers, but the phone didn’t work, so I had to give up on my wish.” I told her that only by analyzing the dream could we understand its real meaning, even though it seemed clear on the surface. I asked her what had happened the day before the dream, because dreams usually connect to recent experiences. It turned out her husband, who sells meat, had told her he was getting too fat and planned to start losing weight.
