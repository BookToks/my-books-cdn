So, between the ideas in a dream and what actually happens in the dream, I change happy feelings into scary ones. This shows that the dream is hiding some of the true meaning behind it. The example also shows that the dream can take a feeling from one part of the dream and put it somewhere else.

Now, I want to look more closely at the "breakfast ship" in the dream. It shows up in a weird way at the end, after everything else made sense. When I think about it more, I notice it was black and shaped like something I saw in museums in old Etruscan cities. It looked like a black cup with two handles, kind of like cups for coffee or tea. We joked that it would be funny to give something like that to the lady of the house. So, this object in the dream means a black dressing set or mourning, and it points to death. The other end of this object looks like a boat where dead bodies were once laid to rest at sea, which connects to the ships coming back in the dream.

The dream says, "Silently on his rescued boat the old man drifts into harbour." This is like coming back after a shipwreck. The breakfast ship looks broken in the middle. But why call it a breakfast ship? It’s a play on words in English: "breakfast" means breaking the fast, and "break" is linked to shipwreck. Also, fasting is connected to mourning.

The only new thing the dream made up about this breakfast ship is its name. The ship itself existed in real life and reminds me of a happy time on my last trip. We didn’t trust the food in one town, so we brought some with us and bought good wine. While a small steamer moved slowly through the water, we had breakfast on deck and felt really happy—we were the only passengers. That was the breakfast ship, and behind this happy memory, the dream hides sad thoughts about a mysterious future.

What’s really interesting is how feelings get separated from the ideas that caused them in dreams. But this isn’t the only or most important change dreams make. If we compare the feelings in the dream’s ideas to the feelings in the dream itself, one thing is clear: whenever there’s a feeling in the dream, it’s also in the ideas, but not all feelings in the ideas show up in the dream. Usually, dreams have fewer strong feelings than the thoughts behind them. When I figure out the ideas behind a dream, I see the strongest feelings fighting against each other. But when I look at the dream itself,

I often find it dull and not very emotional. Not just the story, but also the feelings in the dream are often toned down. It’s like the dream hides or lowers the feelings.

Take, for example, a dream about a botanical book I wrote. It was really about me wanting freedom to live my life how I want. But the dream just shows a book lying there with pictures and dried plants, calm and quiet, like a battlefield after the fighting is over—no sign of the strong emotions.

Sometimes dreams do show strong feelings, but many seem calm even though the thoughts behind them are full of emotion.

I can’t fully explain why dreams hide feelings here; it would take a lot of study about feelings and how we block them. But I have two ideas. First, feelings might be like signals sent outward from the body, and when we sleep, these signals don’t get sent out as much. So, the feelings in dreams might be weaker because of sleep itself.

This might be true, but it’s not the whole answer. We have to remember that complex dreams come from a compromise between different mental forces. On one side, wishes try to show themselves, but on the other, a sort of “censorship” stops certain thoughts. Also, every thought has its opposite fighting against it. Since all these thoughts can cause feelings, it makes sense that feelings get blocked because of these conflicts and censorship. So, blocking feelings is another way dreams control themselves, just like how they change or hide the real meaning.
