The girl’s dream shows that she is struggling with strong feelings about sex. The flowers, especially carnations, stand for something sexual, like the male organ, and also for her virginity. Her fiancé often gave her these flowers, which makes the meaning even clearer. The flowers she gets during the day are like a symbol for giving and receiving love or sex. She gives her virginity and expects a loving relationship in return. Talking about “expensive flowers” might also mean money. So, the flowers in the dream represent her virginity, the male part, and the idea of losing her virginity, which might be violent. Giving flowers between lovers often secretly means something sexual.

The birthday she’s getting ready for in the dream probably means having a baby. She thinks of herself as the groom, and he’s getting her ready for the birth by having sex with her. It’s like she feels if she were the man, she wouldn’t wait but would take her virginity by force. Even the word “violate” shows this idea. So, there are some harsh, even sadistic feelings in the dream.

Deeper in the dream, the sentence “I arrange…” might mean something about self-pleasure or early childhood feelings.

She also knows, maybe only in the dream, that she has physical needs. She sees herself flat like a table, which shows she feels very pure and valuable inside. The table shape might also mean something. The dream is very focused; every word has meaning.

Later, she adds to the dream by saying she decorates the flowers with green crinkly paper, which is fancy paper used to hide ugly flower pots. She says it hides the messy parts and looks like velvet or moss. “Decorate” connects to “decorum,” meaning proper behavior. The green color stands for hope, probably hope for pregnancy. In this part, she isn’t thinking about being the man but feels both shame and honesty. She wants to look good for him and admits she’s ashamed of some physical flaws she wants to fix. The velvet and moss remind us of pubic hair.

The dream shows thoughts she barely knows when awake. She thinks about love, sex, and her body. She’s ready for a birthday, meaning sex, and the fear and maybe even pleasure of losing her virginity are there. She admits her flaws but tries to make her virginity seem really important to cover up her shame. Her shame helps explain her sexual feelings because she believes the goal is to have a baby. Even money worries, which her lover wouldn’t care about, show up. The dream’s simple happy feeling shows that deep emotions are being worked through.

Now, about the chemist’s dream:

A young man who wants to stop masturbating is trying to have sex with a woman instead. The day before his dream, he was teaching a student about a chemical reaction involving magnesium and ether. Two days earlier, there was an explosion during this reaction, and someone got burned.

In his first dream, he is making a chemical called phenylmagnesiumbromide. He imagines himself as the magnesium. He feels strange and keeps telling himself the reaction is working, even though his feet and knees feel soft and dissolving. He checks his feet and somehow takes his legs out of a container. Then he tells himself the reaction is right. He partly wakes up and repeats the dream to himself because he wants to tell it. He’s scared of what the dream means and keeps saying “Phenyl, phenyl.”

In his second dream, he is with his whole family. He’s supposed to meet a lady at a place called Schottentor at 11:30, but he wakes up late. He thinks he’s too late and when he sees his family sitting down to eat, he decides he can’t leave now.

The analysis says the first dream probably has to do with the lady he plans to meet. The student he was teaching is annoying; the chemist told him the magnesium wasn’t reacting yet, but the student didn’t care.
