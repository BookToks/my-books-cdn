I admit honestly that I hadn’t been on good terms with this lady. So, my dream connected two things I saw during the day and made them into one situation.

From many similar experiences, I believe that dreams feel like they have to mix all the things that influenced them into one story. Later, we’ll talk about how this mixing is part of how dreams work.

Now, I want to ask if the thing that causes a dream has to be something recent and important, or if it can be a memory or a thought from before. The clear answer from many studies is that a dream can be caused by a recent mental activity, like remembering something important.

It’s a good time to summarize the different ways dreams can start:

(a) A recent and important event shown clearly in the dream.  
(b) Several recent important events mixed into one dream.  
(c) Important recent events shown indirectly through something less important.  
(d) A meaningful memory or thought shown indirectly by something recent but unimportant.

In all cases, part of the dream repeats something from the day of the dream. This part can be closely related to the dream’s main idea or connected through less important things that link to it. These different ways happen because sometimes the dream changes the main idea, and sometimes it doesn’t. This helps explain why dreams can be so different, just like how the brain wakes up in stages.

We also see that a memory or thought from before can be swapped with something recent but less important, as long as: (1) the dream still relates to something recent, and (2) the real cause is still important. In one case, both are the same thing. Since less important things only work if they’re recent (like within a day or so), it seems that the freshness of a memory makes it important for dreams, kind of like strong feelings do. Later, we’ll understand better why recent things matter so much in dreams.

Also, at night, while we sleep, our ideas and memories can change without us noticing. That’s why people say it’s good to “sleep on” a decision before deciding. Here, we move from thinking about dreams to thinking about sleep itself, which we’ll talk about more later.

But there’s a problem: if only recent things can appear in dreams, how come we sometimes see things from long ago that didn’t seem important then and should have been forgotten?

The answer comes from studying people with mental problems. The process that changes important thoughts into less important ones (and vice versa) happened long ago and got stuck in memory. So, things that seemed unimportant before have now become important in our minds. Things that really stayed unimportant can never show up in dreams.
