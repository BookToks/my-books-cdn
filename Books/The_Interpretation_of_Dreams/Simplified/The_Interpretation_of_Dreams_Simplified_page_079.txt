Also, the way I run upstairs shows a clear difference from the feeling of being stuck or held back, which happens in the second half of the dream. It proves something I already knew—that dreams can show actions like moving or running just as fully as real life; for example, flying in dreams!

But the stairs I go up aren’t from my own house. At first, I don’t recognize them. Only the woman coming toward me tells me where I am. She is the maid of an old lady I visit twice a day to give injections. The stairs look exactly like the ones I climb in that old lady’s house.

How do these stairs and the woman get into my dream? Feeling embarrassed about not being fully dressed is clearly connected to something sexual. The maid in my dream is older, grumpy, and not attractive. These thoughts remind me of something: When I visit the old lady in the morning, I often need to clear my throat, and sometimes spit ends up on the stairs. There’s no spittoon on either floor, and I think the stairs should stay clean without me having to clean them. The housekeeper, an older, grumpy woman who cares about cleanliness, thinks differently. She watches me to see if I spit there, and if I do, I can hear her growl. After that, she ignores me when we meet. The day before the dream, the maid also acted like she was annoyed with me. She told me, “You should have wiped your shoes before coming in. The red carpet is dirty again.” That’s why the stairs and the maid showed up in my dream.

There’s a close connection between me running up the stairs and spitting on them. Throat and heart problems are said to be punishments for smoking, and because of this bad habit, my housekeeper thinks I’m not very clean. So, my reputation suffers in both houses, which my dream mixes into one.

I have to wait to explain more about this dream until I can talk about why people often dream about being not fully dressed. For now, I notice that the feeling of being stuck in movement in dreams happens exactly when it needs to. It can’t be just a weird muscle problem during sleep, because just before, I was happily running up the stairs.

D. Typical Dreams Usually, we can’t understand someone else’s dream unless they share the hidden thoughts behind it. Because of this, it’s often hard to use our way of figuring out dreams in real life. But some dreams are different. Lots of people have these same dreams in almost the same way, and we believe these dreams mean the same thing for everyone. These “typical dreams” are interesting because they seem to come from the same place in all people, so they might help us learn more about why we dream.

So, we will try to use our dream-explaining method on these typical dreams, but we have to admit that sometimes it doesn’t work perfectly. For these dreams, we usually don’t get the helpful thoughts from the dreamer that we need to understand the dream. Or the thoughts they give are confusing and don’t help.

Why this happens and how to fix it will be talked about in a later chapter. Then, you’ll see why I only explain a few typical dreams here and save the rest for later.

(a) THE EMBARRASSMENT-DREAM OF NAKEDNESS Sometimes, in a dream where you’re naked or barely dressed around strangers, you might not feel embarrassed at all. But this dream is important only when you do feel shame and want to hide or run away, but you can’t move or change the situation. This feeling of being stuck and embarrassed is what makes the dream typical. Otherwise, the dream’s meaning can change or be mixed with other details. The main point is feeling ashamed and wanting to hide your nakedness, usually by moving, but being completely unable to. Most people have had this kind of dream at some point.

How exposed you feel is usually unclear. The dreamer might say, “I was in my nightgown,” but this is rarely a clear image. Most times, the lack of clothes is so vague that when telling the dream, people say something like, “I was in my nightgown or slip.”
