But I didn’t do this. Even when the master hired an apprentice and told me to make space for him on the bench, I moved to the corner and kept sewing. That same day, another worker was hired; he was a narrow-minded guy who had worked for us nineteen years before. He had once fallen into a lake on his way home from the pub. When he tried to sit down, there was no room for him. I looked at the master, asking why, and he said, “You have no talent for tailoring; you can leave now. You’re a stranger here from now on.” I was so scared that I woke up.

The early morning light shone through the clear windows of my familiar home. Beautiful art pieces were all around me. In the bookcase stood timeless books like Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, and Goethe—all shining and unforgettable. From the next room, I heard the children’s clear little voices as they woke up and talked to their mother. I felt like I had found again that sweet, peaceful, and happy life filled with calm and deep thinking. But I was annoyed that I hadn’t told my master I was leaving first and that he had fired me instead.

And it’s strange to me: since that night when my master made me a stranger, I’ve slept well. I no longer dream about my tailoring days, which are now far behind me. Those days were simple but happy, though they have cast a long shadow over the later years of my life. In these dreams of a poet who once worked as a tailor, it’s hard to see the usual wishful thinking. All the good things really happened while he was awake, but the dream carried a ghost-like sadness from a life long gone. I have similar dreams myself and can explain them a bit.

When I was a young doctor, I worked for a long time in the Chemical Institute without achieving much. So, when I’m awake, I don’t think about that frustrating and somewhat embarrassing time. But I often dream that I’m working in the lab, doing tests and experiments. These dreams, like exam dreams, are unpleasant and unclear. While thinking about these dreams, I noticed the word “analysis,” which helped me understand them. Now, I’m an analyst. I do analyses that many people praise—psycho-analyses, of course. I realized that when I feel proud of my work while awake, my dreams remind me at night of those failed attempts I’m not proud of. These are like punishment dreams for someone who suddenly becomes successful, like the tailor-turned-poet. But how can a dream help with self-criticism instead of just showing wishes? That’s a tricky question.

I think the dream started as an arrogant wish for success, but only the feeling of failure and humiliation ended up in the dream. There are parts of our mind that even enjoy a bit of self-punishment. So, I don’t mind calling these punishment dreams, different from regular wish-fulfilling dreams. This doesn’t change the main theory of dreams but shows how complicated they are. Looking closely at these dreams, I found something else. In a blurry part of one lab dream, I was young again—at the worst time in my career, with no job and no money. Suddenly, I found I could choose from several women to marry!

So, I was young again, and so was the woman who had been with me through all those hard years. This showed a deep wish for youth that started the dream. The fight between pride and self-criticism shaped the dream, but the wish to be young made it possible. People often say, “Sure, things are better now, but life was sweet back then when you were young.” Another type of dream I’ve had is about making peace with people I’m no longer friends with. My mind finds reasons to stop caring about them, but the dream shows us getting along again.

When we look at dreams told by writers or poets, they often leave out parts they find unimportant or upsetting. Their dreams give us a puzzle that would be easier to solve if we had the full story.

O. Rank pointed out that in Grimm’s fairy tale “The Valiant Little Tailor,” there’s a similar dream about someone who suddenly becomes important. The tailor, now a hero married to the princess, dreams about his old job. The princess gets suspicious and sets guards to listen to his dreams and arrest him. But the tailor is warned and changes his dream.

The way feelings get changed and hidden in dreams can be seen clearly when we study them closely. I will now talk about a few examples of how feelings show up in dreams to prove this idea.
