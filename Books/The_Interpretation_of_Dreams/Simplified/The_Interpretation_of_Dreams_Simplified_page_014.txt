Simon and Tissie think that sick parts of the body affect what we dream about. People with heart problems usually have short dreams that end in fear and often include scary deaths. People with lung problems dream about struggling to breathe, feeling crushed, or running away. Many of them also have nightmares. Borner even made a nightmare happen on purpose by lying face down and covering his mouth and nose. When someone has stomach problems, their dreams often involve tastes they like or dislike. Sexual feelings also clearly show up in dreams, which supports the idea that dreams come from feelings in the body.

Some writers, like Maury and Weygandt, studied dreams because their own illnesses changed what they dreamed about.

Even though sick organs can cause dreams, this isn’t the most important thing. Dreams happen to healthy people too, probably every night. So having sick organs is not needed for dreaming. What really matters is understanding what causes normal dreams in healthy people.

If we think about it more, we find that the body’s signals are a big source of dreams. When we are awake, we don’t pay much attention to feelings inside our bodies. But when we sleep and stop focusing on the outside world, our mind notices these feelings more. These body signals, even when we are healthy, can turn into dream images. So, normal dreams might come from general feelings inside the body, made stronger during sleep. We need to figure out how these body signals become dreams.

Most doctors like this idea. The body’s inner feelings, which are still a mystery, seem connected to the mystery of dreams. This idea also connects dreams with mental health problems because changes in body feelings can affect the mind and cause mental illnesses. So, many writers have come up with this theory on their own.

Some thinkers, like Schopenhauer in 1851, said that our ideas about the world come from how our mind organizes what we sense in time and space. During the day, the feelings inside our body don’t affect us much because outside world distractions are stronger. But at night, when outside distractions stop, inner feelings become clear, like hearing a quiet stream when everything else is silent. The mind turns these feelings into dreams by making them fit into time and space. Other thinkers like Scherner and Volkelt studied how body feelings turn into dream pictures, but this will be explained later.

Psychiatrist Krauss said that dreams, delusions, and false beliefs all come from body feelings. He said any part of the body can start a dream or delusion. He divided body feelings into two types: general feelings that affect the whole body, and specific feelings from five parts: muscles, breathing, stomach, sex, and outside body parts. Krauss explained that a body feeling wakes up a related idea or image, and they join to make a dream. But when we dream, we don’t focus on the body feeling itself, only on the ideas, which is why people didn’t understand dreams before.

Krauss called this process "transubstantiation of the sensations into dream-images."

Most people today agree that body feelings affect dreams, but they don’t all agree on how exactly this happens. If we follow the theory that dreams come from body signals, then to understand dreams we need to find what body feeling caused the dream. If we don’t use the rules suggested by Scherner, we might only notice the dream content and miss the body feeling behind it.
