To change the outside world by moving around the right way, you need to have a lot of experiences saved in your memory. You also need to connect these memories with different ideas to guide your actions. Now, let's think more about this.

The second system in the brain tries out many different ideas, testing them carefully by sending out bits of energy called cathexes and then pulling them back. It needs to have control over all the memories, but it wouldn’t make sense to waste a lot of energy on every single thought, especially if that energy just disappears without doing anything useful. So, I think the second system keeps most of this energy resting and only uses a small amount when it needs to move or act.

I don’t know exactly how this works physically, but the first system tries to let energy flow out freely, while the second system uses its cathexes to stop this flow, turning the energy into a kind of stored-up potential. So, when the second system finishes thinking through something, it releases this stored energy to help make movement happen.

Now, let’s think about how this stopping of energy relates to pain and how we avoid it. Imagine something painful happens, and it causes a reaction in the body. This pain will cause random movements until one of them stops the pain by moving away from what caused it. When the painful thing shows up again, the person will try to run away again until it’s gone. But the person won’t try to bring back the painful memory on purpose. Instead, the brain wants to avoid thinking about the pain because recalling it can cause more pain.

This turning away from painful memories is the first example of what we call repression. Everyone knows how people try to avoid painful thoughts or feelings, just like an ostrich hiding its head in the sand.

Because of the pain rule, the first system can't put anything unpleasant into thoughts. It can only wish for good things. If that was all there was, the second system wouldn’t be able to use all the memories it has to think properly. So, there are two options: either the second system ignores pain and keeps going, or it finds a way to hold onto painful memories without letting the pain come out.

We can’t accept the first option because pain also controls how the second system works. So, the second option must be true: the second system holds onto painful memories in a way that stops the pain from coming out. This means the second system stops the energy from flowing out, which also stops the pain from happening.

It’s important to remember that the second system can only hold onto an idea if it can stop the pain that comes with it. If it can’t stop the pain, it has to give up on that idea because of the pain rule.

Stopping pain doesn’t have to be perfect; a little pain can start, which helps the second system understand the memory and decide if it’s useful for thinking.

I will call the mental process that the first system allows the “primary process.” The process controlled by the second system, which stops some energy from flowing, I will call the “secondary process.” The first system tries to let energy out to make sense of what you see or feel. The second system doesn’t try to do that; it tries to make sense of your thoughts.

All thinking is like a detour between the memory of feeling good and trying to get back to that feeling through new experiences. Thinking is about connecting ideas without getting distracted by how strong they feel. Sometimes, ideas get mixed up or combined in ways that block reaching the goal, so the second system tries to avoid these distractions.

The pain rule can sometimes help thinking by giving important clues, but it can also make thinking harder. So, thinking tries to break free from being controlled only by pain and tries to keep feelings to the smallest amount needed to signal something important. This improvement happens by focusing more with our awareness.

But we know this is hard to do perfectly. Even in normal life, our thinking can still be influenced or messed up by pain.
