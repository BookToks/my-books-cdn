In the dream "Non vixit" I found a small part I had missed at first: the sentence "As P does not understand him, Fl asks me," and so on. When the explanation stopped making sense, I went back to these words and found they led me to a child's fantasy that showed up in the dream as a middle connection. This happened through the poet's lines: "You rarely understood me, I rarely understood you, only when we were in the mud did we understand each other right away."

Every time we analyze a dream, we see that even the tiniest details are important for understanding it. If we wait too long to look at them, it takes longer to finish the explanation. We pay close attention to every little word in dreams. Even when the words seem strange or wrong, like a bad translation, we treat those parts like they're really important. This might seem strange and needs to be explained.

It seems that our way of understanding dreams makes sense, even if other writers don’t agree. When we try to remember and explain a dream, we change it a bit because our normal thinking changes it. But this change is just part of how dreams get changed by our mind’s “dream-censorship.” Other writers have noticed some of these changes, but for us, it’s not a big deal because we know that many changes happen even before the dream is remembered. The mistake other writers make is thinking these changes are random and can’t be solved, which makes them think dreams are confusing. But we know nothing about dreams is random. There’s always a hidden reason why things happen in the dream.

For example, if I try to think of a random number, I can’t really pick any number I want. The number I think of is always connected to other thoughts inside me, even if I’m not trying to think about them. The changes that happen when the waking mind thinks about the dream are not random either. They keep a link to the dream’s real meaning and help us find what the dream is really about, even if it’s hiding something else.

When I study patients’ dreams, I test this idea and it always works. If a dream story doesn’t make sense at first, I ask the person to tell it again. Usually, they don’t use the same words. The parts where they change the words show me where the dream is hiding its true meaning. These spots are like secret marks that help me start understanding the dream. The person telling the dream tries to protect these secret parts by changing the words, but this actually helps me find the real meaning. From how much they try to hide the dream, I can tell how carefully the dream was made.

Some writers think we should doubt how well we remember and understand dreams. But this doubt isn’t really smart. Our memory can’t always give proof, but we still have to believe it more than we think. Doubt about what happened in the dream is just another way the mind tries to hide the dream’s true ideas. This doubt doesn’t attack the strong, clear parts of the dream, only the weak, unclear ones. We already know that the dream changes the value of its thoughts, making some less important. If doubt comes with a weak part of the dream, that part probably hides a forbidden dream idea.

This situation is like after a big revolution in an old city. The rich, powerful families are gone, and only poor or weak people stay, watched carefully. Instead of suspicion, we have doubt. So, when analyzing dreams, we must ignore normal rules about what is true or reliable. If there’s even a small chance something was in the dream, we should accept it as true. If we don’t stop caring about how things seem and try to find every part of the dream, we won’t understand it. If we ignore parts of the dream, the person won’t think about the ideas hidden behind those parts. This is strange but true. It would be more normal to say, "I’m not sure if this was in the dream, but these ideas come to me anyway."
