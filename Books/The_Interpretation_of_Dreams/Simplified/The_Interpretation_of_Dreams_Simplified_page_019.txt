People sometimes say dreams are just strange thoughts, and that we only realize we were dreaming when we wake up. This is what makes dreams different from daydreams, which we never mistake for real life.

Burdach explained dreams like this: (a) Our mind treats the things we imagine in dreams as if they were real, like we’re actually seeing or feeling them. (b) When we sleep, we lose control over our actions, so falling asleep means we become more passive. Our willpower relaxes, which affects the images we see in dreams.

Now, why do we believe these dream images are real? Strumpell says the mind acts normally according to its usual way, even in dreams. The things we dream about aren’t just pictures in our head—they’re real experiences for our mind, like what we sense when we’re awake. When we’re awake, we think using words and ideas, but in dreams, we think in actual images we see. Dreams also have a sense of space, just like real life, where things seem to be around us. So, the mind treats dream images the same way it treats real ones when awake. If it makes mistakes about what’s real in dreams, it’s because when we sleep, we lose the ability to check if the images come from outside or just inside our mind. We can’t test if what we see is real or not, and we can’t control the dream images like we do when awake. The mind also can’t figure out cause and effect in dreams. So, because we’re cut off from the real world, we believe in our dream world.

Delboeuf agrees but explains it differently. He says we believe dreams are real because when we’re asleep, we have no other experiences to compare them to since we’re shut off from the outside world. But it’s not just that we can’t check our dreams; sometimes dreams trick us into thinking we are checking. For example, we might feel like we’re touching a rose in a dream, but we’re still dreaming. According to Delboeuf, the only way to tell if something was a dream or real is that we wake up. He says if you find yourself awake in bed after sleeping, then everything before was just a trick your mind played. We think dreams are real because our mind is used to believing there’s a real world outside us.

If we accept that turning away from the outside world causes dreams to feel the way they do, it’s helpful to look at what Burdach says about how the mind connects to the outside world while sleeping. He says sleep happens only when our mind isn’t bothered by outside things. But it’s not just about missing outside sounds or sights—it’s about losing interest in them. Some outside sounds even help us fall asleep, like a miller who can only sleep when he hears his mill running, or someone who needs a nightlight on to fall asleep.

During sleep, the mind pulls away from the outside world but doesn’t fully disconnect. If we couldn’t hear or feel anything at all, we’d never wake up. We don’t always wake up because of how strong a sound is, but because of what it means to us. For example, a random word might not wake us, but if someone says our name, we wake up. This shows the mind still notices and cares about certain sounds during sleep. Sometimes we even wake up when a sound stops, like when the miller hears his mill stop. This means waking up can happen when something important changes, not just because of noise.

Even if we ignore these points, we still can’t explain why dreams feel so strange just by saying we’re cut off from the outside world. If that were true, we could change dream images back into simple thoughts and understand our dreams fully. But when we remember dreams after waking, they still feel mysterious.

Also, all experts agree that bigger changes happen inside our mind during sleep. Strumpell says when we stop sensing the outside world and normal awareness ends, the feelings, desires, and thoughts that usually connect to our memories get blocked. The pictures of people, places, and events in dreams come back, but they lose their usual meaning. Without that meaning, these images just float in our mind on their own. This loss of meaning, which comes from turning away from the outside world, is a big reason why dreams feel so strange when we remember them.
