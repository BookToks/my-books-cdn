Actually, the first part of how dreams form probably starts during the day when our mind is still kind of awake but not fully aware. The second part, where the mind changes the dream, hides some parts, and shows others, likely happens all through the night. That’s why we often feel like we’ve been dreaming all night, even if we don’t remember the dreams.

I don’t think the dream process follows a strict order like we describe it — first the wish, then the changes by the mind’s “censorship,” then other changes. We say it that way to explain it better, but in real life, the mind tries different ways at once until one dream stands out. Sometimes, making a dream might take more than one day and night. So, dreaming isn’t really magical or instant. Also, the mind might start getting the dream ready even before we fully realize it, and once it does, the dream comes faster, like fireworks that take a long time to prepare but then explode quickly.

Through this process, the dream either gets strong enough to grab our attention and wake up the part of our mind that’s almost awake, or it stays too weak and waits until we’re waking up. Most dreams aren’t very powerful and wait until we start waking up. That’s why if someone wakes us suddenly from deep sleep, we usually remember part of the dream first before noticing the real world.

But some dreams are strong enough to wake us up in the middle of sleep. We can ask why these dreams, which come from unconscious wishes, are allowed to disturb our sleep. The answer might be about how our mind uses energy. Letting a dream come out and use some attention might save energy compared to always trying to keep these wishes hidden like during the day. Even if dreams wake us up a few times at night, we usually fall back asleep right away. It’s like swatting a fly away while sleeping — we wake up for a moment, then go back to sleep once the problem is gone. For example, wet-nurses can sleep but still pay attention to their baby at the same time.

But here’s a question: since unconscious wishes are always active, why don’t they keep waking us up again and again? Why does the dream stop disturbing our sleep after we notice it? 

It’s true unconscious wishes never stop working. They stay ready to be used whenever there’s enough mental energy. The unconscious mind doesn’t forget anything. For example, a bad memory from 30 years ago can still cause problems like an attack if it’s triggered. That’s why therapy is important — it helps these unconscious thoughts calm down and be forgotten. The part of the mind that’s almost awake does this work, and therapy helps to bring the unconscious under control.

So, for any unconscious thought, two things can happen: either it gets ignored and eventually breaks through in some way, or it gets controlled by the almost awake mind and stays calm. The second option happens with dreams. When the mind starts paying attention to a dream, it traps the unconscious energy, so it doesn’t disturb sleep anymore. When we wake for a moment, it’s like chasing away the fly bothering us.

This shows it might be smarter and use less energy to let the unconscious wishes come out as dreams and then control them a little, instead of trying to stop them all night. Even if dreaming wasn’t meant to serve a purpose at first, it has found a role in how our mind works.
