If we want to understand what’s going on here, the main point is that our brain can do really complicated thinking without us even being aware of it. We’ve learned this from studying people with certain mental issues like hysteria or obsessive thoughts. These thoughts aren’t impossible to notice, but sometimes we just don’t pay attention to them during the day for different reasons. Becoming aware of a thought needs a special mental skill called attention, which we only have so much of. Sometimes, our attention is focused elsewhere.  

Another reason we might not notice certain thoughts is that when we try to focus on an idea but it seems wrong or useless, we stop paying attention to it. Even if we stop thinking about it consciously, the thought might keep going on its own until it becomes so strong that it grabs our attention again. So, if we reject a thought at first, it can still keep happening in the background, especially when we fall asleep.  

Let’s sum it up: We call these kinds of thoughts “preconscious” thoughts. They can be thoughts we just ignored or ones we tried to stop. Here’s how we think about how thoughts move: there’s a kind of energy that pushes ideas along certain paths in our brain. If a thought is ignored or stopped, this energy is taken away, so the thought is left on its own. But sometimes, a thought connected to a goal can get more energy and grab our attention. Later, we’ll explain more about how consciousness works.  

A preconscious thought can either fade away on its own or keep going. If it fades, it spreads its energy through related ideas and then calms down. This fading doesn’t really affect dreams. But other important ideas hidden deep in our mind, connected to our secret wishes, can take over this energy and keep the thought alive. This means the thought moves from the “preconscious” part of the mind into the unconscious part.  

There are other ways dreams can form, too. Sometimes a preconscious thought is already connected to an unconscious wish, so it gets rejected by the mind’s main focus. Or an unconscious wish might get active on its own and attach itself to thoughts that don’t have attention. In all these cases, a thought that was ignored gets new energy from the unconscious wish.  

From this point, the thought changes in ways that don’t happen in normal thinking, turning into something strange that we see in dreams. Let’s explain these changes: 1. The energy in the ideas moves around and builds up a lot in some parts, so some ideas become very intense. This can cause the whole thought to squeeze into one strong idea. This is called “condensation,” and it’s why dreams seem weird. We don’t see this happening in normal thoughts we’re aware of.  

In condensation, important ideas get combined into one intense idea. It’s like when you highlight or bold a word in a book to show it’s important. Or when you say a word loudly to make it stand out. An example from a dream was a chemical called trimethylamine that stood out this way.  

Artists have used this idea too. Ancient statues showed important people as much bigger than others to show they mattered more. Later, Roman art was more subtle: the emperor was in the center and looked strong, while his enemies were smaller or bowing down. Even today, we still have ways of showing who’s important in similar ways.  

The way dreams combine ideas is guided by the real connections between thoughts and by the pull of visual memories hidden in the unconscious. When condensation works well, it creates strong ideas that can reach our awareness.
