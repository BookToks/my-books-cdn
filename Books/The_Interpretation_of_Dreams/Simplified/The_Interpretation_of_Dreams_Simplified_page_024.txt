Plaff, changing a well-known saying, says: "Tell me your dreams for a while and I will tell you who you really are." Hildebrandt’s short essay, which I’ve already quoted a lot from, is the best and most interesting writing I’ve found about dreams. It focuses on the problem of right and wrong in dreams. Hildebrandt also believes that the purer your life is, the purer your dreams are; the dirtier your life, the dirtier your dreams.

A person’s sense of right and wrong stays with them even in dreams. "We don’t get upset or suspicious when a math mistake happens in a dream, or when facts are wrong, or when things don’t fit the time period. But we do understand the difference between good and bad, right and wrong, even when we dream. No matter how much of our daily life disappears when we sleep, Kant’s big rule about doing the right thing follows us everywhere, even in dreams. This is because the basic part of human nature, the moral part, is too strong to be shaken up by our wild dreams," (p. 45, etc.).

When talking more about this, the authors sometimes avoid clear answers or contradict themselves. If someone thinks a person’s sense of right and wrong falls apart in dreams, then they shouldn’t care about bad dreams. They shouldn’t blame the dreamer for bad dreams or say bad dreams mean someone is a bad person. This is like how they reject the idea that silly dreams mean someone is dumb when awake. On the other hand, people who think rules about right and wrong apply even in dreams should accept that people are fully responsible for their bad dreams. We can only hope that their own bad dreams don’t make them doubt their own goodness.

Actually, no one really knows exactly how good or bad they are, but most people admit they’ve had bad dreams. No one denies bad dreams happen; the real question is where they come from. So, even though these authors disagree on whether dreams are moral or not, they all try to explain how bad dreams start. Here, another argument comes up: do bad dreams come from normal mind work, or do they come from the body’s influence on the mind? Both sides agree that bad dreams come from a special part of the mind.

People who think right and wrong still matter in dreams don’t fully accept they are responsible for their bad dreams.

Haffner says (p. 24): "We are not responsible for our dreams because the part of our mind that gives life meaning is turned off. So, the wishes and actions in dreams can’t be good or bad." But the dreamer is responsible for bad dreams in a way, because they help cause them. So, just like in real life, it’s their job to clear their mind before sleep.

Hildebrandt looks deeper into this mix of saying no and yes to responsibility for dreams.

He explains that dreams show things like a play, mixing lots of thoughts into short moments, and that dreams confuse and mix up ideas. Even though we should think about these things when judging bad dreams, he admits it’s hard to say we’re not responsible at all for bad things we do in dreams.

(p. 49): "When we want to strongly deny a wrong idea about us, especially about our thoughts and beliefs, we say: ‘We would never dream of such a thing.’ This means we think dreams are the last place we should be blamed for our thoughts because dreams are so mixed up and don’t fully belong to us; but by denying such dreams, we also admit that we would want to be cleared of blame even there. I think, without realizing it, we’re telling the truth." (p. 52): "No dream action happens without first being thought about while awake, in the form of a wish, desire, or impulse." About this first thought we must say: The dream didn’t create it — it just copied and made it bigger. It only made a story out of something already inside us. It reminds us of the words of the Apostle that if you hate someone, it’s like you’ve already done something bad to them. And even if we laugh at our wild bad dreams after waking, we can’t just ignore the bad feelings that started them. We feel responsible for some of the bad things our dreaming self does; not all, but some. "Basically, if we understand the words of Christ that bad thoughts come from the heart, then we can’t help but believe that every sin in a dream carries at least a little bit of guilt." So Hildebrandt finds the cause of bad dreams in the small evil thoughts we have during the day, and he includes these bad parts in judging a person’s character.
