"That’s definitely not an easy thing to do, but with a bit of focus, anyone who dreams can do it. You wonder why it’s usually impossible? In your case, there’s something hidden in your dreams, something a bit unusual and secretive about your nature, which makes it hard to understand. That’s why your dreams often seem meaningless or just weird. But deep down, that’s not true at all; it can’t be, because a person is always the same, whether awake or dreaming."  

How the parts of a dream mix and change — like what’s most important and what’s less so — is something we’ll look at later. For now, we can say that one rule for what shows up in dreams is that it has to slip past the mind’s “censorship.” From now on, when we study dreams, we’ll accept this idea of dream-displacement as a fact.  

Besides the two things we talked about before — condensation and displacement — there are two more things that affect what appears in dreams. But before we go further, I want to quickly explain how people figure out what dreams mean.  

The best way to show this would be to take one dream and explain it in detail, like I did before with the dream about Irma’s injection. Then, from what we learn, we’d put together how the dream was made — that’s called dream-synthesis. I’ve done this with some dreams for practice, but I can’t do it here because it needs special personal information that people would agree should stay private.  

Analyzing dreams is easier because even a partial look can be useful, but making a full, convincing dream-synthesis needs to be complete. I can only do that with dreams from people who aren’t famous. Since I mostly get dreams from patients with mental health issues, I have to wait until I can explain those conditions better before I can show this fully. I’ll do that in another place.  

When I try to build dreams from their hidden thoughts, I see that the information we get varies in importance. Some parts are the main dream-thoughts — these would fully explain the dream if there were no mind censorship. Other parts seem less important and might include ideas that came up after the dream, between dreaming and figuring it out. These parts include the connections between what we see in the dream and what’s really going on underneath, plus the ideas that help us find these connections during interpretation.  

Right now, we only care about the main dream-thoughts. These usually show up as a mix of thoughts and memories that are really complicated, just like how we think when we’re awake. Sometimes, there are several trains of thought starting from different places but still connected; often, each thought has an opposite thought linked by contrast.  

The pieces of this complex idea connect in many ways. They include main ideas, background info, side topics, examples, conditions, arguments, and objections. When the dream is formed, these pieces get shuffled, broken up, and packed together like floating ice. So, what happens to the logical links that held these thoughts together before? Words like if, because, although, either-or — which help us understand sentences — how do they show up in dreams?  

First, we have to say that dreams don’t have a way to show these logical connections between thoughts. Most of the time, they ignore these linking words and focus only on the main content of the dream-thoughts. It’s the job of dream interpretation to put back the connections that the dream mixed up.  

If dreams can’t show these links, it’s because of the kind of material they’re made from. Actually, art forms like painting and sculpture have the same problem compared to poetry, which can use words. The reason these arts are limited is because of the materials they work with.  

Before painting learned how to express feelings and ideas well, it tried to fix this problem.  

In old paintings, little labels with words would hang from the mouths of people in the picture to show what the artist couldn’t express just by painting.
