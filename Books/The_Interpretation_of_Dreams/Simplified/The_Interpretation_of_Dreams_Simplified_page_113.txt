A symbol is like a part of a typeface, but the last lines are missing. Since jokes, puns, quotes, songs, and sayings are a big part of how smart people think, it makes sense that dreams often use these kinds of disguises to show what’s really on our minds. Only a few symbols in dreams have a clear meaning that everyone agrees on because of common sayings or word connections. Many dream symbols are also found in mental illnesses, stories, and everyday life.

If we look closer, we see that dreams aren’t doing anything new when they use these symbols. They just follow the same paths that unconscious thoughts use. These thoughts turn hidden feelings into jokes or hints that can come out without being stopped by the mind’s “censor.” These ideas also show up in the daydreams and fantasies of people with mental health problems.

This helps us understand some dream explanations by Scherner, which I’ve said are mostly right. Thinking a lot about your own body isn’t just something that happens in dreams. I’ve seen it a lot in the hidden thoughts of people with mental illnesses. It usually comes from sexual curiosity, especially in teenagers, about the private parts of the opposite or same sex. But as Scherner and Volkelt say, a house isn’t the only way dreams or mental fantasies show the body. Some patients always think of the body using building parts—like posts or pillars for legs, doors for body openings, or water pipes for the urinary system.

But other ideas come from plants or kitchens, which also hide sexual meanings. Everyday language, with its old comparisons, makes this easy—like “the vineyard of the Lord” or “the seed of Abraham.” Even the grossest or most private sexual stuff can be hidden in innocent-sounding kitchen words. If we forget that sexual symbols can be behind the most normal things, we won’t understand some symptoms of hysteria at all. For example, some kids with mental problems can’t stand to see blood, raw meat, eggs, or pasta, and their fear of snakes is much worse than normal. All these things have a sexual meaning. When mental illness hides feelings this way, it’s following old human traditions, which we can still see in sayings, superstitions, and customs.

Now I’ll share a flower dream from a female patient. I’ll mark all the parts that have a sexual meaning.

This pretty dream stopped being nice for her once it was explained.

First, she dreams about going to two maids in the kitchen and scolding them for taking too long to get a snack ready. She sees lots of heavy kitchen tools piled up and turned upside down to drain. Later, the maids go to fetch water and have to climb into a river that almost reaches the house or yard.

The main dream: She is climbing down from a high place over a fence made of square lattice. The fence isn’t good for climbing, and she’s scared she might slip. She’s happy her dress doesn’t get caught and that she can climb down safely. She carries a big branch that looks like a tree branch covered with red flowers. It reminds her of cherry blossoms, but the flowers look like camellias, which don’t grow on trees. As she goes down, she counts the flowers—one, then two, then one again. When she reaches the ground, the lower flowers start falling.

At the bottom, she sees a strange man combing what looks like such a tree, scraping off thick bunches of hair that hang like moss. Other men have cut branches in a garden and thrown them on the road, where people pick them up. She asks if it’s okay for her to take one too. In the garden, a young foreign man she knows stands there. She goes to ask him how to transplant these branches into her own garden. He hugs her, but she struggles and asks if his hug is okay. He says it is.

He then offers to take her to the other garden to show her how to plant the branches. He says something she doesn’t fully understand: he needs “three meters” or “three square meters” of ground. It sounds like he wants something in return, maybe to make a deal or get something out of it without hurting her. She doesn’t know if he actually shows her anything.

This dream, full of symbols, is a biographical dream—it relates to her life. These kinds of dreams happen a lot in psychoanalysis but are rare outside it. I have many examples, but sharing them all would take us too far into talking about mental illness.
