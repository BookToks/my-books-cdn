The most original and detailed idea about dreaming as a special mental activity that can only happen during sleep was made by Scherner in 1861. Scherner’s book is written in a heavy and showy style, full of excited energy about the topic, which might push people away unless they get caught up in it. It makes understanding the topic hard, so people often prefer the clearer and shorter explanation of Scherner’s ideas by the philosopher Volkelt. Volkelt said, "From all these wild and bright ideas, there is a strange hint of meaning; but this doesn’t really help the philosopher understand dreams." This is Volkelt’s criticism, even though he was one of Scherner’s followers.

Scherner wasn’t one of those writers who thought the mind worked the same in dreams as when we’re awake. He explained how, in dreams, the main part of ourselves that controls thinking and feeling gets weaker; how our mind’s powers like knowing, feeling, wanting, and imagining change because of this. What’s left is not really intellectual but more like a machine. But at the same time, the part of the mind called fantasy, which is free from logical control, becomes the most powerful in dreams. It uses memories from when we’re awake, but it builds new things that are very different, like night is different from day. In dreams, fantasy is not just repeating old ideas but also creating new ones. It loves the unlimited, the exaggerated, and the amazing, and because it’s free from strict rules, it’s more flexible and playful. It reacts strongly to feelings and quickly turns inner thoughts into visible images. Dream fantasy doesn’t use words or ideas but shows what it wants to say through pictures. Since it can’t hold back like thinking does, it shows things fully and strongly, but this makes its way of showing things clumsy and long. It also doesn’t like to show things exactly as they are but prefers to use different images to show certain parts of what it means. This is how symbols are made in dreams. The dream fantasy usually shows things not in detail but in simple outlines, like quick sketches. It doesn’t just show objects but tries to connect the dreamer with them, making actions happen. For example, if the dream shows gold coins on the street, the dreamer might pick them up, feel happy, and take them away.

According to Scherner, the fantasy works mostly with strange feelings from inside the body that we don’t really notice when awake. So, Scherner’s very imaginative theory and the more scientific ideas of Wundt and other physiologists, even though they seem very different, actually agree about where dreams come from and what causes them. But while the scientific theory says the mind stops reacting after it connects these feelings to ideas, Scherner says these physical feelings just give the mind material to use for its fantasy work. For Scherner, dream-creation starts where other thinkers say it ends.

What the dream fantasy does with these body feelings isn’t meant to have a purpose. The fantasy plays a teasing game with them and shows the body’s signals through all kinds of symbolic pictures. In fact, Scherner thinks—though Volkelt and others disagree—that the dream fantasy often uses the symbol of a house to represent the whole body.

Luckily, it doesn’t only use one house but can use many houses to show one body part. For example, a long street of houses might stand for the intestines. In some dreams, parts of a house stand for parts of the body, like the ceiling in a dream with a headache might mean the head, especially if the ceiling is covered with scary spiders.

Besides houses, any object can represent body parts that cause the dream. For example, the lungs might be shown as a burning stove making loud noises, the heart as hollow chests or baskets, and the bladder as round or hollow objects. Dreams caused by sexual feelings might show parts of a clarinet or a tobacco pipe to stand for the male sexual organ, or fur to stand for pubic hair. In women’s sexual dreams, tight closed thighs might be shown as a narrow yard surrounded by houses, and the vagina as a narrow, slippery path the dreamer has to walk through, maybe to deliver a letter to a man. It’s interesting that at the end of dreams caused by physical feelings, the fantasy often shows the actual body part clearly. For example, a dream about teeth often ends with the dreamer pulling a tooth out.

The dream fantasy can also focus not just on the shape of the body part causing the dream but on what’s inside it. For example, dreams caused by the intestines might show muddy streets, or dreams caused by the bladder might show foaming water. Sometimes the dream shows the feeling itself or the thing it wants symbolically. Or the dreamer might act out their own feelings in the dream, like fighting with angry dogs when in pain, or being chased by a naked man in a sexual dream. No matter how complicated the details get, the main force behind every dream is this creative and symbolic fantasy. Volkelt wrote a thoughtful and excited essay trying to understand this fantasy better and how it fits into big philosophical ideas. But his ideas are too hard to understand unless you’re already trained in deep philosophical thinking.
