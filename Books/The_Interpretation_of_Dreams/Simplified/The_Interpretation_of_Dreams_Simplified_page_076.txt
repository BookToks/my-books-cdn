In other words, the things that happen to us while we sleep get turned into a kind of wish-fulfillment. This wish includes parts of our daily experiences that we already know. But this doesn’t always happen the same way; there are different ways our minds can react to physical feelings during sleep. When it does happen, the dream mixes both physical sensations and thoughts from our mind.

Even when physical feelings join the mental parts of a dream, the dream is still about fulfilling a wish. How the dream looks depends on what feelings and thoughts are there.

I want to explain some special things that can change how outside feelings affect a dream. How someone reacts to strong feelings while sleeping depends on many things, like how deep their sleep is and how strong the feeling is. In some cases, the person won’t wake up because the feeling is blocked out. In other cases, it might wake them up or get mixed into the dream. Because of this, some people have outside feelings show up in their dreams more often than others. For me, I sleep really well and don’t like to be bothered while sleeping, so outside feelings rarely show up in my dreams. But mental thoughts easily make me dream. I have only had one dream where a painful outside feeling clearly affected it, and it’s interesting to see what happened in that dream.

In the dream, I’m riding a gray horse. At first, I’m nervous and awkward, like I’m just being carried along. Then I meet a friend, P, who is also on a horse and sitting up straight. He points out something, probably that I’m not sitting well.

Then I start feeling more comfortable on my smart horse. I sit better and feel like I belong there. My saddle is like a soft pad that fills the space between the horse’s neck and back. I ride between two vans and just barely fit. After going down the street, I turn around and want to get off in front of a small open chapel. Then I really get off in front of another chapel nearby. There’s a hotel on the same street. I think about letting the horse go there alone, but I decide to lead it. It feels like I should be embarrassed to arrive on horseback. Outside the hotel, a page-boy shows me a note I lost and makes fun of me. The note says, underlined twice, “Eat nothing,” and another unclear sentence like “Do not work.” I also have a fuzzy idea that I’m in a strange city where I don’t work.

At first, it’s not clear that pain caused this dream. The day before, I had boils that made every move painful. One boil was as big as an apple and hurt a lot with every step. I felt tired, had no appetite, and worked hard despite the pain. I wasn’t really able to do my job as a doctor, but riding a horse was the last thing I could do. In the dream, I’m riding, which is the opposite of the pain I felt. I can’t ride in real life; I’ve only done it once and didn’t like it. But in the dream, I ride like I don’t have any pain. It’s like the dream is telling me I don’t have the boil, because no one could ride with a boil there! The saddle in the dream is like the medicine that helped me sleep. At first, I didn’t feel pain while sleeping, but later it tried to wake me up. Then the dream came and told me to keep sleeping, that I was fine, and that riding meant no pain. The dream worked, and I kept sleeping.

But the dream didn’t just ignore the pain. It also used details to connect other thoughts in my mind to the dream. The gray horse’s color matches the suit my friend P wore the last time I saw him. I had been told spicy food causes boils, which fits better than sugar as a reason for my pain. My friend P likes to act important with me since he took over treating a female patient I used to care for. In the dream, the horse is smart and stands for that lady patient. Feeling comfortable on the horse means the place I had in her life before P replaced me. Someone told me I looked safe “in the saddle” with her, meaning stable. It was a big deal to do my therapy work for so many hours while in pain, but I know I can’t keep working hard without being healthy. The dream also shows bad signs about what would happen if I stayed sick, like the note saying “Do not work, do not eat,” which reminds me of what nervous patients show their doctors.

Looking deeper, the dream also brought up old fights I had as a kid with my nephew, who is now older and lives in England. It also included memories from my trips to Italy—the street in the dream looks like places in Verona and Siena.
