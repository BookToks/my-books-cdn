This blame that I arrived too late is the main part of the dream, but it’s shown in a scene where my old teacher Brucke, who I respected when I was a student, is angry at me with a scary look in his blue eyes for being late. The reason this part changed will soon be clear: the dream can’t show the real scene like I saw it. It keeps the blue eyes with the other man but makes me the one who causes harm, which is a switch that shows the dream is about what I secretly want. I care a lot about my friend’s life, feel bad for not visiting him, feel ashamed (he quietly came to me in Vienna), and want to excuse myself because I was sick—all these feelings mix into a storm inside me that I feel even in sleep, and this storm shows up in the ideas behind the dream.

But there was something else during the time of the dream that had the opposite effect. When I got bad news at the start of the operation, I was told not to talk to anyone about it. This hurt me because it showed a lack of trust in me. I knew my friend didn’t ask for this, but it came from someone else who was being too cautious or clumsy. Still, this hidden blame bothered me because it wasn’t totally wrong. Only blame that has some truth can hurt. Years ago, when I was younger, I knew two men who were friends and liked me. I foolishly told one what the other had said about him. This had nothing to do with my friend Fl, but I never forgot the blame I got then. One of these friends was Professor Fleischl; the other I’ll call Josef, a name shared by my friend and rival P, who is also in this dream.

In the dream, this situation quietly points to the blame that I can’t keep secrets, which is also shown by Fl asking how much I told P. But an old memory mixes in and moves the blame for being late back to when I worked in Brucke’s lab. By putting a Josef in the dream’s harmful scene instead of the second person, the dream shows both the blame for arriving late and the stronger, hidden blame that I don’t keep secrets. The way the dream mixes and moves these ideas now makes sense.

My small anger at being told to keep secrets gets stronger because of deep, hidden feelings, turning into a flood of negative feelings toward people I actually care about. The reason for this is in my childhood. I said before that my close friendships and fights with people my age come from my childhood with my nephew, who was a year older than me. He was bossy, and I had to learn how to defend myself early on. We lived together, were close, and loved each other, but sometimes we fought and blamed each other. In a way, all my friends are like this first person; they all come back as memories. My nephew came back when he was a young man, and then we were like Caesar and Brutus. I always needed a close friend and a hated enemy in my emotional life, and I could always find new ones. Sometimes, friend and enemy were the same person—not at the same time, but switching, like when I was a child.

How recent feelings can bring back childhood memories and make those memories the reason for those feelings is something I won’t explain now. That kind of study belongs to the psychology of unconscious thoughts or psychological reasons for mental problems. For dream interpretation, let’s say a childhood memory or made-up memory shows this: Two kids fight over something—we won’t say what exactly, but the memory, or made-up memory, has a clear idea—and both say they got there first, so they should have it.

They fight; strength beats right; and from the dream, I must have known I was wrong, but this time I was stronger and took control. The loser runs to my father, his grandfather, and complains, and I defend myself with what I heard from my father: "I hit him because he hit me." This memory or made-up memory, which pops up during the analysis without me knowing why, becomes a big part of the dream thoughts, gathering all the feelings in the dream like a bowl collects water.

From here, the dream thoughts go like this: "You deserved it for letting me take over; why did you try to push me away? I don’t need you; I’ll find someone else to play with," and so on. Then these thoughts flow back into the dream itself. For this kind of “move over so I can take your place,” I once had to blame my dead friend Josef. He was just ahead of me in the line for promotion in Brucke’s lab, but promotions were very slow. Neither of us moved up, and we got impatient. My friend, who knew he didn’t have much time left and wasn’t close to his boss, sometimes showed his impatience. Since the boss was very sick, the wish to see him replaced could be seen as mean. Years before, I had the same wish—to get a job that opened up. Whenever there is a rank system, people can hide their jealous wishes. Shakespeare’s Prince Hal can’t stop thinking about the crown, even when his sick father is nearby. But the dream doesn’t put this mean wish on me—it puts it on my friend. “Because he was ambitious, I killed him.” Since my friend couldn’t expect the other to step aside, the other was taken away instead.

I think about these feelings right after going to the ceremony for my friend’s memorial at the University. Part of the happiness I feel in the dream can be seen as a fair punishment: You deserved it.
