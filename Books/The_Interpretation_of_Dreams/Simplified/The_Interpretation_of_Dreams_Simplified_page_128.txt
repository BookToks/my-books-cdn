11. I once analyzed a dream in French where I appeared as an elephant. I had to ask why I was shown that way. The dreamer answered, "Vous me trompez," which plays on the word "trompe," meaning trunk.

Dreams often use strange connections to show tricky things, like names. In one dream, an old teacher named Brucke gave me a task. I prepared something and picked out a piece that looked like crumpled tinfoil. The word that matched this was "stanniol," which reminded me of a scientist named Stannius. He wrote about the nervous system of fish, something I respected when I was young. The first scientific problem my teacher gave me was about a fish's nervous system, but the name couldn’t be shown in the dream picture.

I want to share a funny dream from a child. A lady said she often dreamed that God wore a paper hat shaped like a cone. When she was a child, she had to wear such a hat at the table so she couldn’t see how much food other kids got. Since she knew God knew everything, the dream meant she still felt she knew everything, even with the hat on. Dreams handle their ideas in strange ways, like using numbers and math.

Some people think numbers in dreams are special. I’ll give some examples.

1. A lady dreamed near the end of her treatment. Her daughter took 3 florins 65 kreuzer from her purse to pay, but the mother said, "No, it costs only 21 kreuzer." I understood this because the lady was a foreigner whose daughter was in school in Vienna. The daughter’s school year would end in three weeks, meaning the treatment would stop then too. The dream used money to show time: a year is 365 days, and three weeks is 21 days. The numbers in the dream stood for time, but showed as money because “time is money.” The small amounts expressed a wish: that the treatment and school fees cost less.

2. In another dream, a young married woman learned that a friend named Elise got engaged. She dreamed she was at the theater with her husband, and one side of the seats was empty. Her husband said Elise and her fiancé wanted to come but could only get cheap seats costing 3 for 1 florin 50 kreuzer, so they didn’t come. She thought they didn’t miss much.

Where did 1 florin 50 kreuzer come from? The dreamer’s sister-in-law had received 150 florins and quickly spent it on jewelry. Note that 150 florins is 100 times 1 florin 50 kreuzer. The number 3 relates to the fiancé being three months younger than the dreamer.

The empty side of the theater refers to a real event where the husband teased her. She had booked tickets early and paid a fee, but when they arrived, many seats were empty, so she didn’t need to hurry.

The dream thoughts behind this are: "It was silly to marry so early; I didn’t need to rush. From Elise’s example, I could have found a better husband if I had waited. With the dowry, I could have bought three husbands like him!" The numbers changed meaning a lot in this dream.

This dream changed and twisted ideas more than the first one. That means these thoughts were harder to show in the dream. There’s a strange part: two people are supposed to take three seats. This absurd detail shows the strongest dream thought: "It was silly to marry early." The number 3, from the small age difference, was used to show this idea. The big amount of 150 florins became just 1 florin 50 kreuzer to show how the dreamer felt less happy about her husband deep down.
