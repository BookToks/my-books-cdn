Here, censorship was tricked so well that a hidden fantasy came into awareness disguised as an innocent complaint. Otherwise, it would have stayed just under the surface of the mind.

Another example: I started psychoanalytic treatment with a fourteen-year-old boy who had tics, hysterical vomiting, headaches, and more. I told him that after closing his eyes, he would see pictures or get ideas to tell me about. He described pictures. The last thing he remembered before coming to me was playing checkers with his uncle, and he saw the checkerboard in his mind. He talked about good and bad moves. Then he saw a dagger on the board—something that belonged to his father, but his imagination put it there. Then a sickle appeared, then a scythe, and finally, an old farmer cutting grass in front of his father’s house far away.

A few days later, I found out what these pictures meant. The boy’s family life was stressful. His angry father had been harsh and threatening, divorced his gentle mother, and remarried. The boy got sick a few days later. His hidden anger toward his father mixed with old stories from myths. The sickle was like the one Zeus used to punish his father; the scythe and farmer showed Kronos, a violent old man from myths who ate his children. The father’s new marriage gave the boy a way to fight back against the punishments he had faced for playing with himself (the checkerboard; the forbidden moves; the dagger). These old memories and unconscious feelings came up as strange pictures that sneaked into his awareness.

If you ask me what is the value of studying dreams, I would say it helps us learn more about how the mind works and understand mental illnesses better. Who knows how important this knowledge will become? Even now, it helps treat some mental problems. But what about using dreams to learn about a person’s character? Don’t the hidden feelings in dreams show real forces inside us? Should we ignore the importance of these secret wishes, since they might cause other things in the future?

I don’t feel ready to answer these questions yet. I haven’t studied this side of dreams closely. Still, I think the Roman Emperor was wrong to kill a man just because he dreamed of killing the Emperor. The Emperor should have tried to understand what the dream really meant; it probably wasn’t what it seemed.

Even if a dream really did mean something bad like betrayal, it’s worth remembering Plato’s words: a good person only dreams of what a bad person actually does. So, I believe dreams shouldn’t be blamed for evil. Whether unconscious wishes are real or not, I can’t say. Of course, quick and passing thoughts aren’t real. Even if we fully understood unconscious wishes, we should remember that mental reality is a special kind of existence, different from physical reality. So, people don’t need to feel guilty about bad dreams. When we understand how the mind works and how conscious and unconscious parts relate, most of what seems bad in dreams and fantasies loses its power.

“What a dream shows us about our connection to reality, we will then find in our conscious mind too, and we shouldn’t be surprised if the scary thing we saw in deep analysis turns out to be something tiny and harmless” (H. Sachs).

For real life, judging a person by their actions and what they say is usually enough. Actions matter most because many feelings that come to mind get stopped before they turn into actions. Often, the unconscious knows these feelings will face resistance later, so it lets some through. Still, it’s helpful to learn about the rich soil from which our good qualities grow. Human personality is complex and moves in many ways; it rarely fits into simple good or bad choices like old moral ideas say.

What about dreams telling us the future? That’s not true. Instead, dreams help us understand the past. Every dream comes from past experiences. The old idea that dreams predict the future isn’t completely wrong. Dreams show wishes as if they’re already true, which takes us into the future in our minds—but this future is shaped by the past wishes that never go away.
