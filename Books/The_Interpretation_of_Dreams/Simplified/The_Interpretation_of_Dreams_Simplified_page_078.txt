Sometimes, even a wish that isn’t really there can come up to help make a dream. But a dream always shows some kind of wish being fulfilled. It tries to find a wish that fits with the feelings or sensations it gets. Even if these feelings are painful or unpleasant, they can still help create the dream.

In our mind, there are hidden wishes that we don’t usually notice because another part of our mind stops them. These hidden wishes haven’t disappeared; they’re just pushed down and blocked. The mind keeps working to bring these wishes out, but when one comes true, it can cause discomfort.

If you feel bad sensations in your body while you sleep, the dream uses these feelings to help fulfill a hidden wish, but it still keeps some control over what it shows.

This can explain some scary or anxious dreams. Some anxiety dreams come from hidden sexual feelings, which cause worry. These dreams show how the wish to feel good is blocked. Other anxiety dreams happen because of real physical problems, like trouble breathing. In these cases, the anxiety helps hidden wishes come out in the dream. So, sometimes anxiety in dreams comes from the body, and sometimes it comes from the mind.

Our body’s feelings are a big part of what starts dreams. They don’t create the dream’s story, but they push the mind to choose ideas that fit the body’s feelings. These feelings can stick with us from the day before and connect with our thoughts in the dream. If the feelings are painful, the dream might change them into something nicer.

If the body’s feelings during sleep aren’t very strong, they work like little reminders from the day that help shape the dream if they fit the dream’s ideas. They are like cheap materials the mind uses when needed, not something that decides the dream by itself. Imagine an artist who gets a special stone to carve; the stone’s color and shape help decide the art, but if the stone is plain, the artist’s idea guides the work. This shows why body feelings don’t always appear in every dream.

Here’s an example: I once wanted to understand a feeling in dreams where you can’t move or get something done, which is linked to anxiety. That night, I dreamed I was almost undressed and ran up stairs quickly, happy that I could move well. Then I saw a maid coming down, and I felt ashamed and tried to leave but couldn’t move — I was stuck on the stairs.

This dream came from real life. I have two apartments connected by stairs. After work, I go upstairs to my bedroom. The night before the dream, I walked upstairs with my clothes messy, like in the dream but less so. I often run up stairs fast, and in the dream, this was a wish to feel strong and healthy, especially about my heart.
