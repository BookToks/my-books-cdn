When Maury woke up, he didn’t believe the information he got in his dream was true. But when he checked an atlas, he saw that everything in the dream was actually correct. This showed that sometimes dreams can hold real knowledge, even if we don’t remember where we learned it.

Jessen tells a similar story from a long time ago. An older man named Scaliger dreamed about someone called Brugnolus, who said he was ignored. Scaliger didn’t remember hearing about Brugnolus before, but he still wrote a poem about him. Later, his son found out that Brugnolus was once a famous critic in Verona. Another story comes from the Marquis d’Hervey de St. Denis, who dreamed of a girl with golden hair. He thought he knew her but couldn’t remember where. When he dreamed again, he asked her if they had met before, and she said yes, at a place called Pornic. After waking up, he finally remembered details about her.

The same author also tells about a musician who dreamed a new melody. He didn’t know it at the time, but years later he found the song in an old music book, even though he had never seen it before.

Myers collected many stories like these, but I haven’t been able to read them. Anyone who studies dreams knows it’s common for dreams to show knowledge we didn’t realize we had while awake. In my work with nervous patients, I often see that they use quotes or swear words in dreams that they’ve forgotten when awake. Here’s an easy example: a patient dreamed he ordered something called “kontuszowka” in a café but didn’t know what it was. I told him it was a Polish drink name I had seen in ads. He didn’t believe me at first, but later he saw the name on a sign he passed every day.

From my own dreams, I learned that finding where dream images come from often depends on luck. For years, I dreamed of a simple church tower I couldn’t place. Then I suddenly recognized it from a train station I had passed years before. Later, I kept dreaming of a strange place with weird stone statues. I thought it was the entrance to a beer cellar but wasn’t sure. In 1907, I visited Padua again after many years and found the statues at the entrance to a restaurant garden. It was exactly the place from my dreams.

Many dreams come from childhood memories. Some experts say dreams can bring back very old and forgotten experiences, even from early childhood. These memories might be clear or fuzzy, important or not, but dreams can show them fresh and real. Sometimes, these images seem strange or unknown until we figure out where they came from.
