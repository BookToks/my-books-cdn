When people dream, it's like they go back to a natural state of mind. But the less they have learned or experienced in real life, the more their dreams are influenced by feelings or ideas that don’t match what they know when awake. For example, the writer says his own dreams sometimes show him believing in superstitions he usually argues against when awake.

Maury made some sharp observations about dreams, but he only saw them as proof that dreaming is an automatic mental process, not connected to real thinking. He thought this automatic process was the opposite of active thinking.

Stricker said that dreams aren’t just fake ideas. For example, if someone is scared of robbers in a dream, the robbers aren’t real, but the fear is real. This makes us wonder: which parts of dreaming are real feelings, and which parts are just imaginary? Also, can anything in dreams be part of real thinking like when we are awake?

A dream theory tries to explain what dreams are and how they connect to other mental experiences. Different dream theories focus on different features of dreams and explain them in various ways. We don’t have to find a specific purpose for dreams in every theory, but many people like theories that help explain why we dream.

Long ago, people believed dreams were messages from gods to guide them. That was a full explanation for dreams back then. Now, scientists have many different ideas about dreams, but none are perfect.

We can group dream theories based on how much mental activity they say happens during dreaming:

1. Some theories, like Delboeuf’s, say that our mind works fully during dreams, just like when we are awake. The mind stays active but works differently because we are asleep. However, it’s hard to explain why the mind keeps working in this way during sleep, especially since the mind can only really react by either sleeping without dreaming or waking up if something bothers us.

2. Other theories say that dreaming happens because mental activity slows down, the connections in the brain loosen, and less information is available. Sleep changes the brain’s functioning a lot, not just by blocking out the outside world but by making the mind less able to work properly. To explain this, one might compare the first group of theories to a kind of mental illness called paranoia, while the second group views dreaming as a kind of mental weakness.

Most medical experts and scientists prefer the second kind of theory. They believe that only a small part of the mind stays active during sleep, which creates dreams. This is also the most popular idea for understanding dreams. It explains how dreams can be silly or confusing but sometimes also clear and thoughtful, by thinking of dreaming as a gradual and strange waking-up process.

For those who want a scientific explanation, Binz describes it like this: During early morning, the brain slowly wakes up. The tired chemicals in the brain start to break down and get carried away by the blood. Some brain cells wake up earlier than others, and their activity appears in our unclear consciousness. But other parts of the brain are still “asleep” and not fully controlled yet, which is why dreams can seem strange or mixed up.
