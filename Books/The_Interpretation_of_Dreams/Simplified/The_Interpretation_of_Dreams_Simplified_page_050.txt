Could I really be thinking about this offense? That would make the comparison silly. I remember another talk I had a few days ago with a coworker, N, about the same thing. I saw N on the street; he was also nominated for a professor job, and when he heard I was too, he congratulated me. But I didn’t accept his congratulations. I said, "You’re the last person to joke about this because you know from your own experience what the nomination really means." Then he said, maybe joking, "You can’t be sure of that. There’s a problem in my case. Don’t you know a woman once accused me of a crime? I promise you the situation was fixed. It was a cheap attempt at blackmail, and I barely stopped the accuser from getting punished.

But maybe the Ministry still remembers that incident about me. You, however, have nothing bad against you." So here I have the criminal and the meaning of my dream. My uncle Joseph stands for both of my friends who didn’t get the professor job – one as a fool, the other as a criminal. Now I understand why I use this image. If religious reasons are why my two friends didn’t get the job, then my own chance is also at risk. But if I can say their rejection is for other reasons that don’t apply to me, then I can still hope. This is what my dream does: it makes one friend, R, look like a fool, and the other, N, look like a criminal. But since I’m neither, I don’t have anything in common with them. I deserve to be happy about becoming a professor and don’t have to worry about what the official told my friend R.

I need to think more about this dream because I don’t feel like I’ve fully understood it yet. I still feel uneasy about how easily I made my two respected friends look bad just to clear my own way to the job. I feel better about this since I learned to see dreams for what they really are. I would disagree with anyone who said I truly think R is a fool or that I don’t believe N’s story about the blackmail. And of course, I don’t believe that Otto made Irma seriously sick with a shot of some chemical. Here, like before, the dream is only showing what I wish were true. The part where my wish comes true sounds less crazy in this dream than the first because it uses real facts to make the slander seem believable. For example, R was once opposed by a professor in his own department, and N accidentally gave me something to use as proof for the bad story. Still, I feel like the dream needs more explaining.

Now I remember the dream had another part I haven’t talked about yet. After I realized that my friend R was my uncle in the dream, I felt a lot of love for him. Who was this love really for? Not my uncle Joseph, because I never felt close to him. I have loved R as a friend for many years, but if I told him how much love I felt in the dream, he would be surprised. The love seems fake and too much, just like how I judged his brainpower by mixing him with my uncle, but in the opposite way. Now I see something new. The love in the dream isn’t part of the real meaning behind the dream; it actually hides the true message. This is probably its purpose. I remember I didn’t want to figure out the dream’s meaning and tried to avoid it, even saying the dream was nonsense. I know from my work that when people say this, it doesn’t mean much; it just shows their feelings. Like when my little daughter doesn’t want an apple and says it’s bitter without tasting it. When my patients do this, I know they’re trying to hide a thought. The same goes for my dream. I don’t want to understand it because I don’t like what it says. When I finish the interpretation, I see that what I didn’t want to accept was the idea that R is a fool. I can explain my love for R not by the hidden dream thoughts but by my refusal to accept those thoughts. If the dream lies about R by showing the opposite of what it really means, then the love in the dream is a trick to hide the bad opinion. My real thoughts about R are negative, so to keep me from noticing, the dream shows tender love instead.

This idea might be true in general. As I showed in Chapter III, some dreams are simple wish-fulfillments. But when a wish is hidden and twisted, it means the person is trying to protect themselves from that wish, so it can only show up in a messed-up way. I’ll try to find a similar example in regular life. Where do you see something like this? Only when two people are involved, one with power and the other who has to be careful because of that power. The second person then hides their feelings or acts fake. The politeness I use every day is often like this disguise. When I explain my dreams to others, I have to hide some parts too. Even poets complain about this needed lying: “The best things you know, you can’t tell kids.” Writers who tell the truth to those in power have the same problem. If they say everything openly, the government will stop them — either after they say it or before it gets published. So the writer has to be careful and hide their true thoughts. They soften or hide their criticisms with hints or innocent words.
