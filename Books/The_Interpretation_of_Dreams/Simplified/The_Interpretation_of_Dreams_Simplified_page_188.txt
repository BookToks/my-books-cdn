This isn’t just about a problem in how our mind works that lets certain thoughts sneak into our dreams or cause hysterical symptoms. This problem comes from two things that happen as we grow up. One has to do with how our mind is set up, and the other comes and goes, involving physical feelings that affect our mental life. Both start when we’re babies and come from changes our body and mind go through since then.

When I called one part of the mind the primary process, it wasn’t just about what it does but also about when it happens. We don’t really know of a mind that only has this primary process—it’s more like an idea. What we do know is that the primary process is there from the start, while the secondary process develops over time. The secondary process grows and takes control, usually in adulthood. Because the secondary process shows up later, the core of who we are—our hidden wishes—can’t be fully controlled by our conscious thoughts. These unconscious wishes push everything else we think and do, even if we try to change or control them. Because of this delay, a big part of our memories stays hidden from our conscious mind.

Among these hidden wishes from when we were little, some conflict with what our grown-up thoughts want. Fulfilling these wishes now wouldn’t feel good anymore—it would cause pain. This change in feeling is what we call repression. How and why this change happens is a tricky question, but it starts during development. For example, feelings like disgust appear later and affect how we handle wishes. The memories tied to these wishes have never been fully reachable by our conscious mind, so the feelings they bring out can’t be stopped. Because of this, these ideas stay hidden, and the pain we feel makes our conscious mind avoid them. These hidden thoughts end up repressed, and having a bunch of baby memories locked away is what makes repression possible.

In the best case, the pain stops as soon as the conscious mind stops paying attention to these hidden thoughts, which shows the pain helps protect us. But if the repressed wish gets stronger because of physical feelings, it tries to push through anyway. Then a struggle happens: the conscious mind tries to block these wishes, but sometimes they break through in a disguised way, like symptoms. When these hidden wishes are strong but ignored by the conscious mind, they act on basic impulses or cause hallucinations. We’ve seen this happens only with repressed thoughts. Now we understand more: these weird mental processes happen when thoughts are left alone and filled with energy from the unconscious, pushing to be released. These strange processes aren’t mistakes or bad thinking; they are just how the mind works when it’s not being controlled.

So, the way thoughts move from the conscious mind to actions happens like this, and when we connect ideas to words, we might see the same mix-ups we blame on not paying attention. Also, the extra effort needed to keep these basic mental processes under control might explain why we laugh when these hidden thoughts come out—it’s a way to release extra energy.

The theory about mental illnesses says that only sexual wishes from childhood, which got repressed as we grew up, can come back later and cause symptoms. These wishes come from how we develop sexually and from problems in our sexual life. Adding these sexual forces helps explain parts of repression that were unclear before. I won’t say for sure if this idea works for dreams too, because saying dreams always come from unconscious wishes is already a big assumption. I also won’t compare how mental forces work in dreams and hysteria because we don’t know enough about both. But there’s one important point that made me explain all this about the two mental systems and repression. It doesn’t matter much if my ideas about how the mind works are fully right or not. No matter how our thoughts about mental control or dream meaning change, this point stays important.
