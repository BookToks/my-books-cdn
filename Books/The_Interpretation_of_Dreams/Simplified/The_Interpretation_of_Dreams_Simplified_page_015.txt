People often have similar kinds of dreams that many call "typical" because they happen to a lot of people and feel pretty much the same. For example, dreams about falling from a high place, losing teeth, flying, or feeling embarrassed because you're naked or barely dressed are common. The last one usually happens because in the dream, you feel like you’ve kicked off your blankets and are uncovered.

Dreams about teeth falling out are linked to a small irritation in your teeth, but this doesn’t mean your teeth are actually sick. The flying dream is thought to come from the feeling your body gets when your lungs move up and down while you sleep, but your skin doesn’t really feel that movement. This creates the image of flying in your mind. The falling dream happens because part of your body, like an arm or a bent knee, moves suddenly after your skin stops feeling pressure for a moment, then suddenly feels it again, which your brain turns into a falling sensation.

These ideas seem to make sense, but they have a problem. They only explain dreams by saying some body feeling either disappears or shows up, depending on what fits the dream. Later, I will talk more about where these typical dreams come from.

M. Simon studied many similar dreams to find some rules about how body feelings affect dreams. He said that if a part of your body that usually reacts to emotions gets active during sleep, the dream will match that emotion. Also, if a body part is active or bothered during sleep, the dream will include ideas related to what that body part does.

Another researcher, Mourly Vold, tested how body feelings affect dreams by moving a sleeper’s limbs and checking their dreams. He found:

1. The position of a limb in a dream usually matches its real position.

2. If you dream of a moving limb, one of the positions in the dream matches the real one.

3. You might dream that your limb belongs to someone else.

4. You might dream that your limb can’t move properly.

5. Your limb might appear as an animal or monster in the dream, with some connection between them.

6. The way your limb acts in the dream can make you think of related ideas, like dreaming of numbers when using your fingers.

From this, it seems that even when body feelings influence dreams, the dream images still have some freedom and aren’t completely controlled by these feelings.

When we look at why we dream about certain things, experts agree that we often dream about what we did and cared about during the day. This connection between waking life and dreams helps explain where dreams come from. But some say dreams actually take us away from our daily worries and that we only dream about important things from the day after they stop bothering us while awake. So, when studying dreams, it’s important to remember that there are many rules but also many exceptions.
