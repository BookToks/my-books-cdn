The dreamer had started working in his dad’s business but really didn’t like the shady ways it made money. So, if he had asked his dad about it, he thought, "He would have lied to me just like he lies to his customers." The dream showed cheating in business as a kind of secret action, which the dreamer also connected to masturbation. This idea makes sense because masturbation is usually secret but can also be done openly.

In the dream, the dad was linked to this secret act, just like the questions in the first part of the dream. The dreamer saw a shaft as a vagina because of the soft walls around it. The way the action went down instead of up matched other dreams he had. There was a long platform at the end of the first shaft and then a new shaft, which the dreamer explained from his own life. He had stopped having sex with women because of problems but hoped to start again with help. The dream became unclear at the end, and the interpreter guessed that another idea was coming in. The dad’s business and dishonest ways, plus the vagina symbol, might also refer to the dreamer’s mom.

4. Sometimes, male and female body parts show up as people or places in dreams.

A woman from a poor background dreamed this: Someone broke into her house, and she called for a policeman. But instead of helping, he calmly went with two homeless men into a church. The church had many steps, and behind it was a mountain covered with a thick forest. The policeman wore a helmet, chest armor, and a cloak. The two homeless men wore sack-like aprons. A road went from the church up the mountain, with grass and bushes growing thicker toward the top where the forest was.

5. Kids sometimes have dreams about castration.

(a) A boy about three and a half years old was upset because his dad came back from the army. One morning he kept asking: "Why did Daddy carry his head on a plate?" He said he saw his dad carrying his head on a plate the night before.

(b) A student who later had bad obsessive thoughts remembered a dream from when he was six. He went to the barber to cut his hair, but then a big, scary woman came and cut off his head. He knew the woman was his mom.

6. A different kind of staircase dream.

One sick patient, who didn’t have sex and kept thinking about his mom, often dreamed about climbing stairs with her. The doctor told him that some masturbation might be better for him than not having sex at all. After this, the patient dreamed that his piano teacher scolded him for not practicing. He said that the “Gradus” (a piano exercise) is actually a staircase, and the piano itself is like a staircase because of its keys.

This shows that all kinds of ideas can be used to represent sexual thoughts and wishes in dreams.

7. Feeling like a dream is real and dreams repeating.

A 35-year-old man remembered a clear dream he had at age four. A notary (a legal man) who held his dad’s will brought two big pears. The boy got one pear to eat, and the other was left on the window sill. When he woke up, he believed the pear was still there and kept asking his mom for it. She laughed.

The notary was a friendly old man who sometimes really brought pears. The window sill looked the same in the dream as in real life. The boy couldn’t think of anything else, except maybe his mom had recently told him a dream about two birds on her head that wouldn’t fly away, and one even flew to her mouth.

Because the boy couldn’t explain much, the dream might be using symbols. The two pears probably stood for the mother’s breasts, and the window sill symbolized her chest, like balconies on houses in other dreams.
