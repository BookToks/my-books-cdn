The gaps are the openings of women’s private parts when they are going to bed. Here, something is missing, which is a main feature of female genitals. When he was young, he was very curious to see female genitals and still believed the childish idea that women have male organs.

Another dreamer had a similar dream. He dreamed: I go with Fraulein K to a restaurant... then there is a dark part, a break... then I find myself in a brothel, where I see two or three women, one wearing a chemise and underwear.

Fraulein K is the daughter of his old boss; he saw her as a sister figure. He rarely talked to her, but once they had a talk where they both realized their sexuality, like saying: I am a man and you are a woman. He had only been to that restaurant once, with his brother-in-law’s sister, a girl he didn’t care about. Another time, he walked three ladies to the restaurant door: his sister, sister-in-law, and that same girl. He didn’t care about any of them, but they all felt like sisters. He had been to a brothel only a few times in his life.

The dream’s dark part shows that sometimes, but very rarely, his boyish curiosity made him look at his younger sister’s private parts. A few days later, he remembered this bad behavior clearly.

All dreams from the same night are connected by their meaning. Their parts, how they are grouped and how many there are, all give clues about hidden thoughts. When dreams have different parts or happen one after another, they might all mean the same thing, showing the same feelings but in different ways. Usually, the first dream is the most hidden and shy, while later dreams are more open and clear.

Even the Pharaoh’s dream about ears and cows, which Joseph explained, was like this. Josephus tells it in more detail than the Bible. The king said: "After I saw this dream, I woke up confused, thought about it, then fell asleep again and had another, even more amazing dream that scared me." Joseph said: "Both dreams, though different, mean the same thing."

Jung shared a story about a schoolgirl’s secret sex dream. Her friends understood it without needing to explain, and they made up their own versions. Jung said that the main idea of a long series of dreams is usually the same as the first image tried to show. The mind hides the real meaning by changing the dream into safe symbols and stories.

Scherner knew about this too and wrote that dreams start by showing the real cause in a very hidden way. But by the end, when the dream runs out of energy, it shows the cause clearly, using the right body parts or actions. The dream then finishes its job.

Otto Rank gave a good example of this. A girl told him about two dreams she had in one night, with a break between them. The second dream ended with an orgasm. Even though the girl didn’t explain much, the two dreams connected well. The first dream talked about the same thing in a shy way, and the second one made it clear. Rank said that dreams with orgasms are very important for understanding dreams in general.

But usually, it’s hard to turn how clear or confusing a dream feels into real proof about what the dream means. Later, I will explain a new factor in how dreams form that helps us understand this better.

In many dreams, the place and situation stay the same for a while, but then there is a break where suddenly it feels like another place, and something different happens. This break is like a side thought or extra idea in the dream. When dream-thoughts have conditions (like if or when), the dream shows them happening at the same time.

Now we can ask: What does it mean when we feel stuck or frozen in a dream? This feeling often comes with anxiety and is closely connected to it.
