I’m not saying that I’ve completely explained the meaning of the dream or that my interpretation is perfect.

I could spend a lot more time on it, find more explanations, and talk about other questions it raises. I can even see where more ideas might connect to it. But because it’s a dream about myself, I can’t interpret it any further right now. People who don’t like this kind of careful thinking should try being more open and honest themselves.

For now, I’m happy with one new discovery: if you use the method of dream interpretation I’ve shown here, you’ll find that dreams really do have meaning. They’re not just random brain activity, like some writers say. When you finish interpreting a dream, you can see it as a wish being fulfilled.

In the novel Gradiva by poet W. Jensen, I found some made-up dreams that were very well made and could be interpreted like real dreams. The poet said he didn’t know about my dream theory. I used this to show that my way of interpreting dreams works well.

Aristotle once said that the best dream interpreter is the one who can see the real picture behind the distorted images in dreams. Dream images are like pictures in moving water; the best interpreter can recognize what the dream really means.

Artemidoros of Daldis, who lived about 2,000 years ago, gave the most detailed explanation of dream interpretation in the ancient world. He thought dreams should be interpreted based on careful observation and experience, and he separated his method from fake ones. His main idea was that dreams mean what they remind the interpreter of, but since different interpreters remember different things, this leads to confusion.

My method is different because it makes the dreamer do the interpreting. Instead of using whatever ideas the interpreter thinks of, it uses only what the dreamer thinks about the dream. Even today, some dream interpreters in the East work this way. For example, among some Arabs, the best dream interpreters ask the dreamers many questions to get all the details before giving an interpretation. They even ask things like whether the dreamer had sex before or after the dream. Their main idea is to explain dreams by their opposites.

Dr. Alfred Robitsek pointed out that old Oriental dream-books often interpret dreams using word sounds and similarities, which don’t translate well into other languages. This explains why our modern “dream-books” are confusing. Word plays were very important in old cultures. For example, one ancient interpretation involved a pun: Alexander the Great dreamed of a Satyr dancing on his shield during a siege. The interpreter split the word “Satyros” into “sa” and “turos,” meaning “Thine is Tyros,” encouraging Alexander to be more aggressive and win the city.

Dreams are closely tied to language, and each language has its own dream “language.” Usually, dreams can’t be translated well into other languages.
