This warning hits us and our pride hard. Since we were kids, we've thought we were really smart and strong. Like Oedipus, we don’t understand the feelings that go against what’s considered right, feelings that nature makes us have. When we finally see these feelings clearly, we might want to avoid thinking about our childhood.

In Sophocles' play, there’s a clear hint that the Oedipus story comes from very old dreams. These dreams show how a child’s feelings about their parents get mixed up because of early sexual feelings. Jocasta tries to calm Oedipus, who is confused and worried about what the oracle said, by talking about a dream many people have. She says lots of men dream they’re with their mother, but those who ignore such dreams live easier lives. The dream about being with one’s mother was as common then as it is now, even though people are shocked by it. This dream is key to the story and connects with the dream of the father’s death. The Oedipus story is a way to deal with these two dreams. Just like adults feel disgusted by such dreams, the story also has fear and guilt. Later, people changed the story to fit religious ideas, but trying to mix these feelings with ideas about God’s power and human choice doesn’t really work.

Another famous tragedy, Shakespeare’s Hamlet, is based on the same ideas as Oedipus Rex. But because people’s feelings have changed over time, the two stories treat these ideas differently. In Oedipus Rex, the child’s wishes come out openly, like in dreams. In Hamlet, these wishes are hidden deep inside, and we only notice them through the effects they cause. In Hamlet’s play, we don’t really know why he hesitates to take revenge, and no one has been able to explain it fully. Some think Hamlet is a man who thinks too much and can’t act. Others say he’s a weak, nervous person. But the story shows Hamlet can act sometimes.

We see Hamlet act twice: once when he angrily kills a spy, and once when he cleverly sends two men to their deaths instead of himself. So, why won’t he take revenge on the man who killed his father and married his mother—the man who represents Hamlet’s own hidden desires? The answer seems to be that Hamlet can do anything except take revenge because it reminds him of his own secret wishes. Instead of feeling hate, he feels guilt and worry, thinking he’s no better than the murderer. I’m explaining what Hamlet himself doesn’t realize. If you want to call Hamlet “hysterical,” that’s okay with me. His dislike of sex, shown when he talks to Ophelia, fits this idea. This dislike grew stronger in Shakespeare’s own life and shows up in his later plays.

Hamlet reflects Shakespeare’s own feelings, especially after his father died in 1601. Shakespeare was probably remembering his childhood feelings about his dad. Also, Shakespeare’s son, who died young, was named Hamnet, just like Hamlet. Hamlet is about a son’s feelings toward his parents, while Macbeth, written around the same time, deals with not having children. Like dreams and mental problems, poems and plays can have many meanings and come from many feelings. I’ve tried to explain the deepest feelings behind Hamlet.

About dreams where relatives die: these dreams are special because they show a very unusual situation. They reveal a hidden wish that breaks through the mind’s usual rules and comes out in the dream without changing. Two things help this happen: first, it’s a wish we never expect to have, so the mind’s “dream police” aren’t ready for it. Second, the dream often mixes this wish with real worries about that person’s safety from the day. The worry can only appear in the dream by hiding behind the secret wish, which uses the worry as a cover.
