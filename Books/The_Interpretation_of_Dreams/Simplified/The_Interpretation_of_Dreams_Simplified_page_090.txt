[8] See Chapter VII about "transference."  
[9] Havelock Ellis, who kindly criticized The Interpretation of Dreams, wrote in The World of Dreams (p. 169): "From this point on, not many of us will be able to follow F." But Mr. Ellis hasn’t actually analyzed dreams and doesn’t realize how wrong it is to judge dreams only by what we clearly see in them.  
[10] Look at what is said about speech in dreams in the chapter on "The Dream-Work." Only one writer on this topic, Delboeuf, seemed to understand where the talks in dreams come from; he compared them to clichés.  

[11] For those interested, I want to say that behind the dream is a hidden fantasy of me acting in a rude, sexual way, and the lady feeling disgusted. If this sounds crazy, remember that many doctors have been accused of such things by women with hysteria, where the same fantasy didn’t show up as a dream but was clear and false thinking. The patient started her psychoanalysis with this dream. Later, I learned she was repeating the first trauma that caused her mental problem, and I have seen the same pattern in others who were sexually abused as kids and seem to want the experience to happen again in their dreams.  

[12] This is a change to the opposite meaning, which will be clear after analyzing.  

[13] I learned long ago that making wishes come true only takes a little courage, and after that, I happily traveled to Rome.  
[14] The writer where I found this passage was probably Jean Paul Richter.  
[15] In the first edition of this book, I mistakenly used the name "Hasdrubal," and I explained this big mistake in my Psycho-pathology of Everyday Life.  
[16] It’s doubtful that the Marshal was Jewish.  
[17] The original paragraph has many wordplays on "Hetz" (which means hurry, chase, scurry, game, etc.).  
[18] "Fensterln" is a now-rare custom from the German Black Forest countryside where lovers woo their girlfriends at bedroom windows by climbing a ladder, getting close enough to act almost like they’re married. The girl’s reputation usually stays good unless she’s too friendly with many suitors.  
[19] Feelings from these childhood scenes—surprise and acceptance of what can’t be changed—showed up in an earlier dream, which reminded me of this childhood event.  

[20] I didn’t mention the "plagiostomi" by chance; they remind me of an embarrassing moment in front of the same teacher.  

[21] "Popo" means "butt" in German baby talk.  
[22] This repeated part in the dream text came from absent-mindedness, but I kept it because the analysis shows it has meaning.  
[23] This is a mistake, not a slip, because I later learned that the Emmersdorf in Wachau isn’t the same place where the revolutionary Fischof hid, even though the places have the same name.  

[24] Roses, tulips, and carnations—all flowers will die.  

[25] Don’t cry, little Isabella, because your flowers have faded.  

[26] The quote is not from Germinal but from La Terre—a mistake I only noticed during analysis. Also, notice how "Huflattich" and "Flatus" have the same letters.  

[27] A biographer, Dr. F. Wittels, criticized me for leaving out the name of Jehovah from the motto above. The English medal has the name of God in Hebrew letters on a cloud, placed so you can see it as part of the picture or the words.
