Sometimes, dreams show a mix-up of common features, which helps us understand what they represent. If I see a person in my dream with a plain common feature, it means there’s another, more important common feature hidden in the dream thoughts.

Dreams combine or mix up people for different reasons. First, to show a feature shared by two people. Second, to show a common feature that’s been moved or changed. Third, to show a shared feature that the dreamer wishes for. Often, when two people are swapped in a dream, it means the dreamer wants them to share something. For example, in a dream about a patient named Irma, I want to swap one patient for another. The dream shows Irma in a spot usually used by the other patient. In another dream about my uncle, I put myself in the place of a minister and treat my coworkers badly, just like he does.

From what I’ve seen, every dream is about the dreamer. Dreams focus on the self. If someone else shows up in a dream, it usually means the dreamer is hiding behind that person. Sometimes, the dreamer’s self appears, but it actually hides someone else using identification. In that case, I have to think about the hidden person’s traits as if they were mine. Sometimes, my self appears with others who are actually parts of me when you look closer. Dreams can show the self more than once or in different ways, just like in real life when I think about myself in different times or places.

It’s easier to figure out dreams about places than about people because places don’t involve the strong influence of the self. For example, in a dream about Rome, I see German signs, which remind me of Prague. This is because I wanted to meet a friend in Prague but wished it could be in Rome instead. So, my dream switches the two places to show my wish.

Dreams often create weird mixes of things, which makes them feel strange. These mixes combine parts that could never be seen together in real life. This is like imagining a dragon or a centaur when awake. But in dreams, these mixes happen because of a shared idea, not just the way they look. Sometimes, only one thing’s features show up but hint at another thing too. Other times, the dream combines parts of two things into one new image. This new image can be silly or creative, depending on how well the dreamer’s mind puts it together. If the things don’t fit well, the dream shows a fuzzy mix where images seem to fight each other, like a confusing drawing made from different pictures.

Dreams have lots of these mixed images. For example, in a dream about a patient, the dreamer holds a bunch of flowers that mean both innocence and being naughty. The flowers look like cherry blossoms, camellias, and even an exotic plant. These all point to gifts the patient got that influenced her behavior. Another patient makes a mix of things like seaside bathing machines, country outhouses, and attic rooms. These all relate to being naked or exposed, and show memories from childhood. A male dreamer mixes two places where he got treatment and where he met his wife. Another female dreamer dreams her brother’s legs are covered with black caviar beads. This mixes a moral problem with a memory of a childhood skin rash, showing what she feels about what she gets from her brother.
