The Interpretation of Dreams Sigmund Freud (1900) PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION

There was a nine-year gap between the first and second editions of this book, but only a little over a year passed before the third edition was needed. I should feel happy about this change, but while I didn’t think my work was ignored because it wasn’t good before, I can’t say the new attention means it’s definitely great.

Science has moved forward, and The Interpretation of Dreams has changed too. When I wrote this book in 1899, there was no "sexual theory," and studying complex mental illnesses was just starting. The book was meant to help understand these illnesses by looking at dreams. Since then, we’ve learned a lot more about these illnesses, which also helps us understand dreams better.

The way we interpret dreams has also changed from what I said in the first edition. From my own work and others like Stekel, I’ve come to see how important symbols in dreams (or unconscious thoughts) really are. Over the years, a lot of new information has come up that needs to be included. I’ve tried to add these new ideas in the text and notes.
