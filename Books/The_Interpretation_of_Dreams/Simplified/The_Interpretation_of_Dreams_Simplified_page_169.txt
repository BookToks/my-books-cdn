No other idea helps us understand the strange features of dreams better.

The idea here is about psychic locality. We won’t focus on the fact that the psychic system is also part of the body’s anatomy, and we won’t try to find it in the body. Instead, we’ll stay with psychology and think of the psychic system like a tool, such as a microscope or a camera. Psychic locality is like a spot inside this tool where the first part of an image is created. Just like microscopes and telescopes have special spots where images form, the psychic system has these too. These examples help us break down the complicated psychic process by looking at its parts. No one has really tried to understand the psychic system by breaking it down like this before. It’s okay to guess and imagine, as long as we don’t get confused about what’s real and what’s just a model. For a first try at something new, it’s best to use simple and clear ideas.

So, we think of the psychic system as a tool made of parts, which we’ll call instances or systems to keep things clear. These systems might be arranged in a certain order, like the lenses in a telescope. We don’t have to say they are actually placed in space, but it’s enough if they work in a certain time order during psychic events. This order might change for different processes.

From now on, we’ll call these parts of the system Psi-systems.

The first thing we notice is that the system has a direction. All psychic activities start from some kind of signal (inside or outside) and end in actions. So, the system has a sensory end that gets perceptions and a motor end that controls movement. Usually, the psychic process goes from sensing to acting. The basic shape of the psychic system looks like this (see figure).

This fits with what we know about reflexes, which are the model for all psychic actions.

Next, we see a difference at the sensory end. The things we sense leave a mark in the psychic system called a memory-trace. The job related to this memory-trace is memory. If we want to connect psychic processes into systems, memory-traces can only be lasting changes inside these systems. But it’s hard for one system to keep these changes and still be ready to take in new ones. So, we say two different systems do these jobs. The first system gets the signals but doesn’t keep them—it has no memory. The second system takes the first system’s signals and turns them into lasting memories. The psychic system would then look like this (see figure).

We know that when the P-system gets perceptions, we keep something more than just the content. Our memories connect these perceptions, especially if they happened at the same time. This is called association. Since the P-system has no memory, it can’t keep these associations; if it did, old connections would mess up new perceptions. So, the memory system must be where associations happen. Association means that because one memory element is easier to reach, the signal moves from it to a second memory element instead of a third one.

Looking deeper, we find we need not just one but many memory systems. The same signal from the P-system gets fixed in different ways in these memory systems. The first one keeps associations by things happening at the same time, while others arrange the signals by other connections, like similarity. It’s hard to explain what these systems mean in psychic terms, but they depend on how easily signals move between memory elements.

Here’s a general observation that might be important. The P-system, which can’t keep changes and so has no memory, gives us the rich and varied sensory experiences. Our memories, however, are unconscious, even the strongest ones. We can bring memories to consciousness, but they mostly work below the surface. Our character is based on these memory traces, especially the early ones that rarely become conscious. When memories do become conscious, they don’t have much sensory detail compared to real perceptions.
