Later on, we will talk again about feeling held back or stopped from doing something. In our dreams, this feeling is a perfect example of a fight inside ourselves, a kind of "no" or refusal.

According to what our mind really wants, the show should keep going; but according to the rules that control us, it has to stop.

Our usual dreams often connect with fairy tales, stories, and poems in a way that’s not random or accidental. Sometimes, poets understand how their poems come from dreams, and they trace a poem back to a dream. A friend showed me a part of a book called Der Grune Heinrich by G. Keller: it talks about Odysseus, who shows up dirty and naked in front of Nausicaa and her friends. The story means something deep. If you are ever far from home, feeling sad and lost, you might dream about going back home. You see your home shining and beautiful, and nice people come to greet you. But then you realize you are dirty and naked, and you feel ashamed and scared. You try to hide, then wake up sweating. This will always be the dream of someone who feels lost and troubled. Homer, the ancient poet, knew this deep feeling inside all humans.

What are these deep feelings? They are wishes and feelings from childhood, even before history was written down. These old childish wishes, now hidden and not allowed, come out in dreams behind the normal wishes of a homeless person. That’s why the dream about Nausicaa often turns into a scary dream.

I had a dream where I was rushing upstairs but then stuck to the stairs. This is a type of dream called an “exhibition-dream” because it shows important parts of how such dreams work. It should be possible to find out where this dream came from in my childhood. Knowing this can help us understand how a servant’s behavior toward me (she told me I had dirtied the carpet) made her important in the dream.

I can explain this now. In psychoanalysis, we learn that things happening close together in time are connected. Two ideas that seem separate but happen right after each other actually belong together, like letters “a” and “b” making the sound “ab.” Dreams work the same way. My dream about the stairs is part of a group of dreams I have already studied. They all relate to memories of a nurse who took care of me from when I was a baby until about two and a half years old. I remember her a little bit. My mom told me she was old and ugly but smart and careful. From my dreams, I think she wasn’t always kind and spoke harshly when I didn’t understand why I had to be clean. Since she tried to teach me cleanliness, she appears in my dream as a kind of old, powerful woman from the distant past. Of course, even though she was harsh, the child in me still liked her.

Another common group of dreams is about the death of someone you love, like a parent, brother, sister, or child. There are two kinds of these dreams: ones where the dreamer doesn’t feel sad, and ones where the dreamer feels very upset and even cries in the dream.

We can ignore the first kind because they aren’t typical dreams. When analyzed, these dreams mean something else hidden inside. For example, a dream about a woman seeing her nephew dead doesn’t mean she wants him dead. Instead, it hides a wish to see this person again after a long time apart. Since this wish is real and not sad, the dream doesn’t feel sad either. This shows that the feelings in a dream don’t always match what we see on the surface.

But in dreams where the death of a loved one is imagined and the dreamer feels sad, the dream means what it shows: a wish that this person might die. I know this sounds hard to believe, so I will explain it carefully.

We already saw that dreams can show wishes that aren’t current but from long ago. These old wishes, even if buried or pushed away, still exist in some way because they come back in dreams. They aren’t like dead people who are really gone; they are more like spirits in stories that come back to life when they drink blood. One dream talked about a dead child in a box and showed a wish that was real 15 years before and openly admitted at that time.
