But we still need to think more about the idea that wishes are the only cause behind dreams. We’ve agreed that dreams always fulfill wishes because they come from the unconscious mind, which only wants to fulfill wishes and uses wish impulses to do it. If we want to keep using dream interpretation to understand the mind, we have to show how dreams fit with other parts of the mind too.

If there really is an unconscious system, dreams can’t be the only way it shows itself. Every dream might be a wish coming true, but there must be other ways wishes show up besides dreams. In fact, all neurotic symptoms (like those from mental health issues) might also be seen as unconscious wishes being fulfilled. This means dreams are just the first example of many important wish-fulfillments that psychiatrists need to understand.

But some wish-fulfillments, like hysterical symptoms, have something that dreams don’t. From my research, I know that hysterical symptoms need both parts of our mind to work together. The symptom isn’t just an unconscious wish coming true; it also needs another wish from the preconscious mind, and both wishes come together in the same symptom. So, the symptom has two causes, one from each part of the mind. Just like in dreams, there can be even more causes too.

The part that doesn’t come from the unconscious is usually a thought that fights against the unconscious wish, like a punishment. So, hysterical symptoms happen only when two opposite wishes from different parts of the mind come together in one expression.

Examples might not help much here because you need to understand the full details to get it. But I’ll give one example just to show what I mean. A woman’s hysterical vomiting was caused by an unconscious wish from puberty to be pregnant all the time and have many children with many fathers. But against this huge wish, a strong reaction appeared. Vomiting could ruin her looks, so she wouldn’t be attractive to men anymore. This matched the punishing thought, so both wishes were allowed to happen, and the symptom appeared.

This is like the queen of the Parthians who poured molten gold down the throat of Crassus’ dead body, saying, “Here’s what you wanted!” We know dreams show unconscious wishes, and the conscious mind lets these wishes happen but only after changing them a bit. We can’t always find a clear opposite thought in dreams like in symptoms, but sometimes we see signs of it, like in the dream about my uncle’s friend.

The missing part from the conscious mind might show up somewhere else. Dreams show unconscious wishes by changing them in different ways, especially when the conscious mind wants to keep sleeping. The conscious mind helps the dream by holding on to the wish to keep sleeping during the whole sleep.

This strong desire to keep sleeping helps dreams form. Like in the dream of the father who thought his child’s body caught fire because of a light from the death room. One reason he dreamed this instead of waking up was the wish to keep his child alive for a little longer. Other wishes might be hidden because we can’t analyze the dream fully. Another reason was the father’s wish to keep sleeping, so the dream lasted longer. His hidden thought was, “Let the dream keep going, or I’ll have to wake up.” This happens in many dreams, where the wish to sleep supports the unconscious wish.

We talked about dreams that happen for convenience, but really all dreams do this. The wish to keep sleeping is most obvious in dreams that happen right before waking up. These dreams change outside noises into parts of the dream so you can keep sleeping instead of waking up. This wish to keep sleeping also helps all other dreams, which can disturb sleep from inside.

The mind sometimes tells us, “Don’t worry; keep sleeping; it’s only a dream,” even if we don’t say it out loud. This shows how the main part of our mind feels about dreaming. I think we are as sure we are dreaming as we are sure we are sleeping.

Some people can actually stay aware at night that they are sleeping and dreaming. They can even control their dreams. For example, one person didn’t like how a dream was going, so he stopped it without waking up and started a new one with a happier ending, like changing a story. Another time, a dream put him in a sexual situation and he thought in his sleep, “I don’t want to finish this dream and get tired; I’ll save it for real life.” The Marquis Hervey said he could speed up his dreams and change them however he wanted. It seems his wish to keep sleeping included another wish: to watch and enjoy his dreams.
