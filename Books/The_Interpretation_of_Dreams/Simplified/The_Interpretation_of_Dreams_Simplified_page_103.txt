Someone might say that our dreams do show logical connections because sometimes dreams include complicated thinking—arguments, jokes, and comparisons—just like when we’re awake. But this can be misleading. If we look closer, all these things are just parts of the dream itself, not real thinking happening inside the dream. The dream shows the content of the thoughts, but not how those thoughts connect or relate to each other, which is what real thinking is about. For example, speeches in dreams are usually copied or only a little changed from things already remembered in the dream. Sometimes the speech only hints at something in the dream, but the real meaning is different.

Still, I won’t argue that some critical thinking happens in dreams—that is, thinking that doesn’t just repeat dream material. I’ll explain this later. This thinking happens because of the dream, but only after the dream is mostly finished.

For now, we can agree that logical connections between dream thoughts aren’t clearly shown in the dream itself. For example, if there’s a contradiction in a dream, it’s either a problem in the dream itself or inside one dream thought; it doesn’t directly show a contradiction between dream thoughts.

But just like painters found ways to show feelings like kindness or threat in their paintings without using words, dreams have found ways to show some logical connections using their special style. Some dreams ignore logic completely, while others try to show it as much as possible. In doing so, the dream changes the original material more or less, and the way it shows time or order can also change.

So, how do dreams show these tricky connections? I will list some ways.

First, dreams show connections between all the parts of the dream-thoughts by putting them together as one scene or story. This is like a painting that shows a group of thinkers or poets all in one place, even though they were never really together. The dream acts like this, grouping related parts close together to show they’re connected.

When two things appear close in a dream, it means they are strongly connected in the dream-thoughts too. This is like writing: if letters are together without a space, they form one syllable; if there is a space, they belong to different words. So, dream parts aren’t random; they’re connected in the dream-thoughts as well.

To show cause and effect, dreams use two main methods that are really the same. Usually, the dream shows the reason first, then the result. For example, if the dream-thought is “Because this happened, that happened,” the dream first shows the cause in a short part, then the main dream shows the effect. Sometimes, the order can be reversed. The main part of the dream is always the most detailed.

A great example of this came from a female patient’s dream, which I will share later.

Her dream started with a short scene where she scolds two maids in the kitchen for taking too long to prepare a small snack. She sees lots of heavy kitchen tools upside down, stacked to dry. The maids go to get water and seem to have to climb into a river that reaches the house or yard.

Then the main dream begins. She is climbing down from a high place over a strange trellis and is happy her dress doesn’t get caught.

The first part refers to her parents’ house. The words she hears in the kitchen are probably things her mother said often. The piles of pots and pans came from a simple shop in the same house. The second part hints at her father, who annoyed the maids and got sick during a flood because the house was near the river. The hidden thought behind the first part is something like: “Because I was born in this house, in these poor and unpleasant conditions.”
