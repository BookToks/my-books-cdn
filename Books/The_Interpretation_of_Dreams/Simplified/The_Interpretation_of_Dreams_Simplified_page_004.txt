Nature isn’t magical or holy; dreams aren’t supernatural messages, but follow the rules of our minds, which are connected to something bigger. A dream happens because your mind works while you sleep. Aristotle knew some things about dreams. For example, he noticed that small feelings in sleep can become really strong in dreams, like feeling you’re walking through fire when your body is just a little warm. He thought dreams could help doctors spot early signs of illness that people don’t notice during the day.

Long ago, people before Aristotle thought dreams came from gods, not from the mind. Even then, there were two ideas about dreams. Some dreams were seen as true warnings or predictions about the future, while others were useless or meant to trick people.

A scholar named Gruppe talked about this old way of sorting dreams, using ideas from Macrobius and Artemidorus. They said dreams were in two groups. The first group was about things happening now or in the past and didn’t matter for the future. This included dreams that just showed hunger or fear, like nightmares. The second group was about the future. These included direct messages in dreams, predictions, and symbolic dreams that needed to be explained. This way of thinking lasted for a long time.

People have always tried to understand dreams because they thought dreams could tell us important things. But not every dream is easy to get, and sometimes it’s hard to know if a confusing dream really means something important. So, people tried to change strange dreams into clear, meaningful stories. Artemidorus of Daldis became famous for his knowledge about dream meanings, and his work helps us now because similar old writings are lost.

The old ideas about dreams fit with how people back then saw the world. They believed dreams came from outside the mind, like from another world, which explains why dreams feel strange when we wake up. Even today, some people still believe dreams come from supernatural forces, including smart people who don’t usually believe in magic. Some thinkers, like those in the school of Schelling, still believe dreams have a special power, like predicting the future. This is because psychology hasn’t fully explained all dream experiences, even though science tries to reject superstitions.

It’s really hard to write a clear history of what we know about dreams scientifically. Even though some knowledge is useful, we haven’t made big, clear progress. Every new writer starts from scratch when explaining dreams. If I listed all these authors and their ideas in order, it would be confusing and not give a clear picture. So, I chose to talk about dreams by topic instead of by author, using what I found in books.

I haven’t read everything about dreams because the information is spread out and mixed with other subjects. So, I hope readers accept this summary as it is, as long as it doesn’t miss any important facts or views.

Most writers used to talk about sleep and dreams together, also including things like hallucinations or visions.

But lately, writers focus more on dreams alone. I think this shows that people believe we’ll understand dreams better by studying them carefully in small parts.
