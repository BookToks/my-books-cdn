You and I have rarely understood each other well. But when we got stuck in a tough situation, we immediately understood each other!

This idea comes from the book The Psycho-pathology of Everyday Life.

The statement "Whatever stops the work is resistance" might be misunderstood. It’s really just a rule for analysts to watch out for. Sometimes things happen during analysis that aren’t caused by the person being analyzed. For example, a patient’s dad might die naturally, or a war might interrupt the process. Even though this statement is a bit exaggerated, it still has useful meaning.

Even if something outside the patient causes trouble, how much it affects the patient often depends on them. Resistance shows up when the patient uses these problems as excuses too much.

Dreams sometimes show doubt and uncertainty, focusing on one small detail. In my General Introduction to Psycho-Analysis, there’s an example of a skeptical lady whose dream was analyzed successfully after a short delay.

People often forget things on purpose, as explained in The Psycho-pathology of Everyday Life.

Dreams sometimes include mistakes in foreign languages, but we usually think foreigners make those mistakes. For example, Maury once dreamed he told someone, "I called for you yesterday," but the other person corrected him, saying, "You mean: I called on you yesterday." Ernest Jones mentions that during the analysis of one dream, people often remember another dream from the same night that they hadn’t noticed before.

Dreams from early childhood, remembered clearly even after many years, are very important for understanding a person’s development and mental problems. Analyzing these dreams helps doctors avoid mistakes.

Ed. von Hartmann also thought that unconscious ideas guide our thoughts, even if we don’t realize it. He said that every idea combination isn’t random but directed by unconscious interests. Even when we think we’re just letting our mind wander, unconscious feelings and moods influence which ideas come up. This means our thoughts are never completely free from purpose.

In semi-conscious dreams, only ideas related to the main unconscious interest at that moment appear. Because feelings and moods guide our thoughts, psycho-analysis is a good way to understand the mind.

Du Prel noticed that when we suddenly remember a name we couldn’t recall before, it shows there’s unconscious thinking working behind the scenes, and the result pops into our awareness.

Jung supported this idea with his studies of dementia praecox (a mental illness). The same ideas apply when dreams show surface-level associations, like those Maury reported.
