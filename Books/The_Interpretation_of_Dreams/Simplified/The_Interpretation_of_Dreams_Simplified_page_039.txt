We know exactly how the infection started. My friend Otto recently gave her an injection when she was feeling sick. It was some kind of chemical—propionic acid or something like that.

You shouldn’t give injections without being careful. The syringe was probably dirty too.

This dream is different from others because it clearly connects to what happened the day before and what it’s about.

The beginning explains this. I had heard from Otto about Irma’s health, and I was writing about her case late at night. These thoughts stayed with me even when I was asleep. But no one reading the report or knowing the dream would understand what it really means. Honestly, I don’t know either. The symptoms Irma complains about in the dream aren’t the ones I treated her for. I find the idea of injecting propionic acid silly, and Dr. M’s comforting words don’t make much sense. The end of the dream feels more confusing and faster than the start.

I decide to study the dream carefully to understand all these details.

The hall – we’re hosting some guests. That summer we lived at Bellevue, a house on a hill near Kahlenberg. It was built for parties, so the rooms were big and tall. The dream happened at Bellevue a few days before my wife’s birthday. During the day, my wife said she expected friends, including Irma, to come for her birthday. So the dream shows us getting ready for the party, with guests like Irma in the big hall.

I scold Irma for not taking the “solution” I offered. I say, “If you still hurt, it’s really your fault.” I might have said this when I was awake too. Back then, I thought my job was only to explain the hidden meaning of symptoms. Whether patients accepted the solution or not, I wasn’t responsible for that. I’m glad I realized later this was wrong because it made my life easier when people expected me to cure them. But in the dream, I’m mainly worried I won’t be blamed for Irma’s pain. If it’s her fault, it can’t be mine. Maybe the dream’s point is about this.

Irma complains about pain in her neck, belly, and stomach; it feels like she’s choking. She had some stomach pain before, but it wasn’t strong; she mostly felt sick and nauseous. Neck and belly pain and throat tightness weren’t part of her real symptoms. I wonder why I picked those symptoms in the dream—I don’t know yet.

She looks pale and swollen. My patient always looked rosy. Maybe the dream is mixing her up with someone else.

I get worried I might have missed some real physical illness. This is a common fear for doctors like me, who mostly see patients with nervous problems and often think symptoms are just psychological. But I also wonder if this worry is honest. If Irma’s pain is really physical, it’s not my job to fix it. My treatment only helps nervous pains. I feel like I want to find a mistake in the diagnosis so I won’t be blamed for not curing her.

I take her to the window to look at her throat. She resists a bit, like someone with fake teeth. I think she doesn’t need fake teeth. I had never checked Irma’s mouth before. This reminds me of a time I examined a governess who seemed young and pretty but hid her false teeth. Other memories of awkward medical exams pop up – moments when small secrets came out, making both doctor and patient embarrassed. Saying “she doesn’t need them” might be a compliment to Irma, but I feel there might be another meaning. Careful thinking helps find hidden thoughts. The way Irma stands at the window reminds me of another time. Irma has a close woman friend I respect a lot.

One evening, I visited this friend and found her standing by the window just like in the dream. Her doctor, Dr. M, said she had a diphtheria membrane in her throat. Dr. M and the membrane appear again in the dream. I now remember I thought this friend might also have nervous problems. Irma even told me this herself.

But what do I really know about this friend? Only that, like Irma in the dream, she has nervous throat problems. So in the dream, I swapped my patient with her friend. I also thought this friend might ask me to help her, but she’s very private and resists help. Or maybe she doesn’t need it because she’s strong enough to handle things on her own. There are still a few details in the dream—pale, swollen, fake teeth—that don’t fit Irma or her friend. The fake teeth remind me of the governess. I think maybe it’s just bad teeth. Another person with these features comes to mind. She isn’t my patient, and I don’t want her to be, because she doesn’t feel comfortable with me and isn’t easy to treat.

She usually looks pale, and once, when she wasn’t feeling well, she looked swollen. So I’ve mixed Irma with two other women who would resist treatment. Why did I swap her with her friend in the dream? Maybe I want to replace her—either I like her friend more or I think she’s smarter.
