Sometimes, people become artists without even realizing it, and the story they tell about something keeps repeating until they truly believe it happened. They honestly think it’s a real fact, proven the right way. Spitta says that when we try to remember dreams, we organize the random pieces into a clear story by adding logical connections that weren’t actually in the dream. Since we can only check if our memory is right using outside proof, and since dreams are personal and we only have our memory to rely on, how much can we trust what we remember about our dreams?

E. The Special Features of Dreams

When scientists study dreams, they start by assuming dreams come from our own mind. But the finished dream feels strange to us, like it’s from somewhere else. We might say “A dream came to me,” instead of “I dreamed.” Why do dreams feel so different? It’s not because the stuff in dreams is different from real life—dreams usually have the same content as when we’re awake. Maybe the difference comes from how our mind works during dreams, and that might be what makes dreams unique.

G. Th. Fechner thought a lot about how dreams and waking life are different. He said it’s not just that our mind is less active or distracted during sleep. Instead, he believed that dreaming happens in a different mental “place” than waking life. If dreaming was just a weaker version of waking thoughts, dreams would be similar to our waking ideas. But they aren’t. Fechner’s idea wasn’t very clear and no one really followed it, but maybe dreaming uses different connected mental systems. It’s not about parts of the brain or brain cells, but maybe about how our mind works in layers.

Other writers have focused on certain obvious features of dreams to try to explain them better.

One important thing about dreams shows up even when we’re falling asleep. Schleiermacher said that when we’re awake, our mind works mostly with ideas, not pictures. But dreams mainly use pictures, and as we get sleepy, it becomes harder to control our thoughts, while images start to appear more. When we dream, we lose the ability to think ideas on purpose, and instead, we see pictures in our mind. This happens every time we dream and is a key part of what makes dreams special.

These images, called hypnagogic hallucinations, are the same as dream images. Dreams mostly think using pictures, but they also use sounds and other senses a bit. Like when awake, we also think using words or ideas, but what makes dreams different is the strong presence of images that feel like real experiences instead of just memories. Experts say dreams replace thoughts with hallucinations, meaning the mind creates fake sights and sounds. For example, a tune you hear while falling asleep can turn into a full hallucination of that melody in your dream, which then fades when you wake, only to come back again when you fall asleep.

Turning ideas into hallucinations isn’t the only way dreams differ from waking thoughts.

Dreams take these images and create a scene. They show something like it’s really happening—they act out an idea, as Spitta says. But this only makes sense if we admit that when dreaming, we usually don’t think “I’m dreaming” but instead believe everything is really happening. We accept the hallucinations completely and without doubt.
