Dreams are remembered just as well as other mental activities. I found this out when I was working on this book. I had written down many of my own dreams that I couldn’t understand at the time. A year or two later, I tried to figure them out again. I was always successful, and actually, it was easier to understand them after some time had passed. I think this happened because I had gotten over some of the mental blocks I had when I first dreamed them.

When I looked at the old thoughts from those dreams, they were still there and hadn’t changed. I wasn’t surprised because I was used to interpreting dreams my patients told me about, even if those dreams had happened years ago, as if they were recent. Later in the book, I will share two examples of interpreting dreams long after they happened.

At first, I thought dreams would act like nervous symptoms. When I treat patients with mental health issues, I often look for reasons behind their first symptoms, even if those symptoms happened a long time ago. Usually, it’s easier to understand old symptoms than the current ones. For example, in a study from 1895, I explained a hysterical attack a patient had when she was fifteen, even though she was over forty when I treated her.

Now, I want to give some tips for people who want to try interpreting their own dreams.

Don’t expect it to be easy. It takes practice to notice small details in dreams. It’s even harder to find the ideas you don’t want to face. To do this right, you have to follow some rules: don’t judge yourself, don’t assume anything, and don’t let your feelings or thoughts get in the way.

You have to be patient and work hard, like the scientist Claude Bernard said: “Work like an animal.” If you do this, dream interpretation will become easier.

Sometimes, you won’t understand everything in one go. After thinking about some parts, you might feel tired and need to stop. It’s better to come back the next day and look at other parts. This way, you slowly uncover more meaning in the dream. This method is called “fractional interpretation.”

Beginners often think they are done once they find one clever explanation that fits the whole dream. But that’s not true.

A dream can have more than one interpretation, and sometimes you might miss some meanings. Dreams can be very tricky because they mix many hidden thoughts at once, using clever ways to express them.

Some people might think I’m being too detailed, but anyone who has tried interpreting dreams knows it’s necessary.

On the other hand, I don’t agree with the idea that every dream needs two completely different interpretations. One theory says dreams have a sexual meaning and a deeper, more spiritual meaning. But this isn’t true for most dreams.

Most dreams don’t need to be over-interpreted, and they don’t have secret spiritual meanings. Sometimes, dreams do try to show complicated thoughts from real life by using symbolic ideas. When this happens, the dreamer can understand the surface meaning easily, but the true meaning is found by careful analysis.

Not every dream can be fully understood. Dreams are often changed by mental forces that hide their true meaning. Whether you can break through these blocks depends on your interest, self-control, knowledge, and experience.

Still, you can always make some progress. Usually, you can tell that a dream means something and get an idea of what it means. Often, another dream can help confirm and add to your understanding of the first one.
