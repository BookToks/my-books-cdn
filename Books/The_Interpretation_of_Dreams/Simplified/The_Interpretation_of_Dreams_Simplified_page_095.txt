Dr. Koenigstein reminds me of a conversation I had with him the night before about how doctors pay each other for their work. This talk is what started the dream. The part about the cyclamen plant in the dream is also real, but less important. I now see that the plant part in the dream mixes two things from my day: a boring detail and the interesting talk with Dr. Koenigstein. The plant part connects to the important experience through many thoughts.

Not only the whole idea of the plant monograph but also the words “botanical” and “monograph” themselves link to many parts of the dream. The word “botanical” brings up memories of Professor Gartner (his name means gardener in German), his wife, my patient named Flora, and a story I told about forgotten flowers. Gartner reminds me of the lab and my talk with Koenigstein. The two female patients also tie back to that talk. The lady with flowers leads me to think about my wife’s favorite flowers and the title of the plant book I saw quickly. The word “botanical” also makes me remember school, a university test, and my hobbies. My favorite flower, the artichoke, connects my hobbies to the forgotten flowers. The artichoke makes me think of Italy and a childhood memory where I first got close to books. So, “botanical” is like a center where many dream thoughts meet, all linked to the conversation I had. It’s like a factory where many threads are woven together quickly.

The word “monograph” in the dream is about two things: how focused my studies are and how expensive my hobbies are.

From this, I think the plant and monograph parts were in the dream because they connect to many other dream thoughts. They are like meeting points for lots of ideas and important for understanding the dream.

This shows that every part of the dream is “overdetermined,” meaning it shows up many times in different dream thoughts.

We can learn more by looking at other parts of the dream. For example, a colored picture in the dream links to a new topic: criticism of my work by others. It also connects to my hobbies and a childhood memory of tearing apart a book with colored pictures. The dried plant in the dream relates to my school herbarium experience, making this memory stronger. So, the dream parts and dream thoughts connect in many ways. One dream part leads to many thoughts, and one thought appears in many dream parts. The dream isn’t made by just picking one thought for each part. Instead, the whole bunch of thoughts is worked over, and the strongest ideas show up clearly. It’s like picking the best representatives from a list. No matter what dream I study, I find this same rule: each dream part comes from many thoughts and has many meanings.

It’s helpful to show this with another example that’s even more tangled. This dream comes from a patient with claustrophobia (fear of small spaces). I call this dream “A Beautiful Dream” because it is very clever. In the dream, the person is driving with many friends on X-street, where there’s a small inn (which isn’t real). There’s a play happening in one room. The dreamer watches, then acts in the play. Later, the group is told to change clothes to go back to the city. Some go to rooms on the ground floor, others upstairs. Then there’s an argument. The people upstairs are mad because those downstairs haven’t finished changing, so they can’t come down. The dreamer’s brother is upstairs; he is downstairs and upset with his brother because they’re in a rush.
