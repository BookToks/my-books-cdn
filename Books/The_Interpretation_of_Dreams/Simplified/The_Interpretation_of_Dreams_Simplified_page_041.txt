It feels really unfair. So, I need to believe that things will turn out okay, and I think I made a smart choice by putting comforting words into Dr. M’s mouth. But here I am acting like I’m better than the dream, and I should explain why.

Why does this comfort feel so weird and wrong?

Dysentery. It’s some complicated idea that the body might get rid of disease toxins through the intestines. Am I making fun of Dr. M’s strange ideas and his habit of coming up with odd medical theories? Dysentery reminds me of something else. A few months ago, I was taking care of a young man with serious stomach problems. Other doctors thought he was just weak and malnourished, but I realized it was hysteria. I didn’t want to treat him with therapy, so I sent him on a sea trip. A few days ago, he wrote me a sad letter from Egypt saying he got sick again, and the doctor there said it was dysentery. I think the doctor made a mistake because of the hysteria, but I still feel bad for sending him where he could catch a real sickness. Also, dysentery sounds a bit like diphtheria, a word not in the dream.

Yes, it must be that with the hopeful prediction about dysentery, I’m making fun of Dr. M. I remember he once joked about a doctor who found albumen in a sick woman’s urine. His colleague wasn’t worried and said, “That’s okay, the albumen will be excreted soon.” So now I’m sure that part of the dream is mocking doctors who don’t understand hysteria. I even wonder if Dr. M knows that Irma’s friend’s symptoms, which made him fear tuberculosis, are also caused by hysteria. Has he figured it out, or is he fooled? Why do I treat this friend badly? Simple: Dr. M doesn’t agree with my ideas any more than Irma does.

So, in this dream, I’ve already taken revenge on two people: on Irma by saying, “If you still have pain, it’s your own fault,” and on Dr. M with the silly comforting words I put in his mouth.

We know exactly how the infection started. This fact in the dream is strange because just before, we didn’t know there was an infection until Leopold showed it.

My friend Otto gave her an injection not long ago when she was feeling bad. Otto told me once that he had to give a shot to someone who suddenly got sick at a nearby hotel. Shots remind me of another unlucky friend who poisoned himself with cocaine. I told him to only take it by mouth to help him stop morphine, but he gave himself cocaine shots right away.

With some kind of propyl... propyls... propionic acid. How did I think of that? The day after I wrote about the case and dreamed it, my wife opened a bottle of pineapple-flavored liqueur from our friend Otto.

Otto likes giving gifts all the time; I hope a wife will stop him someday. The liqueur smelled so strong of fusel oil that I didn’t want to drink it. My wife said, “Let’s give it to the servants,” but I objected, saying, “We can’t poison them.” The smell of fusel oil (amyl...) made me remember a whole list: propyl, methyl, and others, which led to the propyl in the dream. I changed it a bit: I dreamed of propyl after smelling amyl, but that kind of change is okay, especially in organic chemistry. Trimethylamin. In the dream, I see its chemical formula, written big and bold, like it’s really important. 

Where does trimethylamin take me? To a chat with another friend who knows all my ideas, and I know his. He had told me about sexual chemistry and said trimethylamin might be a product of sexual metabolism. So this word leads me to sex, which I think is the main cause of the nervous problems I’m trying to fix. My patient Irma is a young widow; if I have to explain why I couldn’t cure her, it might be because of that, which her admirers want to fix. But the dream is strange—my friend, who becomes my patient in the dream instead of Irma, is also a young widow.

I guess why the trimethylamin formula is so important in the dream. A lot depends on that word: it hints at sexuality and reminds me of a friend whose support I really appreciate when I feel alone in my ideas. This friend is a big part of my life and will probably show up again in my strange dream thoughts. He knows a lot about nose and sinus problems and has found cool connections between certain nose bones and female sexual organs (like the three curly shapes in Irma’s throat). I asked him to check Irma to see if her stomach pain might actually come from her nose.
