Now we understand what this function is. The dream takes over the job of controlling the excitement in the unconscious mind (Ucs), which was left uncontrolled, and brings it back under the control of the preconscious part of the mind. This way, the dream releases the excitement from the unconscious, acting like a safety valve, and at the same time, by using a little bit of waking activity, helps keep the preconscious asleep.

So, like other mental activities in its group, the dream works as a compromise, helping both the unconscious and preconscious systems by fulfilling wishes from both, as long as those wishes don’t clash. Looking at Robert’s "elimination theory," we agree with his main idea about what dreams do, even though we see some things differently about how dreams work in general.

But it’s important to remember that this second function of dreaming isn’t part of how we interpret dreams. Planning ahead, making decisions, or trying to solve problems while dreaming are actually functions of unconscious and preconscious thinking that continue from the day and mix with unconscious wishes to form dreams. So, thinking ahead in dreams is more like waking thoughts that continue during sleep, and we can learn about these by analyzing dreams or other things.

Since dreams have been connected so much with what they show on the surface, we have to be careful not to mix up the dream itself with the hidden thoughts behind it.

The part that says the two wishes have to be compatible also hints that sometimes dreams don’t work right. Dreams usually fulfill unconscious wishes, but if doing this bothers the preconscious so much that it can’t stay calm, the dream breaks the compromise and fails its job. When that happens, the dream stops and you wake up. But this isn’t really the dream’s fault. Sometimes, what usually helps can become a problem if the conditions change. This problem can actually help by showing something has changed and making the body adjust. Here, I’m talking about anxiety dreams, and I want to explain them a bit because they seem to go against the idea of wish-fulfillment.

It’s no longer strange to us that a mental process causing anxiety can still be a wish-fulfillment. This happens because the wish belongs to one part (the unconscious), while the other part (the preconscious) rejects and blocks it. Even in healthy minds, the preconscious doesn’t fully control the unconscious. How much it blocks shows how normal our mind is. Neurotic symptoms show that these two parts are in conflict. These symptoms are compromises in this fight and stop it for a while. They give the unconscious a way to release its energy, like an escape route, and let the preconscious control the unconscious somewhat.

For example, think about hysterical phobia or agoraphobia. A neurotic person might be scared to cross the street alone, which is a symptom. If you force this person to do it, they get an anxiety attack—just like how anxiety causes agoraphobia in the first place. This shows the symptom was made to stop anxiety from breaking out. The phobia acts like a fortress blocking the anxiety.

We can’t go deeper into this here because we’d have to talk about emotions, which is a big topic on its own.

So, we say the main reason the unconscious needs to be blocked is that if its ideas were allowed to flow freely, they would create feelings that used to feel good but now, because of repression, feel painful. The goal and result of blocking these ideas is to stop this pain from developing. The blocking also stops the ideas themselves because the pain might come from them.

We think of feelings as actions in the body, and their control comes from unconscious ideas. The preconscious blocks these ideas, stopping them from triggering feelings. If the preconscious stops blocking, unconscious excitement could release feelings that now only cause pain or anxiety because of earlier repression.

This danger is avoided if the dream process runs its course. For this to happen, repressions must have taken place, and the blocked wishes must be strong enough. These wishes are outside the usual way dreams form. If it weren’t for the connection between dreams and anxiety, I wouldn’t even talk about anxiety dreams and all the confusion they bring.

The idea of anxiety dreams is part of studying neuroses. Anxiety in dreams is more about anxiety itself, not about dreams. Now that we see how neurosis psychology connects with dreaming, we don’t need to discuss it further. The only thing left is that since neurotic anxiety starts from sexual causes, I can analyze anxiety dreams to show the sexual ideas in them.
