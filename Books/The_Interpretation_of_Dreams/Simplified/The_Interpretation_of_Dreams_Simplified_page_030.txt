Scherner doesn’t think that the symbolizing part of dreams really has a useful job. In dreams, our mind just plays around with the things it notices. You could say it plays in a tricky or playful way. Some might wonder if studying Scherner’s dream ideas, which don’t follow normal research rules and seem random, can actually help us understand anything.

But it wouldn’t be fair to ignore his theory without checking it out first. His ideas come from his own dreams and careful attention to them, and he seems pretty good at noticing strange mental stuff. Also, dreams have been a mystery to people for thousands of years. Science hasn’t really explained much about them and often just denies their meaning, even when many people believe in their importance.

We have to admit that explaining dreams often involves some imagination. Even scientific explanations about how brain cells wake up in the morning can sound just as strange as Scherner’s ideas. I hope to show that there’s some truth behind Scherner’s thoughts, even if his ideas aren’t widely accepted or clearly proven yet.

For now, Scherner’s dream theory shows us how uncertain and open to different opinions the study of dreams still is, especially compared to medical ideas.

When talking about dreams and mental illness, there are three ways they can be connected: (1) how dreams might cause or happen during mental illness, (2) how dreams change when someone has a mental illness, and (3) how dreams and mental illnesses might be closely linked in some deep way.

Doctors have been interested in this for a long time, and recently some researchers like Sante de Sanctis have studied it more. We’ll just take a quick look at this important topic.

About how dreams and mental illness connect, here are some examples: Hohnbaum says the first time someone goes crazy often comes after a scary dream, and the main idea in the dream is linked to the illness. De Sanctis says the same about paranoid people, calling the dream “the real cause of madness” in some cases.

Sometimes the illness starts suddenly with a dream that explains it in a false but convincing way. Other times, the illness grows slowly through more dreams that the person doubts at first. One case showed a strong dream followed by small hysterical attacks, then deep sadness. Another example is a dream that caused temporary paralysis.

In some cases, symptoms of the illness appear just in dreams, or the illness only shows up in dreams. Thomayer talks about anxiety dreams being like epilepsy fits. Allison described people who act fine during the day but go crazy at night with nightmares and hallucinations. De Sanctis and Tissie share similar stories, like an alcoholic having paranoid dreams or someone hearing voices accusing their wife.

Tissie recorded many recent cases where weird behavior started in dreams, based on false beliefs or strong urges. Guislain even told about someone who stopped sleeping and became insane on and off.

We can be sure that one day doctors will study not just what dreams mean but also how they relate to mental illnesses.

When people recover from insanity, their dreams might still show signs of the illness even if they seem fine during the day. Gregory was the first to notice this. Macario told about a man who, a week after getting better, still had crazy and wild dreams like when he was sick.

Not much research has been done on how dreams change in people with long-term mental illness. But people have noticed for a long time that dreams and mental illness share many features. Maury, Cabanis, Lelut, Moreau, and the philosopher Maine de Biran all talked about this connection.

Even older ideas compared insanity to dreaming. Radestock shared many opinions on this. Kant said, “The lunatic is a dreamer while awake.” Krauss said, “Insanity is a dream with open eyes.” Schopenhauer called a dream a short insanity and insanity a long dream. Hagen said delirium is like dreaming caused by sickness, not sleep. Wundt said that in dreams we can experience almost everything we see in insane people.

So, dreams and mental illness are closely connected in many ways, and understanding one could help us understand the other better.
