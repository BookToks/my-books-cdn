Also, and this might be important when thinking about dreams, the root of this wish came from a memory from the dreamer’s earliest childhood. When she was a little kid—but we can’t say exactly when—she heard that her mom, while pregnant with her, had been really sad and had even wished the baby would die. Now that the dreamer herself had grown up and was pregnant, she was kind of following what her mom had done.

If someone dreams that their mom, dad, brother, or sister has died and feels sad in the dream, it doesn’t mean they want that person to actually die now. The theory of dreams says this only shows the dreamer once wished that person dead as a child. I think some people will still argue they never had those thoughts, just like they say they don’t want anyone to die now. So, I need to explain some hidden childhood feelings based on what we see today.

Let’s first think about how kids feel about their brothers and sisters. We usually assume kids love their siblings, but actually, fights and hate between brothers and sisters happen a lot, even when they are adults. Many adults who now get along well with their siblings actually fought a lot with them as kids. Older kids might have been mean, lied about, or taken toys from younger ones; younger kids might have been angry, jealous, or scared of the older ones. Parents often say kids just don’t get along and don’t know why.

It’s not hard to see that kids don’t always act like the adults we want them to become. Kids are very selfish; they know what they want and try hard to get it, especially when competing with others, especially siblings. But we don’t call kids bad for this—we say they are “naughty.” They aren’t responsible for their bad behavior, not in our eyes or by law. This is good because we expect kids to start caring about others and learning right from wrong as they grow.

Morals don’t grow all at once, and some kids take longer than others to learn them. If morals don’t grow, people say someone is “degenerate,” which means their development stopped. Sometimes, when someone has a mental illness like hysteria, parts of their childhood “naughty” behavior can come back. Another illness, obsessional neurosis, is like having extra-strong morals to stop bad behavior from coming back.

So, a lot of people who now love their siblings and would be sad if they died still have hidden, angry feelings from when they were kids. It’s especially interesting to watch how little kids, up to about three or four years old, act toward younger brothers or sisters. At first, the child was the only kid, then they hear a new baby is coming. The kid looks at the baby and says clearly, “The stork should take it back!” I believe kids can understand that a new sibling might cause problems for them.

For example, a friend who now gets along great with her younger sister said when she first heard about the baby, “But I won’t give her my red cap.” If a child only realizes later that a new brother or sister might make them less happy, they may get upset right then. I know a case where a girl under three tried to strangle a baby because she thought the baby would ruin her happiness. Kids that young can feel very jealous and angry.

Sometimes a younger sibling even dies early, and the older child gets all the attention again. Then if another baby comes, the older child might wish the new baby would die too so things could go back to how they were. But usually, this attitude is just because of the age difference. After some time, the older child’s caring feelings toward the baby will grow.

Kids probably feel more anger toward siblings than adults realize. I didn’t get to watch this with my own kids because they were born close together, but now I see it with my little nephew. He was the boss until his baby sister came when he was fifteen months old. Even though he is polite and gentle with her, I can tell that before he turned two, he was already using words to complain about her, saying “Too little, too little!” Later, when she grew and got better, he found another reason to be annoyed: “She hasn’t any teeth.”

We all remember a story about my niece’s oldest daughter. When she was six, she spent half an hour asking different aunts, “Lucie can’t understand that yet, can she?” Lucie was her younger sister by two and a half years, and the older girl saw her as a rival.
