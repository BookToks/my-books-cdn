Here is the main dream I didn’t mention before. It’s strange and hard to understand because of the weird words in it.

Something is happening in Rome, so the children have to run away. They do. The scene takes place at a big old gate (the Porta Romana in Siena, which I realized while dreaming). I’m sitting on the edge of a well and feeling very sad, almost about to cry. A woman—a nurse or a nun—brings out two boys and gives them to their father, who isn’t me. The older boy looks exactly like my oldest son, but I can’t see the younger boy’s face. The woman asks the older boy for a goodbye kiss. She has a red nose. The boy refuses to kiss her but holds out his hand and says “Auf Geseres” to her, and “Auf Ungeseres” to one or both of us. I think this shows he prefers something.

This dream is full of mixed-up thoughts from a play I saw called Das neue Ghetto (The New Ghetto). It’s about Jewish problems, worries about my children’s future because they don’t have a homeland, and concerns about how to raise them so they can have the same rights as citizens. These ideas show up in the dream.

The phrase “By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept” comes to mind. Siena, like Rome, is famous for its beautiful fountains. In the dream, I try to find a place that can stand in for Rome, a place I know. Near the Porta Romana in Siena, there was a big, bright building called the Manicomio, which is an insane asylum. Before the dream, I heard about someone like me who had to quit a job at a State asylum, which was hard to get.

The words “Auf Geseres” caught my attention because you’d expect “Auf Wiedersehen” (goodbye) instead. And “Auf Ungeseres” doesn’t make sense. A Hebrew expert told me “Geseres” is a real Hebrew word meaning “ordained sufferings” or “fated disaster.” It’s used in Jewish slang to mean “wailing and crying.” “Ungeseres” is a word I made up, and it puzzles me. But I think “Ungeseres” means something better than “Geseres,” like unsalted caviar is better than salted. This is a joke about someone in my family who I hope will take care of my children’s future. The nurse in the dream also stands for a real nurse in my house.

There’s a missing link between salted and unsalted, and “Geseres” and “Ungeseres.” It’s the words “gesauert” and “ungesauert,” which mean leavened and unleavened bread. When the Israelites fled Egypt, they didn’t have time to let their bread rise, so they still eat unleavened bread at Passover. This made me think of a time when my friend and I were walking in Breslau during Easter. A little girl asked me for directions, but I didn’t know the way. I hoped she’d be smarter later in life about who she trusts. Then I saw a sign for “Dr. Herod, consulting hours...” and joked to myself that I hoped this doctor wasn’t a kid’s doctor. My friend was talking about biology and said, “If we had only one eye in the middle of our forehead, like Cyclops...” This reminded me of a professor’s words from an earlier dream: “My son, the myopic.” 

Years ago, this professor’s son had an eye problem. The doctor said it was okay as long as it was only one eye, but if both eyes got sick, it would be bad. The problem went away in one eye, but then started in the other. The boy’s scared mother called the doctor again. This time the doctor said, “What kind of ‘Geseres’ are you making? If one eye got better, the other will too.” And that’s what happened.

How does this connect to me and my family? The school bench where the professor’s son learned is now my oldest son’s. It was given to him by the boy’s mother. In the dream, I put the farewell words into my son’s mouth. The bench is meant to help keep the child from getting nearsighted or one-sided. So myopia (nearsightedness) and the idea of one eye or two eyes, like the Cyclops, are important. Being one-sided can mean physically or mentally one-sided. The dream’s crazy scene seems to challenge this worry. The boy says goodbye but also says the opposite, trying to balance things out. He acts like he follows the idea of having two equal sides.

So, dreams can have deep meaning, even when they seem weird. People who couldn’t say what they really thought without trouble often pretended to be crazy. Those who heard the hidden message might laugh and think it’s silly, so they wouldn’t get upset. Dreams act like the prince in a play who has to pretend to be mad. Like Hamlet said, “I am but mad north-northwest; when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.” This means dreams don’t really make no sense. The weird parts happen because the dream’s ideas include criticism, jokes, or teasing, and they have to be shown somehow.
