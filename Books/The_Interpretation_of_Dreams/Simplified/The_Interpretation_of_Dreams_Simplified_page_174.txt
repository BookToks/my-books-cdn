Some things we don’t finish during the day because something unexpected happens.

Some problems stay unsolved because our brain gets tired.

Some thoughts get pushed away or ignored during the day. There’s also a strong group of thoughts that come from our unconscious mind working with the thoughts we are aware of.

Finally, some things just don’t seem important and get left unsettled.

We should not underestimate how these leftover thoughts from the day affect our sleep, especially the unsolved problems. These thoughts keep trying to come out while we sleep, but since we’re asleep, they can’t reach full awareness like they do when we’re awake.

If we do become aware of our thoughts at night, then we’re not truly asleep. I don’t know exactly what changes happen in the part of our mind that deals with thoughts when we sleep, but sleep mainly changes how energy flows there, and it also stops us from moving.

On the other hand, sleep doesn’t seem to change the unconscious mind much. So, the thoughts from the part of the mind we are aware of during the day have to get help from the unconscious to appear in our dreams.

What about the leftover thoughts from the day and how they show up in dreams? They definitely appear a lot in dreams. They use the dream to push themselves into our awareness even at night. Sometimes, these leftover thoughts even take over the dream and make it continue the work of the day. These thoughts don’t always have to be wishes; they can be anything.

It’s interesting and important to understand what dreams need to accept these thoughts.

For example, I had a dream about my friend Otto, who looked like he had a certain disease. I had been worried about him during the day, and this worry affected me a lot.

I think that worry came with me into my sleep. I wanted to find out what was wrong with him. My worry showed up in the dream I recorded. The dream didn’t make much sense and didn’t show any wish being fulfilled.

I looked deeper to find out why the dream was so strange. I realized I had mixed up my friend Otto with someone else and myself with a different person. This happened because deep down, I had an old, hidden wish to be great, which I linked to that person.

Some bad thoughts about my friend, which I wouldn’t accept when awake, sneaked into the dream. But my worry still found a way to show up through a substitute in the dream.

The worry itself wasn’t a wish but had to connect with a hidden wish from childhood, which was asleep in my mind. This connection allowed the worry to come into consciousness, though disguised. The stronger the worry, the more forced this connection had to be, and the wish and worry didn’t have to be related.

Now, what happens when a dream has thoughts that go against wish-fulfillment, like real worries, sad thoughts, or upsetting truths? There are a few possibilities:

(a) The dream changes all the painful thoughts into opposite, happy ones and blocks out the bad feelings. This makes the dream a clear wish-fulfillment.

(b) The painful thoughts show up in the dream more or less unchanged. These dreams can feel neutral, sad, or even cause anxiety that wakes the person up.

Even these painful dreams are actually wish-fulfillments. A hidden wish that would cause pain if realized directly uses the energy of the painful day-thoughts to come out in the dream.

In case (a), the hidden wish and the conscious wish match. But in case (b), the hidden wish and the conscious mind don’t agree, showing the conflict inside.

Sometimes the pleasure from the hidden wish balances the pain from the day-thoughts, making the dream feel neutral. Other times, the conscious mind gets very upset and ends the dream with anxiety.

So, dreams that seem painful or scary are just as much wish-fulfillments as the happy dreams.
