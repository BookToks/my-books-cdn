At the start of the treatment, I had to tell her that I didn’t have much time for her right now, but later I would spend a whole hour with her every day. This made her very sensitive, which is common in kids who might become hysterical. These kids really want love and attention all the time. She was the youngest of six kids and her dad’s favorite, but she still felt like he didn’t pay enough attention to her.

She waited for me to say, “It is not true,” because of a dream about a little tailor’s apprentice who brought her a dress. She paid for it, then asked her husband if she would have to pay again if the boy lost the dress. He teased her by saying “Yes,” and she kept asking until she wanted him to say it wasn’t true. This dream means she worries she might have to “pay double” for the extra time I would give her—like being greedy or stingy about money, which often shows up in kids’ dreams as being “dirty.”

The part about her waiting for me to say “It is not true” is like a code for the word “dirty.” In her childhood, she once soiled her bed and was punished by being put in the corner and told her dad wouldn’t love her anymore. Her siblings laughed at her then. The little squares in the dream relate to her young niece, who showed her a math trick with nine squares that add up to fifteen in any direction.

Here is a man’s dream: He sees two boys fighting. They are coopers’ boys because of the tools nearby. One boy has thrown the other down. The boy on the ground is wearing earrings with blue stones. The man runs toward the boy who threw the other down, holding a cane to punish him. The boy hides behind a woman who looks like his mom, standing by a wooden fence. She turns her back to the man, then suddenly looks at him with a scary face, so he runs away scared. Her eyes look red and swollen.

This dream uses small things from the day before. The man actually saw two boys fighting, and when he tried to stop them, they ran away. The “coopers’ boys” part comes from another dream where he used the phrase “to knock the bottom out of the barrel.” Earrings with blue stones are usually worn by prostitutes, which is linked to a rhyme about two boys, where one was really a girl named Marie.

The woman by the fence is related to the man’s walk along the Danube river, where he urinated behind a wooden fence. Later, a nice older lady smiled at him and gave him her card. Since the woman in the dream stood where he had stood while peeing, the scary look and red eyes probably represent a woman urinating, showing her private parts as he saw them when he was a kid. The dream mixes memories of when he saw little girls’ genitals as a boy, once by pushing a girl down and once while she was peeing. He also remembers being punished or threatened by his dad for being curious about this stuff.

An old lady had a dream full of childhood memories: She rushes out to do some shopping. On a street called the Graben, she suddenly falls to her knees like she’s broken. People gather around, especially cab drivers, but no one helps her up. She tries hard but fails. Finally, she must get up because she is put into a cab to go home. Someone throws a big basket after her through the window.

This woman is often bothered in her dreams, just like she was as a child. The part where she falls comes from seeing a fallen horse and links to horse racing. When she was young, she rode horses, and before that, she might have imagined being a horse. Falling down reminds her of a story about a boy who had an epileptic seizure and was taken home by cab. She never saw it herself but heard about it, and this idea affected her imagination and her own hysterical attacks later.

When a woman dreams about falling, it usually has a sexual meaning: she feels like a “fallen woman.” In this dream, she falls on the Graben street in Vienna, known for prostitutes. The basket thrown after her can mean more than one thing. In German, “Korb” (basket) also means “rejection,” reminding her of the many times she rejected suitors or thought she was rejected. No one helping her up feels like being looked down on.

The basket also connects to her imagining that she married below her class and now works as a market woman. Lastly, the basket might remind her of being a servant. This brings up childhood memories of a cook who was fired for stealing and begged on her knees for forgiveness, just like the lady did in her dream.
