I wake up feeling scared, even though I try to think that maybe my kids will do what I couldn’t. This thought comes up again: a strange story about a character who stays the same for two thousand years through many generations.

In another dream, I feel surprised by what happens. This dream is so strange and complicated that I have to think about it carefully, especially because it has two other interesting parts. On the night of July 18, I was on a train called the Southern Railway. In my sleep, I heard someone say: “Hollthurn, 10 minutes.” I immediately thought of Holothuria – a natural history museum – and a place where brave men tried but failed to fight their ruler. I thought about the counter-reformation in Austria, as if it was a place in Styria or Tyrol. I saw a small museum with old things these men had collected. I wanted to get off the train, but I wasn’t sure if there was time. There were women on the platform with fruit, sitting on the ground and holding out their baskets. I hesitated because I didn’t know if we were still stopped. Suddenly, I was in another train car where the seats were so narrow my back touched the seat behind me. I was surprised but thought maybe I changed cars while asleep. There were several people, including an English brother and sister, and a shelf with books. I saw The Wealth of Nations and Matter and Motion by Maxwell, big books with brown covers. The man asked his sister about a book by Schiller, wondering if she forgot it. Sometimes the books seemed to belong to me, sometimes to them. I wanted to join the conversation but woke up sweating because all the windows were closed. The train stopped at Marburg.

While writing down the dream, I remembered a part I almost forgot. I told the brother and sister (in English) about a book: “It is from…” but then I corrected myself: “It is by…” The man said to his sister, “He said it right.” The dream started with a station name, which almost woke me up. I first heard Marburg, but then I changed it to Hollthurn.

I knew I heard Marburg first because of the mention of Schiller, who was born in Marburg—not the one in Styria. Even though I was traveling first class, it wasn’t nice. The train was crowded. In my compartment, there was a lady and a man who looked fancy but didn’t hide that they didn’t want me there. They didn’t answer my polite hello, and the woman quickly took the seat opposite her and shut the door, with some rude comments about opening windows. It was a hot night, and the air was stuffy. I think people who act like that often haven’t paid for their tickets fully or at all. When the conductor came, I showed my ticket, but the lady said proudly, “My husband has a pass.” She looked strict and unhappy, and the man didn’t say anything. I tried to sleep.

In my dream, I got terrible revenge on those rude travel companions. Nobody would guess the insults and humiliation hidden in the first part of the dream. After that, I wanted to change my compartment. The dream changed scenes so much that it would have been easy to imagine nicer people instead. But something stopped me from changing and had to explain why. How did I get into another car? I couldn’t remember moving. The only explanation was that I left the car while asleep, which is unusual but known to happen. Some people travel in a half-awake state and only realize it later when they notice missing time. So, in my dream, I said I was one of those people.

There is another way to think about this. The strange explanation in the dream isn’t original—it comes from my patient’s problem. I talked before about a smart, kind man who, after his parents died, started thinking he might kill someone. He was very worried and took many precautions because of these bad thoughts. He felt bad walking outside because he thought he had to keep track of everyone he saw. If someone disappeared from his view, he felt terrible, thinking he might have hurt them. He also felt like Cain, because “all men are brothers.” He stopped going outside and stayed inside his house. But news about murders still came to him through newspapers, and he wondered if he might be the killer the police wanted. He knew he hadn’t left the house for weeks, which helped him feel safe—until one day he thought maybe he left the house without knowing it, asleep. After that, he locked his front door and gave the key to his old housekeeper, telling her never to give it back, even if he asked.

So, this is where the idea in my dream comes from—that I might have changed train cars while asleep. It came from what my patient thought, and my dream used this idea to connect me with him. Thinking about this patient came naturally to my mind.
