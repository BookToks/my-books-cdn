In this group of dreams, we noticed the influence of something called dream-censorship. Clear wish-dreams were mostly found in children; simple and honest wish-dreams also seemed to happen sometimes in adults.

Now, we can ask where the wish that shows up in the dream comes from. But what do we compare it to? I think it’s the difference between our conscious daily life and an unconscious part of our mind that only shows itself at night. So, there are three possible places a wish can come from. First, it might have started during the day but didn’t get fulfilled because of outside reasons, leaving an obvious and unsatisfied wish at night. Second, it might have come up during the day but was pushed away, so it becomes a hidden wish at night. Third, it might not have anything to do with the day but comes from deep inside us, only waking up at night.

If we think about how the mind works, a first kind of wish stays in the conscious mind. A second kind gets pushed back into the unconscious, where it hides. The third kind stays completely unconscious. Now, do wishes from these different places have the same power to cause dreams?

Looking at the dreams we have, we add a fourth kind of wish: one that happens right during the night, like feeling thirsty or wanting something. It seems the source of the wish doesn’t change how likely it is to cause a dream. For example, a child might dream about continuing a trip that had to stop during the day because their wish wasn’t finished. Lots of examples show that wishes pushed away during the day come back in dreams. One simple example is a sarcastic woman who had to say nice things about her friend’s fiancé even though she thought he was boring. That night, she dreamed she gave a funny, secret reply instead. Many analyses show that wishes in all distorted dreams come from the unconscious and can’t be noticed during the day. So, it looks like all wishes are equally important in making dreams.

I can’t prove this is wrong, but I think there might be a stricter rule about which wishes make dreams.

Children’s dreams clearly show that wishes not met during the day can cause dreams. But remember, these are children’s wishes, which are very strong. I doubt that an adult’s unfulfilled wish during the day is enough to make a dream. As we grow up and learn to control our feelings with our minds, we stop having such strong wishes like kids do. People are different, though; some keep their childlike way of thinking longer than others, just like some people have stronger imaginations. But mostly, I believe that adults don’t dream just because of unfulfilled daytime wishes. Conscious wishes might help start a dream, but they probably can’t do it alone.

That other source is the unconscious mind. I think a conscious wish only causes a dream if it wakes up a similar unconscious wish that makes it stronger. From studying mental problems, I believe these unconscious wishes are always there and ready to show themselves when they connect with a conscious wish, adding their power to it. So, it might look like only the conscious wish is in the dream, but a small detail in the dream shows that the unconscious wish is there too. These hidden wishes are like giant Titans from old myths, trapped under mountains but still moving sometimes. These wishes come from childhood, as we learn from studying mental illnesses. So, I want to change my earlier idea: it does matter where the wish comes from. The wish in a dream has to be a childhood wish. In adults, it comes from the unconscious, but in children, who don’t yet have a strong mental system to hide their wishes, it comes from unfulfilled wishes from their waking life. I know this can’t be proven everywhere, but I think it’s often true, even when it’s not expected, and it can’t be disproved either. In making dreams, wishes left over from conscious daytime life are less important. I don’t think they do much except add real-life feelings to the dream.

Now, if I think about other thoughts from the day that are not wishes, this fits with what I’m saying. Sometimes we can decide to stop thinking and go to sleep easily. People who can do this well are good sleepers; Napoleon was said to be one of them. But we don’t always manage to stop thinking completely. Problems, worries, or strong feelings keep our minds active even during sleep, keeping some thoughts going in a part of the mind called the preconscious. These thoughts during sleep can be grouped in different ways: 1.
