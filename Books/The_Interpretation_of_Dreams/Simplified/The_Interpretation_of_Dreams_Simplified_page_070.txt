"So, will you find more pleasure every day from the wisdom you learn," is very different from the worries that bother me when I dream. Then, I remember another teacher whose name sounds like food (Fleischl means meat and Knodl means dumplings). There’s a sad scene involving skin scales (like a mother or hostess), mental confusion (from a novel), and a medicine from the kitchen that stops hunger, which is cocaine.

I could follow my complicated thoughts even further and explain the part of the dream that wasn’t analyzed. But I must stop because it’s too personal to share. I’ll only talk about one part that leads us to the main dream-thoughts. There’s a stranger with a long face and pointed beard who tries to stop me from putting on my coat. He looks like a cloth seller from Spalato, where my wife bought a lot of Turkish fabric. His name was Popovic, which sounds suspicious, and even made a humorist joke about it. I also find the same kind of funny name mix-ups with other people I know.

Playing with names like this is childish. If I do it, it’s revenge because my own name has been joked about too many times. Goethe once said people are very sensitive about their names because they feel their names fit them like their own skin. Another writer, Herder, wrote a poem about his name, saying that whether you come from gods, Goths, or mud, in the end, everyone turns to dust. I know this talk about names is just to explain my complaint. But let’s stop here.

The cloth purchase in Spalato reminds me of another time in Cattaro when I was too careful and missed a great deal. (Missing an opportunity like missing the wet nurse’s breast.) One dream-thought caused by hunger means this: We should never miss a chance; we should take what we can, even if it’s a bit wrong; life is short, and death is certain. Since this also means sexual desire, and desire doesn’t want to stop even if it feels wrong, this idea of "seize the day" has to hide behind a dream because it’s risky. So, many opposite thoughts come up, like remembering when spiritual food was enough, and feeling blocked or even threatened by ugly sexual punishments.

A second dream needs a longer introduction: I went to the Western Station to start a holiday trip to the Aussee but got on the platform just in time for the earlier Ischl train. I saw Count Thun, who was going to see the Emperor at Ischl. It was raining, but he came in an open carriage, walked right through the gate for local trains, and waved away the gatekeeper who didn’t know him and wanted to check his ticket. After he left on the train, I was told to leave the platform and go back inside. After some trouble, I got permission to stay.

I watched how many people bribed the officials to get a compartment and planned to complain and ask for the same favor. I sang to myself a song from The Marriage of Figaro: "If my lord Count would dance, let him say so, and I will play the tune." Maybe others wouldn’t have recognized it. That evening, I was in a good, bold mood; I joked with the waiter and cab driver and hoped I didn’t hurt their feelings. All kinds of bold and rebellious thoughts came to me, fitting the words of Figaro and memories of Beaumarchais’ play.

I thought about great men who bothered to be born, about the lordly right Count Almaviva wants over Susanne, and about jokes that mean-spirited journalists make about Count Thun’s name. They call him Count-Do-Nothing because "Thun" sounds like "to do" in German. I don’t envy him; he has a tough meeting with the Emperor, and I’m the real Count-Do-Nothing because I’m off on vacation. I made all kinds of fun plans for the holiday.

Then a man I know from government medical exams showed up. He’s nicknamed "the Governmental bed-fellow" because of his job. By using his official status, he got half of a first-class train compartment. I heard a guard say, "Where will we put the man with half a first-class compartment?" That’s favoritism! I paid for a whole first-class compartment. I did get a whole compartment, but not in a through carriage, so there was no bathroom inside during the night. My complaints didn’t help, so I joked that they should at least make a hole in the floor for passengers to use if needed.
