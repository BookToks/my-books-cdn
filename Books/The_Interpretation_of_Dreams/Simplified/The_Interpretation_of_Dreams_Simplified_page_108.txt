Before going any further, we need to clear up some common ideas that people usually expect. Since real feelings you have while sleeping can be part of your dreams, people might think these feelings make parts of the dream super intense. Or they might think that if something in the dream feels really clear and strong, it probably comes from those real feelings during sleep. But from my experience, this isn’t true. The parts of a dream that come from real feelings don’t stand out more than the parts that come from memories. Whether something feels real doesn’t decide how strong it looks in a dream.

You might also think that the clearer or stronger images in a dream match how important those thoughts are in the dream’s story. In dreams, the most important ideas are the most intense, and they usually form the main point of the dream. But actually, those important ideas often don’t show up openly in the dream because of a kind of mental “censorship.” Sometimes, parts related to these important ideas appear in the dream but aren’t the main focus or very intense. When we look closely, the intensity of dream images doesn’t match the importance of the ideas behind them. In fact, the meaning of things often flips around between the dream’s story and its images. The part of a dream that seems weak or unclear sometimes turns out to be the key part of what the dream is really about.

So, what makes dream images strong or clear? It turns out there are two separate reasons. First, the parts of the dream that show a wish being fulfilled are usually the strongest. Also, the clearest parts of a dream help start the most ideas or thoughts. The strongest images are also the most carefully created by the mind working hard to put together different ideas into one. So, we can say that the clearest dream parts are those made by combining many pieces of thought. This idea, along with the wish-fulfillment idea, can probably be explained by one rule.

I want to warn you that the question about why some parts of a dream are clearer or stronger is different from the question about why some dreams or parts of dreams seem more clear or confusing overall.

In the first case, the opposite of clear is hazy or blurry; in the second, it’s confusion. It’s true that when a dream feels clear, it usually has strong images, and when it feels unclear, the images are weaker. But understanding why an entire dream feels clear or confusing is more complicated than just looking at how strong the images are. I won’t go into that now, but it’s important to know the difference.

Sometimes, you might be surprised to find that whether a dream feels clear or not depends on the stuff the dream is made of, not its structure. For example, I once had a dream that seemed really clear and perfect when I woke up. I even thought maybe there’s a new kind of dream that doesn’t change or mix things up like usual dreams. But after looking closer, I saw this dream had the same problems as all dreams. So, I stopped thinking there was a special kind of “perfect” dream.

The dream was basically me explaining a complicated idea about being attracted to both genders to a friend. The dream made this idea seem clear and perfect, but I didn’t actually explain it during the dream. The dream’s wish-fulfillment made it feel that way. What I thought was a clear judgment about the dream was actually part of the dream itself. The dream mixed into my waking thoughts and showed me part of the dream that it couldn’t clearly show in the dream pictures.

Once, a woman didn’t want to tell a dream because it seemed so hazy and confusing. Later, she said she thought the dream had several people in it—herself, her husband, and her father—but she wasn’t sure who was who. When we compared the dream to her thoughts during the session, it was clear the dream was about a maid who has to admit she’s pregnant and people wondering who the father is. The confusion in the dream was actually part of the dream’s meaning. The dream’s form or the way it’s told often hides its real meaning surprisingly well.

Comments about dreams, even small ones, often hide parts of what the dream is really about, though they also accidentally reveal them. For example, a dreamer said, “Here the dream was wiped out,” which led to remembering a childhood memory about hearing someone clean themselves after using the bathroom. 

Another example is a young man who had a clear dream that reminded him of childhood fantasies he still remembered. He dreamed he was in a hotel at night and accidentally went into a room where an old lady and her daughters were getting ready for bed. He said parts of the dream were missing, and at the end, a man tried to kick him out, and they had to fight. He couldn’t remember what the childhood fantasy was about, but we realized he had already given the meaning in what he said about the unclear part of the dream.
