The impression from that time must be why, until just before I went to university, I wanted to study law, but I changed my mind at the last moment. A doctor can’t become a minister. Now about my dream: I only now see that it takes me from the gloomy present to the hopeful days of the middle-class government, and it perfectly matches what I wanted when I was young. In the dream, I treat my two smart and respected Jewish coworkers badly—one like he’s dumb, the other like a criminal. I act as if I were the Minister. I put myself in his place. What revenge I take on him! He didn’t make me a professor, so in my dream, I become him.

In another case, I notice that although the dream is about a wish I have now, it’s made stronger by childhood memories. I’m talking about dreams about wanting to go to Rome. For a long time, I’ll probably only be able to travel there in my dreams because, during the time of year I can travel, Rome isn’t good for my health. In one dream, I see the Tiber River and the Sant’ Angelo bridge from a train window, but then the train leaves, and I realize I never actually entered the city. The view came from a picture I saw the day before at one of my patients’ houses.

In another dream, someone takes me up a hill and shows me Rome covered in mist and far away, but the view is clear. This dream is too detailed to explain fully here. The main idea is “to see the promised land from far away.” The city I saw in the mist was actually Lubeck, and the hill was the Gleichenberg. In a third dream, I’m finally in Rome, but it looks nothing like a city. Instead, there’s a small stream with black water, black rocks on one side, and meadows with big white flowers on the other.

I see a man named Herr Zucker (someone I barely know) and decide to ask him to show me the way into the city. It’s clear I’m trying, but failing, to picture a city I’ve never seen while awake. If I break down the scene, the white flowers remind me of Ravenna, a city I know, which once took Rome’s place as Italy’s capital. There were beautiful water lilies in the marshes near Ravenna, growing in black pools. The dream moves them to the meadows because it was hard to pick them from the water. The black rock near the water makes me think of the Tepl valley at Karlsbad.

Karlsbad helps me explain why I ask Herr Zucker for directions. The dream includes two funny Jewish stories with deep, sometimes bitter, wisdom that we like to share in letters and talks. One story is about a poor Jew sneaking on the Karlsbad train without a ticket. He’s caught and treated worse each time the conductor checks tickets. When a friend asks where he’s going, he says, “To Karlsbad—if my constitution holds out.” The other story is about a Jew who doesn’t know French and must ask for Rue Richelieu in Paris. Paris was my big dream for many years, and the first time I walked its streets, I felt sure other wishes would come true too.

Asking for directions in the dream is a direct hint to Rome because, as we know, “all roads lead to Rome.” Also, the name Zucker (which means sugar) points again to Karlsbad, a place where people with diabetes (called sugar disease) go for treatment. This dream happened after my Berlin friend suggested we meet in Prague at Easter. There might be another connection to sugar and diabetes in things I had to talk about with him.

A fourth dream, soon after the last one, brings me back to Rome. I see a street corner with lots of German signs. The day before, I wrote to my friend, guessing Prague wouldn’t be a good place for German travelers. So the dream shows I want to meet him in Rome instead of Prague and also hope that German would be more accepted in Prague. Actually, I probably understood Czech when I was very young because I was born in a small Moravian village with mostly Slavic people. I remember a Czech nursery rhyme I heard when I was seventeen that stuck in my mind even though I don’t know what it means.

So these dreams also connect in many ways to my early childhood memories.

During my last trip to Italy, passing Lake Trasimenus, I finally realized how much my childhood memories made me want to see Rome even more. I had planned to travel to Naples through Rome the next year when a sentence came to me from a German classic: “Who paced his room more impatiently after planning to go to Rome—Assistant Headmaster Winckelmann or the great General Hannibal?”

I had walked where Hannibal had, but like him, I was never going to see Rome. Hannibal also went to Campania when everyone expected him in Rome. Hannibal was my favorite hero in school. Like many boys, I didn’t root for the Romans but for the Carthaginians during the Punic War.

When I realized I was part of a different race and faced anti-Jewish feelings from classmates, Hannibal became even bigger in my mind. Hannibal and Rome symbolized, to me as a kid, the fight between the strong will of Jews and the powerful Catholic Church.

The anti-Semitic movement later made those early feelings and memories even stronger. So, in my dreams, the desire to go to Rome has become a symbol for many important wishes that need the same stubborn focus as Hannibal had, even though they seem as far away as Hannibal’s dream to enter Rome.

And now, for the first time, I’ve found the childhood experience that still fuels all these feelings and dreams today.
