As science developed, people started to think differently about dreams. Doctors often think dreams don’t mean much and aren’t important. But philosophers and people interested in psychology, like amateurs studying the mind, usually agree with most people that dreams have psychological value.

Those who don’t think dreams are very active mentally focus more on physical causes of dreams. Those who believe the mind keeps most of its thinking abilities while dreaming don’t deny that dreams can be triggered by things happening inside the body. One impressive thing about dreams is memory. We’ve talked a lot about how dreams sometimes remember things better than when we’re awake.

Old writers said dreams can go beyond time and space, but this idea is just an illusion. As one expert noted, dreams ignore time and space the same way waking thoughts do because dreaming is just another form of thinking. People also say dreams can feel like they last longer than real time. For example, some dreams pack a lot of experiences into a short time. But scientists still argue about this, and there’s no final answer yet.

Many stories show that dreams can keep up with the thinking we did during the day, solve problems, and inspire artists and writers. This seems proven by many examples. But even if this is true, people still debate what it really means.

Finally, some say dreams can predict the future. This idea is very controversial. There are strong arguments against it, but some people keep believing it. We shouldn’t completely rule out that some cases might be explained by natural psychological reasons later on.

About morals in dreams, I looked into whether the feelings and values we have when awake also appear in dreams. Different writers disagree a lot about this. Some say dreams don’t follow moral rules at all, while others say our moral nature stays the same in dreams.

Most of our experience supports the first idea. One expert said we don’t become better people in our dreams; our conscience is quiet, so we can do bad things like stealing or hurting others without feeling guilty. Another said that in dreams, ideas and connections happen without any real thinking, reason, or moral judgment. Judging right and wrong is very weak, and people don’t care about ethics in dreams.

Some say dreams are especially wild about sexual things. The dreamer and others in the dream act without shame or morals, even doing things they would never think about when awake. But some disagree. One philosopher said that in dreams, people act exactly like they do in real life.

Another expert said that our feelings and desires show up clearly in dreams, and our morals are reflected there too. One said that good people stay good in their dreams, resisting bad temptations, while sinful people dream about things they see in real life.

Another expert said dreams show the truth about ourselves. Honest people don’t do dishonorable things in dreams, or if they do, they feel shocked by it. There’s a story about a Roman emperor who punished a man because he dreamed about killing the emperor, thinking dreams reveal true thoughts. We even say, “I would never dream of such a thing,” to show that some thoughts don’t even come to mind.

Plato thought the best people only have dreams like other people’s dreams, suggesting a connection between dreams and character.
