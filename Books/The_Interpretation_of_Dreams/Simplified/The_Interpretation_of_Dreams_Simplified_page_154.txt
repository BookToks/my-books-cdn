In dreams, understanding and organizing the dream happens not only using the dream itself but also using information from when we are awake. Because of this, people sometimes think that the whole dream is made by the mind right when we wake up. Some, like Goblot and Foucault, believed that waking thoughts create the dream from ideas that come up during sleep.

Leroy and Tobowolska said that people thought dreams happen at waking and that waking thoughts build the dream using images from sleep. But a new idea came from H. Silberer, who noticed how tired and sleepy thoughts can turn into pictures in the mind. When he was sleepy and trying to think hard, his clear thoughts disappeared and were replaced by images. These images didn’t show the original thoughts but instead showed how tired and struggling he felt. Silberer called this the "functional phenomenon," which is different from the usual "material phenomenon" he expected.

For example, Silberer said that once when he was very sleepy, he tried to compare two philosophers’ ideas about time. Because he was tired, he couldn’t keep both thoughts in mind. When he tried hard to focus, his mind created a clear picture like a dream: he saw a grumpy secretary refusing to help him. This picture showed his struggle, not the actual ideas he was thinking about.

Other examples show moments between sleep and waking. One time, while half asleep in the morning, he imagined stepping over a stream but pulling back, wanting to stay where he was. Another time, when he wanted to stay in bed a bit longer, he dreamed about saying goodbye to someone and planning to meet again soon.

To sum up, the question is whether the mind uses all its powers fully in making dreams or only some of them. The answer is more complicated. Dream-making has two parts: creating the dream-thoughts and turning those thoughts into the dream’s story. The dream-thoughts are clear and full of ideas, even if they’re unconscious. These thoughts are important but don’t explain everything about dreams.

The second part, changing these thoughts into the actual dream, is very different from how we think when awake. Dream-work doesn’t think, judge, or reason like waking thought. Instead, it changes the thoughts so they can appear in a dream without being stopped by the mind’s censorship. To do this, it moves feelings and ideas around and changes their importance, turning thoughts into pictures and sounds. It combines many ideas into fewer images and doesn’t focus on logical connections. The feelings in the dream-thoughts are usually hidden or mixed together. Only part of this process is influenced by some waking thoughts when we start to wake up.
