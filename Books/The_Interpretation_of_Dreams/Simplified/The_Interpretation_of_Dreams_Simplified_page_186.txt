2. When feelings and ideas mix freely, they create new, combined ideas—kind of like compromises. This doesn’t usually happen in normal thinking, where we try to pick and keep the right ideas. But when we try to put unconscious thoughts into words, these mixed ideas happen a lot and show up as slips of the tongue.

3. The ideas that share feelings with each other are only loosely connected. They link through things like word sounds or jokes, which serious thinking usually ignores but humor uses a lot.

4. Opposite or conflicting thoughts don’t cancel each other out. Instead, they stay together and sometimes combine into new mixed ideas, acting like there’s no conflict. Sometimes, these compromises happen in our actions even if our thoughts wouldn’t agree with them.

These strange processes happen to the thoughts in dreams. The main goal is to keep the energy moving and able to be released, so what the thoughts actually mean becomes less important. You might think these mixes only happen when thoughts turn into pictures in dreams, but even dreams without images show the same mixing and moving of ideas.

So, there are two very different mental processes in making dreams. One makes clear and fitting dream-thoughts, like normal thinking. The other changes these thoughts in weird and “wrong” ways. We called this second process the “dream-work.” Where does this strange process come from?

We can’t answer fully without understanding more about mental illnesses like hysteria. In hysteria, the same “wrong” mental processes happen. At first, normal thoughts exist, but we don’t notice them directly—they only show up later when we analyze symptoms. These normal thoughts get changed by mixing, compromises, and covering up conflicts, and end up in symptoms. Because dream-work and these mental symptoms are so alike, we can apply what we learn about hysteria to dreams.

From hysteria, we learn that this weird mental mixing only happens when normal thoughts are used to carry hidden wishes from early childhood that are pushed away or repressed.

Using this idea, we built the dream theory on the belief that the wishes driving dreams always come from the unconscious mind. We can’t always prove this, but no one has shown it to be false either. To explain repression better, we need to add more to our psychological ideas.

We imagined a basic mental system that tries to avoid building up too much energy or excitement. It works like a reflex system, using movement to help release energy. We also said that when energy builds up, it causes pain, which makes the system try to get back to feeling good by reducing the energy. This desire to feel better is what we call a wish. Wishes are the only things that can start the system moving, and the system automatically follows feelings of pain and pleasure.

The first kind of wishing might have been imagining the feeling of satisfaction, but this only works if the imagination lasts long enough. If it doesn’t, the need stays and the pleasure doesn’t come.

So, a second process was needed. This part stops the imagined satisfaction from reaching our full awareness too early and instead directs the energy another way. This way uses voluntary movement to change the outside world, so we can actually see or get the thing that satisfies us. These two processes are the beginning of what we now call the unconscious (Ucs) and preconscious (Pcs) parts of the mind.
