When he wakes up, his feeling that things are real makes sense because his mom actually breastfed him longer than usual, and her breast was still there. The dream means: "Mom, please let me drink from your breast again, like I did before." The "before" is shown by eating one pear, and the "again" by wanting the other pear. In dreams, doing something again is often shown by having more than one of the same thing. It's surprising that even a four-year-old uses symbols in dreams, but this is normal. You could say people understand symbols from the very start.

People start using symbols very early, even when they're not dreaming. For example, a woman who is now 27 remembers when she was about four years old. Her nursemaid was taking her, her younger brother, and their cousin to the bathroom before a walk. She sat on the toilet seat, and the other two sat on small potty chairs. She asked her cousin, "Do you have a purse too? Walter has a little sausage, I have a purse." The cousin said she did have a purse too. The nursemaid laughed and told the mother, who scolded her sharply.

Here is a dream that can be easily understood because of its good symbolism. Some people argue that dream symbols only happen in people with mental problems, but actually, both healthy and sick people use the same symbols in their dreams. Healthy people’s dreams are often clearer and easier to understand because their minds don’t hide the symbols as much. The next dream is from a healthy girl who is shy and careful. She’s engaged to be married, but there are problems that might delay the wedding. She told this dream:

She was arranging flowers in the middle of a table for a birthday party. When asked, she said she felt happy and like she was at home, even though she didn’t have a home then.

I could understand the dream using common symbols. The table with flowers in the middle stands for her and her private parts. She’s thinking about her future and having a child, so the wedding feels like it already happened.

I pointed out that saying “middle of the table” was unusual, and she agreed. I didn’t tell her the meaning of the symbols but asked what she thought about each part. As we talked, she became more open and interested. When I asked about the flowers, she said they were expensive flowers you have to pay for. Then she named lilies-of-the-valley, violets, and carnations.

I knew lilies often symbolize purity, and she agreed, thinking of purity too. “Valley” is also a common symbol for girls in dreams. Putting these two words together made the flower a symbol for how precious her virginity is, something valuable that her future husband should appreciate. Saying “expensive flowers” means she thinks becoming a wife and mother will cost her a lot.

I tried to explain the word “violets” as related to the French word “viol” (meaning rape), but surprisingly, the girl thought of the English word “violate.” Because “violet” and “violate” sound similar, the dream uses the flower to show the idea of losing virginity in a painful way, and maybe also shows some secret feelings about this. This is a good example of how words can connect to hidden thoughts in dreams. “You have to pay for them” means she knows she will have to give up something important in life when she becomes a wife and mother.

When she talked about carnations, she first said she thought of the color, and that her fiancé often gives her these flowers. Later, she admitted she wasn’t telling the whole truth — the word she really thought of was “incarnation,” which means becoming flesh or a new being, exactly what I expected. Even the word “color” was connected because of the meaning of carnations.
