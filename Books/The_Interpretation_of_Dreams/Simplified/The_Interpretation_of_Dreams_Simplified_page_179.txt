Sleep works with wishes we have, just like it can work with a condition that makes us wake up (like a wet-nurse’s sleep). We also know that when people care more about their dreams, they remember more of them after waking up.

Ferenczi says that a dream takes whatever is on our mind and thinks about it from all sides. If a dream image might stop the wish from coming true, the dream drops it and tries a new way until it finally makes a wish-fulfilling dream that satisfies both parts of our mind.

Now that we understand that during the night our mind wants to keep sleeping, we can better understand how dreams work. First, let’s sum up what we know. Some thoughts from the day stay in our mind because they haven’t been fully dealt with. An unconscious wish might be triggered by these thoughts or might match something from the day. This wish tries to reach our consciousness by normal thinking paths but is stopped by a kind of mental “censorship.” It then gets changed and twisted because of this censorship.

Because we are asleep, the dream process takes a backward path, following memories that partly appear as pictures but not as clear symbols. As it goes backward, the dream becomes something we can see or imagine. The dream moves from unconscious scenes to the edge of censorship, then back toward what we can perceive. When the dream finally becomes like a perception, it has gotten past the censorship and sleeping block, and it can grab our attention.

Our consciousness can be excited in two ways: first, by what we perceive with our senses; second, by feelings of pleasure or pain from inside our mind. Other mental processes don’t have these feelings, so we don’t notice them consciously. Pleasure and pain help control how our mental energy moves. Later, to handle more complex thinking, the mind developed ways to make ideas grab our attention without relying on pain signals. This happened through connecting thought processes with language and memory, which have qualities that can attract consciousness.

During sleep, the part of consciousness linked to thought is less active than the part linked to perception. This makes sense because the mind wants to rest and not think too much at night. But when a dream turns into something we perceive, it can wake up our consciousness with its qualities. This waking effect makes the mind pay attention to the dream.

Because of this, the dream undergoes “secondary elaboration,” meaning it gets shaped to make more sense and be easier to understand, just like any other thing we perceive. This part of dreaming moves forward again.

About the timing of dreams, some say dreams only happen when we are waking up, like during the transition from sleep to being awake. They think the last picture of a dream is so clear it wakes us up, but it really looks clear because we are almost awake already. However, this idea ignores many facts, like dreams where we dream that we are dreaming, and dreams that don’t wake us up. From what we know about how dreams work, they don’t only happen during waking up.
