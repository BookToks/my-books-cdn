Volkelt says that memories from when we were babies or kids often show up in our dreams. Even things we stopped thinking about a long time ago can come back in dreams. Dreams can bring back childhood memories that we don’t usually remember when we’re awake, and these memories can make some really interesting dreams.

Maury tells a story about when he was a kid. He used to visit a nearby town called Trilport because his dad was helping build a bridge there. One night, he dreamed he was in Trilport again, playing in the streets. A man in a uniform came up to him and said he was a bridge guard named C. When Maury woke up, he asked his old servant if she remembered a man like that. She said yes, he was the watchman on the bridge his dad built. Maury shares another story showing that childhood memories in dreams can be very accurate.

Another person, M. F., had lived in a town called Montbrison as a child. After 25 years away, he planned to visit again. The night before, he dreamed he met a man near Montbrison who said he was a friend of M. F.’s father. M. F. remembered knowing a man like that as a child but couldn’t picture his face. When he actually visited Montbrison, he found the place from his dream and met the man, who looked older but was the same person.

I’ll share one of my own dreams. I saw a man who I knew was the doctor from my hometown. His face wasn’t clear, and it mixed with the face of one of my old teachers. I didn’t understand the connection until I asked my mom about the doctor. She said he had one eye. The teacher in my dream also had one eye. I hadn’t thought about the doctor for 38 years, but the dream brought back this memory, maybe because of a scar on my chin.

Some people say that most dreams are about things that happened recently, not from childhood. Robert says dreams usually focus on things from the last few days. This idea makes sense because it means the oldest memories stay in the background while recent ones come forward. I agree with this from my own research. Nelson, an American writer, says dreams often use memories from two or three days before, not just the day right before the dream.

Many researchers notice that we don’t usually dream about things that upset us a lot right away. For example, if someone we love dies, we don’t dream about them while we’re still very sad. But Miss Hallam found some cases where people did dream about such things, showing that dreams can be different for different people.

The strangest thing about dreams is that they don’t just show important memories but also random, small details. Hildebrandt says it’s weird that dreams pick up unimportant stuff instead of big events. For example, a serious death in the family might not appear in dreams, but a tiny thing like a wart on a stranger’s forehead, which we barely noticed, might show up. Strumpell talks about dreams using tiny details from recent days that we forgot quickly, like things we overheard, saw in passing, or read briefly.
