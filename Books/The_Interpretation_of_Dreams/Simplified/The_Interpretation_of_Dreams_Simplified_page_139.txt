But the study shows that in this case, the dream didn’t just copy things freely, but had to use parts from the actual thoughts behind the dream. It’s like when you copy an algebra problem with numbers, plus and minus signs, and other symbols, but you mix everything up without really understanding it.

The two ideas come from this: It hurts me to think that many of the guesses I base my psychological explanations on will make people doubt or laugh when they first hear them. For example, I have to say that memories from when a person was just one or two years old, or even younger, can leave a lasting mark on their emotions later in life. Even though these memories get mixed up and changed by time, they might be the main cause of some mental problems like hysteria.

When I tell patients this, they often joke about looking for memories from when they weren’t even born yet. My discovery that fathers play a hidden role in the early sexual feelings of female patients might also get the same reaction. But I truly believe both ideas are right. I remember cases where the father died when the child was very young, and later events showed that the child kept unconscious memories of the father. I know people will question these ideas, but the dream-work uses these very ideas to prove important points.

In one dream, which I only briefly mentioned before, the feeling of surprise is clear right at the start.

The older Brucke must have given me some task; oddly, it’s about preparing the lower part of my body, like the hips and legs. I see them as if in a dissection room, but I don’t feel anything missing or scary. Louise N is beside me, helping. The pelvis is opened up; sometimes I see it from above, sometimes below, and the two views mix together. I see big red lumps that remind me of hemorrhoids. Something on top of them, looking like crumpled tinfoil, had to be carefully removed. Then I had my legs again and took a cab through the city because I was tired. To my surprise, the cab drove right into the front door of a building, which opened and let it pass into a hallway that ended and then led outside.

Later, I traveled through changing landscapes with an Alpine guide who carried my stuff. He even carried me for a while because my legs were tired. The ground was swampy; we walked along the edge. People sat on the ground like Native Americans or gypsies, and there was a girl among them. Until then, I was amazed I could walk so well on the slippery ground after the preparation. Finally, we reached a small wooden house with an open window. The guide put me down and laid two planks on the window sill to cross a gap. That’s when I got really scared about my legs.

Instead of crossing, I saw two grown men lying on wooden benches fixed to the walls, and two sleeping children next to them. It looked like the children, not the planks, were supposed to help me cross. I woke up with scared thoughts.

Anyone who understands how much dreams mix things up can imagine how long it would take to fully analyze this dream. Luckily, I’ll only use this dream as an example of surprise in dreams, which shows up in the odd phrase “strangely enough.” Let’s think about what was happening before the dream.

A woman named Louise N, who helps me in the dream, says, “Lend me something to read.” I offer her *She* by Rider Haggard. I explain, “It’s a strange book, but full of hidden meaning; it’s about the eternal feminine and the lasting power of emotions.” She interrupts, “I already know that book. Don’t you have something you wrote yourself?” I say, “No, my own important works aren’t written yet.” She asks sarcastically, “When will you publish your so-called latest revelations that you promised we could understand?” Then I realize she’s speaking for someone else, and I stay quiet.

I think about how hard it was for me to share even my work on dreams, where I had to reveal so much of myself. The dream about preparing my body is actually about analyzing myself to share my dreams. The elder Brucke fits in here because early in my career, I delayed publishing a discovery until he insisted I do.

But the thoughts that come after talking with Louise are too deep to become clear; they get mixed with the ideas the book *She* brought up. The phrase “strangely enough” refers to this book and another by the same author, *The Heart of the World*. Many parts of the dream come from these stories. The swampy ground and the gap to cross come from *She*; the Native Americans, the girl, and the wooden house come from *The Heart of the World*. Both books have a woman leader and dangerous journeys. In *She*, the adventure ends with the heroine dying in a mysterious fire instead of becoming immortal. A similar worry appears in the dream thoughts.

The wooden house is also like a coffin, or grave. But the dream changes this scary idea into something better, a wish-fulfillment. I once visited an old empty Etruscan grave near Orvieto, a small room with two stone benches holding skeletons of two adults. The wooden house in the dream looks just like that grave, but with wood instead of stone. The dream seems to say, “If you have to be in a grave, let it be this one.” By adding this, the dream turns the saddest thought into something almost good. Unfortunately, as we’ll see later, dreams can only change the ideas around feelings, not always the feelings themselves.
