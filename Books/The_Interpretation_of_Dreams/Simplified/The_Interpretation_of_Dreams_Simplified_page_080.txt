Usually, not having enough clothes isn’t a big deal and doesn’t really deserve the shame people feel about it. For a soldier, being naked in a dream often changes into wearing clothes that don’t follow the rules. Like thinking, "I was outside without my sword, and I saw some officers coming," or "I didn’t have a collar," or "I was wearing casual pants," and stuff like that.

The people you feel embarrassed in front of are almost always strangers whose faces you don’t really see clearly. In typical dreams, no one actually scolds or even notices you for not having clothes. Instead, the people in the dream look bored or serious. This is something worth thinking about.

The dreamer feels embarrassed, but the people watching don’t care. This kind of contradiction happens a lot in dreams. You’d expect the strangers to be surprised, laugh, or get upset. But it seems like the dream changes the scene to make the embarrassment stay, while the reactions of others don’t match. This shows that the dream is partly a wish coming true, but also mixed up.

This idea connects to a famous story called The Emperor’s New Clothes by Andersen. In that story, two tricksters make a fake outfit that only “good and true” people can see. The Emperor walks around naked, but everyone pretends they can see the clothes because they’re scared to admit the truth.

This is like what happens in the dream. The strange dream parts help invent the idea of being undressed, which changes the real meaning of the memory and uses it for something else. Sometimes, our mind misunderstands the dream because of a second part of our mind that changes the dream’s meaning. This also happens with fears and obsessions. We can even guess where the new meaning comes from: the dream is the trickster, the dreamer is the Emperor, and the moral lesson hints that the dream hides secret wishes that are not allowed.

These dreams often come from early childhood memories. When we were little, family and strangers like nurses or visitors saw us with little or no clothes, and back then, we weren’t ashamed. In fact, many kids find being undressed fun and exciting, not embarrassing. They might laugh and move around, even if adults tell them it’s wrong. Kids often want to show themselves off. You can see little kids lifting their clothes to strangers sometimes, maybe as a way to get attention.

One patient remembered when he was eight and wanted to dance into his sister’s room wearing just a shirt, but a servant stopped him. For many kids, being seen undressed by kids of the opposite sex is important. In some mental illnesses, people think others are watching them undress, and some adults keep this childhood feeling and become exhibitionists.

Childhood without shame feels like a kind of paradise when we look back. That’s why in stories about paradise, people are naked and unashamed until shame and fear start, leading to being kicked out and the start of adult life and culture. Dreams can take us back to this childhood paradise every night. Early childhood memories want to be replayed just for fun, which is why nakedness in dreams is like showing off.

These dreams are mostly about yourself, not as a child but as you are now, mixed with memories of being partly clothed. The people who watch you and make you feel embarrassed in the dream are strangers, not the real people from your childhood. This is strange but true. People you were interested in as a child don’t usually show up in these dreams or in some mental health issues. Only paranoia brings back the real watchers and is sure they are there, even if they can’t see them.

The strangers in dreams represent a secret wish opposite to the one for a specific person who was really there. Having many strangers instead of one close person is common in dreams and always means a secret. Even paranoia follows this pattern. You’re not alone; you’re being watched, but by many strange people who look unclear.

Also, repression plays a role in these dreams. The uncomfortable feeling comes from the part of your mind that tries to stop the shameful scene from appearing but fails. The only way to avoid feeling bad is to stop dreaming about it altogether.
