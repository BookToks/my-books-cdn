Sometimes, when someone wants to make friends, they might get rejected. This can hurt a lot, and they might worry it will happen again, especially with a friend they like spending time with, like watching a show together. One person even admitted, feeling ashamed, that after being rejected, they felt such strong sexual feelings that they ended up touching themselves twice in a row.

Another dream this person had involved two university teachers they knew. One did something to his private parts, making him scared it was surgery. The other pushed an iron bar against his mouth, causing him to lose some teeth. He was tied up with four silk handkerchiefs.

This dream is clearly about sex. The silk handkerchiefs show he was thinking about a gay friend. Even though he never had sex with men or really tried, he imagined sex like the way he used to touch himself when he was younger.

Dreams about teeth often change because of feelings in the mouth, like someone pulling out a tooth. This happens because sometimes feelings that should be about private parts get moved to other body parts, like the face, to hide the real meaning. People even use words that connect body parts, like comparing the butt to cheeks or lips to parts of the body involved in sex. The nose is often compared to the penis, especially because of hair. Teeth don’t really fit these comparisons perfectly, which makes them good symbols to hide sexual feelings.

I’m sure that dreams about teeth relate to masturbation, but I don’t understand everything about it. There’s a phrase in Austria that means masturbation: “to pull one out” or “to pull one off.” I don’t know where these sayings come from, but teeth fit with the idea of pulling. People often think dreams about losing teeth mean losing a relationship, but psychology thinks that’s more of a joke than the real meaning.

Another group of common dreams are about flying, falling, swimming, or floating. What do these dreams mean?

We can’t say one thing for all of them. Each dream means something different, but they all come from similar feelings.

Psychoanalysis shows these dreams remind us of childhood memories—like the games kids play moving around a lot. Think about an uncle running with a kid on his arms, making them “fly,” or rocking a child then letting them fall a bit. Kids love these games because they feel exciting and fun, and they want to do them again, even if they feel a little scared or dizzy.

As people grow up, they might dream about these feelings again, but without the hands holding them. They imagine floating or falling on their own. Little kids love rocking and see-saw games, and watching gymnasts or circus performers can remind them of those fun feelings. Sometimes, even innocent games like these can bring up sexual feelings. In short, flying and falling dreams are like replaying childhood fun, but the feelings change from happy to a bit anxious. And, as every parent knows, kids’ play can often end with fights and tears.

So, I don’t agree with the idea that flying or falling dreams come from how our bodies feel during sleep, like breathing or moving. Instead, these sensations come from memories and become part of the dream itself.

The feelings of movement are used in dreams to show many different thoughts. Flying dreams usually feel good and can mean different things for different people. One patient often dreamed she was floating a little above the street without touching the ground. She was very short and didn’t like physical contact with others. Her dream of floating showed both her wishes: to be taller and to stay away from people.
