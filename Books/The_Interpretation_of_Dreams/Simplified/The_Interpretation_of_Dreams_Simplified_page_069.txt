The dreamer was twelve years old at the time. Then she remembers a maid who was fired because she had a relationship with the coachman, who later married her. This memory helps explain why the cab-drivers in the dream don’t support the fallen woman, unlike in real life. But why is the basket thrown through the window? This makes her think of sending luggage by train, a country tradition called Fensterln, and a summer holiday when a man threw blue plums into a lady’s window. Her little sister was scared because a strange man looked in through the window. Behind all this is a faint memory from when she was ten of a nurse who was loved by a servant and then both were kicked out. The dream says they were “thrown into,” like being thrown out. This idea shows up in different ways in the dream. In Vienna, a servant’s box is sometimes called “seven plums,” and people say “Pack up your seven plums and get out!”  

I have many dreams like this from patients, which often go back to childhood memories, sometimes from the first three years of life, but these memories are unclear or forgotten. However, it’s not always right to use these dreams to explain all dreams because they mostly come from people with nervous illnesses. The way childhood memories appear in these dreams might be because of the illness, not because all dreams work like this.  

When I analyze my own dreams, which I do even though I’m not seriously sick, I often find scenes from my childhood in the hidden meaning of the dream. A lot of my dreams focus on one childhood experience. I’ve already shared some examples and will share more. Maybe the best way to finish this part is by sharing some of my own dreams, where recent events mix with old childhood memories.  

I.

After traveling, when I’m hungry and tired, my basic needs come up in my dreams. I dream I go into a kitchen to ask for pudding. Three women are there, one is the hostess who is rolling something like dumplings. She says I have to wait until she finishes, but not clearly with words. I get impatient and leave feeling upset. I want to put on an overcoat, but the first one is too long. I take it off and notice it has fur on it. The second coat has a long strip of cloth with a Turkish pattern sewn on. A stranger with a long face and a short beard stops me from wearing it, saying it belongs to him. I show him the Turkish embroidery all over it. He asks, “Why do these Turkish designs matter to you?” But we soon become friends.  

While thinking about this dream, I suddenly remember the first novel I ever read, or actually started reading from the end when I was about thirteen. I never learned its name or author, but I remember the ending well. The hero goes crazy and keeps calling the names of three women who gave him the most happiness and the worst troubles. One of those names was Pelagie. I still don’t know what to make of this memory while analyzing the dream. Along with the three women, the three Parcae, or Fates who control people’s lives, appear. I know that one of the women, the hostess in the dream, is like a mother who gives life and, as in my case, gives the child its first food. Love and hunger come together at the mother’s breast.  

There’s a story about a young man who loved women’s beauty. When people talked about the wet-nurse who fed him as a baby, he said he wished he had taken better chances with her. I use this story to explain how memories from the past come back in mental illnesses.  

One of the Parcae in the dream is rubbing her hands like she’s making dumplings. That’s a strange thing for the Fates to do and needs explaining! This explanation comes from an older memory from when I was six. I was learning from my mother that we are made of dust and will return to dust. I didn’t like this idea and asked questions. Then my mother rubbed her hands together like making dumplings, but without dough, and showed me the old skin flakes falling off as proof we are made of dust. I was surprised and accepted this, later hearing the phrase, “You owe nature a death.” So, the women I visit in the kitchen, like when I was a hungry child waiting for lunch, are really the Parcae. And now about the dumplings!  

One of my university teachers, who taught me about skin (epidermis), would remember a man named Knodl (which means dumpling). This man had to be punished for copying the teacher’s work. Copying someone else’s work, or plagiarism, links to the second part of my dream where I’m treated like a thief stealing an overcoat. I wrote the word plagiarism without planning to, but now I see it fits the hidden meaning of the dream and connects its parts.  

The chain of thoughts goes like this: Pelagie – plagiarism – plagiostomi (sharks) – fish bladder – this connects the old novel to the story about Knodl and the overcoats. The overcoats (called “Uberzieher” in German) also mean a kind of protection used in sex. This is a strange and forced connection, but the dream made it happen, and I couldn’t have thought of it while awake. Nothing is safe from this way of linking ideas! The name Brucke (meaning bridge) reminds me of the place where I spent my happiest student days, feeling like I had everything I wanted.
