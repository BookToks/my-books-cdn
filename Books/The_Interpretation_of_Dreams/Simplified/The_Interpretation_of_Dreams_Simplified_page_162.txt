Maybe when the child said, "I am burning," it was because of the fever that later caused the child to die. And when the child said, "Father, don't you see?" it might have been about some other feeling or event we don’t know about.

Now that we understand dreams have meaning and relate to our feelings and thoughts, it might seem strange that this dream happened right before the father woke up. But even this dream has a kind of wish inside it. The dead child acts like he’s still alive; he warns his father himself; he comes to his father’s bed and holds his arm, just like he probably did in real life. Because of this wish, the father stayed asleep a little longer. The dream was more important than waking up right away because it showed the child still alive. If the father had woken up first and then gone to the child, the child would have been “dead” one moment earlier.

There’s no doubt that this short dream has special parts that make us very interested. So far, we have mostly tried to find the hidden meaning of dreams, how to discover it, and how dreams hide it. In other words, we have focused on how to understand dreams. But now, we see a dream that is easy to explain and clearly shows its meaning. Still, this dream keeps the main features that make dreams very different from our waking thoughts, and this difference needs to be explained. Only after solving the problems of understanding dream meaning do we realize that our psychology of dreams is still not complete.

Before we move on, let’s stop and think if we missed something important. We need to know that the easy part of our journey is behind us. Until now, the paths we followed have led us to clear answers and full understanding. But as we try to dig deeper into how dreaming really works, things get confusing. We can’t fully explain dreams as mental processes because explaining means connecting to what we already know, and we don’t have enough psychological knowledge yet. Instead, we will have to guess how the mind works during dreams and be careful not to go too far with guesses because that might make our ideas useless. Even if we guess perfectly and think of all possibilities, we could still be wrong because we don’t have all the facts. We can’t figure out how the mind works just by studying dreams or any single mental activity alone. We’ll need to study many mental activities to find patterns that are always true. So, the ideas we get from analyzing dreams will have to wait until they can connect with results from other studies that look at the same problem from different angles.

A. The Forgetting of Dreams

First, we should look at a problem that people often bring up and that could mess up our efforts to understand dreams. The problem is that the dream we want to explain might not really be known to us. More exactly, we can’t be sure that we remember the dream exactly as it happened.

What we remember about a dream, and what we try to explain, is often incomplete because our memory is bad at holding onto dreams. It might have left out the most important parts. When we try to think about our dreams carefully, we often feel like we dreamed much more than we remember. We might only remember one small part, and even that part feels unclear.

Also, our memory doesn’t just leave out parts; it might change the dream and make it less true.

We might wonder if the dream was really as random as we remember or if it was more connected. Or maybe the dream wasn’t as clear as we tell it when we try to remember it. Maybe when we tell the dream, we fill in the missing parts with new ideas or make the story smoother and nicer. This means it’s hard to know what the dream was really like. One writer even guessed that the dream only becomes clear and organized when we try to remember it. So, we might lose the real dream itself, which is what we wanted to understand.

Until now, we have ignored these warnings when interpreting dreams. Instead, we have treated every small, unclear part of the dream like it was important for understanding the dream, just like the parts we clearly remember. For example, in the dream about Irma’s injection, we read, “I quickly called in Dr. M,” and we thought even this small detail had a special meaning. From that, we found the story about the sick patient I called my older doctor to help. In another weird dream about the numbers fifty-one and fifty-six, the number fifty-one came up many times. Instead of thinking it was just a small detail, we followed this clue and found fears connected to living only fifty-one years, which went against the main idea of living many more years.
