I’m riding in a cab and tell the driver to take me to a train station. “Of course, I can’t drive with you on the railway tracks,” I say after the driver gets annoyed, like I’ve already been with him on a trip usually done by train. This confusing story has an explanation: Earlier that day, I hired a cab to go to a far-off street in Dornbach. The driver didn’t know the way and just kept driving without direction until I noticed and showed him the way, making a few teasing comments. From this driver, my thoughts moved to an aristocrat I was going to meet later. For now, I’ll just say that one thing middle-class people notice about aristocrats is they like to be in control, like sitting in the driver’s seat. Doesn’t Count Thun drive the Austrian state car?

The next part of the dream is about my brother, who I also connect with the cab driver. I refused to go to Italy with him this year (“Of course, I can’t drive with you on the railway track”), which was a kind of punishment because he usually complains that I wear him out on trips by rushing him too fast and making him see too many beautiful things in one day. That evening, my brother walked with me to the train station, but just before we reached the Western station, he jumped out to catch a train to Purkersdorf. I suggested he stay with me a bit longer since he was traveling by the Western Railway, not the Metropolitan. That’s why, in my dream, I took a trip in the cab that’s usually done by train. In real life, I told my brother, “You could travel the distance on the Metropolitan Railway with me on the Western Railway.” The confusion in the dream happens because I replaced the “Metropolitan Railway” with a cab, which connects the driver and my brother. I then got some nonsense from the dream that’s hard to explain and almost contradicts what I said earlier (“Of course, I can’t drive with you on the railway track”). Since I can’t really explain why I mixed up the cab and railway, I must have made the whole strange story on purpose in the dream.

But why? Now we’ll see what the weirdness in the dream means and why it’s there. The answer is: In the dream, I need something silly and confusing about driving because I have a certain idea that needs to be shown. One evening at a witty and friendly lady’s house, who appears later in the dream as a housekeeper, I heard two riddles I couldn’t solve. Since others knew the answers, I looked funny trying to figure them out. The riddles played on words with “Nachkommen” (meaning both to obey orders and offspring) and “Vorfahren” (meaning to drive and ancestors). They went something like this:

“The coachman does it at the master’s orders; everyone has it; in the grave it rests.” (Vorfahren)

The first halves of both riddles were the same, which confused me:

“The coachman does it at the master’s orders; not everyone has it; in the cradle it rests.” (Nachkommen)

When I saw Count Thun arrive in style (vorfahren) and felt like Figaro, thinking that the only thing aristocrats deserve credit for is being born into it (becoming Nachkommen), these riddles popped into my mind and shaped the dream. Since aristocrats can be replaced by coachmen, and coachmen used to be called “Herr Schwager” (brother-in-law), the dream mixed in my brother too. But the real thought behind this is: It’s silly to be proud of your ancestors (Vorfahren). I’d rather be an ancestor myself. Because of this idea, the dream is nonsense, and that solves the last riddle—that I have driven before (vorher gefahren) with this driver.

So, a dream seems silly when it includes the idea “That is nonsense,” or when the dreamer is criticizing or making fun of something without realizing it. Absurd parts of dreams show contradictions, often by flipping ideas or making things feel stuck or blocked. But the silliness in a dream isn’t just a simple “no.” It’s the dream’s way of showing laughter or mocking the contradiction. Only by doing this does the dream turn part of its hidden meaning into something obvious.

Herr Ludwig is a great poet, and when he sings, Apollo falls to his knees before him, begging and pleading, “Stop, or I’ll go crazy!”
