A deeper meaning of some dreams is about sexual thoughts. I remember a dream about a beautiful country that a female patient had, even though she’d never been to Italy. In German, the word for Italy sounds like the word for genitals. The dream also mentioned a house where I worked before my friend P, and a place where a boil was.

In another dream, I was able to stop myself from waking up even though something was trying to disturb my sleep. This time, the disturbance was a sound. I only figured out the connection by chance. One summer morning in the mountains, I woke up knowing I had dreamed that the Pope was dead. At first, I couldn’t understand the dream, but I remembered the news saying the Pope was sick. Later, my wife asked if I heard the church bells ringing loudly. I hadn’t noticed, but then I realized the bells were trying to wake me up. My dream was my brain’s way of fighting the noise so I could keep sleeping.

Some dreams happen because of body signals. For example, a dream about drinking a lot comes from feeling thirsty. The thirst creates a wish, and that wish makes the dream. Other simple dreams work the same way, where the body’s needs create dreams. One sick woman dreamed she threw a cooling pack off her cheek because of pain. It seemed like she was trying to stop feeling pain by imagining it was someone else’s problem.

My dream about three Parcae (fates) was really about being hungry, but it turned the hunger into a child’s wish for its mother’s breast. It used a simple desire to hide a deeper, more serious one that couldn’t be shown openly. Another dream showed how a physical need connected with strong but hidden feelings. For example, Napoleon had a dream about a battle just before waking up from a loud noise. A young lawyer dreaming about a person named G. Reich was woken up by his wife coughing, showing how outside noises get mixed into dreams.

Let’s compare Napoleon’s dream with a sleepy student’s dream. The student was woken up by his landlady reminding him to go to the hospital. Then he dreamed he was already in a hospital bed, so he didn’t have to get up. This dream was a way to avoid waking up. This is a “convenience-dream” because the dream helps the person keep sleeping. In fact, all dreams help us keep sleeping instead of waking up. Dreams don’t disturb sleep; they protect it.

Sometimes the mind ignores annoying sounds if it can, or it changes them in dreams so they don’t bother us. If the mind can’t ignore them, it tries to fit them into a dream that makes the noise seem okay. For example, Napoleon’s dream changed the sound of guns into a memory so he could keep sleeping. The wish to keep sleeping is very important in making dreams. Every good dream helps us stay asleep.

When we’re asleep, the mind chooses how to understand noises or feelings so they don’t wake us up. It picks the meaning that fits best with what we want to dream about. So, dreams aren’t random or mistakes; they are like excuses that help us keep sleeping. The mind tricks itself to protect sleep.

If noises or body feelings are strong enough, they become the main part of a dream. Then the mind finds a way to make a wish come true based on those feelings. So, many dreams are shaped by signals from our body.
