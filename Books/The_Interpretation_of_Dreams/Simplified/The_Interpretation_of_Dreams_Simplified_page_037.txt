I will explain later exactly how this method works and what results I got from it. While doing these psycho-analytic studies, I found myself curious about how to understand dreams. My patients promised to tell me all their thoughts about a certain topic, and they shared their dreams with me. This helped me learn that dreams can fit into a chain of thoughts that leads back to a person’s memories. The next step was to treat the dream like a symptom and use the same way of figuring out what it means as with other symptoms.

For this, the patient needs to be ready in a certain mental way. We try to help them pay close attention to their thoughts and stop judging or criticizing the ideas that come up.

To focus well on themselves, it helps if the patient sits or lies down comfortably and closes their eyes. They must be told not to judge any thoughts they notice. They also need to know that for the analysis to work, they have to notice and say everything that comes to mind, even if some ideas seem silly or unimportant. They need to keep an open mind because if they criticize their thoughts, they won’t find the answer they’re looking for.

I have seen that a person thinking deeply is very different from someone just watching their thoughts. When reflecting, the mind is very active, and the person might look tense or worried. But when watching their thoughts without judging, the person looks calm. Both need to focus, but the thinking person uses their judgment a lot. This causes them to ignore or stop some thoughts and even keep some from coming up at all. But when just observing thoughts, the only job is to not judge. If they do this, many thoughts come up that they wouldn’t notice otherwise. Using these new thoughts, it’s possible to understand dreams and troubling ideas. The goal is to create a mental state similar to the one just before falling asleep or being hypnotized. When we fall asleep, unwanted thoughts come up because the mind stops controlling them so strictly. These thoughts turn into images or sounds. In this method, the patient purposely stops controlling their thoughts, saving mental energy to carefully watch the unwanted thoughts that come up—thoughts that stay as ideas, not images. This way, unwanted thoughts become useful.

Many people find it hard to relax and stop judging their thoughts. The unwanted ideas often cause strong resistance, trying to keep them hidden. But the famous poet Friedrich Schiller said that to be creative, you need a similar attitude. In a letter, he told a friend who struggled with creativity that the problem was his mind was too strict with his imagination.

Schiller explained that it’s not good for the mind to judge ideas too soon. An idea might seem unimportant or strange alone, but it can be important when connected with other ideas. The mind can’t judge ideas well unless it keeps them and looks at how they fit together. A creative mind “lets go” and allows ideas to come in without judging them right away, then looks at them later. People who judge too soon miss out and complain about not being creative.

Still, learning to stop judging thoughts and watch them openly, like Schiller said, isn’t that hard.

Most of my patients succeed after I explain it once. I can do it well too, especially if I write down the ideas that come to me. How much mental energy they need to stop judging and focus depends on what they are paying attention to.

The first lesson in this method is that you can’t focus on the whole dream at once, only on small parts of it. If I ask a new patient, “What do you think about this dream?” they usually can’t say much. So I break the dream into parts, and then they tell me what thoughts come up for each piece. This way, my method of understanding dreams is different from the old way of guessing the meaning by symbols. It’s more like solving a code.
