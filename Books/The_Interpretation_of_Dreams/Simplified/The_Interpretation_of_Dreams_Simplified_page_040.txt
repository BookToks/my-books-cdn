I think Irma is being silly because she won’t accept my idea. Another woman would be smarter and more likely to agree. Then she would talk more than Irma.  

When I look in her throat, I see a white spot and scabs on the bones inside. The white spot reminds me of diphtheria, the sickness Irma’s friend had. It also makes me think of when my oldest daughter was very sick two years ago, which was a really hard time. The scabs make me worry about my own health. Back then, I used cocaine a lot to stop swelling in my nose. A few days before this, I heard a woman who used cocaine like that got a bad infection in her nose. In 1885, I was the one who first suggested using cocaine, and I got blamed for it. A close friend of mine died because he misused this drug.

I quickly call Dr. M to check again. The word “quickly” makes me remember a sad medical mistake. Once, I kept giving a drug called sulphonal, which was thought to be safe then. But a woman got really sick from it, and I had to rush to ask a more experienced doctor for help. That patient had the same name as my oldest daughter. I never thought about this before, but now it feels like fate punishing me—like one Matilda for another. It’s as if I’m always blaming myself for not being careful enough as a doctor.

Dr. M looks pale, shaves his chin, and limps. His sick look often worries his friends. But the other two things don’t fit him. I think of my older brother who lives abroad—he shaves his chin too, and I just heard he’s limping because of hip arthritis. There must be a reason I mixed these two people into one in my dream. I remember I was mad at both of them for saying no to a plan I recently suggested.

My friend Otto is standing next to the patient, and another friend, Leopold, is checking her and points out a dull sound low on the left side.  

Leopold is also a doctor and related to Otto. They both work in the same field, so they compete a lot and get compared. They helped me for years when I ran a clinic for nervous kids. Scenes like this happened a lot there. While I talked about the diagnosis with Otto, Leopold would recheck the kid and say something new that helped us decide. Otto is quick and sharp; Leopold is slower but very careful. In the dream, I’m comparing Otto and Leopold to praise Leopold. This is like comparing Irma to her friend who is more sensible.  

I realize the dream links the sick kid to the children’s clinic. About the dull sound on the left, I think of a similar case where Leopold’s careful work impressed me. I vaguely remember it might have been something like a cancer spread, but it could also be about the patient I wished Irma was like. That woman showed signs like tuberculosis.

There’s a hard spot on the left shoulder. I know right away it’s my own shoulder pain from rheumatism, which I feel when I can’t sleep. The dream’s words are strange: something I can feel “despite the clothes.” It means feeling it on my own body. Also, the phrase “infiltrated portion of skin” sounds odd. Usually, we say “infiltration of the upper back left,” which means the lungs, and relates again to tuberculosis.

“Despite the clothes” is just a side note. At the clinic, kids were checked without clothes; here, adult women are examined through their clothes. There’s a story about a famous doctor who always checked patients without touching their skin. The rest is unclear, and I don’t want to think about it more.

Dr. M says, “It’s an infection, but it’s okay; dysentery will come, and the poison will leave the body.” This sounds silly at first, but like everything else, it needs careful thought. Looking closer, it might actually mean something.

What I found in the patient was local diphtheritis. I remember talking about diphtheritis and diphtheria when my daughter was sick. Diphtheria is the serious infection that starts from diphtheritis. Leopold shows signs of a general infection with the dull sound, which might mean a spread of infection. But I think this kind of spread doesn’t happen with diphtheria.

It reminds me more of pyaemia (a type of blood infection).

Saying “it doesn’t matter” is meant to comfort. I think it fits like this: the last part of the dream says the patient’s problems come from a serious physical illness. I start to think maybe I’m just trying to blame something real so I don’t feel guilty. The mental treatment I gave can’t be blamed for the diphtheritis still being there. Now, I’m upset that I might have made up such a serious illness for Irma just to make myself feel better.
