But no one ever actually says this out loud; it’s the feeling of doubt during psychoanalysis that helps us see it as a kind of mental barrier or defense. Psychoanalysis is right to be suspicious. One of its rules is: Anything that slows down the process is a kind of resistance.

Forgetting dreams is also hard to explain unless we think about the mind’s way of blocking certain thoughts. Sometimes people feel like they dreamed a lot but only remember a little. This might mean the mind worked on dreams all night but only left one short dream behind. Still, it’s clear that dreams are forgotten bit by bit when we wake up. Sometimes, even when we try hard, we just can’t remember a dream.

But I think people often think they forget more than they actually do. And the parts of the dream we miss aren’t always as important as we believe. Most of the lost dream can be found again through analysis. Even from one small piece, we can figure out the main ideas behind the dream. It just takes more attention and self-control during the analysis. This shows that forgetting dreams isn’t just random—it actually works against us.

A strong proof that dream-forgetting is on purpose comes when, during analysis, a part of the dream suddenly comes back that was thought forgotten. This part is always the most important and helps solve the dream. It was hidden because it was blocked by resistance.

For example, I once had a dream about travel where I got back at two annoying travel buddies. I left most of the dream unexplained because part was rude. Later, I added a forgotten piece about correcting myself while talking about a book by Schiller. This self-correction in dreams isn’t surprising. 

I remember when I was 19 and visited England, I spent a day by the Irish Sea. I picked up sea animals on the beach and looked at a starfish when a girl asked if it was alive. I said, “Yes, he is alive,” but then felt silly and said it right. My dream made a similar mistake with words, which is common among German speakers. The dream changed “from” to “by” because it sounded similar to a German word, making the dream’s meaning deeper. This little memory helps explain a key part of the dream.

I can also prove clearly that forgetting dreams is mostly caused by resistance.

Sometimes a patient says they dreamed but forgot everything. We start working, find the resistance, talk it through, and when the patient feels ready, they suddenly remember the dream. The same resistance that made it hard to understand the dream also made them forget it. When the resistance is broken, the dream comes back.

Sometimes, patients remember dreams from days ago that they had completely forgotten before. This shows that forgetting dreams is more about resistance than just the difference between being awake and asleep.

I, and other analysts and patients, have often been woken by a dream and started figuring out what it meant right away. But even after understanding it fully while awake, I sometimes forget both the dream and the meaning later, even though I knew I had dreamed and worked on it. The dream often takes its meaning away with it.

But there isn’t a huge mental gap between dreaming and waking thoughts like some people say. When Morton Prince objects to my idea that forgetting dreams is caused by resistance, he forgets that repression and resistance cause not only this forgetting but also other memory losses in the mind.

So, forgetting dreams isn’t just random—it’s mostly caused by the mind’s way of protecting itself.
