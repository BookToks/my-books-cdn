(c) The Examination-Dream

Everyone who has finished school and passed their final exam often has scary dreams where they fail or have to repeat their course. For people with a university degree, this common dream changes. Instead, they dream they haven't earned their doctorate yet, even though in real life they might already be working as a doctor, a teacher, or a senior lawyer. These dreams come from old memories of being punished as kids for doing something wrong. These memories get brought back during stressful exams, which are big moments in a student’s life. People who are really anxious tend to feel this fear even more. After school, it’s not parents or teachers who punish us anymore, but the consequences of our actions in life. We dream about exams when we worry about facing problems because we didn’t do something carefully or responsibly.

A colleague who studied these dreams said that only people who passed an exam have these dreams, not those who failed. This has been proven many times. These dreams happen when someone is about to do something important and worries they might fail or embarrass themselves. The dream uses a past exam where the worry turned out to be unnecessary. The part in the dream where the person says, “But I am already a doctor,” is actually the dream trying to comfort them. It means, “Don’t be scared about what’s coming tomorrow; remember how you worried before and nothing bad happened.” The real worry comes from what happened during the day, not from the dream itself.

I tested this idea with myself and others, and it seemed true. For example, I failed my medical law exam but never dreamed about it. However, I often dreamed about exams in botany, zoology, and chemistry, where I was nervous but passed. In my school exam dreams, I’m always tested in history, which I did really well at. I think this is because my kind teacher noticed when I hinted I didn’t want to answer one question and let me skip it. One of my patients failed to take his final school exam once but passed later, and he never dreamed about failing an officer’s exam that he actually failed. He only dreamed about the school exam.

W. Stekel, who first studied these exam dreams, believes they are connected to growing up and sexual experiences. I have often found this to be true.
