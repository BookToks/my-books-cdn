Symbols in dreams can have lots of different meanings, kind of like Chinese characters where you need to understand the situation to get the right meaning. Dreams can show many wishes and thoughts all mixed together, even if they seem very different.

Now, I’ll explain some common symbols. The Emperor and Empress (or King and Queen) usually stand for the dreamer’s parents, and the dreamer is like a prince or princess. But sometimes, powerful men like Goethe can also symbolize a father. 

Long, thin objects like sticks, tree trunks, umbrellas (because they open like an erection), and sharp weapons like knives or daggers usually represent the male body part. A nail-file can also mean this, maybe because it rubs or scrapes. 

Small boxes, cupboards, ovens, cavities, ships, and different kinds of containers usually mean the female body part. A room in a dream often stands for a woman, especially depending on whether the door is open or locked. Dreaming of walking through many rooms can mean a brothel or harem, but sometimes it symbolizes marriage.

Dreams about two rooms that used to be one, or one room split into two, relate to how kids understand the body when they’re little—they think the female parts and the anus are one opening, but later they learn there are two. Climbing or going up and down stairs or ladders often stands for sex. Smooth walls you climb or slide down from in dreams can represent people’s bodies, and holding onto parts of a house in scary dreams shows anxiety. Tables and boards often represent women because they’re flat and don’t stick out. Wood usually means feminine stuff. 

The island name Madeira means wood in Portuguese. Since “bed and board” means marriage, dreams sometimes mix sex with eating. 

Clothes also have meanings: a woman’s hat can mean male genitals, and men’s neckties often symbolize the penis because they hang down and men can choose different styles. People who dream about ties often have lots of them. Machines and tools usually represent male genitals, like ploughshares, hammers, guns, swords, and so on.

Lots of dream landscapes, especially with bridges or wooded mountains, might actually be about genitals. Some people have drawn their dreams and showed that what looked like maps were really pictures of bodies. Weird made-up words in dreams can also mean sexual things. 

Children in dreams often stand for genitals because people sometimes call their private parts “little man” or “little woman.” The little brother can mean the penis. Playing with or hitting a little child in a dream often means masturbation.

Losing hair, teeth, or getting beheaded in dreams can symbolize castration. To avoid this, dreams might show multiple symbols of the penis, or animals like lizards whose tails grow back. Animals like fish, snails, cats, mice, and especially snakes often stand for male genitals in dreams. Small animals or pests can stand for little kids, like unwanted brothers or sisters, and getting infested with pests can mean pregnancy.

A new symbol for the male organ is an airship, because it flies and sometimes looks like a penis. 

A guy named Stekel gave many other symbols and examples in his book, but some of his ideas might not always be right, so be careful using them. He said that in dreams, right and left sides can have moral meanings: the right side means good or honest things, while the left side can mean bad or weird things like crime or perversion. What they mean depends on the dreamer’s own moral views.

Relatives in dreams usually stand for genitals too, especially sons, daughters, and younger sisters. Sisters can mean breasts, and brothers can mean larger body parts. If you dream about trying but failing to catch up with a carriage, it might mean you feel sad about differences in age.
