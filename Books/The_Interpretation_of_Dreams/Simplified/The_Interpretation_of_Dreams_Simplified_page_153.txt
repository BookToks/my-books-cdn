Dreams are made by different things working together. First, the mind takes all the dream ideas and starts putting them together into a basic story. This story changes until it fits what a part of the mind wants. But it’s more likely that this part of the mind’s rules are important right from the start, along with other things like mixing ideas, avoiding censorship, and making the dream easy to picture. All these rules work at the same time to shape the dream thoughts.

Out of these four rules, the last one seems to be the least strict for dreams. This rule is about making the dream story make sense, and it’s very likely that this job is done by the same thinking we use when we’re awake. When we’re awake, our mind tries to organize what we see and make it understandable. Sometimes, this causes us to make mistakes or misunderstand what’s really happening. For example, we might read a page with mistakes but still understand it because our brain guesses the right words.

There’s a funny story about two people watching a meeting where a bomb went off. One thought it was normal to fire a gun after a speech ended, and the other thought the shooting was applause for a great speech. This shows how our minds can twist what we see to fit what we expect.

So, the part of our mind that tries to make sense of dreams often ends up misunderstanding them. When we try to figure out a dream, we should ignore how clear or confusing it seems and look back to the real dream thoughts behind it.

Some parts of dreams seem clear because this organizing part of our mind worked well, and other parts seem confusing because it didn’t. The clearer parts usually look stronger or more detailed in the dream. This means that this organizing work also helps make the dream’s images more vivid.

If I had to compare how this organizing of dreams works, I’d think of a puzzle where letters are mixed up to look like a secret message. Sometimes real words appear, but other times we trick ourselves into seeing meaning where there is none. To really understand it, we have to stop looking for a secret message and just read the letters as they are.

This organizing part of the dream is what many people who study dreams have noticed. Havelock Ellis described it like the sleeping mind rushing to clean up and organize everything before the “master” — our waking mind — comes in. Other experts agree that this organizing is the same work our waking mind does when it tries to make sense of what we see.

Some believe this organizing starts even while we’re dreaming and continues after we wake up. So, our imagination might finish sorting out the dream story once we’re awake, making it seem like our thoughts are faster or more complete than they really were during sleep.
