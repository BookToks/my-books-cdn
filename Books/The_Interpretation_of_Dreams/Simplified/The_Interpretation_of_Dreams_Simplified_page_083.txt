I have always come across dreams about brothers or sisters dying, which shows strong anger or hate. I’ve seen this in all my female patients except for one. That one patient said she never had such dreams but told me about another dream she had since she was four years old. In the dream, many children—her brothers, sisters, and cousins—were playing in a meadow. Suddenly, they all grew wings, flew away, and disappeared. She didn’t know what it meant, but it’s almost like a dream about the death of brothers and sisters. 

Here’s what I think: When she was four, if one child died, she might have asked an adult, “What happens to kids when they die?” The adult probably said, “They grow wings and become angels.” So, in her dream, all the kids have wings and fly away like angels. This leaves her alone, the only one left. The kids playing and flying away remind me of butterflies, which also have wings like the ancient idea of the soul.

Some people might say kids can be mean to their brothers and sisters, but how can they want them dead? Kids don’t understand death like adults do. They don’t know about the scary parts like decay or being in a cold grave. Death is not something kids fear; it’s just a word to them. They might even say things like, “If you do that again, you will die,” without really meaning it. For example, a child might say, “If you die, I will have you stuffed and keep you in my room,” showing how different kids think about death. To a child, being dead means just being gone and not bothering anyone.

Kids don’t always miss people who are gone. For example, if a mom leaves for a few weeks, the kids might not ask for her. But if she dies, at first the kids might seem to forget, and only later start to remember her. So, kids might wish for someone to be gone, but they don’t always think about death seriously. Still, the wish for someone to be gone is similar in kids and adults.

If kids want their brothers and sisters gone because they see them as rivals, why would they have the same wish about their parents, who love and care for them? Most dreams about a parent’s death involve the parent of the same sex—boys dream about their dads, girls about their moms. This might mean that kids see the parent of the same sex as a rival for love, and want them gone to have more attention.

Before thinking this is strange, think about real family relationships. We expect kids to love and obey their parents, but in real life, many kids don’t. There’s often hidden anger and conflict. For example, fathers have been very strict and controlling throughout history. In old stories, dads could be very harsh, even cruel. Sons often saw their fathers as enemies and wanted to replace them.

Even today, fathers can sometimes make sons feel angry by not letting them be independent. This can create feelings of hate and rivalry, just like in old times.
