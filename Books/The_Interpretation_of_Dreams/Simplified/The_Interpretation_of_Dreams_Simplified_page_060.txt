I became someone who loves reading a lot. Since I started thinking about myself, I’ve always traced this early love back to a memory from my childhood. Actually, I realized that this childhood scene hides the real reason I later loved books so much. I also learned early on that our passions can sometimes cause problems. When I was seventeen, I bought a lot of books but didn’t have money to pay for them. My dad didn’t think it was a good excuse that my passion was at least a good one. Talking about this brings me back to a chat I had with my friend Dr. Koenigstein the night before a dream I had. One topic was the usual complaint that I spend too much time on my hobbies.

For reasons I won’t get into, I won’t keep interpreting that dream but will just show how I got to it. While interpreting, I remembered my talk with Dr. Koenigstein, actually more than one part of it. Thinking about what we talked about helps me understand the dream right away. The ideas we discussed—my interests, my wife’s interests, cocaine, how hard it is to get medical help from colleagues, my liking for detailed studies, and ignoring subjects like botany—all connect to parts of this long conversation. The dream feels like it’s defending me, like a kind of excuse for who I am, just like an earlier dream I analyzed where I justified myself by saying I’m a serious student. Both dreams say, “I deserve to do this.” But I don’t need to go further in explaining the dream because I just wanted to see how it related to what happened the day before that made me dream it.

At first, the dream seems to connect to one small thing from the day: I saw a book in a shop window that caught my eye for a moment, but I probably wouldn’t really like what it was about. The second thing was much more important: I had a deep talk with my friend, an eye doctor, for about an hour. I said things that probably upset both of us and brought up memories inside me that stirred many feelings. Then some people joined us, and our talk ended unfinished. So, what’s the connection between these two things from that day and the dream I had that night?

In the dream itself, there’s just a small hint about the unimportant thing, the book. This shows that dreams like to include little things that don’t really matter. But when you analyze the dream, everything points to the important and disturbing event, the talk with my friend. If I understand the dream’s meaning the right way, I realize something new and important. It proves that the idea that dreams only deal with useless stuff from the day isn’t true. It also proves that our waking thoughts do continue in our dreams, and dreams don’t waste our mental energy on silly things. Instead, the things that really grab our attention during the day also fill our dreams, and we dream mostly about what has made us think.

Maybe the reason I dream about the unimportant thing but the important thing causes the dream is because of something called dream distortion. This is like a mental force acting as a censor. The memory of the book about a plant is used as a substitute for the conversation with my friend, just like in another dream where smoked salmon stood for a friend of a patient. The question is: how can the memory of the book about the plant connect to the talk with the eye doctor, when it seems like they have nothing in common? In the smoked salmon example, the connection was obvious because the salmon was the friend’s favorite food. Here, the two things seem totally separate, except they happened the same day. I saw the book in the morning, then had the talk in the evening. The answer is that links between the two memories were made later, connecting the ideas in one with ideas in the other. I already pointed out some of these links while writing this. Maybe thinking about flowers missed by someone named Frau L made me connect the book about cyclamen (a flower) to the fact that cyclamen is my wife’s favorite flower. But I don’t think those small thoughts alone could have caused the dream.

There’s no need for ghosts or anything spooky to explain this, like in Hamlet. But while analyzing, I remembered that the man who interrupted our conversation was named Gartner (which means gardener), and I thought his wife looked healthy and happy. I also remembered that one of my female patients, named Flora, was a big part of our talk. So, through these links about plants, the two events from the day—the small one and the important one—became connected. Other connections were made too, like the one about cocaine, which fit well with Dr. Koenigstein.
