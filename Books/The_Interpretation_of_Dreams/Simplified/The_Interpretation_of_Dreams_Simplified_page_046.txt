So far, not many people have tried to use what we know about how kids think for this kind of study.

Little kids’ dreams are usually simple wishes coming true. Compared to adults’ dreams, they aren’t very exciting. They don’t have tricky problems to solve, but they do prove that dreams are mostly about getting what we want. I found some examples of these dreams from my own kids.

One summer in 1806, we went on a trip to Hallstatt. We were staying on a hill near Aussee, and on clear days, we could see the Dachstein mountain and the Simony hut through a telescope.

The kids often tried to see the hut through the telescope, but I’m not sure if they succeeded. Before the trip, I told them Hallstatt was at the base of the Dachstein. They were really excited about the outing. From Hallstatt, we went into the Eschern valley, which the kids loved because the scenery kept changing. But the five-year-old boy started getting unhappy. Every time he saw a mountain, he asked, "Is that the Dachstein?" and I had to say, "No, just a small hill." After asking many times, he got quiet and didn’t want to climb the steps to the waterfall. I thought he was just tired. But next morning, he came to me, happy, and said, "Last night I dreamed we went to the Simony hut." I understood then—he had hoped to climb the big mountain and see the hut up close, but we only saw smaller hills and a waterfall. He was disappointed, but his dream made up for it. I tried to get more details, but all he said was, "You go up steps for six hours," like I had told him.

The eight-and-a-half-year-old girl also had wishes that showed up in her dream. We had brought along a neighbor’s twelve-year-old boy, a polite young gentleman who seemed to have caught her interest. The next morning she told us her dream: "I dreamt Emil was part of our family. He said ‘papa’ and ‘mama’ to you and slept in our big room like one of the boys. Then mom came in and threw big bars of chocolate wrapped in blue and green paper under our beds." Her brothers, who didn’t really get dreaming, said, "That dream is nonsense." But the girl defended part of it, saying, "It’s nonsense that Emil was family, but the part about the chocolate wasn’t." That confused me until my wife explained. On the way home from the train station, the kids stopped at a slot machine that gave out chocolate bars wrapped in shiny paper. The mother thought they had enough fun that day, so she didn’t buy any chocolate, leaving that wish for the dream. I hadn’t noticed that.

I understood the part the girl said was nonsense easily. I had heard Emil telling the kids to wait for “papa” or “mama” while walking ahead of us. For her, the dream turned this temporary relationship into a real adoption. She couldn’t imagine another way to have Emil around all the time except by making him family in her dream. Why mom threw chocolate under the beds wasn’t clear, and would need asking the girl.

A friend told me about a dream similar to my little boy’s. A girl of eight went on a walk with her dad and other kids to Dornbach, hoping to visit the Rohrer hut, but they had to turn back because it got late. They passed a sign to the Hameau, and the kids asked to go there, but again had to wait for another day. The next morning, the girl happily told her dad, "I dreamed you were with us at the Rohrer hut and the Hameau." Her dream made her feel like the promise already happened.

Another easy-to-understand dream came from my daughter, who was just over three years old. She had crossed the lake for the first time but thought the trip was too short. She cried because she didn’t want to leave the boat. The next morning she said, "Last night I was sailing on the lake." Hopefully, her dream felt longer and better.

My oldest boy, eight years old, was already dreaming about his favorite stories. He dreamed he rode in a chariot with Achilles, with Diomedes driving. The day before, he had been really interested in a book about Greek myths his sister had.

If talking in sleep counts as dreaming, I have one of the earliest examples from my youngest daughter, who was just nineteen months old. One morning she threw up and couldn’t eat all day. That night, she was heard calling out in her sleep: "Anna Freud, strawberry, wild strawberry, omelette, pap!" She used her name to say she wanted those things. The menu was everything she found tasty. The two types of strawberry were her way of fighting the rule that she shouldn’t eat strawberries because the nurse said they made her sick. In her dream, she got back at that rule she didn’t like.
