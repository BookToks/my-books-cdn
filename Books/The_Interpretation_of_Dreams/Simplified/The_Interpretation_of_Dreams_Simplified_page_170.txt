If we can prove that memory and quality don’t happen together in the Psi-systems of consciousness, we’ll have a big clue about how neurons get excited. So far, what we thought about the psychic system didn’t consider dreams or what they tell us about the mind. But dreams can actually help us understand another part of this system.

We saw that you can’t explain how dreams form without thinking about two parts of the mind. One part watches and judges the other, and this judging part decides what stays out of our awareness.

We figured out that the judging part is closer to our consciousness than the part it judges. It acts like a screen between them. Also, this judging part seems to control our waking life and what we do on purpose. If we call these parts systems, the judging system is at the motor end, meaning it controls movement.

In our diagram, we name these systems based on their link to consciousness. The last system at the motor end is the preconscious (Pcs.), which means things here can reach consciousness easily if certain conditions are met, like paying attention or being strong enough. This system controls voluntary movement. Behind it is the unconscious (Ucs), which can’t reach consciousness directly but only through the preconscious, and only after some changes happen.

So, where does the push to form dreams come from? To keep it simple, let’s say it starts in the unconscious (Ucs). Later, we’ll see that dream-formation also connects to the preconscious, but the real drive comes from the unconscious. The dream ideas try to get into the preconscious, and then into consciousness.

Usually, the preconscious blocks dream-thoughts during the day. But at night, these thoughts get through. The question is: how and why? If the block between unconscious and preconscious just got weaker at night, then dreams would be made of our regular ideas and wouldn’t seem strange or hallucinatory like they do.

This weaker block can explain simple dreams but not weird, scary dreams like the one about the burning child, which we said was a tricky problem at the start.

In hallucinatory dreams, the excitement doesn’t go forward to the motor part but goes backward to the sensory part and finally to perception. If moving from unconscious to waking is “progressive,” then dreams go the opposite way, or “regressive.” This backward movement is a big part of how dreams work, but it’s not only in dreams. When we remember or think hard, our mind also goes backward to memories. But when we’re awake, this backward step only goes as far as memory images and doesn’t create the vivid sensory images like in dreams.

Why is it different in dreams? We said that dreams mix and change ideas completely. This change probably lets the sensory part light up very clearly in the opposite direction of normal thinking. I hope we’re not kidding ourselves about how important this is. We’re just giving a name to something strange we see. We call it regression when a dream idea turns back into the original visual image it came from.

But even this name needs a reason. Why use it if it doesn’t teach us anything new? I think it helps because it links something we know to our idea of the mind working in a certain direction. Now that we have this idea, we can understand another strange thing about dreams.

If dreams are a backward process in the mind, it explains why the connections between dream thoughts get lost or are hard to show. According to our model, these connections are stored in the front parts of the mind, but when dreams go backward to sensory images, these connections break apart and disappear. So, in regression, a dream’s thought structure falls apart into its basic parts.
