A dream is the start of waking up.

Is this the only thing dreams do? I don’t know of any other. A. Maeder tried to say dreams have other jobs too. He noticed many dreams show attempts to solve problems, which later actually happen. So, dreams can be like practice for real life. He compared dreaming to how animals and kids play, which helps them get ready for serious things later. Alfred Adler also said dreams help us think ahead. (In 1905, I shared a dream that repeated every night until the problem was solved.)

Since then, psycho-analysis books have given us lots of examples like this.

I put extra focus on the word ‘parts,’ but you can understand it without that.

I was scared to admit it, but I kept feeling strange sensations in parts of me; in the end, it tired me so much that I thought about jumping out of the dorm window several times.

I won’t do that again.

Albert never did that.

I added italics to ‘very marked cerebral anaemia.’

We put this case under ‘apyretic delirias of inanition’ because we think it’s caused by brain anemia.

There are some gaps in my explanation because filling them would take too much work and involve stuff not about dreams. For example, I didn’t explain if ‘suppressed’ means something different than ‘repressed.’ Probably, repressed is more about the unconscious. I also didn’t explain why dream thoughts get changed by the brain’s censorship even when they don’t try to become conscious but instead go backward. I left out other similar things too. Mostly, I wanted to give an idea of the problems studying dreams brings up and show related topics. It wasn’t always easy to know where to stop. I didn’t fully talk about how sexual life affects dreams or explain clearly sexual dreams for a special reason—it might not be what you expect. I don’t think sexual life is shameful or something doctors or scientists should ignore. I find it silly that someone translated Artemidorus of Daldis left out the chapter on sexual dreams. For me, the real reason I skipped this is because explaining sexual dreams would force me to deal with confusing problems about perversion and bisexuality. So, I saved that for later.

If I can’t change the gods, I’ll stir up Acheron.

Dreams aren’t the only thing that help us base mental illness studies on psychology. In some short, unfinished articles in a psychiatry magazine from 1898 and 1899, I tried to explain everyday mental stuff with the same ideas.

These and other articles about forgetting and slips of the tongue are now in the book Psycho-pathology of Everyday Life. This idea changed a bit when we learned that preconscious thoughts are connected to leftover words. See The Unconscious, page 428.

The idea of the unconscious in psychology was a lecture I gave at the Third International Psychological Congress in Munich, 1897.
