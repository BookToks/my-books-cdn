This passage talks about studying dreams in a special way that looks at the mind. The writer hasn’t focused much on sleep itself because sleep is mostly a physical thing. But changes in the mind during sleep should be part of understanding what happens when we sleep.

The writer won’t talk about what other books say about sleep here.

Scientists who study dreams want to answer some important questions. These questions are connected and sometimes overlap.

A. How Dreams and Waking Life Are Connected

When people wake up, they usually think their dream took them to a different world. An old scientist named Burdach said that dreams help us escape from real life’s problems and feelings. Even if we are very sad or stressed, dreams either show us something totally different or just use parts of what we feel in a symbolic way. Another thinker, Fichte, said dreams help heal the mind, and Strumpell said dreaming cuts us off from normal waking thoughts and memories.

But most experts think the opposite. Haffner said dreams continue what happens in real life and are connected to things we thought about recently. Weygandt said most dreams bring us back to everyday life instead of freeing us from it. Maury said we dream about what we have seen, said, wanted, or done. Jessen explained that what we dream is shaped by who we are and everything we have experienced. Maas said our strongest feelings and desires shape our dreams. For example, an ambitious person dreams about success, and a lover dreams about the person they care about. Even the ancient Persians believed dreams showed what someone was thinking about while awake. Other old writers agreed that dreams reflect our daily thoughts and feelings.

These two ideas about dreams—either escaping real life or continuing it—seem to conflict and are hard to solve.

F. W. Hildebrandt said dreams are full of contradictions. On one hand, dreams are very separate from real life, creating a totally different world. On the other hand, they are connected to real life and depend on it. He said when we fall asleep, it’s like we disappear from normal life through an invisible door. You might dream about traveling somewhere and meeting someone famous, and feel sad when you wake up and the dream ends.
