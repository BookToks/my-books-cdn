A person can’t break the basic rules of thinking; even in a dream, they can’t believe two opposite things are the same. In dreams, people only want things they see as good. But while thinking and willing in dreams, the mind can get mixed up and confuse one idea for another.

That’s why in dreams we sometimes say or think things that totally contradict each other. But at the same time, we can also make smart decisions and have very logical thoughts or strong promises. The key to why dreams are so wild is that we don’t have a clear sense of reality, and we don’t check our ideas with others. This causes crazy hopes and wishes in dreams.

Claparede (1905) talked about “Disinterest” as a way to explain how we fall asleep.

No dream is completely reasonable; they all have some weird or silly parts.

Dreaming is like chaos in our feelings and thoughts. Our mind acts like a machine that runs on its own without control or stopping.

There’s nothing too strange or weird that we can’t dream about.

The images in dreams that excite our will are like strange movements in the body, sometimes like uncontrollable twitches or paralysis.

Dreaming shows a decline in our ability to think and reason well.

Dreams happen automatically and involve strange connections between ideas.

Later, we’ll learn how to understand dreams full of words that sound alike or start with the same letters.

Dreams aren’t just crazy or totally illogical.

When we sleep, all parts of the mind—thinking, imagining, remembering, wanting, and morals—still work, but they focus on made-up and changing things. The dreamer acts out many roles, like being crazy or smart, strong or weak, good or bad.

Hervey de St. Denys said that during sleep, the mind is free to act and pay attention as it wants. Sleep mainly means shutting off the senses from the outside world. A sleeping person is like someone daydreaming while blocking out what’s around them. The big difference is that in sleep, ideas look like real things, and memories seem like they are happening now.

But there’s another important difference: the mind during sleep doesn’t stay balanced like when we’re awake.

A dream image copies an idea. The main thing is the idea itself; the picture we see is less important. If we learn to follow how ideas change in dreams, even strange or mixed-up parts make sense.

Even the weirdest dreams have logical explanations if we analyze them right.

Some experts, like Haffner and Spitta, also studied this.

The thinker Du Prel said that dreams, not waking life, are the way to understand deep spiritual ideas.
