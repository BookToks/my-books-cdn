[15] If I don’t know which person in the dream is really me, I follow this rule: The person in the dream who feels an emotion that I notice while I’m asleep is the one hiding my true self.

[16] A hysterical attack often uses a trick called "time reversal" to hide what it really means. For example, a hysterical girl acts out a little story she imagined after meeting a man on a tram. The man notices her pretty foot and talks to her while she’s reading. Then, she goes with him, and they have a passionate love scene. Her attack starts by showing this scene through twisting movements of her body, lips, and arms to show kisses and hugs. Then she quickly moves to another room, sits down, lifts her skirt to show her foot, pretends to read, and talks to me. Artemidorus once said that when you interpret dream stories, you should look at them first from beginning to end, and then from end to beginning. I don’t know if I was right to do this.

[18] The main problems this patient had along with her hysterical symptoms were missing her period and feeling very depressed.

[19] Josephus wrote about this in his book "Antiquities of the Jews," book II, chapter V, translated by Wm. Whitson.

[20] A childhood memory comes up through these links: "The Moor has done his duty, the Moor can go." Then there’s a funny question: "How old is the Moor when he has done his duty?" The answer: "One year, then he can go (walk)." It’s said I was born with so much black curly hair that my young mom called me a little Moor. Losing my hat was something that happened that day and was used in different ways. Our clever servant had hidden the hat. The dream’s ending, "I haven’t done my duty yet; I can’t go yet," hides a refusal to think about sad thoughts of death. Birth and death come together, like in Goethe’s dream about the paralytic, which happened a little earlier.

[21] This idea doesn’t match more recent opinions.

[24] In German, the word "sitzen geblieben" is often used for women who haven’t gotten married.

[28] Her life story.

[29] A noble background, which is the opposite wish to the early dream.

[30] A mixed idea that combines two places: the attic of her father’s house where she played with her brother (and which she later imagined), and the farm of a mean uncle who used to tease her.

[31] This is the opposite wish to a real memory of her uncle’s farm, where she used to expose herself while asleep.

[32] Like the angel holding a lily in the Annunciation.

[33] For the explanation of this mixed idea, see earlier in this chapter, section C; it stands for innocence, menstruation, and the story of "La Dame aux Camelias."
