Doctors often notice that when a son loses his father, he feels sad but also happy to finally be free. Usually, fathers try hard to keep control over their families, even though times have changed a lot. Writers like Ibsen show the old fight between fathers and sons in their stories because it really grabs people’s attention. Problems between mothers and daughters happen when the daughter grows up and wants freedom, but the mother watches her closely and feels she must give up her own romantic life.

Everyone can see these situations, but they don’t explain why some people dream about their parents dying, especially when they have always respected them. Still, from what we’ve talked about, these death wishes might start when kids are very young.

For people with mental health issues, therapy shows this idea is true. It tells us that kids start having feelings about love and attraction very early. Girls often first feel close to their dads, and boys to their moms. For boys, dads and for girls, moms can seem like annoying rivals. This can make kids wish their parents would go away or even die. Usually, parents show favorites: dads spoil daughters, moms favor sons, but both try to raise the kids well. Kids notice this and resist the parent who doesn’t favor them. Loving one parent means the kid gets to have their way more. So, kids follow their own feelings and the parents’ behavior when they choose sides.

Most people don’t see these early feelings, but sometimes kids show them clearly. For example, an eight-year-old girl I know pretends to be the mom when her mom leaves the table. A very smart little girl, not even four, once said, “Now mummy can go away; then daddy has to marry me, and I will be his wife.” This doesn’t mean the child doesn’t love their mom. If a boy sleeps next to his mom when his dad is away, he might wish the dad was always gone so he can stay close to his mom. Kids think that dead people, like their grandpa, are always gone and never come back, so the dad’s death fits this wish.

These ideas fit with what we see in young kids, but they become much clearer when looking at adults with mental problems. Adults often tell stories that show their dreams are really about wishes. One woman was very sad and said she didn’t want to see her family because they must hate her. Then she told me about a dream she had when she was four: a wild animal was on the roof, something fell, and then her mother was carried out of the house dead. She cried a lot. When I explained that the dream meant she secretly wished her mother was dead, she told me more: a boy once called her a mean name when she was little, and a tile once fell on her mom’s head and hurt her badly.

I also studied a young girl who went through many mental changes. At first, she was confused and angry at her mom, hitting and yelling at her, but was nice to her older sister. Later, she became calmer but had bad sleep. During this time, many of her dreams were about her mother dying. Then, as she got better, she started having strong fears that something bad had happened to her mom. She always had to go home to check if her mom was okay.

This case taught me a lot. When she was confused, her hidden anger toward her mom came out strongly. Later, when she was calmer, she pushed those feelings away but still had dreams about her mom dying. Finally, when she was more normal, she became very worried about her mom to protect herself from those bad feelings. This helps explain why girls with these problems often seem very attached to their moms.
