He says that most adult dreams usually involve erotic or sexual wishes, and this is true in many cases.

But things get more complicated when we think about the word "sexual" like psychoanalysts do, meaning more about love and desire (Eros). The question of whether all dreams come from these kinds of desires, instead of from anger or destruction, hasn’t been talked about enough by people who disagree with this idea.

There’s another type of dream to think about, called anxiety-dreams, which have scary or painful feelings. Many people don’t believe these dreams are really about wishes. I can only explain this a little here. Anxiety-dreams don’t show a new problem about dreams, but they help us understand anxiety in real life better. The scary feelings in these dreams don’t really make sense if you just look at what happens in the dream. When we analyze the dream closely, we see that the anxiety isn’t really caused by the dream itself, just like how real fears (phobias) don’t always make sense compared to what we’re scared of.

For example, it’s true you could fall out of a window, so you should be careful near one. But it’s strange why some people feel super scared of windows, way more than the actual danger. The same idea applies to anxiety-dreams: the fear is connected to the dream, but it actually comes from somewhere else.

Because anxiety in dreams is so closely linked to anxiety in real life, I have to talk about both. In an essay I wrote in 1895 about anxiety, I said that real-life anxiety comes from problems in sexual feelings. It happens when sexual energy (libido) can’t reach its goal and gets stuck. This idea has been proven more and more over time. From this, we can say that anxiety-dreams are really about sexual feelings, but those feelings have changed into anxiety. Later, I will show some examples of this from people with anxiety. When I keep working on a theory about dreams, I’ll talk more about how anxiety-dreams fit with the idea that dreams are about fulfilling wishes.

Footnotes show that people have thought about these ideas before, like the ancient philosopher Plotinus who said that when we desire something, our imagination shows us what we want. Also, some other writers noticed that dreams aren’t just nonsense but have hidden meanings if you look closely. Sometimes, dreams can hide true feelings by showing the opposite, like when someone has mixed feelings about a person but dreams that they are friends again. These kinds of tricky dreams happen to many people, including me.
