The robbers in dreams were usually the father, while the ghosts were more likely women wearing white nightgowns.

Before I explain the fourth factor that controls how dreams are made, I want to share some examples from my collection of dreams. These examples show how the first three factors work together, and also support some ideas I’ve mentioned before. It’s been hard to prove my ideas with examples until now.

Examples only make sense when you look at the whole dream. If you take them out of context, they don’t mean much. But if you explain the whole dream, it can get so long that it’s hard to follow. So, I’ll now mix different examples that relate to the last chapter.

First, let’s look at some strange or unusual ways dreams show things. One woman dreamed that a servant girl was standing on a ladder to clean windows, holding a chimpanzee and a gorilla cat (later changed to an angora cat). The girl threw the animals at the dreamer. The chimpanzee snuggled up to her, which she found very gross. This dream worked by taking a figure of speech literally and showing it as if it really happened.

In language, “monkey” is often an insult, like calling someone names. So, the dream was just a way to throw insults. I’ll soon share more examples of this simple trick used in dreams.

Another similar dream was about a woman with a child who had a strangely shaped head. The dreamer had heard the head was deformed because of the baby’s position in the mother’s womb. A doctor said the head could be shaped better but it might hurt the brain. The woman thought since it was a boy, the deformity wouldn’t be as bad. This dream shows a clear picture of the idea about “childish impressions” that the dreamer had learned during treatment.

Here’s a different kind of dream: The dreamer remembered a trip to a place called Hilmteich, near Graz. There was a terrible storm outside, a bad hotel with water leaking from the walls, and wet beds. This dream means “superfluous” or too much. The idea became unclear because of wordplay, mixing words like “overflowing,” “fluid,” and “super-fluid.” The dream showed this by using images of water everywhere. In dreams, how words sound is more important than how they are spelled, like in rhymes.

Language has many words that used to have strong pictures but now are more abstract. Dreams can bring back the original, vivid meaning. For example, a man dreamed his friend was stuck in a tight spot and asked for help. The dream showed a hole, and the man was really warning his friend to “be careful or you’ll get into a hole.” Another dreamer climbed a mountain and saw a huge view. He felt like his brother, who was working on a magazine about the Far East.

In a dream from “Der Grune Heinrich,” a lively horse was running in a field of the best oats. But each oat was really “a sweet almond, a raisin, and a new penny” wrapped in red silk and tied with pig’s bristles. The poet or dreamer explained the meaning: the horse said it felt tickled and shouted, “The oats are pricking me,” which means “I feel lively and strong.”

Old Norse stories often use slang and jokes in dreams. Almost every dream has double meanings or word plays.

It would take a lot of work to collect and organize all these ways dreams show things. Some are almost funny. They seem impossible to understand without the dreamer explaining them.

1. A man dreamed he was asked for a name but couldn’t remember it. He said this means: “I wouldn’t dream of it.”  
2. A woman told a dream where everyone was very large. She said this meant the dream was about her early childhood, because when she was little, grown-ups seemed huge. She didn’t appear in the dream herself.
