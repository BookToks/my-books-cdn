But why should I be scared that Otto has Basedow's disease when he doesn’t look sick at all? My dream analysis gives a different story. It goes back to something that happened six years ago. We were driving through a dark forest with a small group, including Professor R. The driver was a bit drunk and crashed the carriage down a hill. Luckily, no one got hurt. We had to stay overnight at the closest inn, and people there felt sorry for us. A man who clearly showed signs of Basedow’s disease—his face was brownish and his eyes stuck out, but he had no goitre—offered to help us.

Professor R said firmly, “Nothing, except lend me a nightshirt.” The man then said, “Sorry, I can’t do that,” and left us.

While thinking more about the dream, I remembered that Basedow is not just a doctor’s name but also a famous teacher’s. (I’m not sure about this now that I’m awake.) Otto is the friend I asked to take care of my kids’ physical education, especially during puberty (that’s why the nightshirt). Seeing Otto in my dream with the sick man’s symptoms means: “If something happens to me, Otto will do as little for my kids as that man did for us.” This dream sounds pretty selfish. But dreams can also show caring or loving feelings if those emotions are hidden deep down. So, saying a dream is totally selfish can be misunderstood.

Where’s the wish-fulfillment in this dream? It’s not in getting back at Otto, who keeps getting treated badly in my dreams. It’s in how I saw Otto as Baron L and also saw myself as Professor R. I asked Otto for something, just like R asked Baron L for something in real life. Professor R went his own way, outside the usual academic path, and only got his official title later in life. I want to be a professor too! Saying “in his later years” is a wish that I’ll live long enough to guide my boys through puberty myself.

I don’t have my own experience with typical dreams where you fly easily or fall scared, so I rely on others’ stories. These dreams come from childhood memories of playing fast games. Think about uncles making kids “fly” by running with them or playing falling games by rocking them suddenly. Kids shout with joy and want to do it again, especially if it’s a little scary or dizzy. Later, they dream about these feelings but without the hands holding them, so in dreams, they float or fall freely. Little kids love rocking and see-saw games, and watching circus gymnasts reminds them of these games. Some kids even have hysterical attacks by copying these movements perfectly. Sometimes, these games cause feelings that might become sexual, even though the games themselves are just fun.

To sum up: childhood games with lots of movement show up as dreams of flying, falling, or spinning, but the happy feelings turn into worry. And as every mom knows, excited play often ends in fights and tears.

Because of this, I don’t believe that the feelings in our skin or lungs during sleep cause flying or falling dreams. Those feelings actually come from memories the dream is about, so they’re part of the dream, not what started it.

I admit I can’t fully explain these common dreams. My information runs out here. I agree with most people that the feelings in flying or falling dreams happen when the mind needs them and don’t show up when it doesn’t. Childhood memories support this idea, based on my studies of people with psychological problems. But I don’t know what other meanings these feelings might have picked up during life—that probably changes from person to person, even if the dreams look similar. I wish I had good examples to study more.

For those wondering why I say I don’t have enough material even though flying, falling, and other dreams are common: since I started studying dreams seriously, I haven’t had these dreams myself. The dreams from people I study aren’t always easy to understand. Often, there’s a hidden mental block that stops me from fully figuring out the deepest meaning behind their dreams.
