Many dream images are forgotten because they are weak, while stronger ones nearby are remembered. But how strong a dream image is isn’t the only reason we remember it. Sometimes, even very clear dreams are quickly forgotten, while some blurry and meaningless ones stick in our memory. When we're awake, we usually forget things that happen just once and remember things that happen often. Most dreams are unique, which makes us forget them easily.

A more important reason we forget dreams is because feelings and ideas are easier to remember when they connect to other things. For example, if you mix up the words of a poem, it’s hard to remember them. When words are in the right order and make sense, they help each other stay in your memory. But dreams usually don’t make sense or follow an order. Because of this, dreams often fall apart in our minds right after we wake up. This idea doesn’t always fit with some people’s observations that we remember the weirdest dreams best.

Strumpell says other reasons linked to how dreams connect to waking life make us forget them even more. When we dream, we only use bits of memories from our waking life, but these bits lose their usual connections. So dreams don’t fit into the normal flow of our thoughts. They float like clouds and disappear quickly when we wake up. Also, when we open our eyes, the new sights and sounds grab our attention so much that most dream images fade away, like stars disappearing when the sun comes up.

Another reason we forget dreams is that most people don’t care much about them. If someone starts paying attention to their dreams and tries to understand them, they usually dream more and remember their dreams better.

Bonatelli adds two more reasons for forgetting dreams that are already mentioned: (1) the feeling of being asleep and awake is very different, making it hard to connect the two, and (2) the way dreams are put together is so different that it’s hard for our awake mind to understand them.

Because of all these reasons, it’s surprising that we remember any dreams at all. Many researchers have tried to find rules about how we remember dreams, showing that it’s still a mystery. Sometimes, a dream we think we forgot can come back during the day when something reminds us of it. But we have to be careful because our memory of dreams might not be exact.

Strumpell warns that when we try to remember dreams, our awake mind often adds things that weren’t really in the dream. Jessen says that when people tell their dreams, they often fill in missing parts or make the story more connected than it really was. Even honest people tend to change their dreams a little without meaning to. Our minds like to see things as connected, so we imagine links in dreams that were actually random. Eggers agrees and says the best way to avoid mistakes in remembering dreams is to write them down immediately after waking. Otherwise, parts of the dream are quickly forgotten, and if you try to remember later, you might add things that weren’t really there.
