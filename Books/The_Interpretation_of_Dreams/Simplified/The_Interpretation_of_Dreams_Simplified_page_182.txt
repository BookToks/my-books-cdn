I don’t want to use examples from nervous patients because there are too many, so I’ll share some anxiety dreams that children have instead.

I haven’t had a real anxiety dream in many years, but I remember one from when I was about seven or eight. I thought about it again thirty years later. The dream was very clear. I saw my beloved mother, looking very calm and asleep, being carried into a room and put on a bed by two or three strange people with bird-like beaks. I woke up crying and screaming, which scared my parents. The tall, weird figures with beaks came from pictures in a Bible I had seen; they looked like gods with sparrowhawk heads from an Egyptian tomb painting. 

When I thought about the dream later, I remembered a boy named Philip who used to play with us. He had told me a rude word about sex, which adults replace with a Latin word, “coitus.” The birds’ heads in the dream hinted at this. I probably learned the meaning of the word from my teacher’s knowing look. My mother’s calm face in the dream looked like my grandfather’s face when he was very sick and about to die. So, I thought the dream meant my mother was dying, which made me very scared. I woke up anxious and couldn’t calm down until I saw my mother was okay. 

But I wasn’t scared because of the dream itself. I already felt anxious inside, and my mind made the dream fit that feeling. This anxiety came from a deep, hidden sexual desire that showed up in the dream’s images.

Another example is a 27-year-old man who had been very sick for a year. When he was 11 to 13 years old, he often dreamed about a man chasing him with a hatchet. He wanted to run but felt frozen and couldn’t move. This is a common anxiety dream, and it doesn’t seem to have any sexual meaning. When he thought about the dream, he remembered a story his uncle told him later about being attacked at night. He also remembered hurting his hand with a hatchet once. This reminded him of how he treated his younger brother badly, even hurting him so badly that his mother said, “I’m afraid he will kill him one day.” 

While thinking about violence, he suddenly remembered when he was nine years old and heard mysterious sounds from his parents’ bedroom. He thought their relationship was like a fight or act of violence. He even remembered seeing blood in his mother’s bed, which made him believe this even more.

It’s normal for kids to feel scared and confused when they notice their parents having sex. This makes them anxious because they don’t understand it, and they might feel uncomfortable since their parents are involved. When kids are younger, they don’t yet feel ashamed about having sexual feelings toward the parent of the opposite sex, and these feelings can come out more freely.

Night terrors with scary hallucinations, which happen a lot in kids, probably happen for the same reason. These are caused by sexual feelings kids don’t understand and try to push away. These feelings might grow stronger at certain times because of outside things or natural changes in the body.

I don’t have enough information to fully prove this idea. But doctors who care for kids often don’t understand these cases the way I do. To show how silly this can be, I’ll tell a funny example from a study about night terrors.

A 13-year-old boy who was not very healthy started feeling anxious and had bad dreams almost every week. He remembered these dreams very clearly. In one dream, the devil yelled, “Now we have you!” There was a smell like burning pitch, and the fire felt like it was burning his skin. He woke up very scared and couldn’t speak at first. Then he said clearly, “No, no, not me; I haven’t done anything,” or “Please, don’t; I will never do it again!” Sometimes he said, “Albert has never done that!” He also stopped wanting to take off his clothes because the fire only came when he was naked.

These scary dreams made him very sick, so he was sent to the countryside where he got better after about eighteen months. When he was fifteen, he finally admitted, “I was too scared to say it, but I kept feeling tingling and strong feelings in my private parts. In the end, it irritated me so much that I thought about jumping out of the dorm window.”
