At the funeral of a friend, a young man said something that felt a bit out of place: "The preacher spoke like the world couldn’t go on without this one person." This showed that the young man was upset because he thought the preacher was exaggerating. But this made him think: "No one is really irreplaceable. I've already lost many people, but I’m still here. I’m the one who survived." When he was afraid that his friend might be dead if he went to see him, he felt glad that it was the friend who died, not him. He felt like he was winning, like he did when he was a kid and imagined himself as the boss. This feeling of being the one who survives covers most of the emotions in the dream. He was happy to be the survivor and expected that he wouldn’t be the one to die.

It takes a lot of self-control to understand your dreams and talk about them. You have to admit that you might be the bad guy among all the good people you live with. That’s why it makes sense that ghosts or memories of people only stay as long as you want them, and you can make them go away by wishing. My friend Josef was punished for this. These ghosts are like different versions of my childhood friend. I’m happy that I keep replacing this friend in my mind, and I’m sure I’ll find someone to replace the friend I’m about to lose now. No one is truly irreplaceable.

But what is the part of the mind that controls dreams doing? Why doesn’t it stop these selfish thoughts or turn the happy feeling into something uncomfortable? I think it’s because there are other, less selfish thoughts about the same people that also make me happy, and these good feelings cover up the childish selfish ones. For example, at the memorial, I thought, "I’ve lost many good friends—some died, some drifted away. But it’s good that I found new friends who mean even more to me now, especially since it’s hard to make new friends as I get older." This happy feeling about finding a new friend is allowed in the dream. But behind it, there’s a sneaky, mean feeling from childhood. The love from childhood helps the love I feel now, but the childhood hate also shows up in the dream.

Also, the dream connects to another happy thought. Before, my friend had a baby girl after waiting a long time. I knew he was sad because he lost a sister when he was young, so I told him I thought he would love this baby like the sister and maybe forget his sad loss.

This thought also links to the hidden ideas in the dream, which go in opposite directions: "No one is irreplaceable. All the people we lost come back as ghosts." The dream mixes these ideas because my friend’s baby girl has the same name as a girl I knew when I was young. She was the sister of my oldest friend, who was also my rival. Hearing her name made me happy. So, in the dream, I swapped one Josef for another Josef and couldn’t stop thinking about the initials of their last names. Then my thoughts went to the names of my own children.

I wanted my kids’ names to be special, not just popular. Their names should remind us of people we love. Names bring back memories of those people. And finally, having children is the only way people can live forever.

I’ll add a few thoughts about feelings in dreams from another view. When you sleep, your mood—how you feel inside—can be the main thing in your mind and can affect your dreams. This mood can come from things that happened during the day or from your body. Either way, your dreams will have thoughts that match your mood. Sometimes the mood causes the thoughts, and sometimes the thoughts cause the mood. It doesn’t really matter for how dreams form. But dreams always show wishes being fulfilled. Your mood during sleep is treated like a feeling or a sensation that appears while you sleep. The dream either ignores it or changes it to fit the wish being fulfilled. If you feel bad while sleeping, that pain can actually push the dream to work harder to make a wish come true. The more you feel bad in the dream, the more your deepest hidden wishes try to show up. This happens because the bad feeling is already there, so the dream doesn’t have to create it from scratch. This idea also helps explain scary dreams, which are a special kind of dream.

Now, let’s finally look at the fourth part that helps make dreams.
