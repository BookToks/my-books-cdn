We often notice daydreams because we’re aware of them, but many daydreams happen without us even realizing it. These hidden daydreams stay unconscious because they come from thoughts and feelings we’ve pushed away.

If we look closely at daydreams, we see they’re very similar to nighttime dreams. Both are ways we wish for something, often based on memories from when we were kids. Like dreams, daydreams sometimes get a pass from our mind’s “censorship,” allowing us to imagine things that might be strange or not allowed.

When daydreams form, the wish behind them takes bits and pieces from memories, mixes them up, and creates something new. It’s like how old stones from ancient ruins are used to build fancy new buildings in Rome. Daydreams are built from old memories but reshaped into something different.

There’s a part of dreaming that works like this too. It tries to make something like a daydream from the material it has. Sometimes, a daydream shows up exactly in a night dream. For example, a boy might dream he’s riding a war chariot with heroes from a famous story. In one of my dreams, part of it repeated a harmless daydream I had about a professor. Sometimes, only part of a daydream appears in a dream because dreams have to meet many different needs when they form.

Usually, daydreams mix with other dream thoughts—they get squished together, overlapped, or changed. Sometimes the whole daydream stays clear in the dream, and sometimes only a tiny part or a hint of it appears. Whether a daydream stays in a dream depends on how well it fits with the mind’s rules and how well it works with the other dream parts.

When I choose examples to explain dreams, I try to avoid those with many hidden daydreams because that would need a lot of extra explanation about unconscious thoughts. But I can’t ignore daydreams completely because they often show up in dreams, sometimes clearly, sometimes just a little bit.

Here’s another example of a dream with two different daydreams mixed together. One is obvious and the other is hidden underneath. The dream is about a young man sitting in his favorite bar. Some people come to take him away, and one says he will pay later and come back. His friends laugh and say they don’t believe him because that’s what everyone says. One friend jokes, “There goes another one,” meaning someone else who left and didn’t come back.

The man is taken to a small room where a woman holds a child. One of the men says, “This is Herr Muller.” An official looks through papers, saying the man’s name over and over. The official asks a question, and the man says “Yes.” Then the man notices the woman has a big beard.

The two parts of this dream are easy to separate. The first is about being arrested, which seems new and made up by the dream. The second is about marriage, which is hidden but appears clearly when you look closely. The man’s promise to come back, the friends’ teasing, and the official checking papers all relate to marriage. The woman with the beard shows how the marriage idea has taken over the arrest idea in the dream.

The beard might seem strange, but it makes sense because the dreamer had talked with a friend the day before who joked that women get beards like their fathers as they grow older. The dream also has other strange parts, like the man saying “I will pay later,” which could mean he’s worried about the father-in-law’s demands about money. All these parts show the man isn’t ready to fully enjoy the idea of getting married because he has doubts and fears.
