Now, let's compare the dream to real life. The person dreaming has never been a wine seller and doesn’t want to be one. They have never been on a sea trip, and St. Helena is the last place they would want to visit. The dreamer doesn’t like Napoleon; in fact, they feel quite the opposite, proud of their own country instead. Also, the dreamer wasn’t even alive when Napoleon died on St. Helena, so it’s impossible they knew him personally. So, the dream feels completely separate from real life and time.

But, Hildebrandt says the opposite can also be true. Even if dreams seem isolated, they are closely connected to real life. Dreams always use material from reality and our thoughts about it. No matter how strange a dream looks, it can’t completely break away from the real world. The weird or funny stuff in dreams comes from things we have seen or thought about while awake. In other words, dreams borrow from what we have experienced, either outside or inside our minds.

It’s a fact that all the things in dreams come from our memories and experiences. But it’s wrong to think the link between a dream and real life is obvious. Actually, you have to look carefully because sometimes the connection is hard to find. This happens because memory works in a strange way in dreams. These strange memory habits have been noticed before, but no one has explained them well. It’s important to study these strange features closely.

Sometimes, things show up in dreams that we can’t remember having learned or experienced when awake. We remember dreaming about them clearly, but not where or when we first saw them. The dreamer doesn’t know where the dream got these details and might even think the dream made them up. But often, later on, something happens that reminds the dreamer of the forgotten experience, showing where the dream’s material came from. So, in dreams, we remember things we can’t remember when awake.

Delboeuf shares a strong example from his own life. He dreamed his house’s yard was covered in snow, with two little lizards half frozen in it. He cared for the lizards, warmed them, and put them back into their home in the wall. He even gave them some fern leaves he knew they liked. In the dream, he knew the fern’s name: Asplenium ruta muralis. The dream kept coming back, showing more lizards eating the ferns and walking down the road to the hole in the wall.

When awake, Delboeuf only knew a few Latin plant names and had never heard of Asplenium. To his surprise, he later found out this fern really existed, and its real name was Asplenium ruta muraria—the dream had just changed the name a little. It wasn’t a coincidence, but he didn’t know where he had learned the name in the dream.

This dream happened in 1862. Sixteen years later, Delboeuf was at a friend’s house and saw a small album of dried plants, like souvenirs sold in Switzerland. Suddenly, he remembered the dream. He opened the album and found the Asplenium fern, with his own handwriting on the Latin name. He realized he had written it down two years before the dream, in 1860, when his friend’s sister visited and showed him the album. He had copied the names for her, without remembering it later.

Delboeuf also found another part of the dream’s source by luck. In 1877, he found an old magazine with a picture of the lizards just like he dreamed in 1862. The magazine was from 1861, and he remembered subscribing to it since it started.

This shows dreams can use memories we can’t reach when awake. This is very important, so here’s another example. Maury once kept thinking of the word “Mussidan” during the day. He only knew it was a French city’s name. One night, he dreamed of talking to someone who said she was from Mussidan. When he asked where it was, she told him it was the main town in a part of Dordogne.
