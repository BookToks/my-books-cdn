My next goal is to explain that dream-work only happens because of three things working together—and a fourth thing I’ll talk about soon. Dream-work just changes the dream-thoughts into the dream we remember, following four rules. Asking if the mind uses all its thinking skills in dreams, or just some, is the wrong question because it doesn’t fit what really happens.

But since many dreams show thinking like judging, criticizing, recognizing facts, being surprised, trying to explain things, and arguing, I need to answer those problems by giving some examples.

Here’s my answer: Everything in dreams that seems like thinking or judging isn’t the dream-work’s thinking. Instead, it comes from the dream-thoughts themselves and shows up in the dream as a finished idea. I can even say the judgments we make about a dream after waking and the feelings we have when we remember it mostly come from the hidden dream-thoughts and should be included when we try to understand the dream.

1. One good example is about a woman who didn’t want to tell her dream because it was unclear. She saw a person but wasn’t sure if it was her husband or father. Then, another part of the dream showed a manure-pail, which reminded her of a funny story: when she was young, she joked about getting a new manure-pail, and the next day someone sent her one filled with lilies. This part of the dream means “Not grown on my own manure,” or not from her own effort. When we look deeper, the dream-thoughts also include a story from her youth about a girl who had a child but no one knew who the father was. The dream mixes with her waking thoughts, and the judgment about the dream comes from when she’s awake.

2. Another case: A patient had a dream that he thought was interesting. Right after waking, he told himself, “I must tell the doctor.” After we looked at the dream, it clearly related to a situation in his life that he didn’t want to talk about.

3. Here’s one from my own experience: I went to the hospital with a friend, P, through a neighborhood with houses and gardens. I thought I had seen this place before in my dreams. P showed me a path to a restaurant inside a building. I asked about a woman named Frau Doni and learned she lived in a small room at the back with three kids. I met an unclear person with my two little girls on the way. After spending time with them, I took the kids with me, feeling a bit like I was blaming my wife for leaving them there.

When I woke, I felt very happy because I thought the dream’s meaning would be clear soon. But the dream’s meaning didn’t explain that feeling. Instead, the happiness came from the hidden dream-thoughts, related to having children in my marriage. My friend P’s life had gone ahead of mine socially and financially, but he had no kids. The dream showed this.

The dream also connected to something I read the day before: a notice about a woman named Frau Dona A—y who died in childbirth. My wife told me the midwife who helped her with our youngest boys also helped Dona. The name Dona caught my attention because I’d recently seen it in an English book. The dream night was also the night before my oldest son’s birthday, who seems to have a talent for poetry.

4. I also woke feeling happy after a strange dream where my dead father played a political role among the Magyars. This feeling came from the last part of the dream, where he looked like Garibaldi on his deathbed, and I was glad it was true (though I forgot what came next). From the dream’s meaning, I now know it also refers to my second son, who I named after a famous historical person I admired as a boy, especially when I lived in England. I waited a year to use that name if the next child was a boy, and I was very happy to give it to him when he was born.

It’s clear how a father’s hidden wish for greatness gets passed on to his children in his thoughts. This might be how he deals with having to hide those wishes in real life. The little boy became part of the dream because he had an accident—he soiled his clothes, which can happen to a child or a dying person. This connects to the dream’s idea of a “judge” and the wish to be great and pure in front of one’s children.
