This is a detailed way of understanding dreams, not just looking at them all at once. It thinks of a dream from the start as something made up of different parts of the mind.

I have studied over a thousand dreams from people with mental health problems, but I don’t want to use those dreams now to explain how to interpret dreams. One reason is that those dreams come from sick people, so what I learn from them might not apply to healthy people’s dreams. Another reason is that those dreams are always about the person’s illness, so each dream needs a lot of background to understand, which would distract from the main point about dreams themselves.

My goal is to solve the problem of understanding dreams first, so I can later solve harder problems about mental health. Since I’m not using dreams from sick people now, I have to be very careful with the other dreams I have. These are dreams told to me by healthy people I know, or examples I found in books. But I don’t have the full analysis for these, which makes it harder to find their meaning.

I don’t use the easy way of interpreting dreams by just matching symbols to fixed meanings. I believe the same dream can mean different things for different people or situations. So, I use my own dreams because I know myself better, and they include many daily life events. Some might doubt if I can analyze my own dreams fairly, but I think it’s easier to understand yourself than to understand others. It’s worth trying to see what self-analysis can do for dream interpretation.

There are other challenges. I don’t want to share too many private feelings, and I worry others might misunderstand me. But I have to get past that. As one writer said, every psychologist has to admit their weaknesses if they want to shed light on a confusing problem. I hope readers will soon stop focusing on my personal details and focus on the psychology I explain.

So, I will pick one of my own dreams to show how I interpret dreams. Every dream needs some background first, so I ask the reader to share my interest and pay attention to even small details of my life. Understanding dreams means you have to get very involved.

Before I tell the dream, here’s some background. In the summer of 1895, I was helping a young woman named Irma, who was close to me and my family, with psychoanalysis. Such situations can be complicated and bring up many feelings for a doctor, especially when treating a friend. I was more personally involved, but maybe had less authority. If I failed, it could harm my friendship with her family.

In this case, the treatment helped her anxiety but didn’t cure all her physical symptoms. I wasn’t sure what really meant she was fully cured, and I thought she would accept a solution that she didn’t agree with. We stopped treatment for the summer.

One day, a younger doctor friend named Otto, who visited Irma and her family at their country home, came to see me. I asked how Irma was. He said, “She’s better, but not quite well.” His words and tone annoyed me. I felt like he was blaming me, maybe because her family didn’t like my treatment. I didn’t say anything about this feeling.

That same evening, I wrote down Irma’s medical history to share with another doctor friend, Dr. M, who was important in our group. During the night, I had this dream, which I wrote down right after waking.

Dream of July 23-24, 1895:  
I’m in a big hall with many guests, including Irma. I take her aside like I want to answer her letter and scold her for not accepting the “solution” yet. I say, “If you still have pain, it’s really your own fault.” She replies, “If you knew what pains I have now in my throat, stomach, and belly — I’m choking from them.”

I’m surprised and look at her. She looks pale and swollen. I think maybe I missed some real disease. I take her to the window to check her throat. She resists a bit, like someone with false teeth. I think she probably doesn’t need false teeth.

Her mouth opens wide, and I see a big white spot on the right side, and other grayish-white scabs shaped like nose bones. I quickly call Dr. M, who checks again and agrees.

Dr. M looks very different — pale, limping, and clean-shaven chin. Now my friend Otto is standing next to Irma, and another friend, Leopold, taps on her covered chest and says, “There’s a dull sound below on the left,” and points out a thickened skin patch on her left shoulder which I feel through her dress.

Dr. M says, “It’s definitely an infection, but it’s okay; dysentery will come and get rid of the poison.”
