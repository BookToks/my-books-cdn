5. If I had to find examples of judgments or opinions that stay inside a dream and don’t carry over to our waking thoughts, it would be easier to use dreams I’ve already talked about. Goethe’s attack on Herr M’s dream has a lot of judgments. I try to explain the timing a bit because it seems strange to me. Doesn’t it seem like a critical thought against the silly idea that Goethe attacked a young man I know? It seems likely the young man was 18. That sounds like a calculation, even if a silly one. Saying “I don’t know exactly what year it is” shows uncertainty or doubt in dreams.

But from analysis, I know these judgments, which seem new in the dream, can be understood differently. This makes them important to understand the dream without sounding silly. When I say “I try to explain the timing a bit,” I’m pretending to be my friend who is actually trying to figure out life’s timing. This sentence then isn’t a judgment against the previous nonsense. The phrase “which seems improbable to me” goes with “it seems plausible to me.” I once said almost the same words to a lady who told me about her brother’s illness: “It seems unlikely” that the cry “Nature, Nature” had anything to do with Goethe. It seems more likely it had a sexual meaning, which she knew about. In that case, a judgment was made, but it wasn’t a dream—it was a real memory used by the dream-thoughts. The dream uses this judgment like any other part of the dream-thoughts.

The number 18, which seems random in the dream’s judgment, still reminds me of the real judgment’s background. Lastly, “I don’t know exactly what year it is” is just to show I’m identifying with a paralyzed person who was checked and that fact was found out.

When figuring out these judgments in dreams, remember the rule that the connections between parts in dreams aren’t important. Each dream part should be looked at alone and traced back to where it came from. Dreams are made of many parts that need to be broken down to understand them. But we also realize there’s a psychic force in our dreams that makes these parts feel connected. This force works on the dream material again. This shows the psychic force, which we will soon study as one of four things that help create dreams.

6. Now let’s find other examples of judgments in dreams I’ve already mentioned. In the strange dream about a message from the town council, I ask, “You married soon after?” I think I was born in 1856, which seems right after. This looks like a conclusion. My father married shortly after his attack in 1851. I’m the oldest son, born in 1856, so this makes sense. But we know this conclusion was changed by wish-fulfillment, and the main idea in the dream-thoughts is: “Four or five years – that’s nothing – that doesn’t count.” The patient whose patience my colleague complains about plans to marry right after treatment ends. How I talk with my father in this dream reminds me of a test or questioning, like a professor who collected all personal info when students signed up: “When were you born? – 1856. – Father?” Then the student gave the Latin name of the father, and we guessed the professor made conclusions from the father’s name, which might not always be correct. So, drawing conclusions in the dream is just repeating conclusions from the dream-thoughts. 

This teaches us something new. If a conclusion happens in a dream, it definitely comes from the dream-thoughts. It might be from remembered stuff or it might connect a series of dream-thoughts logically. Either way, a conclusion in a dream is a conclusion taken from dream-thoughts.

It’s good to keep analyzing this dream. Remembering the professor’s questioning makes me think of a Latin index of students and my own studies. The five years for medical school weren’t enough for me. I worked without worrying for a few more years. People thought I was lazy and doubted I’d finish. Then I suddenly decided to take exams and passed despite the delay. This confirms the dream-thoughts I use to challenge my critics: “Even if you don’t believe it because I’m slow, I will finish (in German, ‘Schluss’ means end, conclusion, inference). It has happened like that before.”

At the start, this dream has several sentences that sound like an argument. This argument isn’t silly; it could happen in my waking thoughts. In my dream, I make fun of the town council message because I wasn’t born in 1851 and my father, who it might be about, is dead. Each statement is true and these are exactly the arguments I would use if I got that message.

From all this, we know the dream comes from very angry and mocking dream-thoughts. If we also think the dream-censorship is very strong, we understand that the dream-thoughts want to make a perfect answer to a dumb demand, following the pattern in the dream-thoughts.
