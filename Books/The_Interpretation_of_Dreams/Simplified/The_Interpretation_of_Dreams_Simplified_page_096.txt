(Some parts are unclear.) They had already decided who would go upstairs and who would go downstairs when they arrived. Then he walks alone up the hill toward the city. He walks so heavily and with such trouble that he can’t move from where he stands. An older man joins him and talks angrily about the King of Italy. Near the top of the hill, he finds it much easier to walk.

The struggle to climb the hill was so real that, for a while after waking up, he wasn’t sure if it was a dream or real life.

Looking at the obvious story in the dream, it’s hard to say it’s a good one. Breaking the usual rule, I’ll start explaining with the part the dreamer said was the clearest.

The trouble in climbing the hill, and feeling short of breath, was something the patient had actually felt years before. Back then, doctors thought it was tuberculosis (though it was probably just a fake symptom). From studying similar dreams, we know that feeling stuck or slowed down while moving is a common dream feeling. This dream uses that feeling again in a different way. The part where climbing is hard at first but easier at the top reminded me of a famous scene in Daudet’s book Sappho. In that scene, a young man carries the girl he loves upstairs. At first, she feels very light, but the higher they go, the heavier she feels. This represents their relationship, warning guys not to get too serious with girls from uncertain backgrounds.

Even though I knew my patient had recently dated an actress and then ended it, I didn’t expect my idea to be right. But the patient said the idea matched a play he had seen the night before. The play, called Rund um Wien (Round about Vienna), was about a girl who started off respectable but later joined the demimonde (a lower social circle) and got involved with important lovers. She climbed up but then went downhill fast. This play reminded him of another called Von Stufe zu Stufe (From Step to Step), which had a poster showing stairs.

To keep explaining: The actress he had the complicated recent relationship with lived on X-street, but there was no hotel there. While spending some time in Vienna for her, he stayed in a small hotel nearby. When leaving, he told the cab driver, “At least I didn’t get any vermin here!” (He’s very afraid of bugs.) The driver said, “How could anyone stay there? That’s not a hotel, it’s just a pub!” The pub made him remember a line: “Of a wonderful host I was lately a guest.”

But in a poem by Uhland, the host is an apple tree. Then another quote came to mind from FAUST (where Faust dances with a young witch):

A lovely dream once came to me; I then saw an apple tree,  
And there two beautiful apples shone:  
They tempted me so, I climbed up there.

THE FAIR ONE  
People have wanted apples since they first grew in Paradise;  
And I’m happy to know that such apples grow in my garden.

It’s clear what the apple tree and apples mean. The actress had a beautiful chest that was one of the charms that attracted the dreamer.

From the way the analysis goes, it seems the dream also reminded him of something from his childhood. If this is true, it probably refers to his wet nurse, since he’s almost thirty now. The nurse’s breast was like a small home or inn for the child. The nurse, like Daudet’s Sappho, seems to represent his recently ended relationship with the actress.
