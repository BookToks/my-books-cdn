In a dream, I’m given a strange task by an older man named Brucke—to prepare my own pelvis. While dreaming, I notice I don’t feel the horror I think I should. This is a kind of wish coming true in more ways than one. Preparing my pelvis represents me analyzing myself, like when I published my book about dreams. That was so hard and painful that I waited over a year before printing it. Now, I wish I could ignore this feeling of dislike, so I don’t feel horror in the dream.

I also want to avoid “Grauen,” which means horror but also “turning grey,” because my hair is already getting grey and reminding me not to wait any longer. At the end of the dream, I think, “I’ll have to leave my kids to finish their tough journey without me.” 

In two other dreams, I feel happy right after waking up. One happiness comes from expecting to understand what “I have already dreamed of this” means, which really refers to the birth of my first child. The other happiness comes from believing that a warning sign I saw means something important will happen, and that’s how I felt when my second son was born.

The feelings in these dreams come from the same deep thoughts but the process is probably more complicated than it seems. If you look closely, this happiness sneaks past my inner “censorship.” It hides behind acceptable feelings so it won’t be stopped.

Here’s an example from real life: Imagine there’s someone you really hate, and you secretly want something bad to happen to them. But your sense of right and wrong stops you from feeling happy about it, so you hide your true feelings and act sorry instead. Everyone has felt like this sometimes.

Now, if that person actually gets into trouble because they deserve it, you’re allowed to feel happy about it because it’s fair. But your happiness is stronger than others’ because your hidden hatred is finally free to show itself. This happens a lot in social life when unpopular people get punished more harshly than they should be, because people’s secret dislike adds to the punishment. The people who punish might not realize they’re being unfair because they feel relief from hiding their real feelings for so long. 

This shows that sometimes feelings are okay in quality but too strong in amount. People don’t always notice how much stronger their feelings are because they focus on whether those feelings are right or wrong.

This kind of thing is common in people with nervous problems. Their feelings can be too strong because hidden feelings come out when something triggers them. These hidden feelings connect with allowed feelings and make the total feeling much stronger. So, the hidden part and the part that controls it don’t just fight each other—they can work together and make problems worse.

When we try to understand feelings in dreams, we see they usually come from more than one source. One feeling helps another one get past the inner “censorship” and both join together. So, feelings in dreams are like many small streams flowing into one bigger river.

One dream that shows this well is where the phrase “Non vixit” (meaning “did not live”) is very important. In this dream, feelings of anger and pain come together when I destroy my enemy with just a few words. At the end of the dream, I feel very happy and even believe, though it sounds silly when awake, that ghosts could be chased away just by wishing.

I haven’t said why I had this dream. It’s important and helps explain the meaning. A friend in Berlin (I call him Fl) told me he was going to have surgery, and his family in Vienna would keep me updated. The first news after the surgery was bad and made me very worried. I wanted to visit him, but I was sick and moving hurt a lot.

From my dream thoughts, I realize I was afraid my dear friend might die. I knew his only sister had died young after a short illness. In the dream, Fl tells me about his sister, saying, “She died in three-quarters of an hour.” I must have thought Fl’s health was also weak. I feared I would have to travel soon, despite feeling bad, because of even worse news—and that I would arrive too late, which would make me feel guilty forever.
