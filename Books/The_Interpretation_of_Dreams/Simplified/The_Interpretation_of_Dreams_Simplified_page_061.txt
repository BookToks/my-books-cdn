I wrote about Koenigstein and a plant book so I could connect two different ideas. This way, part of the first idea could be a hint to the second one.

I know some people might say this explanation is random or made-up. What if Professor Gartner and his wife hadn’t shown up, and the patient wasn’t called Flora but Anna? The answer isn’t too hard.

If these connections weren’t there, other ones would have been chosen. It’s easy to make these links, like the fun puzzles and jokes we enjoy. There are endless ways to be clever. If no good connections could be made between the two ideas from the day, the dream would just follow a different path. Another random thing from the day, which we usually forget, would take the place of the plant book in the dream and link to the conversation.

Since it was the plant book and not something else that showed up, it was probably the best choice for the dream. We don’t need to be surprised, like Hanschen Schlau who said “only rich people have the most money.” Still, the way our mind swaps important ideas for less important ones seems strange. Later, we’ll try to explain why this odd process happens. For now, we just accept it because dreams often show this pattern.

It’s like the mind shifts attention from strong ideas to weaker ones until the weaker ideas become strong enough to appear in our thoughts. This kind of shifting isn’t surprising when it comes to feelings or actions. For example, a lonely woman might love animals, a single man might collect things passionately, a soldier fights hard for his flag, a small touch in love feels amazing, or a lost handkerchief makes Othello very angry. These are all examples of feelings moving from one thing to another. But when this shifting decides what we actually think and what we don’t, it feels strange, and if it happens when we’re awake, we call it a mistake. Later, we’ll explain that this process in dreams isn’t a mental illness but just a different, more basic way the mind works.

So, when dreams include little bits of unimportant experiences, we say the dream is “distorted” by this shifting. We also think there’s a kind of mental “censorship” between parts of our mind controlling this. Because of this, dream analysis usually finds the real important cause of the dream in the day’s events, even if the dream shows some less important memory instead. This idea is very different from Robert’s theory, which we don’t find useful anymore. Robert thought dreams clean out useless memories, but that’s not true. If dreams really did that, we’d be very busy during sleep, since there are so many unimportant things to forget. It’s more likely that we forget these easy without our mind working hard.

Still, we shouldn’t completely ignore Robert’s idea yet. We haven’t explained why some unimportant memory from the day always shows up in the dream. Sometimes, the connection between that memory and the real cause of the dream isn’t clear at first but is made while the dream is happening, probably to help with the shifting process. So, something must make this random memory especially useful for the dream. Otherwise, the dream could pick any unimportant thought.

Some experiences help explain this: If the day gives us two or more things that could become a dream, the dream tries to mix them into one story. For example: One summer afternoon, I got on a train and saw two people I knew, who didn’t know each other. One was an important coworker, and the other was from a fancy family I worked with. I introduced them, but during the trip, they talked to each other through me. I spoke about different things with each of them.

I asked my coworker to recommend a young doctor we both knew. He said the doctor was good but looked plain, so it would be hard for him to get rich clients. I said that’s why he needed recommendations. Then I asked the other man about his aunt, who was sick and the mother of one of my patients.

That night, I dreamed the young doctor I asked about was in a fancy room, talking like an important man. He was giving a funeral speech for the old lady, the sick aunt, who had died in the dream. The room was full of rich and noble people I knew.
