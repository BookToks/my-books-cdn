But what change makes it possible to go back in thought during sleep, something that can't happen during the day? Let's just guess for now. There must be changes in how different parts of the mind handle energy, making some parts easier or harder to react. But the same effect could happen for different reasons. We usually think of sleep and the many changes it causes in how we sense things. During the day, there's a steady flow from one part of the mind to the part that controls movement; this flow stops at night, so it can no longer block signals going the other way. This might explain why dreams feel disconnected from the outside world, as some people suggest. But to fully explain why dreams take us back to earlier thoughts, we also need to think about other times this happens, like in certain mental illnesses when people are awake. In those cases, this explanation doesn’t work because the usual flow of sensory signals keeps going.

Hallucinations in hysteria and paranoia, as well as visions seen by normal people, can be seen as going back to earlier thoughts turning into images. I believe that only thoughts connected to hidden or forgotten memories change like this. For example, I treated a 12-year-old boy who couldn’t sleep because he kept seeing scary "green faces with red eyes." This came from a memory he had pushed away about a boy he saw years before who had bad habits, including masturbation, which the boy now felt guilty about. His mother had noticed that boy’s face looked green and his eyes were red. That’s why the boy’s scary visions looked like this. It also reminded him of his mother’s warning that boys like that would become crazy, fail at school, and die young. Some of that warning seemed true for the boy: he struggled at school and was very afraid of what might happen next. But after a short treatment, he started sleeping well, felt less anxious, and did great in school.

I can also share a story from a 40-year-old woman who had a vision when she was healthy. One morning, she saw her brother in her room even though she knew he was locked up in a mental hospital. Her little son was sleeping beside her. To keep the boy from getting scared and having a seizure, she covered his face with a sheet. After that, the vision disappeared. This vision was connected to a childhood memory she still remembered, about how her mother—who died young—used to have seizures caused by being scared by the brother, who once appeared like a ghost with a sheet over his head. The vision had the same parts: the brother, the sheet, the fear, and what happened because of it. But these parts were put together in a new way and attached to different people. The real reason for the vision was her worry that her son, who looked a lot like his uncle, might have the same problems.

Both these examples are somewhat linked to sleep, so they might not be perfect proof. That’s why I also studied a paranoid woman with hallucinations and other mental illness cases to show that when thoughts go back and turn into images, it’s usually because of hidden or forgotten memories from childhood. These memories pull related thoughts into the regression and stop them from being expressed openly. From my research on hysteria, I found that if you can bring back childhood scenes into awareness—whether real memories or fantasies—they appear as hallucinations. They only stop being hallucinations once shared. Also, even people who don’t usually remember visually often keep their earliest childhood memories as clear pictures well into adulthood.

If we remember how important childhood experiences and fantasies are in dreams, and how often bits of these come back in dreams, even as wishes, it’s likely that in dreams, thoughts turn into pictures because they are attracted by these visual memories trying to come back. In this way, a dream can be seen as a stand-in for a childhood scene changed by new experiences. The childhood scene itself can’t come back fully, so it returns as a dream instead.

This idea about childhood scenes shaping dreams makes some other theories unnecessary. For example, Scherner and his followers think that vivid dreams come from visual excitement inside the eyes. I don’t disagree, but I think this excitement comes from memories of real visual experiences from the past. I don’t have a perfect example from my own dreams, which aren’t very rich in pictures compared to others, but in my most vivid recent dream, I can clearly see how the strong images came from things I had seen recently. In another chapter, I mentioned a dream where the colors of water, smoke, and buildings made a deep and lasting impression on me.
