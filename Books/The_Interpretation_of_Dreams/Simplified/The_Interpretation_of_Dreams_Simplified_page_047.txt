When we say childhood is happy because kids don’t yet feel sexual desire, we shouldn’t forget that there is another strong feeling that can cause disappointment and make kids daydream a lot.

Here’s an example. My nephew, who was almost two years old, was told to wish me a happy birthday and give me a small basket of cherries. Cherries were rare at that time of year. He found it hard to do and kept saying, "Cherries in it," while holding tightly to the basket. But he made up for it in another way. Every morning, he told his mom about a dream he had of a “white soldier,” a guard he once saw on the street. The day after he gave me the cherries, he woke up happily and said, "He man eaten all the cherries!" which was probably about a dream.

I don’t know what animals dream about. One of my students shared a saying: "What does the goose dream of? Maize." This shows the idea that dreams are about wishes coming true. We could have figured out what dreams really mean just by looking at common sayings. 

People often say dreams don’t mean much and call them "bubbles," but in everyday language, dreams mostly mean wishes coming true. When something amazing happens, we say, "I never imagined that in my wildest dreams," showing how dreams are connected to what we hope for.
