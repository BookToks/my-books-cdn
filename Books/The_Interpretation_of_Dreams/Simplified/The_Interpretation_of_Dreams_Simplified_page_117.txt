(Another dream from the same patient who’s afraid of open spaces.) Her mom sends her little daughter away so she has to go alone. Then she drives with her mom to the train station and sees her little girl walking right on the train tracks, so she’s sure to get hit by a train. She hears the bones breaking. (This makes her feel uneasy but not really scared.) She then looks through the train window to see if the pieces can be seen behind. Then she gets mad at her mom for letting the little girl go out alone.

It’s not easy to fully explain this dream. It’s part of a group of dreams, and you can only understand it by looking at the others. The patient first says the train trip is about leaving a hospital for nervous illnesses, where she was in love with the doctor. Her mom came to get her, and before she left, the doctor gave her flowers at the station. She felt awkward because her mom saw this. So in the dream, the mom is the one who messes up her feelings, like she did when the patient was a girl.

The next part, where she looks to see if the pieces are behind, seems like she’s thinking about the little girl’s broken body. But actually, she remembers seeing her dad naked from behind once. She talks about how you can see a man’s private parts from behind but not a woman’s. She now thinks the little girl in the dream is actually her own private parts. She’s mad at her mom for wanting her to live like she doesn’t have any private parts. The mom sending the little girl away means she has to be alone, which to her means no boyfriend or sexual relationships, and she doesn’t like that. She says her mom was jealous because her dad liked her more.

The deeper meaning comes from another dream that night where she sees herself as her brother.

She was a tomboy and people said she should have been born a boy. This shows that the little girl in the dream really means her private parts. Her mom threatened to punish her like castrating a boy for playing with her private parts, which means the dream shows she masturbated as a kid, though she only remembers her brother doing it. She once knew about male private parts but forgot later. The second dream also shows the childish idea that girls come from boys by losing something. The patient told a story where a boy asks a girl if she was “cut off,” and she says no, she’s always been like that. So sending the little girl away also means the threat of castration. She blames her mom for not having given birth to her as a boy.

Being hit by a train means sex, but you wouldn’t know that just from this dream without other information.

3. Using buildings, stairs, and shafts to represent private parts.

(A dream from a young man who feels held back by his dad.) He’s walking with his dad in a park, probably the Prater, because they see a round building called the Rotunda. In front of it is a small entrance with a balloon tied to it, but the balloon looks soft and limp. His dad asks what it’s for, surprised. The young man explains it. They go into a courtyard with a big sheet of tin on the ground. His dad wants to take a big piece but first looks around to see if anyone’s watching. The young man says all he needs is to ask the boss, and he can take as much as he wants. From the courtyard, stairs go down into a shaft with soft walls, like a leather chair. At the end of the shaft there’s a long platform, and then another shaft starts...

The young man was a hard case for therapy. He worked on his dream almost by himself. He said the Rotunda is his private parts, and the balloon is his penis, which he worries is limp. We can explain it more: the Rotunda stands for the butt, which kids often connect to private parts, and the small thing in front is the scrotum. The dad asks what the parts are for, but really the son should be the one asking. Since his dad never answered his questions about sex, the dream shows a wish: “What if I had asked my dad about sex?”

The courtyard with the tin is actually from his dad’s workplace. For privacy, the tin represents something else, but the dream’s words stay the same.
