The mention of propyls in the dream is an interesting example of how dreams mix things up. The dream actually included amyls, not propyls. You might think this was just a simple mistake in the dream, but it actually serves a purpose. When I think about the word "propylen" in German, it sounds like "propylaeum," which is a kind of entrance found in Athens and also in Munich. A year before the dream, I visited a sick friend in Munich, and the mention of trimethylamin, which comes right after propyls, clearly refers to him.

I won’t focus on the strange way dreams link very different ideas as if they were the same. Instead, I want to call the way amyls in the dream-thoughts get replaced by propyls in the dream itself a kind of flexible process.

On one side, there are thoughts about my friend Otto, who doesn’t understand me, thinks I’m wrong, and gives me a drink that smells like amyls. On the other side, there are thoughts about my Berlin friend William, who does understand me, always thinks I’m right, and has taught me a lot about the chemistry of sex.

What stands out in the Otto group depends on recent events that caused the dream; amyls are part of that. The big group of ideas about William is actually inspired by the contrast between William and Otto. The parts of William’s group that match the feelings stirred up by Otto are what get emphasized. In this whole dream, I keep pulling away from someone who makes me dislike another person, and I compare these two friends, listing the good points of one against the bad points of the other. So amyls in the Otto group reminds me of things in the other group related to chemistry. Trimethylamin, which fits in from different angles, appears in the dream too. Amyls could have stayed the same in the dream, but the William group influences it. From all the memories linked to amyls, the dream picks out something that fits both groups. Propyls is close to amyls, and the word "propylaeum" from the William group relates to Munich. Both groups come together in propyls - propylaeum. This middle idea sneaks into the dream as a kind of compromise.

This creates a shared idea that connects different meanings. It shows that having more than one reason for something helps it get into the dream. To make this shared idea, attention moves from what was really meant to something close to it in the connections.

Studying the dream about Irma’s injection helps us understand condensation in dreams. Condensation means picking out things that show up a lot in the dream, mixing people or images, and creating shared ideas. We will learn more about why and how condensation happens when we study the mental processes behind dreams. For now, we can just notice that condensation links the thoughts behind the dream and what actually appears in the dream.

Condensation is easiest to see when dreams play with words and their meanings. Dreams often treat words like objects and mix them up like they do with real things. These word-mixes can be funny or strange.

1. A colleague sent me an essay where he exaggerated the importance of a new discovery and used fancy words. That night I dreamed a sentence about the essay: "That is a truly norekdal style." It took me a while to figure out this made-up word. It seemed like a joke based on superlatives like colossal or pyramidal, but I wasn’t sure where it came from. Finally, I saw it split into two names, Nora and Ekdal, from plays by Ibsen. I had recently read an article about Ibsen by the same writer I was criticizing in the dream.

2. One female patient dreamt about a man with a light beard and a shiny eye pointing to a sign on a tree that said: uclamparia - wet. The man looked serious, and his shiny eye reminded her of a church near Rome, where she saw mosaic pictures of Popes. One early Pope seemed to have a golden eye (which is really an optical illusion). The man’s face looked like her clergyman, the beard reminded her of her doctor (me), and his height reminded her of her father. All these men guide her life. When asked more, the golden eye made her think of gold, money, and the expensive psychoanalysis she was worried about. Gold also made her think of a cure for alcoholism and a man she almost married who had a bad drinking problem. She doesn’t mind people drinking sometimes; she drinks beer and liqueurs herself.
