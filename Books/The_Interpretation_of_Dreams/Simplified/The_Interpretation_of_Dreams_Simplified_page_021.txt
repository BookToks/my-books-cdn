It's not really necessary to mention the statements of authors who agree with Maury about the higher mental activities in dreams.  

Strumpell says that in dreams—even when the dream doesn’t seem silly—our logical thinking and connections between ideas become less clear. Spitta says that ideas in dreams don’t follow cause and effect. Radestock and others point out that judgment and logical thinking are weak in dreams.  

Jodl says that in dreams, there’s no self-criticism or checking if what we see makes sense with everything else we know.  

He also says, “All the activities of our mind happen in dreams, but they’re incomplete, blocked, and separate from each other.” Stricker and others explain the contradictions in dreams by saying we forget facts or lose the logical links between ideas while dreaming.  

Even though these authors don’t think much of the mind’s work during dreams, they agree dreams keep some mental activity. Wundt, who influenced many dream researchers, agrees with this.  

We can ask, what parts of our normal mental life stay in dreams? Most agree that memory stays strongest in dreams; it might even work better than when we’re awake, even if some weird parts of dreams happen because we forget things while dreaming. Spitta says our feelings aren’t affected by sleep and guide our dreams. By feelings, he means the deep emotions that make us who we are.  

Scholz thinks dreams show mental activity by turning dream images into symbolic meanings. Siebeck also sees dreams as a way the mind interprets everything it notices.  

It’s hard to judge how much consciousness, the highest mental function, works in dreams. Since we only know about dreams through consciousness, it must still be there. But Spitta thinks only consciousness stays in dreams, not self-consciousness—the awareness of being aware. Delboeuf admits he doesn’t understand this difference.  

The mental connections that link our images also work in dreams, maybe even more clearly than when we’re awake. Strumpell says dreams seem to follow only the simple rules of how images connect, without any thinking, reasoning, or moral judgment. The authors think dreams start when different sensations during sleep create images that seem like hallucinations or illusions. These images connect to each other by known association rules, which then bring up new images. This process is worked on by the still-active part of our thinking mind. But no one has figured out what decides how these images connect when they don’t come from outside stimuli.  

It has been noticed that the connections between dream images are different from those in waking life. Volkelt says, “In dreams, ideas grab onto each other based on random, slight similarities. All dreams are full of these loose and accidental connections.” Maury thinks this is very important because it makes dreams similar to some mental illnesses. He says two main features of “delirium” are: (1) spontaneous, automatic mind activity; (2) strange and irregular connections between ideas.  

Maury gives two good examples from his own dreams. Once, he dreamed he was on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem or Mecca. After many adventures, he met a chemist named Pelletier, who gave him a galvanized shovel. This shovel then turned into a big sword in his dream. In another dream, he was walking along and read distance signs, then ended up in a grocery store with big scales. A man weighed him using kilogram weights, and the grocer told him he was on an island called Gilolo, not in Paris. Then he saw pictures of a flower and a general he had recently read about. The dream ended with him playing a lotto game.  

We know that many people have disagreed with the low opinion of mental activity in dreams. But it’s hard to argue against it. It doesn’t matter much that Spitta says the same psychological rules apply to waking and dreaming, or that Dugas says, “A dream isn’t pure nonsense or pure reason,” if neither explains how dreams show such mental chaos.  

However, some people think the craziness of dreams might have a hidden order. Maybe it’s just acting crazy, like Hamlet pretending to be mad. These authors either avoided judging dreams by how they seem or saw different things in dreams.
