I know from my work with people who have mental struggles what kind of memories tend to show up like this. Most people look up encyclopedias to understand the confusing feelings about sex that come with growing up.

The ideas I shared before, which seemed unlikely at first, have since been tested and supported by Jung and his students in their studies.

Since writing this, I have thought that being aware actually happens where memories are stored in the brain.

We need to think more about this idea that the part of the mind after the preconscious is where awareness happens. So, the preconscious equals consciousness.

The first sign of going backward in thinking appears in the works of Albertus Magnus. He said that imagination builds dreams from real things it remembers. This is the opposite of how we think when we are awake. Hobbes said dreams start from the opposite end compared to waking thoughts.

There is a Greek word, Kathexo, meaning to hold or use energy, which is used here to explain mental energy.

In explaining repression, a thought gets pushed away by our conscious mind and pulled by the unconscious, like being helped up a pyramid.

Unconscious mental acts are very strong and never disappear. They work like in the Odyssey, where spirits come back to life when they drink blood. But thoughts in the preconscious can break down. Therapy for mental illnesses depends on this difference.

I have tried to learn more about sleep and hallucinations in my essay about dreams.

Here, we can think about the super-ego, a concept later important in psychoanalysis.

In other words, we need a way to test what is real.

Le Lorrain praises how dreams fulfill wishes easily, without hard work or struggle that tires us out.

I have explained this more, saying there are two main ideas: the pleasure principle and the reality principle.

One part of a symptom is the unconscious wish coming true, and the other part is the mind’s reaction against it.

Hughlings Jackson said, “Learn all about dreams, and you will learn all about madness.”

I also wrote about how hysterical symptoms come from hidden fantasies related to being attracted to both sexes.

This idea comes from Liebault’s sleep theory, who brought back hypnotic research in modern times.
