I want to show that dreams can be understood and explained. Any help with the problems we’ve already talked about will only come as a bonus while I focus on this main goal. If we assume that dreams can be explained, I don’t agree with most popular ideas about dreams—except for one by Scherner. To explain a dream means to find out what it really means and see how it fits into our mind’s activities in an important way. But most scientific ideas say dreaming isn’t a mental activity at all; they say it’s just a physical process that shows up in the mind as symbols.

Regular people have always disagreed with these scientific ideas. Even though they admit dreams can be weird and confusing, they don’t want to believe dreams have no meaning. People feel that dreams must mean something hidden, like a secret message replacing another thought, and if we figure out the right way to read it, we can find the dream’s real meaning.

Because of this, people have always tried to interpret dreams using two main methods. The first method looks at the whole dream and tries to switch it for another idea that makes sense and is kind of similar. This is called symbolic dream-interpretation, but it doesn’t work well when dreams are confusing or don’t make sense. A good example is the biblical story where Joseph explains Pharaoh’s dream about seven fat cows eaten by seven skinny cows. The cows symbolized seven good years followed by seven bad years of famine in Egypt.

Many poet-made dreams also use this symbolic way, showing ideas in a disguised form like dreams do.

People used to think dreams mostly predicted the future, based on old beliefs that dreams were like prophecies. This idea makes people try to connect dream meanings to future events using symbolic interpretation.

You can’t really explain exactly how to get these symbolic meanings. It’s mostly guesswork or an intuition, which is why dream interpretation has been seen as an art that needs special talents.

The second popular method is called the cipher method. It treats dreams like secret codes where every symbol stands for something else, using a guide or "dream-book." For example, if you dream about a letter and a funeral, you look them up and find "letter" means trouble and "funeral" means a promise. Then you try to connect these to predict the future. A smarter version of this method was used by Artemidoros of Daldis, who also thought about the dreamer’s personality and social life. That way, the same dream could mean different things to a rich person, a poor person, or a single person.

This method looks at each part of the dream separately, like a puzzle where every piece needs its own explanation. Confusing dreams probably led to this method being made.

Both these popular methods don’t really work well. Symbolic interpretation only works sometimes and can’t be explained fully. The cipher method depends on how good the dream-book is, and there’s no proof those are reliable. Because of this, some philosophers and scientists think trying to interpret dreams is just a waste of time.

But I think differently. I believe that old popular beliefs about dreams might actually be closer to the truth than modern science’s ideas. I’m sure dreams do have meaning, and that there is a scientific way to interpret them. I found out about this method through years of work with mental health problems like fears and obsessions, trying to help patients get better.

I’ve been doing this since I heard something important from Joseph Breuer: when we understand the root cause of these mental problems, the problems go away and the person feels better. Since other treatments didn’t work and these problems seemed mysterious, I decided it was worth trying Breuer’s approach until I fully understood it.
