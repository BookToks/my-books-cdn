The patient’s older brother also shows up in the dream; he is upstairs, while the dreamer is downstairs. This is the opposite of what really happened, because the brother actually lost his social status, but the patient kept his. When telling the dream, the dreamer didn’t say the brother was upstairs and himself downstairs, because in Austria saying someone is “on the ground floor” means they have lost their money or social status. So this switch in the dream must mean something important.

This upside-down idea is also seen at the end of the dream, where someone is climbing, but in a way that’s the opposite of a story about Sappho. In Sappho’s story, a man carries a woman he is close to, but in the dream, a woman carries a man. This could only happen in childhood, referring to a nurse carrying a heavy child. So the end of the dream connects both Sappho and the nurse in the same idea.

Just like the name Sappho wasn’t chosen randomly, the parts of the dream with people upstairs and downstairs hint at sexual thoughts the dreamer is thinking about but trying to hide. Dream interpretation doesn’t prove if these are real memories or just fantasies; it just gives us ideas to think about. Sometimes real and imagined events seem equally important, not just in dreams but also in bigger parts of the mind.

A large group of people in dreams often means there’s a secret. The brother in the dream represents someone from childhood who is connected with the dreamer’s later thoughts about women. There’s also a part about a man angrily talking about the King of Italy, which hints at people from lower classes trying to join the upper class. It’s like a warning for young men, but also for babies. In the dreams I mentioned, I showed where parts of the dream repeat in the dreamer’s thoughts to make the connections clearer. Since these dreams aren’t fully analyzed yet, I will now look at a dream that is fully studied to show how many things come together in a dream. I will use the dream about Irma’s injection (see chapter II) as an example. This dream shows that dreams combine many things in different ways.

The main person in the dream is Irma, who looks like she does in real life, so she first represents herself. But her behavior in the dream comes from memories of another woman, the one I wish could replace Irma, as the dream thoughts show. Because Irma has a throat problem like diphtheria, which reminds me of my worry for my oldest daughter, she also represents my daughter. Behind this, linked by their names, is the patient who died from poison.

Later in the dream, Irma’s role changes without her image changing. She becomes one of the children we examine at public health clinics, where my friends show differences in their mental skills. This happens because of my thoughts about my little daughter. Because Irma won’t open her mouth, she also reminds me of another woman I examined, and also my wife. The sick changes in her throat also remind me of several other people.

All these people I think about when I think of Irma don’t appear in the dream themselves; they hide behind Irma, who becomes a mix of different people. This makes her image confusing and mixed up. Irma stands for these other people, who are combined into one because I let anything happen to her that reminds me of them.

Sometimes, to mix people in dreams, I combine the real features of two or more people into one dream character. For example, Dr. M in my dream has the name, voice, and behavior of Dr. M, but his looks and illness are from my oldest brother. One feature, paleness, fits both of them. Dr. R, from my dream about my uncle, is another mixed character. But here, instead of mixing features, I put the two faces on top of each other like a family portrait, so the things they share look stronger, and the parts that don’t match fade away. In my uncle’s dream, the fair beard stands out clearly because it belongs to both men, but the rest of the face looks fuzzy. The grey beard also connects to my father and me.

Making mixed or group characters is one of the main ways dreams combine different ideas. We will talk more about this later.

The idea of dysentery in Irma’s injection dream has many meanings: it sounds like diphtheria, and it also refers to a patient I sent far away whose illness was misunderstood.
