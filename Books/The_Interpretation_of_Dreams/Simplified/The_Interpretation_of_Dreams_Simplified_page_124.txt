The dreamer says: Between two big, fancy palaces, there is a small house a little bit back, with its doors closed. My wife leads me down a short road to the house and pushes the door open. Then I slip quickly and easily into a courtyard that goes up steeply.

Anyone who knows about dreams will notice that going into small spaces and opening locked doors often stand for sexual stuff. This dream shows an attempt at sex from behind (between the two big cheeks of a woman’s body). The narrow, steep path is the vagina. The wife helping the dreamer means he only stops because he cares about his wife. Also, the day before, a young girl came to the dreamer’s home. She made him happy and seemed open to him getting close. The little house between the palaces reminds the dreamer of a place in Prague, where the girl is from.

When I talk to patients about the Oedipus dream—dreams about having sex with one’s mother—they often say, "I don’t remember such dreams." But then they recall another dream they’ve had many times that seems boring or confusing. After looking at it closely, it turns out to be an Oedipus dream in disguise. I assure you, hidden dreams about sex with the mother are much more common than obvious ones.

Here’s an example of a disguised Oedipus dream: A man dreams he’s secretly seeing a woman another man wants to marry. He worries the other man will find out and stop the marriage, so he acts nice and even kisses him. In real life, the dreamer secretly sees a married woman. Her husband, who is friendly with the dreamer, said something that made the dreamer think he might know about the affair. But there’s more: The husband is sick and might die soon. The woman is ready for that, and the dreamer wants to marry her after. This situation makes the dreamer’s mind create the Oedipus dream. He wishes the husband would die so he can marry the woman. The dream hides this wish by showing the other man only wanting to marry her, not already married. The dreamer shows his bad feelings with fake kindness, which go back to how he felt toward his own father as a kid.

Some dreams are about places that feel very familiar, like “I’ve been here before.” This feeling, called Deja vu, means something special in dreams. In one case, a patient with obsessive thoughts dreamed he visited a house he had been to twice before. But when he was six years old, he shared his mother’s bed and did something wrong by touching her while she was asleep. The familiar place in the dream is really the mother’s genitals.

Many dreams that feel scary and involve going through tight spaces or spending time in water are about being in the mother’s womb before birth. Here is a dream of a young man who imagined spying on his parents having sex while he was still inside his mother.

He is in a deep tunnel with a window like the Semmering tunnel. First, he sees an empty landscape outside. Then, suddenly, a picture appears, showing a field being plowed, with fresh air and dark soil, which feels nice to him. Next, he sees a book about education open and is surprised that so much is about children’s sexual feelings, making him think of me.

Here is a nice water dream from a female patient that helped in her therapy.

At her usual holiday spot by a lake, she jumps into the dark water where the pale moon shines on it.

Dreams like this are birth dreams; the meaning is found by flipping the dream’s story. So instead of jumping into the water, it means coming out of the water—being born. The place of birth can be guessed by the French word for moon, “la lune,” which sounds like the white bottom of the water where a baby might imagine coming from. I asked the patient why she wanted to be born at a holiday spot. She said, “Hasn’t the treatment made me like I was born again?” So the dream is a sign to keep the treatment at that summer place—maybe it also secretly shows she wants to become a mother. Another birth dream and its meaning come from a paper by E.
