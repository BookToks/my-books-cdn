It’s wrong to say that when we try to understand dreams, our minds just wander without any purpose. Even when we stop thinking hard and let random ideas come up, we still can’t completely lose control of our thoughts. We only reject thoughts we know about, but once those stop, unknown or unconscious thoughts take over and guide the flow of ideas. We can’t think without these guiding ideas, and no mental illness shows a way of thinking without them either. Psychiatrists have given up too soon on the idea that our mind’s structure is solid. Even in conditions like hysteria and paranoia, or in dreams, a completely random flow of thoughts doesn’t happen.

Maybe this kind of uncontrolled thinking only happens in serious brain damage. But what some people think is free thinking in mental illnesses can actually be explained by a kind of mental censorship that pushes some thoughts forward because hidden ideas are controlling them. People say free association happens when ideas connect only through surface-level links like similar sounds or timing, not deeper meaning. This kind of connection shows up in dreams a lot. In dreams, even silly or weak connections serve as bridges from one thought to another. But these shallow links happen because the mind’s censorship blocks deeper, more important connections.

The reason shallow connections show up more often is because the mind’s censorship blocks normal pathways. When the usual ways are blocked, shallow connections take their place, like when a flood blocks main roads and people have to use rough mountain trails instead.

There are two cases here, but they’re really the same. First, censorship blocks the link between two thoughts, so the thoughts appear one after the other but their connection is hidden. Instead, we see a shallow link that connects different parts of the idea. Second, censorship blocks both thoughts, so they show up changed and replaced by other thoughts that connect through shallow links. So censorship causes normal meaningful connections to be replaced by shallow and strange ones.

Because we understand these replacements, we trust even shallow links when interpreting dreams. Psychoanalysis uses two main ideas: when we stop controlling our thoughts consciously, hidden ideas take control; and shallow connections are just substitutes for deeper, hidden ones. These ideas are the base of psychoanalysis. When I ask a patient to stop thinking carefully and say whatever comes to mind, I believe they can’t drop the main idea of getting treatment. So even if their thoughts seem random, they relate to their problems. Another hidden idea influencing them is my own presence. Fully explaining this belongs to psychoanalysis as therapy. Here, we stop talking about dream interpretation.

One real objection remains: not all the associations we find come from the dream itself. When we interpret dreams while awake, we follow a path backward from the dream’s images to the thoughts behind them. The dream happens in the opposite direction. These paths probably don’t work the same both ways. During the day, new thoughts connect to the earlier ones, creating new links and detours because of added mental resistance since the night.
