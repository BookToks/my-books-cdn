After I finished writing my manuscript, I found a paper by Stumpf that agrees with my idea that dreams have meaning and can be interpreted. But his method uses symbolic stories, and there’s no proof that this way works for all dreams.

Every psychologist has to admit their own mistakes if it helps explain a hard problem.

I should say that I almost never shared a full interpretation of my own dreams. I probably did the right thing by not trusting readers too much.

This is the first dream I really studied and explained in detail.

The stomach pain mentioned in the dream is still a mystery, but I think it refers to a third person—my wife. The pain reminds me of times when she felt shy. I admit I don’t treat Irma or my wife very kindly in the dream, but that’s because I’m comparing them to the perfect, brave, and obedient patient.

I think I didn’t dig deep enough into this part to find all the hidden meanings. If I kept comparing these three women, I’d go way off topic. Every dream has at least one part that can’t be understood—a central mystery that links it to the unknown.

Also, the word “Ananas” sounds a lot like my patient Irma’s last name.

The dream wasn’t a prediction, but it was right in another way. The stomach pains, which I didn’t want to be blamed for, actually came before a serious illness caused by gallstones.

Even if I haven’t explained everything about the interpretation as you might expect.

CHAPTER 3 THE DREAM AS WISH-FULFILLMENT

Imagine walking through a narrow path and suddenly reaching a high place where the path splits and you can see beautiful views in different directions. It’s a good time to stop and decide which way to go next. That’s how it feels after understanding this first dream interpretation.

We now see clearly that a dream isn’t like random noises made by a broken instrument. Dreams are not meaningless or silly. They don’t happen because part of our mind is asleep and another part is awake. Dreams are real mental events, showing a wish being fulfilled. They fit with the clear mental activities we have when we’re awake and are made by a very complex thinking process.

But just as we’re about to celebrate this discovery, many questions arise. If a dream shows a wish coming true, why does it appear in such a strange and unfamiliar way? What changes happen to our thoughts before the dream appears as we remember it? How do these changes happen? Where does the stuff in the dream come from? Why do dream thoughts sometimes contradict each other? Can dreams teach us new things about our minds? Can they correct ideas we had during the day?

For now, I suggest we ignore these questions and focus on one thing. We found that the dream shows a wish being fulfilled. Next, we need to find out if this is true for all dreams or just the one about Irma’s injection that we studied first.

Even if every dream has meaning and value, that meaning might not be the same in every dream. The first dream was about a wish coming true. Another dream could be about a fear coming true. A third dream might just show a reflection. A fourth might simply be a memory.

So, are there dreams that are not about wishes? Or are all dreams wish-dreams?

It’s easy to see that wish-fulfillment in dreams is often clear and easy to spot, which makes you wonder why people haven’t figured out the language of dreams long ago.
