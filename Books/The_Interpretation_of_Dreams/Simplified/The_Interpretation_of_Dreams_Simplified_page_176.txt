Sometimes, the capitalist is also the entrepreneur; this actually happens quite often. A hidden wish gets triggered by the day’s work, and this starts the dream. The dream process shows many different ways the economic relationship can work. For example, the entrepreneur might put in some capital themselves, or several entrepreneurs might ask the same capitalist for help, or several capitalists might join together to provide the needed money. So, dreams can be supported by more than one wish, and many other variations can happen, but we don’t need to talk about those now. There is still something missing in our talk about the dream-wish, which we will finish later.

In the examples used, there is a certain amount of something that the dream can use freely, which helps us understand the dream’s structure better. As explained before, most dreams have a center with strong sensory feelings. This center usually shows the wish being fulfilled. If we look closely, the strong feelings in the dream come from the wish. Sometimes, the things near this wish don't really relate to what it means but come from painful thoughts that oppose the wish. Because these painful thoughts are connected to the main wish, they get some of its energy and show up in the dream. So, the power of the wish spreads to nearby ideas, making even weak ones appear in the dream. When a dream has several wishes, we can separate the different areas for each wish, and the empty parts in the dream often mark the borders between them.

Even though we said that recent daily experiences aren’t very important for the dream, they still deserve some attention. Every dream has a link to something that happened recently while awake, even if it seems unimportant. We don’t yet understand why these things are part of dreams. The answer comes when we think about unconscious wishes and what we learn from studying mental illnesses. An unconscious idea can’t enter the part of the mind we’re aware of on its own. It can only affect that part by connecting with a harmless idea already there, which carries its energy and hides it. This is called transference, and it explains many strange things in the minds of people with mental problems. The harmless idea may stay the same but becomes stronger, or it may change because of the unconscious idea. To explain this, think of an American dentist in Austria who can’t work unless a licensed doctor lets him use their name as a cover. Also, just like busy doctors don’t usually help dentists, unconscious ideas don’t connect with important ideas in the conscious mind. Instead, they attach to ideas that were ignored or pushed away. It’s well-known that ideas closely linked in one way tend to resist new connections. I even once tried to explain a kind of paralysis using this idea.

If we accept that unconscious ideas need this kind of cover in dreams too, we can explain two things about dreams: why they always include recent experiences, and why these recent parts often seem unimportant. We also know that these recent, simple parts appear in dreams because they don’t face much mental resistance. The simple parts are chosen because they don’t trigger lots of connections, and the recent parts because they haven’t had time to form many connections yet.

So, recent daily experiences, including the unimportant ones, not only get energy from unconscious wishes when they become part of dreams but also give the unconscious something it needs — places to connect through transference. To understand this better, we would need to study how the conscious and unconscious parts of the mind interact, which mental illness studies could help with. But dreams don’t help us much here.

One last thing about recent daily experiences: it’s these that really disturb our sleep, not the dreams themselves. In fact, dreams try to protect our sleep. We will talk more about this later.
