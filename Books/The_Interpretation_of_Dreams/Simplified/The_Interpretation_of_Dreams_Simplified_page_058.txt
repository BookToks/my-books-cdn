To show how often this happens, I will look at some of my own dreams. I will only share as much as needed to find the source of the dream.

1. I visit a house and have a hard time getting in, while a woman waits for me.

Source: The night before, I talked with a female relative who said she would have to wait for the money she asked for.

2. I have written a detailed report about a certain kind of plant.

Source: In the morning, I saw a report about Cyclamen plants in a bookstore window.

3. I see two women on the street, a mother and her daughter, who is a patient.

Source: A female patient told me the night before how her mother makes it hard for her to keep up with her treatment.

4. At a bookshop, I sign up for a magazine that costs 20 florins a year.

Source: During the day, my wife reminded me that I still owe her 20 florins from her weekly allowance.

5. I get a message from the Social Democratic Committee, calling me a member.

Source: I had received messages that day from the Liberal Committee on Elections and from the president of the Humanitarian Society, which I really belong to.

6. I see a man standing on a steep rock rising out of the sea, like in a painting by Bocklin.

Source: News about Dreyfus on Devil’s Island and messages from my family in England.

You might wonder if dreams always connect to events from just the day before, or if they can come from memories from a longer time ago. This question is not very important, but I think dreams mostly come from things that happened the day before.

Whenever I thought a dream was from something two or three days old, I found out that I remembered it again the day before the dream. So, the memory was fresh again before I dreamed about it. I could not find any regular time gap between what I experienced during the day and what appeared in my dream.

I believe every dream’s cause comes from things that happened “on which one has not yet slept.” Havelock Ellis, who also studied this, said he couldn’t find any pattern in his dreams. He told about a dream where he was in Spain and wanted to go to a place called Daraus, Varaus, or Zaraus. When he woke up, he didn’t remember any place like that. Months later, he found out Zaraus was a train station he had passed 8 months before the dream.

So, memories from the recent past (except maybe the day before) are like memories from a long time ago in how they relate to dreams. A dream can pick its material from any time in life, as long as there is a connection from recent experiences back to older ones.

But why do dreams mostly come from recent memories? We can guess by looking more closely at one of my dreams. I choose the dream where I wrote the detailed report about a plant. In the dream, the book is in front of me; I am turning the pages. Every copy has a dried plant pressed inside, like in a collection of plants.
