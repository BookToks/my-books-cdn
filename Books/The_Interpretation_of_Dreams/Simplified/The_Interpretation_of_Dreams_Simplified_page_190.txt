A doctor can’t agree with the idea that being aware, or conscious, is the most important part of the mind. If the doctor still respects what philosophers say, he might think that they are actually talking about different things and studying different subjects.

Just one smart look at the mind of someone with mental health issues, or one simple dream analysis, can show that very complex and exact thinking can happen without the person being aware of it. The doctor only finds out about these hidden thoughts when they affect the person’s awareness in a way that can be noticed or shared.

But what appears in our awareness can be very different from the hidden process behind it, so we can’t just say one is the same as the other. The doctor has to figure out, by thinking carefully, how the hidden mind caused what shows up in awareness. He learns that these hidden processes don’t actually become conscious, and they happen without the person noticing.

A thinker named Du Prel says the question “What is the mind?” needs us to first ask if consciousness and mind are the same. Dreams prove they are not the same, because the mind is bigger than just what we are aware of, like how a star’s gravity reaches farther than its light.

It’s very important to understand that consciousness and the mind are not exactly the same thing.

Before we can really understand how the mind works, we have to stop thinking that consciousness is the most important part. Another thinker, Lipps, said the unconscious mind is the main part of our mental life.

The unconscious is like a big circle that includes the smaller circle of conscious thoughts. Everything we are aware of first starts in the unconscious, but unconscious thoughts don’t have to become conscious to be real parts of the mind. The unconscious is the true reality of the mind; it is just as unknown to us as the real world outside, and it is only roughly shown to us through what we are aware of, just like our senses only give us a rough idea of the outside world.

Many old questions about dreams stop being a problem when we stop thinking conscious life and dream life are totally different. Dreams are not strange; they are actually unconscious thinking, which happens during the day too.

If a dream seems to show symbols about the body, it’s because of hidden fantasies, probably related to sexual feelings, that show up not only in dreams but also in fears and other mental symptoms.

If a dream finishes mental work started during the day and even brings new ideas, we only have to remove the dream’s disguise to see this as help from hidden parts of the mind. The smart ideas come from the same mental forces responsible for all daytime thinking.

We often think too much about how important awareness is in creating ideas and art. Famous creators like Goethe and Helmholtz said their best ideas came to them like sudden inspirations, almost fully formed, without much conscious effort. Sometimes, when all parts of the mind work together, conscious thinking helps too. But conscious thinking often hides all the other mental work happening behind the scenes.

It’s not really necessary to talk much about the historical importance of dreams. For example, if a leader was inspired by a dream to do something bold that changed history, it only seems mysterious if we think dreams are magic powers, different from other mental forces.

The mystery goes away when we see dreams as a way to express feelings that were blocked during the day but got energy from deep inside the mind at night.

Ancient people respected dreams because they wisely guessed that dreams come from a strong, wild part of the soul, a powerful force that gives us our wishes in dreams, and that force is what we now call the unconscious.

I say “our unconscious” on purpose, because what we call unconscious isn’t the same as what philosophers or Lipps meant. They just mean what’s not conscious. The question is whether both conscious and unconscious mental processes exist, which some people argue about a lot.

Lipps said everything mental exists as unconscious at first, and some of it also becomes conscious. But to prove this, we don’t need to look only at dreams or mental illnesses; normal life shows it clearly.

What we learned from studying mental illness and especially dreams is new: the unconscious mind actually works as two separate systems, and both exist even in normal mental life.

So, there are two kinds of unconscious that psychologists haven’t clearly separated yet. Both are unconscious in the usual sense, but in our view, the first kind, called Ucs, can never become conscious. The second kind, called Pcs, can become conscious if certain rules are followed. Maybe the thoughts have to go through a kind of mental “censorship” before they can reach awareness, but they do this separately from the first kind.

Because these thoughts have to go through certain steps before reaching consciousness, and are changed by this process, we describe them using ideas like space to help explain how it works.
