Dreams often make opposite things seem the same. They can show something as its exact opposite, so at first, it’s hard to tell if something in a dream means the positive or negative side of that thing.

In one dream, a girl named Mary climbs down a trellis holding a flowering branch. This reminds her of the angel in paintings holding a lily, and girls walking with green branches on a special day. The branch in her dream clearly stands for sexual innocence. But the branch has red flowers like camellias, and by the end of the dream, the flowers start falling, which hints at menstruation. The branch also refers to a character named Camille, who wore a white camellia usually, but a red one when menstruating. So, the same branch means both innocence and its opposite. The dream shows the girl’s happiness about staying pure, but also suggests she might feel guilty about mistakes she made as a child. The dream mixes two opposite ideas, one comforting and one more serious, using the same symbols.

Dreams work best with ideas that are similar or connected. They often use things that are alike to hide or change what the dream really means. A big part of dreaming is mixing things together in new ways, especially things that are alike.

Dreams usually show similarity by combining things into one. Sometimes this happens by identifying one person for several others who share something in common. Other times, dreams mix features of different people or things to create a new, combined figure. Places can even be shown like people in dreams.

When one person stands for two or more related people, the dream shows only that one person. This person acts in ways that belong to all the others they represent. When people are combined, the dream might mix their looks, names, actions, or gestures to make a new person. Sometimes, the dream tries to combine people but fails, so one person acts while the other just watches. That watching person is like an extra clue that explains the dream.

The reason two people get combined in a dream is because they share something important. This shared part might not even show up in the dream because combining them helps avoid showing it directly.

For example, instead of showing “A is mad at me, and B is mad at me,” a dream might create a single person who is both A and B. This new person can do things that belong to either A or B. This lets the dream pack a lot of meaning into one image and avoid showing complicated relationships one by one. It also helps the dream get past the mind’s “censor” that blocks upsetting or forbidden thoughts. The censor might reject ideas connected to one person, but not to a combined person who mixes less upsetting features of both. This way, the dream can include tough ideas in a less obvious form.

When a dream shows a shared feature of two people, it usually hints that there is another hidden shared feature the censor won’t allow to appear directly.
