There is a dream I can have whenever I want, almost like an experiment. If I eat salty foods like anchovies or olives in the evening, I get thirsty at night and wake up. But before waking, I always have the same dream: I am drinking water. The water tastes amazing because my throat is really dry. Then I wake up and feel thirsty for real. The dream happens because I’m thirsty, and it shows me drinking to satisfy that thirst. This dream helps me because I sleep well and usually don’t wake up because of body needs. If I can “drink” in my dream, I don’t have to wake up to drink for real. It’s a dream that makes things easier. But sometimes, like when I’m really thirsty, the dream can’t fully help. I once dreamed my wife gave me water from a special old vase, but the water tasted salty, so I had to wake up. The dream tried to solve the problem, but it wasn’t perfect. The vase was something I used to have and miss, so it showed up in the dream, too.

When I was younger, I often had “convenience-dreams.” I worked late and didn’t like waking up early. I dreamed I was already up and standing by the sink, but I was still actually asleep. A friend of mine had a funny version of this. His landlady tried to wake him for work, but he dreamed he was already at the hospital lying in bed. He told himself, “If I’m already there, I don’t have to go,” and went back to sleep. He admitted the dream was just to avoid getting up.

Here’s another dream caused by something happening while sleeping: A woman patient had surgery on her jaw and had to wear a cooling device all the time. But she always took it off when she fell asleep. One day she said she couldn’t help it because in her dream she was at the opera, but she thought about a man with jaw pain and said, “I don’t have pain, so I don’t need this.” So, she threw the device away in her dream. This shows how dreams can reflect what people want or feel, even if it’s not true.

Other dreams I’ve heard also show wish-fulfillment. A friend told me his wife dreamed she was having her period, but actually, her period had stopped. This dream meant she hoped to enjoy her freedom before having a baby. Another friend’s wife dreamed she had milk stains on her shirt, meaning she was pregnant again and hoped to have more milk this time.

A young woman who had been isolated while caring for a sick child dreamed of being with famous writers who were very nice and fun. One of them looked like the man who cleaned her sickroom. This dream meant she was ready for fun and company after being stuck taking care of the child.

These examples show that many dreams are simple and clear wish-fulfillments. They are different from the confusing and mixed-up dreams that people often talk about. Simple dreams are easier to understand and are common in children, whose minds are less complicated than adults’. Studying children’s dreams might help us understand adult dreams better, just like studying simple animals helps us understand more complex ones.
