The number and form of the clues we create during the day don’t really matter, as long as they help us find the dream-thoughts we’re looking for.

Now that we’ve answered some objections or at least shown how to defend against them, it’s time to start the psychological study we’ve been preparing for. Let’s sum up what we’ve learned recently: Dreams are important mental acts. They always come from wishes we want to come true. Dreams don’t look like wishes and often seem strange or silly because the mind’s censorship changes them while they form.

Besides avoiding this censorship, other things affect how dreams form: first, a need to shorten the mental material; second, the need to show it in images we can sense; and third (not always), the need for the dream to seem logical and understandable. Each of these ideas leads to more psychological questions. Now, we need to study how the wish motives and these four conditions connect, and see where dreams fit in mental life.

At the start of this part, we talked about a certain dream to remind us of problems we haven’t solved. The interpretation of that dream (about the burning child) wasn’t hard, though it wasn’t fully explained. We wondered why the father had to dream instead of just waking up, and saw that the dream wanted to show the child as still alive. We’ll show there was another wish in the dream after more discussion. For now, we can say the dream changed the sleep thought process to fulfill a wish.

If the wish-fulfillment is removed, only one thing makes dreams different from other mental events. The dream-thought might be: “I see a light from the room where the body is. Maybe a candle fell and the child is burning!” The dream shows this thought exactly but makes it seem like it’s happening right now and can be sensed like a real event. This is the most common and important feature of dreams: a thought, usually a wished-for one, is turned into a scene that feels real or experienced.

But how do we explain this special feature of dreams, or how do we connect it to mental processes?

Looking closer, the clear form of the dream has two main features that are almost separate. One is that it shows the event as if it’s happening now, leaving out words like “maybe.” The other is that the dream turns the thought into pictures and speech.

The change that puts the dream-thought into the present tense might not stand out much in the burning child dream. This is probably because the wish-fulfillment is less important in that dream. Let’s look at another dream where the wish follows the waking thoughts more closely, like the dream about Irma’s injection. The dream-thought is: “If only Otto could be blamed for Irma’s illness!” But the dream drops the “if” and says simply: “Yes, Otto is to blame for Irma’s illness.” This is the first change even a clear dream makes to dream-thoughts. But we won’t focus too much on this right now.

We can compare this to daydreams, which act the same way with ideas. For example, in Daudet’s story, M. Joyeuse wanders the streets unemployed while his daughter thinks he has a job. He dreams in the present tense about things that might help him get a recommendation and a job. Dreams use the present tense just like daydreams do. The present tense shows the wish as already fulfilled.

The second special thing about dreams, different from daydreams, is that ideas aren’t just thought but turned into pictures we believe and feel like real experiences. However, not all dreams turn ideas into pictures. Some dreams are just thoughts, but they are still dreams. For example, my dream “Autodidasker” about Professor N is almost all thoughts, with hardly any pictures, like something I’d think during the day. Also, long dreams often have parts that aren’t turned into pictures but are just thoughts or known ideas like when we’re awake.

We should note that turning ideas into pictures isn’t only in dreams. It also happens in hallucinations and visions, which can happen in healthy people or in mental illnesses. So, this connection isn’t unique to dreams. Still, this feature is the most important part of dreams, and we can’t think about dreams without it. But understanding it fully needs a lot of detailed discussion.

Out of all the ideas about dreams, I want to highlight one important point. The famous G. T. H. Fechner suggested that dreams happen somewhere different than our waking thoughts do.
