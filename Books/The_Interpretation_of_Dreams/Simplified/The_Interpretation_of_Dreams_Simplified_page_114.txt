Everything shows that we don’t need to think there’s a special way our mind uses symbols when we dream. Instead, dreams use symbols that already exist in our unconscious thoughts. These symbols work well for dreams because they’re easy to understand and usually not blocked by our inner “censors.”

I first noticed dream symbols a long time ago when I studied a personal dream. But it took me a while to fully understand how common and important these symbols are, especially after reading the work of W. Stekel.

Stekel helped psychoanalysis a lot, but he also caused some problems. At first, people didn’t believe his new ideas about symbols, but many of them turned out to be true. Still, some of his examples weren’t convincing, and his way of figuring out symbols was not scientific. He used his gut feelings to understand symbols right away, but that kind of skill can’t be trusted for everyone. It’s like a doctor guessing an illness by smell—sometimes it works, but it’s not a reliable method for everyone.

Over time, psychoanalysis found some patients who had a special ability to understand dream symbols quickly. Many of these patients had a mental illness called dementia praecox, so people thought this ability might be linked to the illness. But that wasn’t true. It’s just a unique skill some people have, and it doesn’t mean anything bad.

When you learn that many dream symbols represent sexual stuff, you might wonder if these symbols always mean the same thing, like shorthand signs. You might even want to make a new “dream dictionary” based on these symbols. But symbolism isn’t just about dreams—it’s part of how people’s unconscious minds work. You see symbolism more clearly in stories, myths, sayings, and jokes than in dreams. So, to really understand symbols, we have to look beyond just dreams.

Symbols show things indirectly, but we have to be careful not to treat all indirect signs the same way. Sometimes a symbol clearly relates to what it means, but other times it’s a mystery. These tricky symbols are important because they hint that symbols come from old connections. What is symbolically linked today might have been literally the same thing a long time ago. Symbols remind us of this past connection. Sometimes symbols go beyond language, as people noticed even in the early 1800s.

Dreams use symbols to hide their true meaning. Some symbols almost always mean the same thing. But our minds are flexible, so a symbol might sometimes mean exactly what it seems, or the dreamer might use a symbol in a unique way based on personal memories. When choosing symbols, the dreamer picks ones that fit best with other thoughts in the dream.

Since Scherner’s time, scientists have proven that dream symbols really exist. Even Havelock Ellis agrees that dreams are full of symbols. But symbols make understanding dreams harder, not easier. Just using the dreamer’s free thoughts to explain symbols often doesn’t work. Going back to random guesses, like people did long ago or like Stekel’s wild ideas, isn’t scientific.

Because of this, we have to use a mixed method: listen to the dreamer’s associations and also use the interpreter’s knowledge of symbols. We have to be careful and study clear examples of dreams to avoid guessing too much. The difficulties in interpreting symbols come from both our limited knowledge (which can improve) and the strange nature of dream symbols themselves.
