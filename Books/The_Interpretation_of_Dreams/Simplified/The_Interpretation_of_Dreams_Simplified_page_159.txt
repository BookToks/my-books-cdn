It took me a while to understand how important the thoughts and fantasies about life before birth really are.

These ideas explain why many people have a strange fear of being buried alive. They also show the deepest reason why people believe in life after death—it’s like imagining the mysterious life we had before we were born. Being born is the first time we feel anxiety, and this experience is where anxiety comes from.

Certain symbols in dreams have special meanings. For example, water can mean urine, semen, or the fluid that surrounds a baby before birth. A ship can stand for peeing or for sperm. Getting wet can mean bed-wetting, sex, or pregnancy. Swimming can mean having a full bladder or being in the place where a baby lives before birth. Rain can symbolize peeing or fertilization. Traveling or getting out of bed can mean having sex or going on a honeymoon. Urinating can mean sexual release.

Many experts have studied these symbols and how they appear in dreams and thoughts.

Some dreams involve numbers and complicated math, but the person dreaming often solves these problems easily.

Sometimes, people explain their actions with stories that fit many reasons at once. For example, if someone is late, they might say it’s because they worked late and then had a long trip to get somewhere.

Dreams can also be influenced by things we saw during the day, like pictures or books. For example, a dream filled with tiny figures came from looking at detailed drawings about a terrible war.

Dreams sometimes make fun of thoughts they find silly by creating funny or strange images.

One dream I had was about saving my kids from Rome. This dream also reminded me of something from my childhood and showed that I felt jealous of relatives who had moved their kids to another country.

Some expressions in German mean things like “That’s not my problem” or “It’s not because of me.”

When people have a dream during therapy and feel they need to tell the doctor, they often resist sharing it or even forget the dream later.
