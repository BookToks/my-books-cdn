Even when she was standing next to the coffin of her older, much-loved son, she might still have felt a quiet, gentle love for the visitor she had missed so much.

Another patient had a similar dream. She had always been smart and cheerful, and she still showed these traits when talking freely during her treatment.

In her long dream, she saw her fifteen-year-old daughter dead in a box. She didn’t want to believe this dream was about wanting something, but she thought the box might mean something else. The night before, people had talked about the English word “box” and all its German meanings, like a small container, a theater box, or a slap on the ear. She also thought about the German word “Buchse,” which sounds like “box” and is a slang word for female private parts.

So, the child in the box could actually mean a child in the mother’s belly. At this point, she admitted the dream did match a wish she had. Like many young women, she wasn’t happy about being pregnant and had even wished the baby would die before being born. After a fight with her husband, she had hit her stomach, trying to hurt the baby. So, the dead child in the dream was really her wish coming true, but it was a wish she had forgotten after many years. A lot had changed since then.

Dreams about the death of loved ones, like these two, will be talked about again under “Typical Dreams.” I will show more examples proving that even bad dreams are actually about wishes coming true.

Here’s another dream, told to me by a smart lawyer who wanted me not to jump to conclusions about my theory. He said, “I dreamed I was walking in front of my house with a woman on my arm. A closed carriage was waiting, and a man showed me he was a police officer and asked me to come with him. I asked for time to get my things in order.” He then asked me, “Do you think I wished to be arrested?” I said, “No.” I asked, “Do you know what the charge was?” He said, “Infanticide.” I told him that only a mother can be charged with killing her newborn baby. He agreed.

I asked what had happened the night before. He hesitated but then said he had spent the night at a woman’s house, someone very important to him. In the morning, something happened between them, then he went back to sleep and had the dream. I asked if the woman was married. He said yes. I asked if he wanted her to get pregnant. He said no, because it would cause trouble. I asked if they used normal sex. He said he made sure to pull out before finishing.

I guessed he had done this several times that night and the next morning wasn’t sure if it worked. So, his dream was a wish showing he didn’t make the woman pregnant or, in other words, that he had “killed” the child. I showed him how his dream connected to a recent talk we had about marriage problems and the idea that having sex without getting pregnant is okay, but hurting a fetus after it’s formed is a crime.

We also talked about an old argument about when the soul enters a fetus, because murder is only possible after that point. He strangely said he thought of a poem by Lenau that compares killing babies and birth control. That was another sign from his dream.

I also pointed out another wish in the dream: walking up to his house with the woman on his arm, instead of spending the night at her place like in real life. The wish showed itself in an ugly way, maybe because pulling out during sex can cause anxiety, which he was feeling. This nervous feeling helped hide the real wish in the dream.

I asked why he thought of infanticide, a crime only mothers commit. He admitted that years ago, a girl he knew tried to get an abortion to avoid problems from being with him. He wasn’t involved, but he worried it might get found out. That memory made the idea of messing up the birth control even more upsetting.

A young doctor who heard this story felt it fit him, so he made up a similar dream. He had just told the tax office about his income, which was small. In his dream, an acquaintance told him the tax office doubted his report and he would be fined. This dream really meant he wished to be known as a doctor with a big income.

It also reminds me of a story about a girl who was warned not to marry a man who would beat her. She said, “I wish he would hit me!” Her wish to get married was so strong that she even wished for the bad parts of marriage.
