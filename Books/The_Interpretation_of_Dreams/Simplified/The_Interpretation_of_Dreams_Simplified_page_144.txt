I’m going to share a dream example where the feelings in the dream don’t match the gross stuff happening in it. The reason for this is that the thoughts in the dream are fighting with each other. I have to tell you this short dream, even though you might find it really disgusting.

IV.

There’s a hill with something like an outdoor toilet on it—a long bench with a big hole at one end. The back of the bench is covered with piles of poop, some fresh and some old. Behind the bench, there’s a bunch of bushes. I pee on the bench, and the long stream of urine cleans everything, making the poop fall into the hole. But it still feels like something is left behind at the end.

Why didn’t I feel disgusted in this dream?

Because, when I think about it, good and nice thoughts helped create this dream. When I analyze it, I remember the Augean stables cleaned by Hercules. In the dream, I am Hercules. The hill and bushes remind me of Aussee, where my kids are now. I have figured out the childhood causes of neuroses and protected my kids from getting sick.

The bench (without the hole) looks just like a piece of furniture a kind female patient gave me. This shows how much my patients respect me. Even the museum of human poop can have a good meaning. No matter how gross it is, it reminds me of beautiful Italy, where small towns have toilets like this.

The stream of pee washing everything clean stands for greatness. It’s like how Gulliver put out a huge fire in Lilliput by peeing on it, even though the tiny queens got mad. It’s also like Gargantua, a giant hero, who pees on Paris to get back at the people there. Just the day before, I was looking at pictures of Gargantua in a book before I went to bed.

Also, I was once really into climbing the towers of Notre-Dame in Paris, hanging out with the gargoyles. The fact that the poop disappears quickly before the pee fits the saying: “He blew and they were scattered,” which I plan to use as a chapter title for healing hysteria.

Now, about what made me have this dream. It had been a hot summer afternoon. In the evening, I gave a lecture about the link between hysteria and strange behaviors. I didn’t like what I said at all—it felt useless. I was tired and didn’t enjoy my hard work. I wanted to get away from digging into dirty human stuff, first to see my children, then to think about the beauty of Italy.

After the lecture, I went to a café to get some fresh air and a snack because I wasn’t hungry. But someone from my audience followed me and asked if he could sit with me. He started praising me, saying he learned a lot from me, that I changed how he saw things, and that I had cleaned out wrong ideas about neuroses. He called me a very great man.

I wasn’t in the mood for his compliments. I felt disgusted and left early to get away from him. Before going to sleep, I looked through the book about Rabelais and read a short story called The Sorrows of a Boy.

This dream came from all that. The story reminded me of childhood scenes. My bad mood from the day stayed in the dream because most of the dream came from that feeling. But during the night, a strong and even over-the-top confidence woke up and chased away the bad feelings. The dream had to include both feeling bad about myself and feeling great at the same time.

This made the dream’s meaning unclear, and the feelings in the dream ended up neutral because the opposite feelings canceled each other out.

According to the idea that dreams show what we wish for, this dream wouldn’t have happened without the opposite, hidden but happy thoughts of feeling super important mixed with the disgust. Dreams don’t want to show pain. Painful thoughts only get into dreams if they can hide a wish or a happy meaning.

Dreams can handle feelings in another way too—they can change feelings into their opposites. We know that in dream interpretation, anything in a dream can mean its opposite as well as itself. We can’t know for sure which one it is until we look at the whole dream.

People even guess this, which is why dream books often say the meaning might be the opposite of what the dream shows. This changing into the opposite happens because our thoughts connect things with their opposites. Like other tricks in dreams, this helps the dream “censor” or hide things. But it’s often part of wish-fulfillment because wishing means swapping something unwanted with its opposite.

Just like pictures in dreams can turn into their opposites, so can the feelings behind the dream thoughts. This change is probably caused by the dream’s censor. Changing or hiding feelings isn’t just for dreams—it happens in real life too, like when people act fake or hide their real feelings.
