Painful dreams can sometimes be punishment dreams. This idea adds something new to how we understand dreams. These dreams fulfill an unconscious wish – the wish to be punished for a hidden, forbidden desire. So, these dreams still follow the rule that the reason behind dreaming comes from an unconscious wish.

But if we look closer, we see a difference between punishment dreams and other wish-dreams. In some dreams, the wish comes from hidden thoughts inside us. In punishment dreams, the wish is also unconscious, but it comes from the ego (the part of us that deals with reality), not from the hidden thoughts.

Punishment dreams show that the ego plays a bigger role in making dreams than we thought. Instead of just thinking about conscious versus unconscious, it's better to think about ego versus hidden material. This idea is connected to mental illnesses, so it’s not fully covered here. It’s important to know that punishment dreams don’t always happen because of bad thoughts during the day. They often happen when the day’s thoughts are actually nice but involve something forbidden. In these dreams, the opposite of those nice thoughts appears, just like in some other types of dreams. So, punishment dreams come from a wish inside the ego that wants to punish the dreamer, even though this wish is unconscious.

I will explain this with one of my own dreams, which also shows how the dream deals with a painful worry from the day:

The dream starts vaguely. I tell my wife I have big news for her. She gets scared and doesn’t want to hear it. But I say it’s good news and start telling her that our son’s Officers’ Corps sent some money and an honorable mention. We go into a room, kind of like a storeroom, to get something. Suddenly, I see my son. He’s not in uniform but wearing a tight sports suit like a seal, with a small cap. He climbs on a basket near a chest to put something on it. I call to him, but he doesn’t answer.

It looks like his forehead is bandaged, and he’s putting something in his mouth. His hair has some gray in it. I wonder if he’s really tired or has false teeth. Before I can speak again, I wake up, not scared but with a fast heartbeat. It’s 2:30 a.m.

I can’t explain the whole dream, but some important points stand out. The dream came from painful worries I had during the day. I hadn’t heard from my son, who was fighting in the war, for over a week. The dream shows my fear that he might be hurt or dead. At first, the dream tries hard to replace these painful thoughts with their opposite. I want to say good news about money and honors. (The money came from a happy event in my medical work, trying to change the dream’s topic.) But this doesn’t work. My wife feels something bad is coming and doesn’t want to listen. The hidden meaning shows through everywhere.

If my son died, his friends would send back his things, and I’d have to give them to family members. Honors are often given after an officer dies heroically. So, the dream tries to express what it first wanted to hide, but it does this in a twisted way. The change of place in the dream might have a symbolic meaning.

We don’t know what gave the dream its strength. But my son isn’t shown as hurt in battle; instead, he’s climbing. He was a brave mountain climber. He’s in a sports suit, not uniform, which reminds me of a ski accident he had once when he broke his leg. The suit looking like a seal reminds me of our funny little grandson. The gray hair reminds me of my son-in-law, who had a hard time in the war. What this means is unclear.

The room, the chest, and what he’s doing remind me of an accident from my childhood. When I was 2 or 3, I climbed on a stool in the pantry to get something nice from a chest. The stool fell, and I hit the lower jaw. I might have lost my teeth. At this point, a thought pops up: “You deserved it,” like a mean feeling against the brave son. A deeper look shows a hidden wish that my son would have an accident – a secret envy of youth I thought I had stopped in real life. The strong fear that something bad might happen helped this secret wish come out in the dream.

Now I can explain what the unconscious wish means for a dream. Some dreams mostly come from day thoughts. For example, I worried about my friend Otto’s health and wanted to become a professor. These thoughts helped me sleep better that night. But the worry alone wouldn’t make a dream. The dream needed some energy, and this energy comes from a wish. The day thought is like someone who has an idea and wants to make it happen, but they need money to do it. The “money” for the dream is always an unconscious wish that provides the energy to create the dream.
