Since each event happens because of the one before it, the ruler never gave powerful men in the country a break between wars when they could plan against him.

A leader can also earn respect by showing strong character in how he handles things at home, like Bernabo` Visconti did in Milan. Whenever someone does something important, good or bad, people come up with rewards or punishments that get everyone talking. But most importantly, a ruler must make sure people think he is someone with great skills.

A ruler will be respected when he is a true friend or a true enemy, meaning he clearly supports one side and opposes the other. This approach works better than staying neutral. For example, if you have two strong neighbors at war, you might or might not be scared of the winner later. Either way, it’s usually smarter to pick a side and join the fight. If you are scared but stay neutral, the winner will take over anyway, and you’ll have no way to defend yourself.

It’s important that a ruler never teams up with a stronger person just to attack his enemies, unless it’s absolutely necessary. When you win, you’ll owe your ally, and rulers should avoid depending on others for power. The Venetians teamed up with France to attack the Duke of Milan, but it was a terrible choice they could have avoided. But if a ruler can’t avoid an alliance, like Florence did when the pope and Spain attacked Lombardy, then he must pick a side for the reasons mentioned.

Also, rulers should never think any decision they make is completely safe. For example, when Antiochus was sent to Greece by the Aetolians to fight the Romans, he asked the Achaeans, who were Rome’s allies, to stay neutral. The Romans told the Achaeans to join their side. After the debate, the Romans said that staying neutral would hurt the Achaeans the most—they wouldn’t get any thanks or help from anyone.

A good ruler wins respect by planning and doing great things, keeping his people interested and excited about what he is doing.
