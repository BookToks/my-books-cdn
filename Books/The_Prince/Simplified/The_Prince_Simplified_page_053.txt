The most intense part of this scandal is when the author talks about Cesare Borgia, a man who got power and kept it by being really sneaky and cruel. The translator might want to make the book seem more shocking by focusing on Machiavelli’s extreme ideas, even if the original tone isn’t exactly what readers expect.

At the end of the section about Borgia, after explaining how he lost power when his dad, Pope Alexander, died suddenly and a new pope who didn’t like Borgia was chosen, Machiavelli writes: "After looking at everything the duke did, I wouldn’t know how to blame him." One translator, Bull, says: "So having summed up all that the duke did, I cannot possibly criticize him." The word "criticize" here has a strong moral meaning, and adding "cannot possibly" sounds like a strong statement. It makes it seem like Machiavelli is saying he has no moral problems with anything Borgia did, which fits with Machiavelli’s reputation for being pretty cynical.

Another translator, Marriot, is more careful and says: "When all the actions of the duke are remembered, I don’t know how to blame him." Both Italian translations agree with this idea. The point is that just like the word "virtù" isn’t really about good or bad morals, the word "riprendere," meaning "to blame," isn’t about moral behavior either. It’s more about whether the duke made a mistake or did something wrong.
