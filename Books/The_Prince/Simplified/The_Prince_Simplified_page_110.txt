A lot of big cities started fighting against local nobles who needed the emperor’s support to keep their armies and control. The Church helped the rebels because it wanted to have more power by increasing citizen armies. In many other towns, private citizens took over as rulers. Because much of Italy was now controlled by the Church and republics—people without war experience—leaders began hiring soldiers from outside.

The first successful mercenary leader was Alberigo da Conio from Romagna. Auxiliary armies, which means asking a powerful ruler to send troops to defend your town, were also not very useful.

Francesco Sforza and others became important leaders in Italy’s future. A recent example is Pope Julius during his campaign in Ferrara: after seeing how badly mercenaries fought, he made a deal with Ferdinand, King of Spain, to get help. Auxiliaries can be useful for their own goals, but they usually cause problems for those who hire them. If they lose, you lose; if they win, you are at their mercy.

Mercenaries tried to seem more important by ignoring infantry. They didn’t have their own land and lived off what they gained from fighting. They couldn’t support large numbers of infantry, so they focused on cavalry, which they fed and respected more. This meant an army of 20,000 might have fewer than 2,000 infantry.

Mercenaries avoided hard work and danger. They didn’t kill each other in battle but took prisoners instead. They avoided night attacks, didn’t leave their forts to attack enemies, didn’t dig ditches or build defenses around camps, and didn’t camp outside in winter. They did all this because they wanted to avoid danger and work.

This behavior became normal, and it helped bring Italy to a low point. The emperor started losing control of Italy while the pope gained more power. As a result, the country split into smaller states.
