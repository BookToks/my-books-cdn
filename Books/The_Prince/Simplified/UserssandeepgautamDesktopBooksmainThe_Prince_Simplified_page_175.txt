In a treaty from 1474, the person himself was blamed for a murder. His short time as a leader was mostly spent in the east, where military problems made him lose power. Eventually, he was defeated by supporters of a 14-year-old king named Heliogabalus, who was the grandson of Caracalla’s aunt, Julia Maesa.

Louis XII (1462–1515) was King of France from 1498 to 1515. Before becoming king, he was the Duke of Orleans. He took over after his cousin Charles VIII died in 1498. Louis made a deal with Pope Alexander VI to divorce his first wife and marry Charles’s widow, which helped him add Brittany to France.

The Orleans family had claims to both Milan and Naples. Louis made a deal with Venice to split Milan’s land and took the town in 1499. The Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, got the town back in 1500 but was pushed out again. Louis also worked with Spain to divide the Kingdom of Naples and captured the town for France in 1501. However, Spain and France argued over the deal, and in 1503, the Spanish beat the French at Garigliano.

In 1508, Louis joined the Holy Roman Empire, England, the Papal States, Florence, and Spain in the League of Cambrai, a team against Venice. Louis led the army and won a big battle at Agnadello in 1509. But this made Rome and France more powerful, which caused them to fight. In 1510, Pope Julius II formed the Holy League with England, Spain, Switzerland, and the Holy Roman Empire to push France out of Italy. This goal was reached at the battle of Novara in 1513. Two years later, Louis’s successor, Francis I, took Milan and much of northern Italy.

Maximilian (1459–1519) ruled the Holy Roman Empire from 1486 to 1519. He wanted to bring his empire’s many different parts together by making the government stronger. He also wanted to take back power in Italy and lead a fight against Islam. While his work at home was somewhat successful, his foreign policies were confusing and didn’t work well. Because of this, Switzerland became an independent country in 1499.

Maximilian tried to get land back from Venice but kept failing because he had to focus on stopping France from growing stronger. In 1495, he joined the League of Venice to kick the French out of Italy but didn’t get much from it. In 1496, he was asked by the Duke of Milan (his wife’s uncle) to send an army against France, but France didn’t attack. He was persuaded to help Pisa fight Florence, but the army couldn’t save Pisa. From 1507, Maximilian tried to take land from Venice but didn’t make much progress. In 1512, he joined the Holy League to push the French out of Italy. When Francis I took Milan again in 1515, Maximilian tried one more time to stop France from moving north of the Alps but failed.
