Soderini got away, and the Medici family came back to power. Machiavelli lost his job and couldn’t find a new one.

The shocking part of The Prince came more from how it was written than from Machiavelli trying to be shocking on purpose. The book, first called On Principalities, starts by sorting out different types of states and governments at different times. Then, it jumps between old and new history to find some general rules about how to gain and keep power in each type of state. Because Machiavelli had lots of experience, read a lot, and was honest, he had to say that sometimes leaders have to break normal moral rules to win and keep power. He said that once someone wins, people usually won’t challenge them. Leaders were basically above the law.

If Machiavelli had spent more time saying this was a bad thing, or if he had judged leaders by things other than just staying in power and making their state strong, or if he had said that power isn’t worth it if you have to give up your morals, he might have avoided a lot of criticism while still saying the same facts. But except for a few small mentions that the world should be a nicer place, Machiavelli didn’t do this.
