Between his missions, he was often busy helping Florence in its ongoing fight to take back Pisa, which had become independent again during the French invasion. Pisa was very important to Florence’s trade because it gave the city access to the sea.

People usually say Machiavelli wasn’t a great diplomat and that his work during these years only helped him gather ideas for his later writing after he lost his job.

But Machiavelli probably didn’t see it that way. For over ten years, he was Florence’s main diplomat and was proud of it. If his missions didn’t have big success, it was mostly because Florence was the weakest of the main Italian states during a confusing and dangerous time. Eventually, four foreign powers—France, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and Switzerland—got involved in Italy’s conflicts.

Savonarola had pushed Florence to team up with France. The leaders after him kept this plan but didn’t have a clear idea of how to make the city safe and stable in the long run. Things got worse in 1502 when Florence decided their leader, called the gonfaloniere or first minister, should be chosen for life. They picked Piero Soderini, a good man but one who couldn’t make strong or bold decisions.
