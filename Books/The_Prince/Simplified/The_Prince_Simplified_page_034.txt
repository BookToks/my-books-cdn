During the Renaissance in Italy, the bad guy in plays was changed to include ideas from Machiavelli. This made the villain a sneaky courtier who enjoyed being cruel and planning evil things. English theatre then copied this idea, creating many tricky bad guys like gossipers, greedy people, or jealous husbands who were good at using poison and always carried a hidden dagger.

For playwrights, a sneaky character with secret plans who thinks they are smarter than everyone else is really interesting. This kind of character creates drama, keeps the story exciting, and helps the plot end with good winning over bad. Even though the audience dislikes these characters, like Marlowe’s Jew of Malta, Webster’s Flamineo, or Shakespeare’s Iago, they also find it exciting to imagine someone who can control everything, trick people, and follow their own selfish goals without caring about right or wrong. In this way, the Machiavellian villain is like the worst kind of modern selfish person.

There is also fun in watching the clever bad guy get caught in their own trap.

As time went on, and the serious Jacobean tragedies became more like the comedies of Ben Jonson and others, the evil Machiavellian villain turned into a silly failure whose wicked plans always backfired, making them look foolish.
