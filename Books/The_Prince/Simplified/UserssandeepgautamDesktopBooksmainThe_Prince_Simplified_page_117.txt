When a leader is getting ready for war, and even when he’s back leading his armies, he must always think about war. There’s nothing that can happen that he shouldn’t know how to handle. Preparing for war is something a ruler has to work on even more during peace than during war itself.  

He can do this in two ways: physically and mentally. Physically, besides keeping his soldiers fit and disciplined, he should go hunting a lot. This will make his body stronger. It will also help him learn about different kinds of land—how mountains rise, valleys open up, and where rivers and marshes are. He needs to study these things carefully because this knowledge helps in two ways. First, it helps him understand his own country better, so he can defend it well. Second, knowing about hills, valleys, plains, rivers, and marshes in one place makes it easier to understand other places too.  

A ruler who doesn’t understand land misses something very important. Knowing the land helps you find the enemy, lead your army the right way, pick a good place to camp, plan battles, and surround towns in the best way.  

Mentally, a ruler must read history, especially stories about great leaders and what they did. He should study their war strategies, understand why they won or lost, and learn from their mistakes and successes. Most importantly, he should pick a great leader as a role model and always remember their example and achievements. For instance, Alexander the Great looked up to Achilles, Caesar admired Alexander, and Scipio copied Cyrus.  

If you read about Cyrus in Xenophon’s writings, you can see how much Scipio learned from him. Scipio’s good qualities like kindness, charm, and generosity were just like Cyrus’s. A smart leader will follow this advice and never relax during peace. Instead, he should work hard to use peace well so that when tough times come, he will be ready.  

One leader historians really liked was Philopoemen from Achaea. Even during peace, he thought only about military strategy. When he was with his friends, he often stopped and asked them questions like: If the enemy was on that hill and we were down here, who would be in a better spot? How could we attack without breaking our ranks? If we had to retreat, how would we do it? And if the enemy retreated, how would we chase them?  

As he walked, he talked about all the tricky situations an army can face. He listened to his friends’ ideas and shared his own.  

People, especially leaders, can be very different. Some are stubborn, some are brave, some are scared. Some are kind, others are rude. Some are honest, others lie. Some believe strongly in religion, others don’t believe at all. And so on.
