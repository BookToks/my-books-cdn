If a person can’t see problems before they happen, they can’t be a smart leader. But not many people have this skill. If you look at why the Roman Empire fell, you’ll see it started when they began hiring Goths as soldiers. From that moment, the empire got weaker, and its enemies got stronger.

So, to sum up: no country is safe without its own army. If it doesn’t have loyal and determined people to defend it during a crisis, it’s just lucky. Leaders who understand this know that their main job is to focus on war and making the army strong. This is the only real job for someone in charge. A strong reputation means nothing without your own army to back it up.

Having your own army means having soldiers who are your own people, like citizens or people who depend on you. All other forces, like mercenaries or helpers, aren’t as reliable. To learn how to build your own army, just look at how leaders like Philip or Alexander the Great did it. Their armies are good examples to follow.

Francesco Sforza was a soldier who had his own army and became the Duke of Milan. But his sons didn’t like the hard life of soldiers, and they lost their power and became commoners again. One big problem with not having an army is that people will see you as weak, and that’s something a leader must avoid. There’s a big difference between someone who has an army and someone who doesn’t. A man with an army won’t respect a man without one, and a man without an army won’t feel safe around someone who has one. This makes it hard for them to work together.

Besides all these problems, a leader who doesn’t care about the army won’t earn the respect of his soldiers or be able to trust them.
