They have to create a new system to run things and new rules to follow. Changing how a government works is really hard, more likely to fail, and tricky to understand. The person making these changes will make enemies of anyone who was doing well before. At the same time, the people who might benefit from the new system won’t fully support it because they’re scared of their opponents. These opponents still have the old laws to help them, and people usually don’t trust change until they see it actually work. So, when the opponents get a chance, they fight hard, while the supporters only resist a little. This weakens the new leader’s position.

To understand this better, we have to ask: does the leader rely on their own strength, or do they need help from others? In other words, can they make things happen by themselves, or do they have to ask for support? If they need help, they will probably fail. But if they have their own power and can force their plans, they are less likely to be in serious danger. That’s why leaders with armies usually win, while those without weapons often lose, no matter how smart their ideas are.

We also have to remember that people’s opinions change. It’s easy to get people to believe in something at first, but it’s hard to keep them convinced. When people stop believing in a leader, the leader has to be strong enough to make them believe again.

Leaders like Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus couldn’t have kept their new laws if they didn’t have armies. We saw what happened to Girolamo Savonarola in our own time—he lost his power and all his changes when people stopped trusting him.
