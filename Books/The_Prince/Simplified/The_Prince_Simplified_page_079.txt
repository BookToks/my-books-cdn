People who are under control will always want freedom and remember the old ways they used to live. It doesn’t matter how long they’ve been controlled or if the rulers are kind, they won’t forget their past. If the people haven’t been completely broken or scattered, they will fight for their freedom whenever they get the chance, just like the Pisans did after being ruled by Florence for a hundred years.

But if people have been used to living under a ruler and that ruler and their family are gone, they won’t know how to pick a new leader or live freely on their own. So, they will be slower to act or rebel. Republics, where people have more freedom, are harder to control because people remember their old rights and want revenge. In these cases, the only choices for a new ruler are to destroy the place or live there themselves.

When you want to copy someone great, like a leader, you can’t do it exactly. You have to follow their example as best as you can, even if you’re not as good. It’s like an archer who aims high because the target is far away, not because he wants the arrow that high, but so it falls on the target from that height.

So, when a new ruler takes over a state, how easy it is for them to stay in power depends on their skills and luck. You can’t go from being a regular person to a ruler without talent or good timing. Those who don’t just rely on luck usually last longer. Also, if the ruler doesn’t already own another state, they must live in the new place they control.

The first big problems for new rulers come from trying to set up their government and keep control. The most impressive rulers who did this through their own skills were people like Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, and Theseus.
