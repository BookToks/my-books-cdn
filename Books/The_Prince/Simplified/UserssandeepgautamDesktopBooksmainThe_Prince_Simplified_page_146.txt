Every action a leader takes affects what happens next, so he never gives powerful people in the country a break between wars to plan against him.

If you’re not friends with someone fighting, they’ll try to get you to stay neutral, while your ally will want you to join the fight. Leaders who can’t decide usually stay neutral, but that usually ends badly. If you choose a side bravely and your ally wins, they’ll owe you and become your friend, so even if they’re stronger, they won’t treat you badly.

A leader can also earn respect by showing strong character in how they handle things at home, like Bernabo` Visconti did in Milan. Whenever someone does something big, good or bad, people will react with rewards or punishments. But mostly, a leader must make sure people see him as someone with amazing skills.

A leader gets respect when he’s clearly a true friend or enemy, meaning he openly supports one side and opposes the other. This usually works better than staying neutral.

For example, if you have two powerful neighbors going to war, you might or might not be scared of the winner later. Either way, it’s better to pick a side and fight hard. If you’re scared but stay neutral, the winner will probably take you over, and the loser will be happy about it. You’ll have no excuse and nowhere to hide. Winners don’t want fake friends, and losers won’t care about you since you didn’t pick a side and share their fate.

When your ally wins, with your help, they’ll control you. So, a leader should never team up with someone stronger just to attack their enemies unless it’s absolutely necessary. Leaders should avoid putting themselves under someone else’s power.

For example, when Antiochus was sent to Greece to fight the Romans, he asked the Achaeans (who were friends with the Romans) to stay neutral, while the Romans asked them to join their side. After thinking about it, the Achaeans were told by the Romans that staying neutral would hurt them the most—they’d get no thanks or support.

In general, a leader should never think any decision is completely safe. They need to plan and do great things, keeping their people interested and hopeful, focusing on winning their battles.
