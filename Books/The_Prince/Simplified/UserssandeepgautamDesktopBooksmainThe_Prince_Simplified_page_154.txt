So, these rulers of ours, who were strong kings and dukes but still lost their states, shouldn’t complain about bad luck; they only have themselves to blame. I’ve explained some rules that, if followed carefully, could help keep peace. These rulers never thought things could change. When trouble came, their first move was to run away instead of fighting back. They hoped the people would get angry at the attackers and bring them back. This might work if you have no other choice, but relying on that is a big mistake. A ruler should never just accept losing power because they expect someone else to fix it later.

People pay more attention to what a new ruler does than what an old king did. If a new ruler does well, people will trust and support him more than a king who was born into power. People care more about what’s happening now than what happened before. When things are good, they’ll be happy and loyal as long as the ruler doesn’t mess up. So a ruler can be proud of starting a new kingdom and making it strong with good laws, a good army, strong allies, and smart policies.

On the other hand, a ruler born into power who loses it because of bad choices is shamed twice as much.

Looking at Italian rulers who lost power recently—like the King of Naples and the Duke of Milan—the main problem was that they all had weak armies. I talked about this earlier. Also, some didn’t have the people’s support, and even if they did, they couldn’t keep the nobles on their side. Without the support of both, you can’t keep a strong state or army. For example, Philip of Macedonia didn’t have the resources of the Romans and Greeks attacking him, but because he was a good military leader and knew how to keep the people and nobles happy, he held on to his kingdom for many years. Even though he lost a few towns in the end, at least he didn’t lose everything.
