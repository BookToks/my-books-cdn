The Swiss are really well-armed and completely free. A good example of mercenaries being used in ancient times is Carthage. After their first war with Rome, the Carthaginians were almost overthrown by their own mercenaries, even though these men were led by Carthaginian citizens. After Epaminondas died, the Thebans made Philip of Macedonia their army leader, but as soon as he won the war, he took away their freedom.

When Filippo Maria Visconti died, the Milanese hired Francesco Sforza to fight against the Venetians. After beating the Venetians at Caravaggio, Sforza joined forces with them to overthrow the Milanese rulers who paid him. Francesco’s father was the mercenary commander for Queen Joanna of Naples, but he suddenly ran away and left her kingdom unprotected, so she had to rely on the King of Aragon or risk losing her land.

Venice fought well and confidently at sea, where both nobles and armed common people showed great courage. But when they started fighting on land, they stopped relying on their own strengths and hired mercenaries like other Italian states. In the beginning, they had so little land and so much respect that they didn’t have to worry about mercenary commanders. But as they moved deeper into Italy, they faced problems with these hired soldiers. They knew Carmagnola was a great leader and had already defeated the Duke of Milan with him, so they noticed when Carmagnola lost interest in the war. They realized they couldn’t win anymore with him, but they were also afraid to fire him because they might lose what they had already gained. The only safe option was to kill him.

Later, they hired other mercenary commanders like Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Ruberto da San Severino, and Niccolò Orsini, Count of Pitigliano. These commanders were more likely to lose than win. For example, at the battle of Vailà, the Venetians lost everything they had worked so hard to get in just one day. Francesco Sforza had to deal with Braccio da Montone, and both commanders kept each other busy. Sforza focused on Lombardy while Braccio fought in Rome and Naples.

But remember what happened not long ago. Florence hired Paulo Vitelli as their military leader. He was a serious man who started with nothing and achieved a lot.

Over the centuries, as the empire lost power in Italy and the pope gained more control, the country broke into smaller states. This history shows how mercenaries caused slow wins but sudden, confusing losses. Since Italy has been controlled by mercenaries for many years, it's important to look at the bigger picture to find a solution.
