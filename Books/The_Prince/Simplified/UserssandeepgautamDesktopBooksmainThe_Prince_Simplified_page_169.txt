After helping Naples, Florence, and Charleston, Naples became the ruler of Perugia in 1495. At this time, other Italian powers were active, including Julius Caesar (around 100–44 BC). After winning battles in Gaul and Britain, Julius Caesar made himself dictator, starting the change from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire. He was later killed by senators, including his friend Marcus Junius Brutus.

The Colonna family was powerful in medieval and Renaissance Rome and fought the Bentivogli family in Bologna. The Bentivoglis were backed by Venice, while the Canneschis were supported by the Viscontis, dukes of Milan. In 1445, with help from Milan, Battista Canneschi, head of his family, killed Annibale Bentivogli. But the people of Bologna turned against the Canneschis, killed Battista, and the rest of the family ran away.

Roman emperor Commodus (161–193) was the son of Marcus Aurelius. He ignored his father's simple lifestyle and gave himself over to fun, surrounding himself with favorites. He was proud of his body and often fought as a gladiator. Eventually, a conspiracy led to his strangling by a wrestler named Narcissus.

Alberigo da Barbiano (around 1348–1409) was originally from Romagna but later became Count of Conio, a small town above the Italian Riviera. He was the first mercenary leader to insist that his army be made up only of Italians. Francesco Bussone, Count of Carmagnola (around 1432–82), was hired by the Duke of Milan and fought for Milan against Florence and Venice. After a victory, he was accused of treason, arrested, and killed.

Cyrus (around 576–529 BC) founded the Persian Empire, which covered much of central and southwest Asia. Darius, the last king of Persia (336–331 BC), was murdered by one of his governors.

Charles VII (1403–61), King of France from 1422 to 1461, was inspired by Joan of Arc. He united France under one ruler and drove the English out of most of their French lands except Calais. He built a strong standing army.

David (around 1012–972 BC) was the second king of Israel. Charles VIII (1470–98), King of France from 1483 to 1498, took control in 1492 after his sister Anne’s regency. Encouraged by the pope and Duke Ludovico Sforza of Milan, Charles claimed the throne of Naples. He gathered an army of 25,000 men and marched into Italy in 1494.

Theban statesman and military commander Epaminondas (around 418–362 BC) ended Spartan dominance in Greece, making Thebes the leading power. He was excommunicated and attacked by Venice.
