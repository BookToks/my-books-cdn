This was a really tough problem that caused many emperors to fail. Pertinax tried to make the emperors follow strict honesty rules. This made a lot of people hate him. It was hard to keep both the people and the army happy at the same time. Pertinax was also old and disliked, so he was soon removed from power.

People liked quiet leaders who kept things calm. Soldiers, on the other hand, liked leaders who were bold, greedy, and sometimes cruel. They wanted the emperor to act tough so they could get more money and satisfy their own selfish desires.

Because of this, emperors who didn’t have natural authority or political skill often couldn’t control both the soldiers and the people. This usually ended badly. Since it was so hard to keep everyone happy, many new leaders chose to please the army and ignore the people’s needs.

Emperors who tried to avoid any hate first had to avoid the anger of the most powerful groups. If that was impossible, they had to do everything to stay in the good graces of those groups.

Looking at leaders like Commodus, Severus, Antoninus Caracalla, and Maximinus, we see they were very cruel and selfish. They did whatever crimes they wanted to keep the army happy. Except for Severus, they all had bad endings. Severus was strong and even though he was harsh on the people, he kept the army on his side and ruled successfully.

Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander were all kind and fair men who lived simple lives and hated cruelty. They impressed the people and the army in different ways, but only Marcus avoided a bad end and kept respect until he died.

Severus became emperor because of his family, not because the army or people chose him. He had many good qualities and kept both the people and the army under control without being hated. Because of this, he managed to avoid the problems that brought down other rulers.

When Julian was weak, Severus convinced the army in Slavonia to march on Rome and take revenge for Pertinax, who had been killed. The soldiers had grown used to a spoiled lifestyle under Commodus.

Roman emperors had to deal with a big problem: the greed and cruelty of the army. This was a serious challenge that made ruling very difficult.
