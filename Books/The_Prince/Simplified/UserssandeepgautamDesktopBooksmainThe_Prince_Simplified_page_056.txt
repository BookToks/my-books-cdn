Experience shows that women are more attracted to men who are bold and confident than to those who act distant or cold. Women usually prefer younger men because they are less careful and more passionate, and because they take charge with more confidence.

I hope I’m starting to understand this idea better. For better or worse, this is the kind of man Machiavelli was, and here’s what he thought: In the end, luck changes, but people keep going no matter what.

When a person’s way of acting fits the situation, they succeed. When it doesn’t, they fail. My opinion is that it’s better to be impulsive than cautious. Luck is like a woman, and if you want to stay in control of her, you have to be bold and take action. You’ll find she responds better to people who are active and daring than to those who are cold and distant. Also, since she’s a woman, she prefers young men because they are wilder and braver when they take charge.
