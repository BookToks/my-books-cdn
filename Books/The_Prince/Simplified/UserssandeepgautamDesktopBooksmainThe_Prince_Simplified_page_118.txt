I’m sure we’d all agree it would be great if a ruler had all the good qualities and none of the bad ones. But since it’s impossible to have or always use all the good qualities, a ruler must be careful to avoid the mistakes that could make him lose his position.

For mistakes that don’t risk losing power, he should avoid them if he can, but if he can’t, it’s not a big deal. At the same time, he shouldn’t worry too much about getting a bad reputation from some negative traits that are almost necessary to keep power.

If you think about it, something might seem morally right but actually cause a ruler to fail. And something else might seem wrong but bring safety and success.

Many writers have imagined perfect republics and kingdoms that never really existed. There’s a big difference between how people actually live and how they should live. If someone tries to always be good in a world where most people aren’t, they’re setting themselves up for disaster and should forget about staying safe. So if a ruler wants to survive, he has to stop being good sometimes, at least when it’s needed.

Putting aside what people have dreamed up about rulers and focusing on reality, when we talk about anyone—especially leaders who are always in the spotlight—we notice the qualities that make people praise or blame them.

One person might be called generous, another stingy; one kind, another cruel; one loyal, another untrustworthy; one brave, another scared; one humble, another arrogant; one honest, another sneaky; one serious, another shallow; one religious, another not.
