Spending your own money is the only thing that really puts you at risk.

Generosity can use itself up quickly because when you keep giving, you lose the resources you need to keep giving. Either you end up poor and looked down on, or to avoid being poor, you become greedy and mean. It’s better for a leader to be feared or loved, but never hated or despised.

Being generous can cause both good and bad feelings. It’s smarter to be known as stingy, which people don’t like but don’t hate, than to try to be generous and end up being seen as greedy, which makes people hate you. Every leader wants to be seen as kind rather than cruel.

But a leader must be careful about how they show kindness. Cesare Borgia was seen as cruel, but his harshness helped bring peace and order to Romagna. In a way, he was kinder than the Florentines, who didn’t want to seem cruel and ended up causing chaos in Pistoia. A leader shouldn’t worry about being called cruel if it helps keep people loyal and united. Sometimes being strict is actually kinder than being too soft, which can lead to crime and disorder. Problems like that hurt everyone, while punishments only affect the people involved.

New leaders especially can’t avoid being seen as cruel because taking over a new place is really dangerous. Virgil wrote that new rulers have to do tough things and protect their borders carefully.

Still, a leader should think carefully before deciding to be harsh or kind.
