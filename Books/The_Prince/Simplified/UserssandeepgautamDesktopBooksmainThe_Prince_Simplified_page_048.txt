I owe a lot to them because, even though I always translate straight from the original, I also check these and modern Italian translations to see where they disagree and think about what I can learn from them. The original text is sometimes tricky, and all four translations I look at—two in English and two in Italian—can have different meanings. In these cases, you really have to try to understand how Machiavelli thinks, how he focuses on logic, reason, and careful thinking, and remember that every sentence, even every word, is there for a reason.
