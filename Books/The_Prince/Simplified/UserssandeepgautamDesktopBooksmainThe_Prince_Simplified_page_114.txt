If a person can’t see a problem coming, they can’t be a smart leader. But not many people have this skill. If you look at why the Roman Empire fell, you’ll see it started when the rulers began hiring Goths as soldiers. From that time, the empire got weaker, and its enemies got stronger.

So, to sum up: no country is safe without its own army. If it doesn’t have people ready to defend it with loyalty and determination during a crisis, it is just hoping for good luck. Leaders who know this believe that their only job is to focus on war and military discipline. This is the main role of the person in charge. Having your own army, made up of your own people, is very important. Other soldiers, like mercenaries or helpers, can’t be trusted as much.

To figure out how to build your army, just look at how famous leaders like Philip or Alexander the Great did it. They are great examples. Leaders who care more about fancy stuff than fighting usually lose power. The best way to gain power is to be really good at war.

Francesco Sforza was a soldier who had his own army and went from being a common person to the Duke of Milan. But his sons didn’t like the hard parts of war, and they lost their power. One bad thing about not having an army is that people will see you as weak, and a leader must avoid this. The truth is, a person with an army is very different from one without. It makes no sense for someone with an army to obey someone who doesn’t have one, or for a leader without soldiers to feel safe around those who do. They won’t trust each other or work well together. So, beyond other problems, leaders who ignore military matters are in big trouble.
