People trying to get on the good side of a ruler usually give him something they really care about or something they know he likes a lot. So, rulers often get gifts like horses, weapons, gold fabric, jewels, and other fancy things.

I wanted to give Your Highness a sign of my loyalty, and I realized that nothing is more valuable to me than my knowledge about great people and what they did. I've learned this through years of watching current events and studying old history. After thinking carefully about everything I've learned, I wrote it all down in a short book that I am now sending to Your Highness.

Even though this gift might not seem fancy enough for you, I believe the experience it shares will be appreciated. Especially since I can’t offer anything better than a chance to understand in a few hours what I have learned through many years of danger and hard times. I didn’t make the book look pretty with long sentences or fancy, showy words like many writers do; I only wanted it to focus on the serious and important topic.

Also, I hope you don’t think it’s rude for someone like me, who has a very low social status, to talk about how princes should rule their people.  

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
