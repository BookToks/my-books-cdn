When a king takes over new land, soon his old land and the new land will become one big kingdom.

But when a king tries to get back land that rebelled, he’s less likely to lose it again. He learns from the rebellion and becomes stricter with troublemakers, checks suspects, and fixes weak spots in his defenses. Holding onto new land with different languages and customs is really hard and needs luck and hard work.

Maybe the best way to keep control is for the king to live there himself. This makes the place safer and more stable. The Turkish sultan did this in Greece, and his other efforts only worked because he stayed there. When the ruler is present, problems can be stopped early. If the ruler is far away, they only hear about issues when it’s too late. Also, if the king lives there, his officials won’t steal from the new land, and people can ask the king for help directly. This makes people more loyal or more scared to rebel. Anyone planning an attack will think twice. So, living in the new land makes it much less likely to be lost.

If the new land shares the same language and customs, it’s easier to control. People there might accept the king as long as his family replaces the old rulers. Everything else can stay the same, so people won’t be too upset. This has worked in places like Burgundy, Brittany, Gascony, and Normandy, which have been under French rule for many years. Even when the language is different, similar customs help people get along.

A ruler taking over such lands should do two things: first, get rid of the old rulers’ families; second, keep the laws and taxes as they were so people don’t resist.

Another good idea is to set up colonies in one or two places in the new land. These colonies act like chains that hold the land to the king’s control. Colonies don’t cost much and only make a few people angry—those who lose their homes or land to make room for colonists. Since that’s a small part of the population, and those people might move away, they can’t cause much trouble. Most people won’t be affected or scared to rebel because they don’t want to lose their own homes. 

In short, colonies are cheap, more loyal, and cause less anger and problems.
