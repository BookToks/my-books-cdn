In 1471, Francesco della Rovere became Pope Sixtus IV. Sixtus was known for favoring his family and, in 1478, joined a plan called the Pazzi conspiracy to overthrow the Medici family in Florence.

After the plan failed and the killers were executed, Sixtus excommunicated Lorenzo de’ Medici, put Florence under church punishment, and, with Naples, declared war on the city. Sixtus’s nephew, Giuliano della Rovere, later became Pope Julius II in 1503.

Francesco Sforza was a famous mercenary leader in the 1400s. He fought for the Duke of Milan and married the duke’s daughter, Bianca Maria, in 1441. After the duke died in 1447, the people of Milan declared a republic, but Sforza eventually became duke in 1450.

Piero Soderini was elected leader of Florence in 1502 and was a friend of Machiavelli. He helped Machiavelli get started but was seen as weak and lost respect over time. Like his predecessor Savonarola, Soderini kept an alliance with France, but he was not a strong leader.

Giacomo (Muzio) Attendolo, father of Francesco Sforza, joined a mercenary army in the 1380s and was nicknamed Sforza for being strong and determined. He often fought against another mercenary leader, Braccio da Montone, and died while serving Joanna of Naples.

Ludovico Sforza, the second son of Francesco Sforza, became Duke of Milan after his older brother was assassinated in 1476. When the duke’s son was a child, Ludovico took control. He supported the French king Charles VIII’s claim to Naples and encouraged his invasion of Italy in 1494.

However, as the French became too powerful, Ludovico joined the League of Venice, a group that pushed the French out of Italy. He briefly regained Milan in 1500 but was defeated and imprisoned by the French until he died in 1508. Ludovico is best remembered for supporting Leonardo da Vinci.

Antonio da Venafro helped Pandolfo Petrucci become ruler of Siena and became Petrucci’s top adviser. He did important diplomatic work and was involved in political plots. After Petrucci’s family lost power, Antonio returned to his hometown and later worked for the government of Naples, where he died.
