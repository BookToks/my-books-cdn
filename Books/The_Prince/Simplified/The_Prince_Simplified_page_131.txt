To protect yourself from other countries, you need a strong army and good friends. If your army is strong, you’ll have good friends too. When you’re safe from outside threats, you’ll usually be safe inside your country as well, unless someone is already planning against you. Then, even if an enemy attacks, if you’ve prepared like I said, you just have to stay calm and you’ll get through it, like the Spartan leader Nabis I talked about before.

Now, let’s talk about what happens inside your country. When there’s no danger from outside, a leader must make sure people don’t start plotting against him. He can do this by making sure he’s not hated or looked down on, and that people are happy with him. This is really important, as I explained earlier. One of the best ways to stop plots is simply to not be hated by most people. People who want to start a plot have to believe that killing the leader will be popular. If they think it won’t be, they lose hope because plots are always hard to pull off.

You’ll lose respect if you seem weak, fake, scared, or unsure. So a leader must avoid these things and act in a way that shows strength and seriousness. When solving problems between people, the leader should make sure everyone knows his decision is final and no one can trick him. If people think it’s better to betray a plot than join it, because betrayal brings rewards and joining is very risky, then plotting won’t happen easily.

A leader who shows he is strong and respected will be admired and it will be hard for people to plot against him. If he’s known for being excellent and respected by his people, enemies will find it tough to attack him too.  

To sum up: people who want to plot are driven by fear, jealousy, and the chance of punishment. But the leader has the power of the government, the laws, and the support of friends and the country behind him.
