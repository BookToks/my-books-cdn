These towns are super well protected, so everyone knows attacking them would be really hard and tiring. They have big moats and strong walls, the right weapons, and public stores with food, drinks, and firewood for a whole year. Plus, to keep people fed without spending too much money, they also keep supplies for a year’s work in the trades that help the city and the jobs most people do. They take military training seriously and make sure everyone practices it often.

When thinking about different states, one big question is: if a ruler is attacked, can they defend themselves with their own resources, or do they always need others to help? To be more exact, a ruler who has enough men or money to build an army that can fight anyone is able to defend themselves. But a ruler who can’t fight outside the city and has to hide behind walls will probably always need help.

What about people who live outside the walls and see their homes getting burned? Won’t they get scared or angry and stop caring about their ruler? A strong leader with power and personality can handle this. They can make people hopeful that the siege won’t last long, scare them with stories about the enemy’s cruelty, and act quickly against anyone who gets too upset. It’s clear that the enemy will burn the countryside before reaching the city, but the people will still want to fight hard.

If a ruler has built strong defenses and keeps a good relationship with their people, enemies will think twice before attacking. People don’t like problems that seem too hard, and attacking a strong town with people who don’t hate their ruler is never easy. When the countryside is damaged, people will support their ruler even more because they feel thankful for his protection. It’s human nature to stay loyal to a leader who has helped you as much as the leader has done good things.

German cities are completely independent and don’t have much land around them. They only obey the emperor when it suits them. They aren’t afraid of him or any other powerful leader.
