The prince is the most important man.

So, the translator might want to use the word ‘king’. In the past, a king was at the top of a system and was the man who mattered most. But it’s hard to call the lord of Imola, a pope, or a Roman emperor a ‘king’ when translating Machiavelli. In the end, I decided to use the less exciting words ‘ruler’ or ‘leader’, but I always make sure it’s clear we mean the political leader of a country. However, the book’s famous title stays the same.

It’s even harder to translate the word ‘virtù’, and some other words related to it. It would be easy to use the English word ‘virtue’, which means being good, but that’s not what Machiavelli meant. He wasn’t talking about good or evil, but about winning and losing, being strong or weak, success or failure. For Machiavelli, ‘virtù’ means any quality that helps you get or keep political power. It could be bravery in battle, a strong personality, being smart in politics, or even the kind of harsh cruelty that shows you’re serious.

But you can’t just write ‘cunning’ or ‘cruelty’ for ‘virtù’, even if that’s what it means here. That’s because Machiavelli isn’t talking about moral virtues, but he still wants these qualities to sound positive. This cruelty is meant to solve problems, keep power, and make the state strong. So in this case, it is a ‘virtù’.
