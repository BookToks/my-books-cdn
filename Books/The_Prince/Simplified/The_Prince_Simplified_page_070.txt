People think Louis could have kept his position if he hadn’t tried to avoid wars when he saw trouble coming. They knew in Italy that if he had followed certain rules, he couldn’t have stopped problems forever, but in the long run, the chances would have been good for safety and protection for all his friends. Instead, the situation shifted in favor of his enemies.

Many of his friends were weak and scared, like Philip and Antiochus in Greece, so he didn’t want to fight Venice or Rome and ended up having to choose sides in Italy. He could have delayed both wars, but he didn’t.

Louis never followed the advice we often hear today—relax, time is on your side. Instead, he trusted his own judgment and spirit. Time keeps moving and can make things better or worse.

Now, let’s get back to the King of France and see if he did any of the things we’ve been talking about. When I say King, I mean Louis, not Charles, because Louis controlled land in Italy longer and it’s easier to see what he did.

You’ll notice Louis did the opposite of what a ruler should do to keep control in a place where the customs and language are different from his own kingdom. It was the ambitions of Venice that brought Louis into Italy. The Venetians planned to take half of Lombardy while Louis took the other half. I’m not going to blame Louis for agreeing to this. He wanted a foothold in Italy and didn’t have any friends there—actually, thanks to King Charles’s actions before him, all doors were closed to him, so he had to accept whoever would ally with him.

The plan might have worked if Louis hadn’t made other mistakes. By taking Lombardy, he won back the good reputation Charles had lost. Genoa surrendered, and many important leaders and republics offered alliances.

But Louis’s desire to conquer more land is natural. If you have the power, people usually admire you for wanting more. But if you don’t have the power and try anyway, then you deserve the blame.

If Louis could have taken the Kingdom of Naples with his own forces, he should have done it. If he couldn’t, then he shouldn’t have split the territory with others. The Venetians realized they had been too rash when they first made their deal: for two towns in Lombardy, Louis became king over a third of Italy. This gave anyone in the region who had ambitions or was unhappy someone else to turn to besides Louis.

Louis could have kept Naples under a friendly king, but instead, he kicked that king out and brought in a stronger one to remove him. This made things worse for Louis.

Whenever someone tries to take more land, the people in control always find a way to fight back.
