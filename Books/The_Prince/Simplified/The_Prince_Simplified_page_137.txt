Using this excuse and showing no easy life at all, the army loved him. But his cruelty and fierceness were so overwhelming and terrible that after many murders, he wiped out much of the population of Rome and all the people of Alexandria. At this point, everyone really hated him, and even those close to him got nervous. In the end, he was killed by a centurion while with his soldiers.

It’s worth noting that assassinations like this happen sometimes when a determined man makes a serious decision. Once a person no longer cares about dying, they are free to act. That said, a ruler shouldn’t worry too much because such murders are very rare. They just have to be careful not to treat the people who serve them badly or keep dangerous people close. For example, Antoninus killed a centurion’s brother in a shameful way and threatened the man every day but still kept him nearby. This kind of risky behavior can cause disaster, as it did here.

Severus faced two problems if he wanted full control of the empire: one in Asia, where the army leader Pescennius Niger declared himself emperor, and another in the west, where Albinus also wanted to be emperor. Severus decided it would be dangerous to fight both at once, so he tricked Albinus. He wrote to Albinus in France, saying that since the Senate had made him emperor, he wanted to share power with him. He gave Albinus the title of Caesar and had the Senate make him co-emperor. Albinus believed him, but after Severus defeated and killed Niger and took control of the eastern empire, he went back to Rome and complained that Albinus was planning to kill him. So Severus went to France, took power from Albinus, and had him killed.

Now let’s talk about Commodus, who could have kept the empire. He was the son of Marcus Aurelius and became emperor by right of birth. All he had to do was follow his father’s example, and the army and people would have accepted him. But Commodus was cruel and greedy, and he liked to please the soldiers by giving them gifts and favors. He had no respect for himself and often went down to the amphitheater floor to fight as a gladiator. He did many shameful things that made the soldiers look down on him. Eventually, hated by both the people and the army, he was killed in a conspiracy.

Severus’s son, Antoninus, was a man with some good qualities. The people liked him, and the army welcomed him. He was a strong leader who could handle tough times and didn’t care about fancy foods or comforts. But the soldiers were unhappy with the weak Alexander, and after getting rid of him, they chose Maximinus instead.

Maximinus was a real warmonger. As I said before, the armies were frustrated with the weak Alexander, so when they removed him, they picked Maximinus to replace him.
