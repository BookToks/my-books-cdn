The senators and richest men in town were very important. After a terrible massacre, Oliverotto felt that working with others was beneath him. He decided to take power for himself.

Agathocles became King of Syracuse and kept his throne without any fights from the people. He was defeated twice by the citizens, who wanted to protect their city from the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians even surrounded the city, but Agathocles didn’t free the people; instead, he enslaved them. With help from Vitellozzo, he managed to defend the town. He left some men behind to resist the siege and led the rest out of Syracuse to attack Africa.

The siege was lifted, and the Carthaginians were almost defeated. They made a deal to keep Africa while giving Sicily to Agathocles.

Giovanni Fogliani wrote a letter saying that after many years, he was eager to come home, visit the town, and check his property. Since he had been working hard only for his status, he wanted to return in style with a hundred friends and servants, so everyone would see he hadn’t wasted his time. He asked his uncle to organize a special welcome to honor both him and his uncle, who had raised him.

The people of Fermo gave Oliverotto a formal welcome. A few days later, he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the town’s top leaders to a big party. After the food and entertainment, Oliverotto suddenly stood up and said some important things about the power and achievements of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare Borgia. Then, he said the best way to talk about these things was somewhere more private, and led Giovanni and the others to another room. Right after they sat down, Oliverotto’s soldiers jumped out of hiding and killed them all.

After the massacre, Oliverotto rode around the town and surrounded the chief magistrate. At a signal, his soldiers attacked and killed everyone there.

Oliverotto was raised by his uncle Giovanni after his father died when he was young. His uncle got him to join the army under Paulo Vitelli to help him rise in rank. After Paulo died, Oliverotto served under Paulo’s brother Vitellozzo. Oliverotto was strong, smart, and soon became the army’s leader.

Looking at Agathocles’ life, you don’t see luck helping him. He had no powerful friends when he took control but rose by surviving dangers and working hard. He made tough decisions to keep power. But killing his own people, betraying friends, and being cruel don’t show real talent. These may give power but not respect.

Oliverotto’s story shows the same. He used crime and violence to get power. Even though Agathocles was brave and smart, his brutality means he isn’t someone we should admire.
