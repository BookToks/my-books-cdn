If you don’t do everything needed right from the start, like setting up a government with Oliverotto as the leader, you’ll always have to keep using force. If you were badly advised or didn’t have the courage, you’ll never be able to trust your people because they won’t trust you after all the violence you’ve used. So, it’s better to get the violence over with quickly; that way, people will feel it less and be less hostile. 

On the other hand, favors should be given out slowly, one at a time, so people can really appreciate them. Most importantly, a ruler should have a relationship with their people where nothing that happens, good or bad, will make them change how they act. If tough times come, being cruel too late won’t help, and any soft actions you take will seem forced and won’t impress anyone.

You might wonder how people like Agathocles, after all their betrayals and cruelty, could stay in power for years and even fight off enemies, while others who were just as cruel couldn’t keep control even in peace. I think it’s about whether cruelty is used well or badly. When cruelty is used well, it’s quick and only as much as needed to secure power, then it stops. The ruler uses their power to give the best to their people. 

But cruelty is used badly when a leader isn’t harsh enough at first but becomes more cruel over time instead of easing off. Leaders who use cruelty well, like Agathocles, have a chance to improve their position with their people and with God. Those who don’t have no chance at all.

It’s important that when you take control of a state, you figure out how much violence is needed and do it all at once, so you don’t have to keep being cruel all the time. Once the violence stops, your people will feel safer and you can win their support. If a ruler is surrounded by men who see themselves as equals, it will be hard for him to give orders or manage things the way he wants.
