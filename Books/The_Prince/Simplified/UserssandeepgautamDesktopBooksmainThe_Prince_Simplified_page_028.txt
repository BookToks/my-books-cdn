Machiavelli should have known that if he wanted to use his book to help his career as a diplomat, being honest in it would actually hurt him. Being honest and trying to get ahead didn’t really work together.

He was surprised and upset when The Prince didn’t help his career. After that, he went back to chasing women. Besides just having casual relationships, he also fell in and out of love quickly, following his feelings without thinking much. Just like he was better at romance than diplomacy, he was more successful writing funny, sexy plays than serious political stuff. In 1518, his play The Mandragola, about a young guy using crazy tricks to sleep with a married woman, made him famous right away. A few years later, another play called Clizia, about an older man trying to get a young woman, showed he was really talented.

But Machiavelli didn’t just want to be a writer. He cared more about being involved in politics. He spent about ten years working on books like Discourses on Livy, a history of Florence, and The Art of War. Still, he really wanted his old job as the city’s main ambassador back. Finally, in 1525, Pope Clement VII, whose real name was Giulio de’ Medici and was Giovanni’s cousin, brought Machiavelli back into politics. The Pope asked him for advice on how to handle the growing tensions between the French and the Spanish.
