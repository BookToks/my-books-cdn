So, these rulers we had, who were kings and dukes with strong power, still lost their states. They shouldn’t make excuses about bad luck; they only have themselves to blame.

Usually, rulers don’t expect things to change during peaceful times. When trouble comes, their first reaction is to run away instead of fighting. They hope the people will get angry at the attackers and help them get their land back. This might work if there’s no other choice, but relying on this is a big mistake. A ruler should never accept losing power just because they think someone else will help them later.

People pay more attention to what a new leader does than to an old king’s past. If a new ruler does great things, people will trust and support him more than someone who just inherited power. When things are good, people are happy and won’t look for other leaders. They will even defend a ruler if he doesn’t disappoint them. So, a ruler can feel proud of creating a new kingdom and making it strong with good laws, a strong army, allies, and smart policies.

On the other hand, a person born into power who acts foolishly and loses it is ashamed twice.

Now, looking at some Italian rulers who lost power recently—the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and others—we see they all had weak armies. This happened for reasons I explained earlier. Also, some didn’t have the people’s support, or if they did, they couldn’t keep the nobles on their side. Without these problems, you don’t lose a state that has a strong army.

If you look at Italy, which has seen many big changes and started many revolutions, you’ll notice it’s a land without good natural defenses like rivers or mountains.
