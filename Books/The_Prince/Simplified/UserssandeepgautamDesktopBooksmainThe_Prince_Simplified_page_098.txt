A man who knows how to lead and doesn’t panic when things get tough is someone you have to watch out for and protect like they’re already your enemy. Because when problems start, these men will try to bring you down. But if he stays calm and makes smart choices, time will show that he built strong foundations.

A man who becomes king with the support of the people must keep those people on his side. This is easy enough because all they want is to be free from being controlled. But if a man becomes king without the people’s support and relies on rich nobles, he’s in big trouble. He depends on the nobles to keep his power, and they can easily take it away, especially when times are hard, by attacking him or ignoring his orders.

When the ruler isn’t in full control and people are used to taking orders from other leaders, they won’t start obeying him suddenly during a crisis. So, he will always be looking for someone he can trust. A ruler in this position must have the people on his side; otherwise, he will have no way out when things get tough.

Nabis, the Spartan king, was attacked by many enemies but still defended his country because he had the people with him. He only had to deal with a few internal enemies because the people supported him. If the people had been against him, he wouldn’t have lasted. The ruler must make sure that his citizens always need both him and his government, no matter how things are going. Then they will stay loyal.

Some say the saying “the man who builds his house on the people is building on mud” is true, but that only applies if it’s a private citizen hoping the people will save him when he’s in trouble. Men like this usually get betrayed, like the Gracchi brothers in Rome and Giorgio Scali in Florence.

But when it’s a king building his power on the people, and when the monarchy has public support, it’s different.
