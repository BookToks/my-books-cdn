These are the people you need to watch out for and protect yourself against, like they are already your enemies. Because when things start going wrong, these people will try to bring you down. A strong leader who stays calm when things get tough, takes the right steps, and leads in a way that keeps everyone positive will never fail. Time will prove that he built a solid foundation.

A man who becomes king with the support of the people must keep those people on his side. This is easier when everyone just wants to be free from unfair treatment. But if someone becomes king without the people’s support and relies on rich nobles to stay in power, he is at greater risk. He depends on these nobles who might turn against him when things get hard, either by attacking him or ignoring his orders. When trouble starts, the ruler won’t have time to take full control because the citizens are used to listening to other leaders, so he will struggle to find anyone he can trust.

A ruler in this situation must have the people on his side; otherwise, when things get tough, there’s no way out. When the citizens need their government, everyone supports the leader and promises loyalty. But when the government needs the people, hardly anyone shows up to help. This is dangerous because you only get one chance to handle a crisis.

For example, Nabis, the Spartan king, was surrounded by enemies but still defended his land because he had the people with him. All he had to do was protect himself from some inside enemies. If he had the people against him, he wouldn’t have survived. A smart ruler must make sure his citizens always need both him and the government, no matter what happens. Then, they will stay loyal.

Some people say that building your power on the people is like building a house on mud, but that’s only true if it’s a private citizen hoping the people will save him when he’s in trouble. Those kinds of people usually get let down, like the Gracchi brothers in Rome or Giorgio Scali in Florence.

But when a king builds his power on the people and understands how strong his state is, he stands a much better chance.
