A ruler and his promises

Going back to the question of whether a ruler should be feared or loved, my conclusion is this: people decide for themselves if they want to love their leader, but the ruler decides if people will fear him. So, a smart ruler will base his power on what he can control, not on what people can choose freely. But he must be careful, as I said, that people don’t start to hate him.

Everyone will respect a ruler who keeps his promises and is honest instead of lying. However, nowadays we have seen leaders who did great things without worrying too much about keeping their promises. By being clever and tricky, these leaders achieved more than honest ones.

A leader should remember that there are two ways to fight: using the law and using force. Usually, humans rely on laws and animals rely on force. But since laws don’t always work, it makes sense to use force sometimes.

So, a ruler must be able to use both the human and the animal sides of himself fully. Long ago, writers used stories to teach this lesson: they said leaders like Achilles were raised by a centaur named Chiron, who was half-man and half-beast. This meant a leader needs to use both sides of his nature. If he only had one, he wouldn’t survive.

Because a ruler must act like a beast sometimes, he should have the traits of both a fox and a lion. The lion can’t protect itself from traps, and the fox can’t protect itself from wolves. So, you have to be like a fox to spot traps and like a lion to scare away wolves. A leader who only acts like a lion and forgets the fox doesn’t know what he’s doing.

Therefore, a smart leader can’t always keep his promises if doing so puts him in danger. Also, if the reasons that made him promise something are no longer true, he should be able to change his mind.
