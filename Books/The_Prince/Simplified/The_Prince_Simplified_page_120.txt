In our experience, the only leaders who did great things were known for being mean. The others failed. Pope Julius II used his reputation for being generous to become pope, but then he happily spent money on wars. The current King of France has fought many wars without raising new taxes because he constantly cuts costs to pay for them. The current King of Spain wouldn’t have won his wars if he was known for being generous.

If we think about generosity, it might seem good to be seen as generous because it shows you have the resources to protect your country. But a ruler doesn’t have to steal from people or be fake generous, because that will only hurt them. Real generosity can go unnoticed, and you might end up with a reputation for being mean instead.

If you want people to think you’re generous, you have to spend a lot. But if you keep doing that, you’ll run out of money. Then you’ll have to raise special taxes and find ways to get more cash. People will start to hate you, and no one will respect you when you’re broke. Since your generosity only helps a few and hurts most, you’ll be weak when problems come, and people will call you mean if you try to stop.

Some might say famous generals were generous, but a ruler who already has power should be careful with money. Julius Caesar wanted power, not just to be generous. If he had kept spending like that as emperor, he would have ruined the empire. A ruler can’t be generous and safe at the same time, so it’s smart to accept being called mean sometimes.

If a ruler’s careful with money and doesn’t raise taxes too much, over time people will start to see him as generous—because he can protect the country without hurting his people. This generosity is for almost everyone, except a few who don’t benefit.

A ruler who fights wars by taking loot and using other people’s money should be as generous as possible with it, or his soldiers won’t follow him. Giving away other people’s money doesn’t make you look bad; it actually makes you look generous.

Leaders like Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander gave away other people’s money freely, which helped them keep power and respect.
