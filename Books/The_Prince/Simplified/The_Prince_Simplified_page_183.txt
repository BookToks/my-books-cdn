Filippo Visconti (1392–1447) was the Duke of Milan from 1412 to 1447. He was cruel and suspicious, but he rebuilt Milan’s power by hiring mercenary leaders like Carmagnola and Francesco Sforza. To keep Sforza loyal, Filippo promised him his only child, Bianca Maria, in marriage but made him wait many years before the wedding.

Niccolò Vitelli (1414–1486) was a military leader who fought constantly with the pope’s forces for control of Città di Castello, a town near Perugia in Umbria. In 1475, Pope Sixtus IV forced him out of the town. After the pope got involved in a failed plan called the Pazzi conspiracy, the Medici family helped Niccolò. When he got the town back, he destroyed the forts the pope had built while he was gone.

Paulo Vitelli (1461–1499) was Niccolò’s son and a mercenary leader. He led the Florentine army when it attacked Pisa in 1498. Even after breaking through the walls, Paulo was strangely cautious and didn’t take full advantage of the situation. Because of this, people thought he was a traitor, and he was arrested and executed.

The Vitelli family was a noble family of mercenary commanders who controlled Città di Castello near Perugia for most of the 1400s.

Vitellozzo Vitelli (around 1458–1502) was Niccolò’s son and Paulo’s brother. He was working for Florence with Paulo when Paulo was arrested and executed for treason. Vitellozzo escaped and later worked for Cesare Borgia. He joined a group that planned against Borgia but was killed with the other conspirators in Senigallia in 1502.

Xenophon (431–354 BC) was an Athenian and a friend of Socrates. He didn’t like democracy and spent much of his life in Sparta. He joined 10,000 mercenaries who fought for Cyrus in Asia Minor in 401 BC. After Cyrus died, Xenophon helped lead the mercenaries on a long retreat of 1,000 miles back home, but fewer than 6,000 survived. He wrote about this journey in his book called Anabasis.
