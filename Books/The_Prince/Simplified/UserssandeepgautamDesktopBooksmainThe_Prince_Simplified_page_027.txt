Who was this ruler? Just before Machiavelli got out of prison, Pope Julius died and was replaced by Giovanni de’ Medici, the son of il Magnifico. Giovanni had become a cardinal when he was only thirteen. This happened in March 1513. A few months later, Machiavelli started writing The Prince and planned to dedicate it to Giovanni’s brother, Giuliano, who was put in charge of Florence after the Medicis came back. But Giuliano, who was not very interested in politics, was replaced by his younger, more aggressive nephew Lorenzo. So, Machiavelli decided to dedicate the book to Lorenzo instead.

Up to this point, Machiavelli showed he could adapt to changing situations. But there was something kind and almost funny about his mistake. The smart thinking needed to understand politics and history, the deep ideas that would show other smart people he was as wise as famous historians like Livy, Tacitus, and Thucydides, were probably too much for a young, not very well-educated Medici prince to really get or enjoy.

When Lorenzo got the book in 1515, he probably never even opened it or took time to read Machiavelli’s carefully thought-out ideas. Even if he had read it, would Lorenzo—or any other ruler—want to hire a diplomat who openly said that trickery was common in politics and that it didn’t matter if you really believed in religion, just that you looked like you did?
