I’m sure we all agree it would be great if a leader had only good qualities and no bad ones. But since it’s impossible to have or show all good qualities all the time, a leader must be careful to avoid the kind of mistakes that could make them lose their position. For smaller mistakes that don’t risk their power, they should try to avoid them if possible, but if they can’t, it’s not a big deal.

At the same time, a leader shouldn’t worry too much about having a bad reputation if those negative traits help them stay in power. If you think about it, there will always be things that seem morally right but actually hurt a leader, and things that seem wrong but help them succeed.

Many writers have imagined perfect republics and kingdoms that don’t match real life. There’s a big difference between how people actually live and how they should live. If someone refuses to act like most people do in order to always do what’s right, they are setting themselves up for failure and should forget about being safe. If you always try to be the “good guy” in a world where most people aren’t good, you’ll end up in trouble. So, if a leader wants to survive, they have to learn to stop being good when it’s necessary.

Putting aside ideas about how leaders should be and focusing on reality, when we talk about anyone—especially leaders who are in the spotlight—we point out their qualities that get praise or blame. One person might be called generous, another stingy; one kind, another cruel; one loyal, another untrustworthy. But very few people are completely good or bad.
