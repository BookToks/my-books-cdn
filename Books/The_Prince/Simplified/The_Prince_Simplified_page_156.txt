Luck plays a big part in what happens to people and countries. If a country had been properly protected, like Germany, Spain, and France, either the flood wouldn’t have caused so much damage or it might not have happened at all.

That’s pretty much all you need to know in general about dealing with luck.

But if we look closer, we’ve all seen how a leader might be doing great one day and then suddenly lose power the next, even though nothing about them seems to have changed. Many people think this is just luck or fate. I believe the world is controlled by both God and fortune, and often leaders trust luck too much and don’t protect themselves. When luck changes, they fall apart.

Because of this, some leaders think it’s not worth trying hard and just leave things to chance. This way of thinking is more common now because the world is changing so fast and in ways no one expected. Sometimes, I’ve thought this myself. But I still believe that luck decides about half of what happens, and the other half depends on what we do.

It’s like a wild river that sometimes floods and destroys everything. Everyone tries to stay safe, but no one can stop the river. Still, we build banks and dykes to keep the water from flooding when it rises. Fortune is like that river. It’s strongest where no one has prepared for it.

This is why people’s luck goes up and down. If someone is careful and patient and the situation fits their approach, they succeed. But if the times change and they don’t change with them, things go wrong. Some people adapt to new situations and do well. Others fail because they stick to old ways.

All people want success and fame, but they go about it in different ways. Some are careful, others act on impulse. Some use force, others use smart tactics. Some wait patiently, others rush. Any of these ways can work if they match the situation.

For example, two cautious people can have different results—one wins, the other loses. Or two successful people can have very different styles, like one careful and one impulsive. Their success depends on whether their way fits the circumstances.

If you look at Italy, which has had lots of big changes and problems, you can see it hasn’t built the banks or dykes to protect itself from fortune’s floods.
