The ideas in The Prince were taken out of context and made simple, so readers thought they really understood Machiavelli. But actually, they got a twisted version that made any kind of cruelty seem okay and celebrated cold, heartless thinking.

After that, Machiavelli’s name stopped being just for smart people and became a way to insult someone. People called him names like ‘Mach Evil’ and ‘Match-a villain’ in English, and ‘Mitchell Wylie’ in Scotland. Many critics didn’t even read his real work. Instead, they learned from Gentillet, whose book ‘Anti-Machiavel’ was quickly translated into Latin for English readers, and about twenty years later, into English. By the end of the 1500s, Machiavelli’s work still hadn’t been fully translated into English.

Ironically, after the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, when Catherine de’ Medici was trying to end France’s civil wars and convince Catholics to accept the Huguenots in some areas, both she and Machiavelli were attacked again. This time, Catholics accused them of putting political convenience above important religious truths. The Catholics were afraid this would turn France into a country without strong religious values.
