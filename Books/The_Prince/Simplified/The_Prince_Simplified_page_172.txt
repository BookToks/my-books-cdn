Hannibal (247–182 BC) was the son of Hamilcar and a great military leader. Starting in 221 BC, he led an army with war elephants across Spain, over the Pyrenees and Alps, and into northern Italy during the Second Punic War. He won many battles but had to go back home when the Romans attacked Carthage. He was finally defeated in 201 BC by Scipio Africanus. After this, Hannibal became a leader in Carthage and made many changes, but the Romans forced him into exile. To avoid being captured, he poisoned himself.

Marcus Didius Julianus (around 133–193) became emperor after the Praetorian Guard killed the previous emperor, Pertinax. However, Julianus only ruled for 66 days before he was murdered when Septimius Severus came to power.

Julius II (1443–1513) was made pope in 1503. He quickly worked to take down the powerful Borgia family and end fights between two big Roman families, the Orsini and Colonna. He took control of parts of Italy, which made the pope very powerful. In 1508, he formed the League of Cambrai with France, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire to kick the Venetians out of Romagna. But later, Julius teamed up with Venice to push the French out of Italy. He was a big supporter of the arts, starting the building of St. Peter’s Basilica and hiring Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling.

Heliogabalus (203–222) was a Roman emperor from 218 to 222. He was the grandson of the murdered emperor Caracalla’s aunt. Some people said he was Caracalla’s illegitimate son. Heliogabalus tried to change Roman religious traditions and married five times before he was killed at 18 and replaced by his cousin Severus Alexander.

Hiero II was the king of Syracuse from 270 to 215 BC. He was the son of a nobleman and a former general. After the famous general Pyrrhus left, Hiero became leader and defeated enemies in 275 BC. He made a peace deal with Rome in 263 BC to protect his kingdom in exchange for helping Rome fight Carthage. Hiero was related to Archimedes and supported his inventions, especially for the military.

Leo X (1475–1521) was made a cardinal at 13 and became pope in 1513. He was from the Medici family and was famous for selling indulgences to pay for St. Peter’s Basilica. He worked hard to help his family and responded to Martin Luther’s protests against indulgences. In 1513, he joined the Venetians and other powers to drive the French out of Italy but later switched sides and supported the French against the Holy Roman Empire.

Joanna II (1373–1435) ruled Naples from 1414 to 1435. She had no children and let her court be run by her favorites and lovers. She played the rival Anjou and Aragon families against each other by offering them chances to succeed her throne. This caused conflicts between the two families.

Louis XI (1423–1483) was king of France from 1461 to 1483. He made the king stronger compared to the nobles and hired the best mercenary commanders, like Francesco Sforza, to help him win battles.
