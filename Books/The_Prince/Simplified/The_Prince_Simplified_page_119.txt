I’m sure we’d all agree it would be great if a ruler had all the good qualities and none of the bad ones. But since it’s impossible to have all those qualities all the time, a ruler has to be careful not to make mistakes that could cost him his job.  

For smaller mistakes that don’t risk his power, he should avoid them if he can. But if he can’t, he doesn’t need to worry too much. Also, he shouldn’t care about having a bad reputation if it helps him keep control. Sometimes things that seem wrong might actually help a ruler succeed, while things that seem right could lead to disaster.  

Many writers imagine perfect kingdoms and leaders that don’t exist in real life. There’s a big difference between how people actually live and how they should live. If someone tries to always be good in a world where most people aren’t, they’ll end up in trouble. So, if a ruler wants to stay in power, he has to learn not to be good all the time, especially when it’s necessary.  

Putting aside ideas about perfect rulers, let’s focus on reality. When we talk about people, especially leaders who are always watched, we notice the qualities that make people praise or blame them. Some are seen as generous, others as selfish; some as kind, others as cruel; some as loyal, others as treacherous.
