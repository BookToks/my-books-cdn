Machiavelli expected his readers to know a lot about the men he talks about from recent and modern times, but not so much about the people from ancient history. To help today’s readers understand better, I gave more information about the modern historical figures and less about those from Roman times and earlier.

Achilles was a Greek hero in the Trojan War. He was the son of the immortal nymph Thetis and was raised by Chiron, the centaur.

Giovanni Acuto is the Italian name for John Hawkwood (1320–1394). He fought in the English army in France. In 1360, Hawkwood joined mercenary soldiers in Burgundy. Later, he led the White Company, a group of soldiers who fought for different states and sides in Italy. He was good at making deals between his employers and their enemies, which helped him become very rich. From 1390 on, he led the armies of Florence in their war against Milan’s Visconti family.

Agathocles (361–289 BC) was the ruler of Syracuse from 317 to 289 BC and became King of Sicily from 304 to 289 BC. He took power in Syracuse by kicking out and killing thousands of people. He built a strong army and controlled Sicily, which caused a long conflict with Carthage.

Albinus, whose full name was Decimus Clodius Ceionius Septimius (around 150–197 AD), was a Roman military leader in Britain. After the emperor Pertinax was killed in 193, Albinus declared himself emperor too. At first, he teamed up with Severus in Rome, who had also claimed to be emperor.
