A minister in charge of a state should never think about himself, only about the ruler, and focus only on the ruler’s business.

To make sure the minister does this, the ruler must pay attention to him, give him money and respect, help him out, and share honors and important jobs with him. This way, the minister will know he can’t live without the ruler. He will have so many honors that he won’t want more, so much wealth that he won’t look for more, and so many jobs that he will protect the current situation.

There’s another important problem to think about, which is flatterers. Rulers can only avoid problems with flatterers if they are really smart or really good at picking their ministers.

Courts are always full of flatterers, and people are quick to brag about themselves and think they are better than they really are, so it’s easy to make this mistake. But if you try to fight off flatterers, people might start to dislike you.

The only way to protect yourself from flattery is to let people know you don’t mind hearing the truth. But if everyone can tell you the truth whenever they want, you lose respect.

So a wise ruler should find a middle ground. He should pick smart men as ministers and only let them tell him the truth—and only when he asks about something, not all the time. The ruler should ask his ministers about everything, listen to their ideas, then decide on his own using his own judgment.

When the ruler talks to his advisers, he should make it clear that the more honestly they speak, the more he welcomes their advice. After that, he should not listen to anyone else, but go ahead with his decision and stand firm. If he tries something else, he will either be ruined by flatterers or have his plans changed by bad ministers who only care about themselves.
