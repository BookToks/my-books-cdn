Luck plays a big part in what happens to people and countries. If a country had been properly protected, like Germany, Spain, or France, floods wouldn’t have been so bad or might not have happened at all.

I think that’s all you really need to know about how to deal with luck in general.

But if we look closer, we’ve all seen how a leader might be doing great one day and then lose power the next, even if nothing seems to have changed about them. Many people believe this happens because of luck or fate. I believe the world is controlled by both God and luck. Sometimes, smart leaders can’t protect themselves from bad luck. Because of this, they might think there’s no point in trying and just leave everything to chance. This idea is more common now because the world is changing so fast, with things happening that no one could predict.

Still, I’m sure the leader who succeeds is the one who changes and adapts to new times. The leader who fails is the one who sticks to old ways that don’t work anymore.

Everyone wants fame and money, but they try to get these things in different ways. Some people are careful, some act without thinking. Some use force, others use cleverness. Some wait patiently, others rush in. All these ways can work. You can even see two careful people have very different results—one wins and the other fails. Or two people can both succeed but by doing very different things. This depends on whether their way fits the situation. That’s why two people can both do well with different styles, or why one might fail even if they try the same way as someone else.

This is like a wild river that floods sometimes, destroying trees and buildings. People run away because they can’t stop it. But just because a river is dangerous doesn’t mean we can’t get ready for it. When the water is low, people build banks and dikes to protect against floods. Then, when the river rises again, the damage isn’t so bad.

Luck is like that river. It hits hardest where no one is prepared. If you don’t get ready, luck can cause a lot of trouble. If you look at Italy, which has had lots of big changes and revolutions, you’ll see it’s a place without any banks or dikes to protect it from bad luck.
