He also found a new way to make the Church more money, something that had never been done before. The country was controlled by the pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and the Florentines. Julius didn’t just follow Alexander’s example—he went even further.

These powerful states had two main goals: to keep foreign armies out of Italy and to stop each other from taking more land. The pope and the Venetians wanted to expand their power the most. The only way to stop the Venetians was for all the other states to team up, which they did to defend Ferrara. To annoy the pope, they relied on the Roman barons. Since these barons were split into two groups, the Orsinis and the Colonnas, they were always fighting each other.

Two things stopped the barons from changing much: first, the Church’s power scared them; second, they didn’t have any cardinals. Cardinals usually cause fights because they support different groups, but without them, the barons stayed quiet and weak. Even when a strong pope like Sixtus came along, he couldn’t fix this problem because cardinals often start fights. Popes didn’t stay in power long—usually about ten years. During that time, a pope might beat one group, but the next pope would support the other, so the fighting went on.

Because of this, the Italian states didn’t think the pope’s political power was very strong.

Then came Alexander VI, who showed what could be done with money and armies. Using his son Valentino Borgia and taking advantage of the French, he made many gains. Although Alexander wanted to make his son powerful, his success also made the Church stronger. After Alexander and Valentino died, the Church kept their conquered lands.

So when Pope Julius was elected, he took over a Church that now controlled all of Romagna and was stronger because Alexander had defeated the Roman barons and their fighting groups.
