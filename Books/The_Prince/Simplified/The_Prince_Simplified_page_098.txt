These are the people you have to watch out for and treat like enemies from the start. Because when things start going bad, these people will try to bring you down. A strong leader who stays calm and plans ahead keeps everyone positive, and the people won’t let him fail. Over time, it will be clear if he built a solid foundation.

A man who becomes king with the support of the people must keep those people on his side. This is easier since everyone just wants to be free from being controlled. But if a man becomes king without most people’s support and relies on rich nobles, he’s in big trouble. He has to win over the common people’s trust or they’ll take away his power, especially when times get hard. They might fight him or just ignore his orders.

If the king rules through others instead of himself, he’s weaker and more at risk because he depends on the people he appoints to help him. When problems start, he won’t have time to take full control because people are used to following those helpers and won’t quickly listen to him instead. So, a ruler in this position must have the people on his side; if not, there’s no way out when things get tough.

Nabis, a Spartan king, was attacked by many enemies but he kept defending his country because he had the people with him. He only had to deal with a few inside enemies. But if the people had turned against him, he wouldn’t have stood a chance. The ruler must always make sure his citizens need both him and his government, no matter if things are good or bad. Then they will stay loyal.

Some people say building your power on the people is risky, like building a house on mud. That’s true if it’s just a regular person hoping the people will save him when he’s in trouble. People like that usually get betrayed, like the Gracchi brothers in Rome or Giorgio Scali in Florence.

But when a king builds his power on the people, and the people support him, things are different.
