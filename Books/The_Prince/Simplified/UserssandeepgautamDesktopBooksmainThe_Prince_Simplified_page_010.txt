The result was a short book that caused a lot of controversy for hundreds of years.

Niccolò Machiavelli was born in Florence in 1469, the same year Lorenzo de’ Medici (called il Magnifico) became powerful. He was the first boy after two girls. Niccolò grew up very close to his dad, Bernardo, who used to be a lawyer but was mostly out of work. Bernardo had good connections but wasn’t rich or powerful. If Niccolò wanted to succeed, and he really wanted to, he would have to rely on his own smarts and charm. His younger brother, Totto, didn’t want to compete and became a priest instead.

Their mom was very religious and wrote poems and songs about God.

Their dad, on the other hand, was more doubtful and preferred serious old Latin books instead of the Bible.

Niccolò probably got his writing talent from his mom, but when it came to religion, he agreed with his dad and the Roman historians.

People say Lorenzo il Magnifico “came to power,” but officially Florence was a republic. Since Lorenzo was only twenty in 1469, he was too young to have an elected job. So, there’s more to the story.

Back in the 1200s, the people of Florence kicked out the noble families who used to run the city. They made a republic with a really fair system. A group of eight leaders called “priori” was chosen every two months. One of them was the “gonfaloniere,” like a prime minister. They picked these leaders by drawing names from bags that held names of rich men from different work groups and parts of town.
