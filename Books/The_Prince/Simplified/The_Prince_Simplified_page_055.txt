The phrase comes at the very end of The Prince (the final part is a bit different), and Machiavelli wanted to finish with a strong and clever message.

Here is Marriot’s version of the last paragraph: I think that fortune changes a lot, but people usually stick to their habits. When these two work together, people succeed, but when they don’t, people fail. I believe it’s better to take risks than to be too careful because fortune is like a woman. If you want to control her, you have to be forceful. She lets people who are bold and daring control her more than those who are careful. She likes young men because they are less careful, more intense, and braver.

And here is Bull’s version: I think fortune changes all the time, but people don’t change much. People do well when fortune and their actions match up, but fail when they don’t. I strongly believe it’s better to be bold than too cautious because fortune is like a woman. To make her obey, you have to push and control her.
