With his dad’s support, Borgia was building a new state for himself on the northern edge of the Papal States and had just taken over the city of Urbino, which is east of Florence. Machiavelli was sent to stop Borgia from moving into Florentine land, but he was really impressed by him. Borgia was charming, determined, smart, and ruthless. He was a strong leader, very different from Machiavelli’s unsure boss, Soderini.

In January 1503, Machiavelli went on another mission to Borgia. Borgia invited a group of rebels to talk in the coastal town of Senigallia, but as soon as they were inside the town walls, he had them captured and killed. Machiavelli saw that Borgia was someone who grabbed control of situations. What amazed Machiavelli wasn’t that Borgia ignored Christian rules, but that he could quickly understand a situation, think it through, and then act fast in whatever way would get the best result. This practical way of thinking, where ideas help only if they lead to quick action, is the main idea in The Prince.

Meanwhile, Florence kept falling apart. Machiavelli was back again in 1503, this time in Rome, when Borgia’s empire fell after he and his dad got very sick. People say Pope Alexander accidentally poisoned them both. The pope died, and Borgia lost his power.
