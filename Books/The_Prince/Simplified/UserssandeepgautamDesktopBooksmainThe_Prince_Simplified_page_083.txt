He had no way to keep the first believers loyal or force the doubters to agree with him. But any new ruler who gets power by chance will face big problems and dangers, mostly in the beginning, and must use his own skills to overcome them. Once he does that and gets rid of those who are against him, so people start to respect and admire him, then he can enjoy his power safely and live with honor and satisfaction.

I’ve talked about four great leaders, but now I want to mention a less impressive man, Hiero of Syracuse. He didn’t have to work hard to take control of his state but still needed some of the same qualities as the others and had to work to keep his power. He had no problem becoming important because he was lucky. Hiero was just a normal citizen who became King of Syracuse.

The luck he had was in the situation at the start: the Syracusans were threatened by Carthage, so they chose him as their military leader. He did such a good job that they made him king. Even as a private citizen, he was capable, and one writer said about him: "He had everything it takes to be a king except a kingdom." Hiero got rid of the old army and made a new one. He broke old alliances and made new ones, so with his own soldiers and allies, he built the foundation for whatever he wanted.

It took him a lot of effort to set up his power, but very little to keep it. These kinds of men depend completely on the people who gave them their power, which is very unstable and uncertain. They don’t know how to keep power because, unless they are very talented, their past lives as private citizens don’t prepare them to be leaders. They also don’t have an army they can trust to stay loyal. Like anything that appears suddenly and grows fast, these new rulers have weak foundations and will usually fall when trouble comes.

Unless, of course, the man who suddenly becomes a ruler is so talented that he immediately starts working to protect what luck gave him and to build strong foundations that another leader would have made.
