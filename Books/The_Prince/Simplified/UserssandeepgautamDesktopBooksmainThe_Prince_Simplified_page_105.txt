He also found a new way to increase the Church’s income that had never been used before. The country was controlled by the pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and the Florentines. Julius not only followed Alexander’s example but went even further.

These powerful states had two main concerns: to keep foreign armies out of Italy and to stop each other from taking more land. The pope and the Venetians were the most eager to expand. The only way to stop the Venetians was for all the other states to team up, which they did to protect Ferrara. To annoy the pope, they relied on the Roman barons. Since these barons were split into two groups, the Orsinis and the Colonnas, they were always fighting with each other.

The pope kept these groups weak and divided by not giving them any cardinals. Cardinals usually cause fights inside the Church because they support different sides, and the barons would defend their own groups. Even when a strong pope like Sixtus came along, he was never smart or lucky enough to fix the problem. Popes usually didn’t last long; in ten years, one pope might beat one group, but the next pope would support the other group, so the fights never really stopped. That’s why the Italian states didn’t think the pope’s power over land was very important.

Then came Alexander VI, who showed what could be done with money and military force. Using his son Valentino Borgia and taking advantage of the French, he made the gains I talked about before. Even though Alexander wanted to make his son powerful, not the Church, his actions still made the Church stronger. After Alexander and then Valentino died, the Church kept their new lands.

So when Pope Julius was elected, he took over a Church that now controlled all of Romagna and was stronger because Alexander had defeated the Roman barons.
