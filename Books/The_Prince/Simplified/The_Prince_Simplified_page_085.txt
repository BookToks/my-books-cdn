Before Alexander came to power, things were pretty stable, but some people wanted to change that to grab land and control. The Venetians, for their own reasons, really wanted to bring the French back into Italy. Instead of fighting this, the pope helped by canceling King Louis’s first marriage to make it easier for the French.

So, the French king entered Italy with help from Venice and the pope’s approval. As soon as he took over Milan, the pope convinced the king to send troops to help his son, Cesare Borgia, take Romagna. This would have been impossible without the king’s support. Borgia had to deal with two big problems: his own army, which he didn’t fully trust, and French politics. He used the Orsini family’s forces but worried they might stop listening to him and cause trouble.

Borgia also worried about the King of France. When he captured Faenza and attacked Bologna, his soldiers didn’t seem very excited. After taking Urbino, Borgia moved toward Tuscany but the French king told him to stop. From then on, Borgia decided he wouldn’t rely on other people’s armies or power again.

When Pope Alexander VI wanted to make his son a powerful duke, he faced many problems. His son couldn’t rule any land that wasn’t Church property because the Duke of Milan and the Venetians would block him. Also, the armies the pope could call on wouldn’t help. So, the pope started winning over the nobles in Rome who supported his enemies by paying them and giving them jobs.

In just a few months, old loyalties disappeared, and these nobles supported the pope’s son. After breaking up the leaders of one enemy family, the pope waited for a chance to get rid of the main men from the other family. This way, he made a stronger foundation for his son’s future power.
