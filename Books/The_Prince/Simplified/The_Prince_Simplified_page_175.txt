In a treaty made in 1474, it was decided that he was responsible for the murder. He spent his short time as ruler focusing on the eastern areas, but his power started to weaken because of military losses. Finally, he was defeated by supporters of the 14-year-old Heliogabalus, who was the grandson of Caracalla’s aunt, Julia Maesa.

Louis XII (1462–1515) was King of France from 1498 to 1515. He was originally the Duke of Orleans and became king after his cousin Charles VIII died in 1498. Louis quickly made a deal with Pope Alexander VI that let him leave his first wife and marry Charles’s widow, adding Brittany to France. The Orleans family claimed both Milan and Naples, so Louis made an agreement with Venice to split Milan’s land and took the city in 1499. The Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, came back in 1500 but was pushed out again. Louis then made a deal with Spain to divide the Kingdom of Naples and took the city for France in 1501.

But the French and Spanish didn’t agree on how to divide the land. In 1503, the Spanish beat the French at Garigliano. In 1508, Louis joined an alliance called the League of Cambrai with the Holy Roman Empire, England, the Papal States, Florence, and Spain to fight Venice. Louis led the army and won a big battle against Venice in 1509. However, as Rome and France became stronger, they started fighting each other. In 1510, Pope Julius II joined England, Spain, Switzerland, and the Holy Roman Empire to form the Holy League to kick France out of Italy. That goal was reached in 1513 at the battle of Novara. But two years later, Louis’s successor, Francis I, came back and took Milan and much of northern Italy.

Maximilian (1459–1519) was the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire from 1486 to 1519. He wanted to unite his empire’s many different lands by making the government stronger. He also wanted to bring back the empire’s power in Italy and become the leader of the Christian world by starting a crusade against Islam. While he did okay with changes inside his empire, his foreign policies were mixed and caused him to lose Switzerland, which became independent in 1499.

Maximilian wanted to take back land from Venice but was often stopped because he had to focus on stopping France from getting stronger in Italy. In 1495, he joined the League of Venice to try and push the French out, but it didn’t help much. In 1496, the Duke of Milan, who was his wife’s uncle, asked him to send an army to stop a French attack, but France didn’t attack. Later, Maximilian tried to help Pisa fight Florence but failed. In 1507, he started trying to take land from Venice but didn’t make much progress. In 1512, he joined the Holy League to push the French out of Italy again. When Francis I took Milan in 1515, Maximilian got involved in another failed attempt to stop France from moving north of the Alps.
