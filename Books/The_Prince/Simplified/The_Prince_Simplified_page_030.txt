After being shared for years as handwritten copies and then printed in Latin under the title On Principalities, it finally came out in Italian in 1532. But in 1559, Pope Paul IV put it on the list of banned books. This happened partly because the English cardinal Reginald Pole said that The Prince, which he called written by ‘Satan’s finger,’ was mostly to blame for Henry VIII’s choice to break away from the Roman Church.

At the same time, in France, the fight between the Protestant Huguenots and the Catholics was getting worse. It would explode during the rule of the sickly young king Charles IX, who was mostly controlled by his mother, Catherine de’ Medici. Catherine was Italian, from Florence, and her dad was Lorenzo de’ Medici, the same man Machiavelli had dedicated The Prince to. Catherine brought a lot of Italian friends to the French court, which made people angry at Italians. She tried to calm down the religious fighting that was tearing France apart. But she was still blamed for the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre in 1572, when thousands of Huguenots were killed. One person who almost got killed, Innocent Gentillet, escaped to Protestant Geneva and wrote a book called Discours contre Machiavel. This book started a long tradition of criticizing Machiavelli.

This book was meant to attack Catherine de’ Medici and the strong French Catholics and to defend the Huguenots. It said Catherine loved reading Machiavelli and used people’s dislike of Italians to say that both the queen and Machiavelli showed a cruel and evil side of Italian character.
