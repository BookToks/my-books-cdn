Father of Hannibal and Braccio da Montone fought against each other.

Hannibal (247–182 BC) was the son of Hamilcar. He led Carthaginian forces from 221 BC. He took an army, which included war elephants, across the Iberian Peninsula, over the Pyrenees and Alps, and down into northern Italy in what became known as the Second Punic War. Even though he won some big battles, he had to go back home when the Romans attacked Carthage. He was defeated at the Battle of Zama (201 BC) by Scipio Africanus. After that, he worked for many years as the top leader in Carthage and made lots of reforms. But the Romans forced him into exile. To avoid being caught by the Romans, he poisoned himself.

Marcus Didius Julianus (c. 133–193) was made emperor by the Praetorian Guard after they killed Pertinax. But he was emperor for only sixty-six days before he was killed. Septimius Severus, who didn’t accept Julianus’s rule, came to Rome and took over.

Julius II, also known as Giuliano della Rovere (1443–1513), was made pope in 1503 after Pius III died. Julius had been a strong enemy of Alexander VI and would not support Alexander’s son, Cesare Borgia. Julius quickly destroyed the Borgia family’s power and worked to stop the fight between two powerful families, the Orsini and Colonna. After securing control in Rome, he took back papal lands in the Romagna region. He attacked the Venetians and took Perugia and Bologna in 1506. This gave the pope more power over land. In 1508, he created the League of Cambrai with France, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire to kick the Venetians out of Romagna. But when the Venetians won at Agnadello in 1509, Julius worried about France becoming too strong and joined forces with Venice to push Louis XII out of Italy. Julius was a big supporter of the arts. He started building St. Peter’s Basilica in 1506 and hired Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling.

Heliogabalus (c. 203–222) was a Roman emperor from 218 to 222. He was the grandson of the aunt of the murdered emperor Caracalla. Some people said he was Caracalla’s illegitimate son. He became emperor after Macrinus was killed. Heliogabalus tried to change Roman religious traditions and broke many rules. He married five times before he was 18. But he was murdered and replaced by his cousin Severus Alexander.

Hiero II was king of Syracuse from 270 to 215 BC. He was the illegitimate son of a nobleman and used to be a general under Pyrrhus. After Pyrrhus left, Hiero became commander of Syracuse’s army and was chosen to rule after defeating the Mamertines (who lived in what is now Messina). After losing a war with Rome, he made a deal in 263 BC to keep his kingdom safe as long as he helped Rome in their war with Carthage. Hiero was related to Archimedes, who invented many military tools, and Hiero supported his work.

Leo X, born Giovanni de’ Medici (1475–1521), became a cardinal at 13 and was elected pope in 1513. He is known for selling indulgences to pay for building St. Peter’s Basilica, supporting his Medici family, and dealing with Martin Luther’s protests against indulgences. In 1513, he joined Venice and other powers to drive the French out of Italy but later worked with the French against the Holy Roman Empire.

Joanna II (1373–1435) ruled Naples from 1414 to 1435. She had no children and let her court be controlled by her favorites and lovers. She played the Anjou and Aragon families against each other by offering them chances to succeed her. This caused fights between the two royal families.

Louis XI (1423–1483) was king of France from 1461 to 1483. He made the king stronger compared to the barons and added Burgundy and Anjou to the French kingdom.
