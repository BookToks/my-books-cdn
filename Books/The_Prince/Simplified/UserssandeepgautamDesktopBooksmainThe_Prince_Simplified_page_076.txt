If we go back to the Kingdom of Darius, it was a Turkish kingdom. So, Alexander first had to defeat the entire army and take control of the country. But once he did that, and after Darius died, he was safely in charge for the reasons mentioned before.

If his followers had stayed united, they could have ruled the area without any problems. Actually, the only troubles they had were fights among themselves. But states organized the French way can never be held easily.

When the places you take over are used to ruling themselves without a king and living freely by their own laws, there are three ways to control them. The first way is to destroy them completely. The second is to move in and live there yourself. The third is to let them keep living by their own laws, make them pay taxes, and set up a small local government that supports you.

Because this local government is set up by the conqueror, its members know they can’t survive without his support. So, they will do everything they can to protect his power. Once you decide not to destroy the place, the best way to control it is with the help of its own citizens.

Let’s look at Sparta and Rome as examples. The Spartans controlled Athens and Thebes by setting up local governments, but they eventually lost those cities. The Romans destroyed Capua, Carthage, and Numantia completely to keep control. They tried to hold Greece the same way the Spartans did, letting it keep its own laws, but it didn’t work. In the end, they had to destroy many cities to keep control of the whole region.

The truth is, the only sure way to hold these places is to destroy them. If you take over a city used to self-government and don’t destroy it, you can expect problems. Even if you kill the king’s family, there will always be nobles ready to take power when they see a chance. Since you can’t give them everything they want or get rid of them all, you’ll lose the land you took as soon as your enemies find an opportunity to rebel.
