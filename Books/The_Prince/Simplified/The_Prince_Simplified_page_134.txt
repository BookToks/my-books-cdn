This was a really tough problem that caused many emperors to fail. Pertinax tried to make people honest and follow high standards. This made a lot of people hate him. It was hard to keep both the people and the army happy at the same time. Since Pertinax was also old and not liked, he was soon overthrown.

The people wanted a calm and peaceful life, so they liked quiet leaders. But the soldiers liked leaders who were bold and had military goals. They wanted the emperor to be tough and even cruel so they could get more money and power. Because of this, emperors who didn’t have strong authority or political skills couldn’t control both the soldiers and the people. This usually ended badly.

When emperors saw how hard it was to please both groups, most chose to make the army happy and ignored the people. This caused suffering for the common people. It was a necessary choice: if a ruler wants to avoid hatred, he must try not to anger the powerful groups, especially the army.

Looking at Alexander, he was a good man. For over fourteen years, he never executed anyone without a trial. But people still didn’t like him. They thought he was weak and said his mother controlled him. Because of this, the army turned against him and killed him.

On the other hand, emperors like Commodus, Severus, Antoninus Caracalla, and Maximinus were very cruel and greedy. They did whatever it took to keep the army happy, even if it meant hurting their own people. Except for Severus, most of them ended badly.

Severus was different. He was strong and even though he was harsh, he kept the army loyal. His rule was successful because both the people and the army respected him in their own ways.

Since Severus became emperor by birth, not because the army or people chose him, he had to be smart. He used clever tricks to stay in power. He made sure both the army and the people stayed under control and never hated him.

When Emperor Julian was weak, Severus convinced the army he led to march on Rome and get revenge for Pertinax, who had been killed. The soldiers had grown used to a spoiled lifestyle under Commodus.

Roman emperors had to deal with a big problem: the army’s greed and cruelty. This was a danger to their rule and made it hard to keep peace.
