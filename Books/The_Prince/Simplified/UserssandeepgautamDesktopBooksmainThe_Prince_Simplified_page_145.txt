At that time, no foreign enemies could help the people. But later, her forts didn’t help much when Cesare Borgia attacked the town, and the people, who didn’t like her, sided with him. She would have been safer if she had kept the people on her side instead of just trusting her forts.

I think rulers who build forts and those who don’t both can be okay. But I will always criticize any ruler who thinks it doesn’t matter if the people hate him and just trusts forts to keep him safe.

Nothing makes a ruler respected like big military wins and showing great personal qualities. A good example today is Ferdinand of Aragon, the King of Spain. At first, he was a weak king, but he became the most famous and respected king in Europe. His achievements are amazing.

At the start of his reign, he invaded Granada, which helped him gain power. It was smart because at that time, things were calm inside the country, so no one could stop him. The war kept the nobles busy so they couldn’t cause trouble. Meanwhile, Ferdinand’s power and fame grew without them noticing.

He paid his armies with money from the Church and the people, which helped him fight a long war and build a strong military for the future. After that, to get more support from the Church for bigger campaigns, he did something cruel but called it religious. He took the wealth of the Marrano Jews and kicked them out of his kingdom, which was very harsh and shocking.

Using religion as an excuse again, he attacked Africa, then moved into Italy, and finally attacked France. He was always planning and doing big things, keeping his people busy and focused.
