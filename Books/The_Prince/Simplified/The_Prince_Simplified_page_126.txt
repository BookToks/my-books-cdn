A ruler and his promises

When it comes to whether a ruler should be feared or loved, I think people choose if they want to love their ruler, but the ruler decides if people are afraid of him. So, a smart ruler should base his power on what he can control, not on what people can freely choose. But he must be careful not to make people hate him.

Everyone respects a ruler who keeps his promises and is honest instead of tricky. But nowadays, we’ve seen leaders who did great things without always keeping their word. They used clever tricks to beat their enemies and got more done than honest leaders did.

Leaders should remember there are two ways to fight: by using laws or by using force. People usually use laws, and animals use force. But since laws don’t always work well, it’s smart to use force sometimes too.

So a ruler must be able to use both his human side and his animal side fully. Long ago, stories taught this by saying leaders were raised by a creature who was half-man and half-beast, like the centaur Chiron. This showed that a ruler needs both sides to survive.

Because a ruler has to act like an animal sometimes, he should be like a fox and a lion. The lion can scare away wolves, but it can’t avoid traps. The fox can spot traps but can’t scare wolves. So, a ruler needs to be like a fox to see traps and like a lion to scare enemies. A leader who only acts like a lion and forgets to be like a fox doesn’t know what he’s doing.

Therefore, a smart ruler can’t always keep his promises if doing so would hurt his power or make his rule weaker.
