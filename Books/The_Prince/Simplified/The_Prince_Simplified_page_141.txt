Even if your hired soldiers are good, they’ll never be good enough to protect your castles and plans from strong enemies and unfriendly people.

New rulers usually arm their people. History shows this happens all the time.

But when a ruler takes over new land added to an existing state, he has to take away weapons from the people there, except for the men who helped him win it. Over time, even those men should be watched closely. To keep power safe, some rulers have disarmed and weakened their citizens; some have kept towns they control divided by making them fight each other; some have made people dislike them; some have tried to win over those who didn’t trust them at first; some have built fortresses; others have torn them down and destroyed them. Even though we can’t fully judge these actions without knowing all the details, I will try to talk about them in general.

No new ruler has ever left his people unarmed. Instead, they always give them weapons. When you give people arms, those weapons belong to you. Men who might have been against you become loyal, and those who already liked you become stronger supporters. You can’t give everyone weapons, but if you arm some, you can trust them more.

The experts in Florence once said that to control a town like Pistoia, you had to encourage fights between groups inside it and also hold its fortresses. So they made some towns fight among themselves to keep control. When there was a balance between groups in Italy, this probably worked, but I don’t think it’s a good rule today. Faction fights never really helped. When an enemy comes, a town divided by fights will fall quickly. The weaker group will join the enemy, and the other won’t be strong enough to stop both.

The Venetians thought the same way when they made groups called Guelphs and Ghibellines fight in the towns they held. They stopped the fights from turning violent but kept the groups busy with their own arguments so they wouldn’t unite against Venice. But this didn’t work. After the Venetians lost at Vaila`, one group took control of the towns. This kind of plan shows a ruler’s weakness. In a strong and confident state, these divisions wouldn’t be allowed because they don’t really help with defense or power.

If you take weapons away from people, you upset them. It shows you don’t trust them and makes them hate you. But if you arm them, they will feel loyal and responsible, and they’ll want to protect you because their lives depend on yours.
