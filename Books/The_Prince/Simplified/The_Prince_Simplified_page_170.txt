The papacy fought back but was stopped, partly because of help from the French leader Fabius Maximus, and partly because Ferrara had better cannons. Making these cannons was very important and something the duke was proud of. 

In 1526–27, Alfonso joined Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, in an expedition that led to the sacking of Rome.

Ferdinand of Aragon was born in 1452. When he was seventeen, he married Isabella of Castile, who was eighteen. This was the first step toward uniting Spain. They ruled Castile together from 1474 and Ferdinand became King of Aragon in 1479.

After a long fight to take Granada, the last Muslim territory in Spain, Ferdinand won in 1492. That same year, he forced the Jews to leave both Castile and Aragon. Most of his rule was spent fighting against French expansion in Italy. From 1494 to 1496, he helped Italian leaders drive Charles VIII of France out of Italy. In 1501, he made an agreement with Louis XII to split the Kingdom of Naples, but later took over all of it by 1504. By the time Ferdinand died, Spain was the most powerful country in Europe. His grandson Charles of Austria, who was also Holy Roman Emperor, took over.

The brothers Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Sempronius Gracchus were important Romans in the second century BC. Both became officials called Tribunes who tried to limit the power of the rich nobles and help the common people. Both were killed for trying to make these changes.

The dukes of Ferrara were from a family that ruled for about 400 years.

(1) Ercole d’Este (1431–1505) was duke from 1471 to 1505. He married the daughter of King Ferrante of Naples and supported Renaissance art.

(2) Alfonso d’Este (1476–1534) was duke from 1505 to 1534. He married Anna Sforza and later Lucrezia Borgia, daughter of Pope Alexander VI. In 1508, he joined the League of Cambrai, which wanted to destroy Venice’s power and divide its land. When the pope switched sides to support Venice, Alfonso stayed loyal to France. Because of this, the pope excommunicated him and attacked him.

Guidobaldo da Montefeltro (1472–1508) became Duke of Urbino in 1482. He fought for the pope and French kings, and later for Venice against France. When Cesare Borgia attacked him in 1497, he ran away but came back after Borgia’s soldiers turned against him. Guidobaldo’s court was one of the most refined in Europe and inspired the famous book "The Book of the Courtier," which talks about the perfect qualities of a courtier.

Hamilcar Barca (c. 270–228 BC) was a Carthaginian general during the First Punic War against Rome. He led an invasion of Roman lands in Sicily around 247 BC.
