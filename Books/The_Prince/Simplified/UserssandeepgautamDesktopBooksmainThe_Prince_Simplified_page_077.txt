If we go back to the Kingdom of Darius, we’ll see it was a Turkish kingdom. So, Alexander first had to defeat its entire army and take control of the country. But once he did that and Darius was dead, he was firmly in charge for the reasons mentioned earlier. If his successors had stayed united, they could have ruled the area without problems. The only trouble they had was fighting among themselves.

When you invade places where people are used to living freely and ruling themselves without a king, there are three ways to keep control. The first is to destroy everything. The second is to move in and live there yourself. The third is to let them keep living under their own laws, make them pay taxes, and set up a small local government that supports you. This local government knows it can’t survive without your support, so they do everything they can to protect your power. If you decide not to destroy the place, the best way to hold onto a self-governing city is by working with its own citizens.

Let’s look at Sparta and Rome as examples. The Spartans controlled Athens and Thebes by setting up local governments, but in the end, they lost those towns. The Romans destroyed cities like Capua, Carthage, and Numantia to keep control. They tried to control Greece like the Spartans did, letting it keep its own laws, but it didn’t work. Eventually, they had to destroy many cities to hold the region.

The truth is, the only sure way to keep control of these places is to destroy them. If you conquer a city used to ruling itself and don’t destroy it, expect it to destroy you.
