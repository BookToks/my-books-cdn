During the war against Rome and Naples in 1480, Florence asked the French king to go after his claim to the throne of Naples more seriously. In 1482, when Venice attacked Ferrara, Florence and Milan encouraged the Turks to increase their attacks on Venice’s sea territories. Venice answered by inviting the Duke of Orleans to claim Milan. In a war against Naples in 1483, Pope Innocent VIII reminded the Duke of Lorraine that he also had a claim to the southern kingdom and asked him to send troops.

Some of these threats were just bluffs, but in 1494, when King Charles VIII of France accepted Milan’s invitation to claim Naples, the bluff ended. Charles marched south with an army bigger than any Italians had seen in a long time. From then on, Italy wouldn’t be free from foreign control until 1870 when the Risorgimento was finished. The French, struggling to keep Naples, asked the Spanish from Sicily to help share the kingdom. Later, after Charles I of Spain became Holy Roman Emperor, the Spanish pushed the French back north, sacked Rome, and ruled Italy for 150 years.

But that’s jumping ahead. In 1494, when the French first marched through Lombardy on their way to Naples, Florence was right in their path and was also an ally of Naples.
