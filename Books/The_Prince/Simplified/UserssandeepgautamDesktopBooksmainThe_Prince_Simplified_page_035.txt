This character disappeared from British plays in the mid-1600s but still shows up sometimes, like in Rowan Atkinson’s funny show Blackadder. In that show, the character is super scared and adds to the list of bad traits Machiavelli is known for.

A big reason Machiavelli’s book The Prince stayed popular, even though the Pope banned it, was because people linked his name with evil. But there was another reason too.

As old religious ideas and ways of thinking faded, and science and logic slowly grew, Europe faced many different religions and beliefs. So, for any new ruler, the main question became: how can I make people believe I have a real and fair right to be in charge? In England, King Charles Stuart said kings had a divine right to rule, even though many kings had actually taken power by force or trickery. Interestingly, Charles’s opponent Cromwell also believed he had God’s approval, but because of his faith, not family background. Cromwell, who was supposed to support Parliament, often ruled without it because he worried people might not agree with God’s plan.
