The king knew that the people didn’t like or trust the nobles, and he wanted to protect both the nobles and the people. But it was important that the king himself didn’t have to do everything, because if he did, he might get blamed by the nobles for favoring the people or blamed by the people for favoring the nobles. So, he created a group called parliament to keep the nobles in check and protect the people without the king being blamed.

A good example of this happened long ago in Bologna. Annibale Bentivogli, the grandfather of the current Annibale, was the Duke when a group called the Canneschis plotted against him and killed him. His only son, Giovanni, was still a baby at the time. After Annibale’s death, the people got really angry and killed all the Canneschis because the Bentivogli family was very popular. Since there was no one in the family to run the town, the people went to Florence to find someone to help. They found a man who said he was a Bentivogli, but he had been pretending to be the son of a blacksmith. Still, he ruled Bologna until Giovanni was old enough.

This shows that as long as a ruler has the people on their side, they don’t need to worry too much about conspiracies. But if the people hate the ruler, then the ruler has to be very careful and watch every move. Good rulers and strong governments always try not to make the nobles desperate or the people unhappy, because keeping both groups satisfied is one of the ruler’s most important jobs.

Today, France is an example of a well-organized state with good systems that keep the king safe and free to act. The most important part of this is parliament, which helps balance power. Roman emperors had a harder time because they had to deal not only with nobles and people but also with a greedy and cruel army, which made ruling even more difficult.
