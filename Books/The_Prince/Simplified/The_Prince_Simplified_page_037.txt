When a leader has to depend on looking respectable just to seem legitimate, their position is very shaky.

Machiavelli’s small book was a constant threat to this long, fake show of power and respect. It reminded people that power is always up for grabs, always about who can take it by force or trickery, and always the main goal of any ruler. When religious and government leaders tried to criticize The Prince, they focused on Machiavelli’s liking for the cruel Borgia but ignored that Machiavelli also believed a ruler must avoid being hated and put the people’s needs before the rich. Machiavelli thought that since there are so many people, real power lies with them.

Liberal and left-wing thinkers quickly noticed this part of the book. Rousseau thought The Prince was actually a trick: Machiavelli pretended to teach kings how to rule, but really he wanted to teach people how to be free by showing that royal power was just a trick. Spinoza and the Italian poet Ugo Foscolo agreed: The Prince warned about how power really works, aiming to take away the respect and glamour from rulers and show people how to fight back. Machiavelli said he was a republican and a libertarian. Even the communist leader Antonio Gramsci saw The Prince as predicting a future where the working class would take control.
