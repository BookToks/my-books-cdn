A big clue to understanding the text is in the next paragraph. It says: ‘The only thing Borgia can be blamed for is his part in making Julius pope, where he made a bad choice’ (meaning, he picked the wrong person to support for his own benefit).

This shows the tricky part of Machiavelli’s writing: he isn’t saying Borgia’s bad actions shouldn’t be judged. Instead, Machiavelli doesn’t care about the moral side of things, at least not from a Christian view.

For him, it’s about smart or bad decisions, not about right or wrong. When he talks about Borgia as an example, it’s not about being good or bad, but about how Borgia knew how to get power, keep it, and build a strong country.

Also, older translations seem a bit shy. Machiavelli was known for having many girlfriends, and when he wrote The Prince, he expected his readers to be men who didn’t care about being politically correct. When he says ‘fortune is a woman, and if you want to keep her under control, you have to hit and push her,’ he’s making a clear sexual joke.
