This isn’t true for an original text. When we read Chaucer or Shakespeare, we might need help understanding some words, or in Chaucer’s case, a modern version. But we only use these to enjoy the work as it was first written. We feel like the story is fresh and real, almost like we learned a new language quickly with little effort and got a lot out of it.

This is different with an old translation. If we read Pope’s translation of Homer today, we do it because we want to read Pope, not Homer. The language makes us focus more on the style of the 1700s instead of Homer or ancient Greece.

Trying a new translation of Machiavelli doesn’t mean older translations are bad. It just shows that old versions now make us notice the English language of their time. My new version will probably be seen like that one day too. This is a bit annoying with Machiavelli because he said he only cared about style if it helped explain his ideas clearly and simply. He said, “I didn’t make the book fancy or use long sentences or showy words like many writers do. I just wanted it to matter because of its serious topic.”
