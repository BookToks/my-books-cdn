Sure, mercenaries seem happy to be your soldiers when you’re not at war, but when war comes, they run away or just disappear.

It shouldn’t be hard to understand this, since Italy’s current problems happened because they depended on mercenaries for too long. It’s true mercenaries won some battles and looked brave when fighting other mercenaries; but when a real foreign army showed up, some didn’t even have to fight. Charles, King of France, just marked the buildings he wanted to use as places for his soldiers. When Savonarola said we brought this on ourselves because of our sins, he was right—but he wasn’t thinking of the rulers’ sins I’m talking about. Because they were our rulers’ mistakes, they were the ones who suffered.

Now that I’ve explained the states I wanted to talk about and why some were strong or weak, I’ll talk more generally about how states attack and defend themselves. We’ve already said that a ruler’s power must be based on strong foundations; otherwise, he will fall. The main foundations of any state—whether new, old, or newly taken—are good laws and good armies. You can’t have good laws without good armies, and if you have good armies, good laws will follow. I won’t talk more about laws now and will go straight to the army.

The armies a ruler depends on can be his own, mercenaries, auxiliaries, or a mix. Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous. If you rely on mercenaries to protect your state, you will never be stable or safe because mercenaries are greedy, undisciplined, disloyal, and they fight among themselves. They are brave with friends but cowardly with enemies, do not fear God, and don’t keep promises. With mercenaries, the only way to avoid disaster is to delay battle; in peace, they steal from you, and in war, they let the enemy steal from you.

Why is this? Because mercenary commanders may or may not be good leaders. If they are good, you can’t trust them because they want power for themselves, either by attacking you, their employer, or others against your wishes. If they aren’t good leaders, they will ruin you anyway. Some might say it doesn’t matter who leads an army since commanders always act this way, whether mercenaries or not. But the truth is, armies always serve their ruler or republic. A ruler must lead personally and act as commander; a republic must send its own citizens. If the commander is bad, they replace him; if he’s good, they keep him under control with laws that limit his power.

Experience shows that only rulers and republics with their own armies make real progress, while mercenaries only cause problems. A republic with a citizen army is also less likely to be taken over by a coup than one that pays for mercenary armies.

Rome and Sparta stayed armed and free for many centuries.
