The Swiss are really well-armed and totally free. A good example of mercenaries in ancient times is Carthage. After their first war with Rome, the Carthaginians were almost overthrown by their mercenaries, even though these mercenaries were led by Carthaginian citizens. 

After the death of Epaminondas, the Thebans made Philip of Macedonia their army leader. But as soon as he won the war, he took away their freedom. When Filippo Maria Visconti died, the Milanese hired Francesco Sforza to fight against the Venetians. After beating the Venetians at Caravaggio, Sforza joined them to overthrow the Milanese who hired him.

When Francesco’s father was the mercenary commander for Queen Joanna of Naples, he suddenly ran away and left her kingdom unprotected. She had to ask the King of Aragon for help or risk losing her kingdom.

Venice fought well at sea because both nobles and armed commoners were brave. But when they started fighting on land, they stopped using their own forces and hired mercenaries like other Italian states. At first, they didn’t have much land or power, so they didn’t worry about their mercenary leaders. But as they expanded deeper into Italy, they faced problems with these hired soldiers.

Under Carmagnola’s leadership, the Venetians had beaten the Duke of Milan and saw how good he was. But when he lost interest in the war, they knew they couldn’t win anymore. They couldn’t fire him because they might lose what they had already gained, so the only safe choice was to kill him. Later, they hired other mercenary leaders like Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Ruberto da San Severino, and Niccolò Orsini. These commanders were often more likely to lose than win. For example, at the battle of Vailà, the Venetians lost everything they had worked hard to gain over 800 years in just one day.

Francesco Sforza had to fight against Braccio da Montone, and they kept each other in check. Sforza focused on Lombardy while Braccio fought in Rome and Naples. 

But remember what happened not long ago. Florence hired Paolo Vitelli as their military commander. He was a serious man who had worked hard to succeed. 

The truth is that Florence and Venice sometimes increased their land by using mercenaries. These mercenaries didn’t take power but defended their employers. The Florentines were lucky. Some powerful captains were threats, but one didn’t win his war, and others faced strong enemies or lost interest.

John Hawkwood, also called Giovanni Acuto, didn’t win either. Since he lost, we don’t know if he was loyal or not. But if he had won, the Florentines would have been at his mercy.

Mercenaries only bring slow, unsure victories and sudden, confusing defeats. Since Italy has been ruled by mercenaries for many years, we should look at the bigger picture to understand the problem better.

We must remember that for centuries, cities like Rome and Sparta were armed and free.
