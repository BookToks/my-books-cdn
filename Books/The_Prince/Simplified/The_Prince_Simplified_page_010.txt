The result was a small book that caused a big controversy for hundreds of years.

Niccolò Machiavelli was born in Florence in 1469, the same year Lorenzo de’ Medici (called il Magnifico) became powerful. Niccolò was the first son after two daughters. He grew very close to his dad, Bernardo, who used to be a lawyer but didn’t have a steady job. Bernardo knew important people but wasn’t rich or powerful. Niccolò wanted to succeed in life, so he knew he had to rely on his own smarts and charm. His younger brother, Totto, didn’t want to compete and decided to become a priest.

Their mom was very religious and wrote poems and songs about faith.

Their dad, on the other hand, was more doubtful and liked old Latin books more than the Bible.

Niccolò probably got his writing talent from his mom, but when it came to religion, he agreed more with his dad and the Roman historians.

People say Lorenzo il Magnifico “came to power,” but actually Florence was a republic. Since Lorenzo was only twenty in 1469, he was too young to have an official job, so this needs some explaining.

Back in the 1200s, the people of Florence kicked out the noble families who used to run the city. They made a republic with a very idealistic way of governing. Every two months, eight leaders called priori and a prime minister called the gonfaloniere were chosen by picking names from bags. These names were of rich men from different work groups and parts of the city.
