Remember, Machiavelli is dealing with people who say that whether a ruler’s people hate him or not isn’t the main thing to think about when deciding if that leader will stay in power. These people are using examples from some Roman emperors.

Machiavelli will explain that power and politics in the Roman empire were very different from those in a modern state of his time (early 1500s). The big difference was that the Romans had a strong army that a leader had to please first, even before the people. This army was often kept happy by letting it treat the people badly, like stealing and hurting them. This part is getting us ready for Machiavelli’s way of answering the objection: we need to understand the different history and situation.

The word ‘parte’ might mean ‘apart’ or ‘in part,’ as Italian translations say. So, the sentence might mean: To answer these objections, I will look at some of these emperors’ traits, show how the reasons they fell are not different from what I said before, and add some background that historians think is important.

A translator’s note says the original phrase ‘mettere in considerazione’ (put in consideration) is used only once in The Prince. So instead of a normal translation like ‘submit for consideration,’ the translator chose ‘bringing into the argument’ to better show that Machiavelli is telling us he needs to add more context for these examples.
