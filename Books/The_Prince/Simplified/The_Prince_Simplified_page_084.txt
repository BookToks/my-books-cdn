Before Alexander came to power, things were pretty unstable. I want to talk about two men from our own time who got power in very different ways—one by working really hard and being skilled, and the other mostly by luck. These men are Francesco Sforza and Cesare Borgia.

Sforza, who wasn’t born into nobility, became Duke of Milan through smart choices and bravery. After a lot of effort, he kept his power without much trouble. Borgia, also called Duke Valentino, got his lands because of his father’s influence. When his father died, Borgia had the king send troops to help him take over Romagna, which wouldn’t have happened without the king’s support.

Borgia had two big problems if he wanted to keep Romagna and get more land: his own army, which he didn’t fully trust, and French politics. He used the Orsini family’s soldiers but worried they wouldn’t obey him, and he was also worried about the King of France. When Borgia attacked Bologna, his soldiers weren’t very excited. Later, when he moved towards Tuscany, the French king told him to stop, so Borgia decided he wouldn’t trust other armies or powers again.

When Pope Alexander VI made his son a duke, many problems popped up. Borgia couldn’t rule anywhere outside Church lands because other rulers would block him. Giving away Church land wasn’t an option either, since places like Faenza and Rimini were protected by Venice. Plus, many armies in Italy were controlled by families like the Orsini and Colonna, who didn’t trust the pope or Borgia.

To deal with this, Borgia weakened these families by paying their supporters with good jobs and money, making them loyal to him instead. In just a few months, old rivalries were forgotten, and everyone supported the duke. After breaking up the Colonna leaders, Borgia waited for a chance to expand his power.

If a new leader wanted advice on gaining power, looking at Borgia’s actions would be smart. Even though things didn’t always go his way, it wasn’t because he wasn’t talented. Sometimes, luck just didn’t favor him. But he worked hard to keep what he had and build a strong base, something any new ruler should try to do.
