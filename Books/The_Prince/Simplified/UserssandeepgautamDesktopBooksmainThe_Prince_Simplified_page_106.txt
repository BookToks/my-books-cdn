Sure, mercenaries might seem happy to be your soldiers when there’s no war, but when war actually comes, they either run away or just disappear.

It shouldn’t be hard to see this, since Italy’s current problems happened because they relied too much on mercenaries. It’s true mercenaries won some fights and seemed brave when battling other mercenaries; but when a real foreign army showed up, they didn’t even have to fight. Charles, King of France, just marked the buildings he planned to use as places for his troops to stay. When Savonarola said we brought this on ourselves because of our sins, he was right — but he didn’t mean the sins we usually think of, but the ones our rulers made. And because these were our rulers’ mistakes, they were the ones who suffered the most.

Now that I’ve explained the different types of states and why some are strong or weak, I want to talk about how states attack and defend themselves. I’ve already said that a ruler’s power must be based on strong foundations. The main foundations of any state, whether new or old, or one that’s just been taken over, are good laws and good armies. You can’t have good laws without good armies, and if you have good armies, good laws will follow. I won’t talk about laws now, but will focus on the army.

The armies a ruler depends on to protect the state can be made up of his own soldiers, mercenaries, auxiliaries (help from others), or some mix of these. Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous. If you rely on mercenaries to defend your state, you will never be safe or stable. Mercenaries are ambitious, undisciplined, disloyal, and they fight among themselves. They might be brave with their friends but cowardly against enemies. They don’t fear God and don’t keep promises. With mercenaries, the only way to avoid disaster is to delay the battle; in peace, they steal from you, and in war, they let the enemy steal from you. Why? Because they only care about the small salary you pay them, and that’s not enough to make them want to die for you.

An excellent mercenary commander might be good at leading, but you can’t trust him. If he’s good, he will want power for himself, either by attacking you, his boss, or by going against your wishes. If he’s not good, he will ruin you anyway. Some say commanders always act this way, no matter if they are mercenaries or not. My answer is that armies always serve the ruler or the republic. A ruler must lead and command personally, and a republic must send its own citizens. If a republic’s leader turns out to be bad, it must replace him; if he’s good, it must keep him under control with laws. Experience shows that only rulers and republics with their own armies can make serious progress, while mercenaries only bring trouble.

A republic with a citizen army is also less likely to be taken over by a sudden attack than one that pays for mercenaries.
