They are the kind of people who, if one of them wins, you either have to be afraid of him or not.

And Bull says: they are either the kind of people who, if one of them wins, you will be in danger, or they are not.

You can see that Bull’s version sounds more like how we speak today, but no one writing this idea in English now would add “or they are not” right after the “if” part like Machiavelli did. If we keep Bull’s idea but put the alternative at the start – like saying “either they are or they aren’t the kind of people who, if one wins, you will be in danger” – the sentence sounds smoother. 

But the easiest way is to move the choice to the word “fear” instead of describing the two kinds of people. This keeps the meaning the same and makes the sentence more direct, like the original.

So, it becomes: you may or may not have a reason to fear the winner afterward.

Translator’s Note: I really respect both of these older translations and others too.
