As a big fight between two powerful countries in Italy got closer, Machiavelli was put in charge of protecting Florence’s walls. But when the time came, the armies of Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, now ruled by the same king, just ignored Florence. They went straight to Rome and attacked it. The attack was extremely violent, worse than anything Italy had seen in hundreds of years.

After this, the Medici government in Florence fell apart, and Machiavelli lost favor again. Feeling very disappointed and taking medicine that wasn’t good for him, he died in June 1527 at the age of fifty-eight. He probably accepted his death calmly, after thinking it over.

Machiavelli knew that there are many ways to become famous and that a person’s actions can mix with big historical events in surprising ways. He would have found it ironic that because of Luther’s Protestant Reformation and the wars it caused, his name became one of the most hated but also well-known in history.

The important moment for his fame came in 1572. The Prince was not published while Machiavelli was alive.
