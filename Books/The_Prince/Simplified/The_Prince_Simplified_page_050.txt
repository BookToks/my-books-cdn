 One modern Italian translation gives: ‘e in parte indicherò quei fatti che sono important per chi si interessa alla storia di quei tempi.’ Literally: ‘and in part I will indicate those facts that are important for people interested in the history of those times.’ This is now extremely close to our literal translation of Machiavelli’s original but still not particularly helpful.

 Another Italian translation gives: ‘nello stesso tempo indicherò i fatti che devono essere messi in evidenza da chi si interessa alla storia di quei tempi.’ Literally: ‘at the same time I will indicate the facts that must be put in evidence by people interested in the history of those times.’ Despite the fact that ‘parte’ has once again been mysteriously transformed into ‘at the same time’ – a classic filler when a translator is lost – a n idea at last emerges: that there are facts that people interested in those times ‘must put in evidence’, and the implication is that without these facts we won’t understand what has to be understood if we are to be persuaded by the author’s argument.
