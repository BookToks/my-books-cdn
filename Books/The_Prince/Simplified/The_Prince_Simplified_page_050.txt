Why would the reader have thought he was giving examples that didn’t really matter?

One modern Italian translation says: ‘and partly I will point out the facts that are important for people interested in the history of those times.’ This is very close to our literal translation of Machiavelli’s original, but it still doesn’t really help much.

What is the author trying to say? What does this phrase add to what was already said?

Another Italian translation says: ‘at the same time I will point out the facts that must be highlighted by people interested in the history of those times.’ Even though ‘parte’ has again been changed to ‘at the same time’—a common filler when a translator is confused—an idea finally appears: that there are facts people interested in those times really need to focus on. The hint is that without these facts, we won’t understand what needs to be understood to believe the author’s point.

Now the translator tries to understand Machiavelli’s thinking, feeling confident because this author always put sense and clarity above everything else.
