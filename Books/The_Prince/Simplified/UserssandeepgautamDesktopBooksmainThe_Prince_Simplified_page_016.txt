By this time, Lorenzo il Magnifico had been dead for two years, and his son Piero, who was not a good leader, was in charge of the Medici family. Piero gave in to Charles without a fight and even gave up the city’s nearby lands. The people of Florence were so unhappy with him that they rebelled. The Medici family lost power, and soon the preacher who had warned about this disaster became the city’s leader, called gonfaloniere, but this time he was in charge for a whole year instead of just two months.

Girolamo Savonarola ruled Florence from 1494 to 1498. During this time, Florence changed from a place known for Renaissance Humanism to a strict, religious city where people even burned books. The Church in Rome saw Savonarola’s claim that he was God’s prophet as a big threat. They worked hard to bring him down. In 1498, after losing much support, Savonarola was found guilty of heresy and was burned at the stake. After these events, Niccolò Machiavelli got important jobs in Florence, like Secretary of the Second Chancery and Secretary of the Ten of War, which handled foreign relations and war plans.

Machiavelli was only twenty-eight years old. We don’t know how he got such important jobs so young because there is no record of any special experience he had. But within a few months, he was traveling to nearby states to represent Florence. Over the next fourteen years, he worked on important and often long missions to leaders like the King of France, the pope, the Holy Roman Emperor, Cesare Borgia, Caterina Sforza, and many more.
