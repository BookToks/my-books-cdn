During the war against Rome and Naples in 1480, Florence asked the French king to try harder to claim the throne of Naples. In 1482, during a Venetian attack on Ferrara, Florence and Milan encouraged the Turks to increase their attacks on Venice’s sea areas. Venice responded by inviting the Duke of Orleans to claim Milan.

In a war against Naples in 1483, Pope Innocent VIII reminded the Duke of Lorraine that he also had a claim to the southern kingdom and asked him to send troops.

Some of these threats were just bluffs, but in 1494, King Charles VIII of France accepted Milan’s invite and decided to go for the crown of Naples. Charles marched south with a huge army, bigger than anything Italy had seen in a long time. From then on, Italy wouldn’t be free from foreign interference until 1870, when the Risorgimento ended it. The French struggled to keep Naples and invited the Spanish from Sicily to share the kingdom. Later, when Charles I of Spain became Holy Roman Emperor, the Spanish pushed the French back, attacked Rome, and ruled Italy for 150 years.

But that’s jumping ahead. In 1494, when the French first marched through Lombardy towards Naples, Florence was right in their way and was also an ally of Naples.
