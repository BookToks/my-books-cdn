Every town had to send someone to represent them, and he took the chance. He realized too late that the growing power of Borgia and the Church would be their downfall. Because some people hated him for being harsh, the Orsini planned to meet at Magione, near Perugia.

This meeting caused a rebellion in Urbino and uprisings across Romagna, creating many problems for Borgia. But with help from the French, he managed to get through it.  

After getting back his trust, Borgia didn’t want to test the loyalty of the French or anyone else, so he turned to trickery. He was so good at hiding what he really wanted that even the Orsini made peace with him and sent Paulo Orsini to help. Borgia was very kind to Paulo, giving him money, clothes, and horses until the Orsinis finally agreed to an invitation to Senigallia, which put them under Borgia’s control.

After killing the Orsini leaders and making their followers his allies, Borgia built a strong base for his power. He controlled Romagna and the Duchy of Urbino and felt he had the support of the local people who were starting to enjoy some wealth and peace.

When Borgia took over Romagna, he found that weak leaders had been running it badly. They stole from people and caused fights instead of bringing peace. So, he decided the area needed good government to calm things down and make people respect the rules.

He picked Remirro de Orco, a tough and strict man, to be in charge. De Orco quickly brought peace and order, gaining a strong reputation. But Borgia thought such harsh rules might make people angry, so he later set up a court to handle laws more fairly.

Borgia also worried about what would happen after his father, Pope Alexander, died. He feared the new pope might try to take away the lands his father had given him. To stop this, he made four plans: first, get rid of the families of local rulers in his lands so no new pope could bring them back; second, win over the noble families of Rome to block the pope’s actions; third, control the group that would choose the next pope; and fourth, take as much land as possible before his father died, so he could defend it himself.

While his father was sick and weak in Rome, no one took advantage of the situation, and Borgia was careful to prepare for any attacks on his power.
