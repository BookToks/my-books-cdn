I understood the word ‘parte’ to mean ‘in part,’ and to make the sentence flow better, I translated it as ‘some’: the author can’t include all the background, but some of it.

We can’t be sure if this is exactly what Machiavelli meant, but now the sentence makes the passage feel more connected than in other versions.

If we look back at the original word-for-word translation – ‘and part I will put in consideration those things that are important to people who read the events of those times’ – we can see it works the way I chose to translate it.

One big problem a translator faces with The Prince is the book’s reputation. Everyone knows Machiavelli is controversial because he cares more about results than how you get them. He even seems to accept violence, cruelty, and betrayal, which go against Christian and modern Western values. For example, we don’t approve of killing someone brutally just because it stops a riot, and we’re uncomfortable with torture, even if it might stop a terrorist attack.
