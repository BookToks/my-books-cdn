Then, using his own strength and the help of a few people who are angry but can’t fight back because they’ve lost everything, he can easily weaken the stronger neighbors and take control of the area. But if an invader doesn’t handle his new neighbors well, he will quickly lose the land he took. Even if he keeps it for a while, he will face many problems and enemies.

You have to either treat people well or hurt them so badly they can’t fight back. If you hurt them a little, they will fight back; if you hurt them a lot, they won’t be able to. So if you plan to hurt people, make sure you don’t have to worry about their reaction.

If you send an army to take over instead of setting up colonies, it will cost a lot more. All the money from the new land will be spent on defending it, turning what should have been a gain into a loss. You will also make more enemies because an army moving around and taking supplies will hurt everyone living there. These hurt people can fight back, so military bases are as useless as colonies are helpful.

A leader who moves into a new place with a different language and customs must become the leader and protector of the weaker neighbors while trying to weaken the stronger ones. He must make sure no powerful foreign ruler can take control there. The Romans did this when they took over new provinces: they sent settlers, made friends with weaker neighbors without letting them get too strong, and stopped powerful rulers from gaining influence.

For example, in Greece, the Romans made good relations with the Achaeans and Aetolians, stopped Macedonia from growing stronger, and drove out Antiochus. They didn’t give the Achaeans and Aetolians extra land as a reward, because that would have made them stronger. Whenever Philip convinced them to be friendly with him, it made them weaker. Even though Antiochus was strong, he never gained control because the Romans stopped him.

Wise leaders don’t just deal with problems now; they also use everything they have to stop future problems. If you see trouble coming early, you can handle it easily. But if you wait until it’s already happening, it will be too late to fix.

Think about tuberculosis: when it’s just starting, it’s easy to cure but hard to notice. If you don’t catch it early, it gets easier to see but harder to cure. The same happens with political problems. If you see trouble early and act smart, you can fix it fast. If you miss it, by the time it’s big, everyone will want to join the enemy, and it will be too late to do anything.

The Romans always invited local people to support them when they moved into a new area. This is natural because when a strong foreign ruler shows up, weaker local powers usually side with him, either because they’re scared or because they don’t like the stronger neighbors who controlled them before. So the new ruler easily wins their support and takes over the land.

He just has to make sure these new allies don’t become too powerful themselves. Because the Romans could see threats early, they always knew how to respond.
