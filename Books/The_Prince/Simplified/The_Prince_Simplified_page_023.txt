The wild and intense show made people feel both amazed and shocked. When we read about Borgia, it’s clear that Machiavelli’s book changes from a smart but calm study of rulers to a strange and disturbing story called The Prince. 

Machiavelli stops just explaining different types of governments and starts telling a gripping, personal story about a leader who ignores Christian rules and only cares about having power. 

Machiavelli was a diplomat who spent his life around powerful people but never really controlled things himself. He was so honest that when people checked if he stole money, he actually got paid back what he was owed. So, it was easy for him to feel jealous and almost wish he could be like Borgia, who took whatever he wanted and never worried about being honest.

The real shock of The Prince comes from the fact that Machiavelli, like many writers, secretly enjoys describing ruthless people. But unlike others, he organizes this kind of behavior and seems to say it’s the right way to act—at least for those who want to gain and keep political power.
