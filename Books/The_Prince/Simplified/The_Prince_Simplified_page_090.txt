People attack each other because they are scared or hate one another. The cardinals that Borgia had hurt included Giuliano della Rovere, the cardinal of San Pietro in Vincula, Cardinal Colonna, the cardinal of San Giorgio of Savona, and Ascanio Sforza. Almost all the others, except the cardinal of Rouen and the Spanish cardinals, would have been afraid of him if they became pope.

The cardinal of Rouen was very powerful because the King of France supported him. The Spanish cardinals were connected to Borgia and owed him favors. So, the best choice for Borgia, besides luck and his good qualities, was to have a Spanish pope. If that wasnâ€™t possible, he should have let Rouen win the election.

There are two other ways a regular person can become a ruler and take the throne, but Giuliano della Rovere was not one of them. These ways are better explained in books about republics. First, a man can take power by doing something terrible. Second, a private citizen can become a hereditary ruler with the help of other citizens. We will look at two examples of taking power by crime, one from ancient times and one from modern times. These examples are enough to understand how this happens.

Agathocles was from Sicily. He started as a regular person, actually one of the lowest in society, and became King of Syracuse.

He was born the son of a potter and lived a bad life from beginning to end. But even though he was bad, he had smart and strong qualities. He joined the Syracusan army and worked his way up until he became the commander-in-chief. After that, Agathocles wanted to be king, and he was ready to use violence to keep the power he had as commander without owing anything to anyone. He talked about this plan with Hamilcar, a Carthaginian whose army was fighting in Sicily, and they made an agreement.

One morning, Agathocles called a meeting of the people and the Senate as if he had important government business to discuss.
