Why would the reader think he was giving examples that didn’t matter?

One modern Italian translation says: “and partly I will show those facts that are important for people interested in the history of those times.” This is very close to a direct translation of Machiavelli’s original, but it still doesn’t help much.

So, what is the author trying to say? What does this phrase add to what was already said?

Another Italian translation says: “at the same time I will show the facts that must be highlighted by people interested in the history of those times.” Even though “parte” has been changed to “at the same time” — a common way translators fill in when they’re unsure — an idea finally appears: that there are facts people interested in those times *have* to focus on. Without these facts, we won’t understand what we need to if we want to believe the author’s argument.

Here, the translator tries to understand Machiavelli’s thinking, feeling confident because Machiavelli always cared more about making sense and being clear than anything else.
