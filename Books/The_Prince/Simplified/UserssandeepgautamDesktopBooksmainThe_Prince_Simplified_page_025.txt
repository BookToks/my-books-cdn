The book isn’t a strict plan that follows one fixed idea. Instead, Machiavelli quickly looks at different kinds of countries and governments, different situations, and different people with their successes and failures. He finds two things that can’t be easily explained: luck and personality.

By the end of the book, he stops just giving examples of heroes and winners. He knows that one thing a person can’t easily change is their own character. For example, Soderini couldn’t have acted like Borgia, and Borgia couldn’t have acted like Soderini.

Machiavelli is especially interested in how certain personality traits can fit well or badly with different historical situations. Someone might do well in one situation but fail badly in another. A plan that works great at one time can be a total disaster later.

So, instead of one perfect leader, different people are needed for different situations. The only way to always win in politics is to keep changing your instincts to fit new events. But Machiavelli sadly notes that doing this all the time would mean there’s no more luck and no more surprises in history.

While writing The Prince, Machiavelli’s own thoughts were very mixed. This struggle makes the book interesting and sometimes confusing.

On one side, he was honestly trying to understand the truth about power and politics. By figuring out how countries are won and lost, he felt more in control and it made him feel better about himself.
