If all people were good and kept their promises, life would be easier. But since most people aren’t, you don’t have to keep your promises to them if the situation calls for it.

A leader has to be very careful with what they say. They should always act like they are kind, loyal, honest, and caring. It’s really important for a leader to seem religious too because people judge others by how they appear, not always by what they really are.

Most people don’t deal with a leader directly. They only see what the leader wants them to see. Only a few people know the truth, and they usually don’t have the courage to speak up against what most people believe. When people look at a leader, they focus on the results, not how the leader acts behind the scenes. If a leader does what it takes to stay in power, people will respect and praise them for it.

There was a famous example: Pope Alexander VI. He was known for tricking people and breaking promises, but he was very good at it. He always found people to fool and never kept his promises. His success showed how well he understood human nature.

So, a leader doesn’t have to be truly good but must seem good. It’s even better if they actually are good, but they have to be ready to change if their power is at risk. Sometimes a leader has to do things that seem against loyalty, kindness, or religion to stay in control.

In the end, if a leader promises something but the reasons for that promise no longer matter, it’s okay for them to break it without losing power. What matters most is that they know when to change and protect themselves.
