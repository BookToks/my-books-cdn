Savonarola strongly believed in living a poor life. He wanted to burn any books or art that were considered bad and warned that the people of Florence would face disaster because of their sins. In 1494, his warning actually came true.

To understand Machiavelli’s work, The Prince, you need to know about Italy’s complicated politics in the 1400s and early 1500s. Something big changed in the 1490s that affected Italy for the next 350 years.

Back then, there were five main powers in Italy: the Kingdom of Naples, the Papal States, Florence, Venice, and Milan. The Kingdom of Naples was the biggest, stretching from just south of Rome all the way to the bottom of Italy.

Florence was in the middle but was the smallest and weakest, with only shaky access to the sea.

All five were fighting hard to take more land. Venice wanted to grow inside northern Italy and along the Adriatic coast because they had lost many overseas lands to the Turks. Milan, aware of the strong and united France to the north, wanted to expand south and west to balance power. Florence just tried to get bigger in any way it could.
