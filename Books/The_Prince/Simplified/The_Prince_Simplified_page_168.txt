After taking control of Naples, Florence, and Charleston, Naples became the ruler of Perugia in 1495. At this time, other Italian powers were active, including Julius Caesar (around 100–44 BC). After winning battles in Gaul and Britain, Julius Caesar made himself a dictator, starting the change from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire. He was killed by a group of senators, including his friend Marcus Junius Brutus.

The Colonna family was powerful in medieval and Renaissance Rome. They often fought the Bentivogli family in Bologna. The Bentivoglis were supported by Venice and Florence, while the Canneschis, allied with the Viscontis of Milan, opposed them. In 1445, with help from Milan, Battista Canneschi had Annibale Bentivogli murdered. But the people of Bologna turned against the Canneschis and killed Battista, causing the rest of the family to flee.

Roman Emperor Commodus (161–193), son of Marcus Aurelius, rejected his father's simple lifestyle. He focused on pleasure and allowed favorites to rule, but was eventually killed along with his supporters. He was known for fighting in gladiator matches himself. Commodus was strangled by a wrestler named Narcissus.

Alberigo da Barbiano (around 1348–1409) was from Romagna but later became Count of Conio, a small town in the Italian hills near the Riviera. He was the first mercenary leader to insist that his army be made up only of Italians. Francesco Bussone, Count of Carmagnola, was a mercenary leader hired by the Duke of Milan and later the Venetians. After failing to follow up a win in 1427, he was accused of betrayal, arrested, and executed.

Cyrus the Great (around 576–529 BC) founded the Persian Empire, which covered much of Central and Southwest Asia. Darius, the last king of Persia, was murdered by one of his governors.

Charles VII (1403–1461), King of France, was inspired by Joan of Arc. He united France under one ruler and drove the English out of most of their French lands except Calais. He built a strong standing army. Charles VIII (1470–1498) became king after his sister Anne’s regency. Encouraged by the pope and the Duke of Milan, he claimed the throne of Naples and in 1494 led an army of 25,000 men into Italy, causing conflict with many major states.
