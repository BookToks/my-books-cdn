If a country already has a king or queen from the same family for a long time, it’s easier to keep things under control than if the ruler is new. A new king or queen just needs to be smart and adjust their rules when problems come up. If they do this well, they can stay in charge for a long time. Only a really strong enemy can take them away, and even then, they might get their power back if the enemy starts having problems.

When a ruler takes over a new area, they usually upset the people there. First, the army that comes in causes problems, and then there are many unfair things that happen after the invasion. This makes the locals angry at the new ruler, even if some people helped the ruler get power. The ruler can’t give these helpers as much as they expected, and can’t be too harsh because they still need the locals’ support to keep control.

A good example is the Duchy of Ferrara in Italy. In 1484 and 1510, it was taken over for a short time by outside forces, first by the Venetians and then by Pope Julius. But these takeovers didn’t last because Ferrara already had a strong ruling family. When a ruler inherits power from their family, they don’t have to upset people as much as a new ruler, so people usually like them better. If the ruler is careful and doesn’t make people hate them, most will want them to stay.

When a family has ruled for many years, people forget old reasons for wanting change. But when a new ruler comes in, people remember why they don’t like change and are more likely to rebel. For example, Louis XII, King of France, took over Milan but lost it quickly. The local people who helped him realized they weren’t getting what they hoped for and didn’t want to accept the strict rules and taxes. So, the old ruler was able to take the city back.
