When taken out of context, the ideas in The Prince were made simple and clear, making readers think they really understood Machiavelli. But actually, they got a twisted version that approved of any kind of cruelty and loved cold, selfish planning.

After that, Machiavelli’s name went from being known only by smart people to becoming a popular insult. People called him names like ‘Mach Evil’ and ‘Match-a villain’ in English, and ‘Mitchell Wylie’ in Scotland. Many critics didn't even read his original work. Instead, they learned about him from Gentillet, who wrote a book called ‘Anti-Machiavel.’ This book was quickly translated into Latin for English readers, and about twenty years later, it was translated straight into English. At the end of the 1500s, there still wasn’t an English version of Machiavelli’s original work.

Ironically, after the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, when Catherine de’ Medici was trying to solve France’s civil wars and convince Catholics to accept the Huguenots in their own areas, both she and Machiavelli were attacked again. This time, the Catholic side accused them of ignoring important religious truths just to keep peace. The Catholics were afraid this would eventually turn France into a country that didn’t care about religion.
