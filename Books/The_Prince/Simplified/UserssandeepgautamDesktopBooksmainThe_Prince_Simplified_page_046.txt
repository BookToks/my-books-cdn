A leader will be respected when he is a true friend to some and a real enemy to others. This means he clearly chooses a side and stands against the other. This way of acting always works better than staying neutral.

For example, if you have two strong neighbors who start fighting, you might or might not be afraid of the winner afterward. But no matter what, it’s better to pick a side and fight hard. If you are afraid but stay neutral, the winner will still take you over, and the loser will be happy about it. You won’t have any good reasons or protection, and you won’t be able to hide.

This is because a winner doesn’t want friends who only sort of support him during a crisis. And the loser will ignore you because you didn’t choose to fight with him and share what happens to him.
