Men like our Italian commanders knew that if you didn’t use your soldiers well or just let them go, things would go wrong. So, they cut up their auxiliaries into smaller groups and only fought with their own soldiers.

If you want to find a situation where you can’t win, don’t choose auxiliaries. They are even more dangerous than mercenaries. Auxiliaries stick together tightly and always obey their own leaders. Mercenaries take time to get organized before attacking because they’re not a united group. Also, since you pay mercenaries, the leader you pick needs time to make them follow orders. The big problem with mercenaries is that they can’t decide quickly, but auxiliaries are too determined.

Good rulers have always tried to avoid using auxiliaries and mercenaries. They prefer to rely on their own soldiers and would rather lose with their own men than win with others. Winning with foreign troops isn’t a real victory.

Cesare Borgia is a good example. He invaded Romagna with only French auxiliaries and took Imola and Forlì with them. But he didn’t really trust them. When he hired the Orsini and Vitelli armies but found them disloyal and slow in battle, he killed them and trained his own soldiers. You can see the difference in his power depending on which soldiers he used.

Charles VII, Louis XI’s father, pushed the English out of France and realized a ruler needs his own troops. He set up a standing army of cavalry and infantry. Later, his son Louis hired Swiss mercenaries to strengthen the infantry. This was a mistake. Since France had no infantry of their own, they depended on the Swiss. The French started to think they couldn’t win without them. So, French forces became a mix of mercenaries and their own men. This kind of mixed army is better than just auxiliaries or mercenaries but still worse than having only your own soldiers. France’s problems show this clearly. If they had kept their standing army strong, they would be unbeatable. But people often choose easy options without seeing the hidden dangers.

I wanted to talk about Italian examples, but I also have to mention Hiero of Syracuse. When he was in charge of the Syracusan armies, he quickly saw that mercenaries didn’t work well. Later, when Constantinople brought 10,000 Turks into Greece, the mercenaries wouldn’t leave after the war, and that’s how the Turks started taking control of Greece.
