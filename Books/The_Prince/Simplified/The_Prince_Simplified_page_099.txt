A strong leader stays calm when things get tough. He plans ahead and leads in a way that makes people feel positive. If the people trust him, they won’t want to see him fail, and time will prove how solid his rule really is.

A man who becomes king with the support of the people has to keep their trust. This is easier when the people only want to be free and treated fairly. If a king takes power without the people’s support, he has to rely on rich nobles and officials to help him. This makes him weaker because those people might not always be loyal.

When people are treated well, even if they once didn’t like the ruler, they’ll become loyal and support him more than before. But if the ruler depends on others to give orders, he can’t act quickly when problems happen. The people won’t just start following him right away in a crisis, so he will struggle to find loyal helpers.

A ruler must have the people on his side because when things are good, citizens need their government, and when things are bad, the government needs the citizens. If the people don’t support him, he has no way out.

For example, Nabis, a Spartan king, was attacked by many enemies but still defended his country because he had the people’s support. If the people had turned against him, he would have lost easily. So, a smart ruler makes sure his citizens always need both him and his government, no matter how good or bad things are. Then, they will stay loyal.

This idea works if the ruler builds his power with the people, not just relying on private support or expecting people to help him only when he is in trouble. Leaders who don’t do this often end up being abandoned, like the Gracchi brothers in Rome and Giorgio Scali in Florence.

But when a king truly builds his rule on the people, he has a much stronger chance of staying in power.
