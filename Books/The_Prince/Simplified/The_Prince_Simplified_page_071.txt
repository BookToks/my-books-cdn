People think Louis could have kept his power if he hadn’t rushed into war when trouble was coming. They knew in Italy that if he followed certain rules, the problems couldn’t be avoided forever, but in the long run, things would work out and protect his friends. Instead, many of his enemies were stronger and scarier, like Philip and Antiochus in Greece. So Louis and his allies in Italy had no choice but to pick sides. They could have delayed both wars, but they didn’t.

When Louis got to Milan, he did the opposite of what he should have done. Instead of protecting himself, he helped Pope Alexander attack Romagna. He didn’t realize this made things worse for him because he lost his friends and the support of people who had come to him for help. At the same time, he made the pope more powerful by giving him more land and influence.

After that first mistake, Louis got even more involved. To stop the pope from taking over Tuscany, Louis had to go further into Italy. The real reason Louis got involved was because Venice wanted to take half of Lombardy, and Louis wanted the other half. He made a deal to split the land with the King of Spain. Before this, Louis was the strongest in Italy, but this deal gave someone else power too, so people who didn’t like Louis now had another option.

Louis could have kept Naples under a king who was loyal to him, but instead he kicked that king out and brought in a stronger one who then pushed him out. This hurt Louis’s power.

Wanting more land is normal, and if someone has the chance, they usually go for it. But if they don’t have the resources and still try, then they’re to blame if things go wrong. If Louis could have taken Naples with his own army, he should have done it. If he couldn’t, he shouldn’t have shared the land with another king.
