With his dad’s help, Borgia was building a new state for himself on the northern edges of the Papal States and had just taken over the city of Urbino, which is east of Florence. Machiavelli was sent to stop Borgia from moving into Florentine land, but he was really impressed by him. Borgia was charming, determined, smart, and ruthless—a true leader. He was very different from Machiavelli’s unsure boss, Soderini.

In January 1503, Machiavelli went to see Borgia again. Borgia invited a group of rebels to talks in the town of Senigallia by the coast, but as soon as they came inside the town walls, he had them captured and killed. Machiavelli saw that Borgia was someone who grabbed control of situations without hesitation. It wasn’t just that Borgia ignored Christian rules, but that he quickly understood what was going on, figured out the best move, and acted fast to get what he wanted. This practical way of thinking—where action is more important than just ideas—is a big part of The Prince.

Meanwhile, Florence kept losing its way. Machiavelli was there again in 1503, this time in Rome, when Borgia’s power fell apart after he and his dad got very sick. People say Pope Alexander accidentally poisoned them both. The pope died, and Borgia lost his power.
