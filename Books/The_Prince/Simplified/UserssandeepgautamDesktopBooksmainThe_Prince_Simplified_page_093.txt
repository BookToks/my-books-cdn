After the senators and richest men in town were killed, Agathocles felt that working with others was beneath him. He decided to make himself King of Syracuse and took control without anyone stopping him. Although the town’s citizens fought back twice, they preferred their city to be ruled by the Carthaginians. Agathocles not only managed to defend his town but also led an attack on Africa after leaving some men behind to resist the siege. The siege was lifted, and the Carthaginians were pushed to the edge of defeat. They agreed to let Agathocles keep Sicily while they kept Africa.

Agathocles wrote a letter to Giovanni Fogliani saying that after so many years he was eager to come home, visit the town, and check on his property. Since he’d been working hard just for the respect his position gave him, he wanted to ride into town with a hundred friends and servants to show everyone he hadn’t wasted his time. He asked his uncle to organize a special welcome that would honor both him and his uncle, who had raised him.

Giovanni wanted to make his nephew proud. After the people of Fermo gave Agathocles a formal welcome, Oliverotto was invited into Giovanni’s house. A few days later, Oliverotto secretly planned a crime and threw a big party, inviting Giovanni Fogliani and the town’s top leaders. After the meal and entertainment, Oliverotto suddenly said they should talk in private and led Giovanni and the others to another room. Then, his soldiers jumped out and killed them all.

After the massacre, Oliverotto rode around the town and trapped the chief magistrate in the palace, forcing people to obey him. Oliverotto grew up with his uncle Giovanni, who hoped that joining the army would help him gain power. Oliverotto was smart and strong, and after the death of his first commander, he served under his uncle’s brother, Vitellozzo. 

Looking at Agathocles’ life, it’s clear he didn’t get lucky or have helpers when he took power. He worked his way up by surviving tough challenges. He made hard decisions to keep his power. But his violence and cruelty mean he isn’t admired like other great leaders. Oliverotto is similar—he used crime and betrayal to get what he wanted. So, you can’t say Agathocles succeeded because of luck or good qualities. Instead, he was tough, risky, and determined, but also ruthless and cruel.
