When a king takes over new land, his old and new lands will soon become one.

But when a king tries to get back land that has rebelled, he is less likely to lose it again. He learns from the rebellion and becomes stricter with troublemakers. He watches for spies and makes his defenses stronger. Holding onto new land in these situations takes a lot of luck and hard work.

The best way to keep control is for the new ruler to live there. This makes the land safer and more stable. For example, the Turkish sultan lived in Greece to keep control. When a ruler is there in person, they can spot problems early and stop rebellions before they get big. If the ruler is far away, they only hear about problems when it’s too late. Also, the new ruler living there means their officials won’t steal from the land. People will be happier because they can talk to the ruler directly. This makes them more likely to obey or at least be afraid to rebel. Anyone planning an attack will think twice if the ruler lives there. So if you go and live in the new land, you will probably keep it.

Another smart idea is to set up colonies in one or two places. These colonies act like chains that hold the new land to your kingdom. If you don’t do this, you will need many soldiers to guard the land all the time. Colonies don’t cost much. You can send people to live there cheaply, and only a few locals will be unhappy because they lose their homes and land. Since this is a small part of the population, and many will leave, they won’t cause much trouble. Everyone else won’t be affected and will be scared to rebel because they might lose their own homes.

In short, colonies are cheap, more loyal, and cause less anger among the people. They help the ruler keep power and control.
