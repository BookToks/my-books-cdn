Just like artists who want to draw landscapes go down into the valley to study the mountains and go up to the mountains to look down on the valley, a prince needs to understand the people and the different kinds of states he wants to rule.

Your Highness, please accept this small gift with good intentions. Study it carefully, and you will see that I truly want you to become as great as your position and qualities promise.

If, from your high position, you ever look down on those far below, you will realize how unfair and unkind life often is.

All governments that have ruled people have been either republics or monarchies. Monarchies can be hereditary, meaning the ruler’s family has been in charge for generations, or new.

New monarchies can be completely new, like when Francesco Sforza took over Milan, or they can be lands added to an existing kingdom by conquest, like when the King of Spain took Naples.

A new territory won by conquest might be used to being ruled by a monarch or might be used to governing itself. It could be taken by the ruler’s own army, by another army, by luck, or because they deserved it.
