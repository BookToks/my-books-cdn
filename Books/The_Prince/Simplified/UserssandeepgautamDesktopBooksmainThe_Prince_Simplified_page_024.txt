The author wrote in a letter to a friend about how he felt when he was writing the book. It shows that during the months right after he was fired, locked up, and tortured, it was a big relief to imagine himself back in the world of politics. Even if it was only on paper, he felt like he was as important as the great heroes from history.

In the evening, he walks home and goes into his study. There, he takes off his dirty, muddy clothes and puts on fancy palace clothes. When he is dressed up, he feels like he is in the courts of the past, where ancient leaders welcome him kindly. He enjoys the only kind of “food” that really belongs to him and that he was meant for. He feels comfortable talking to these leaders and asking why they did what they did, and they answer him generously. For four hours at a time, he feels no pain, forgets all his worries, isn’t scared of being poor, and isn’t afraid of dying. He completely puts himself in their minds.

The Prince is still a strong explanation of how political power is gained and lost because it focuses on the mind. More exactly, it looks at how one person’s thoughts and the shared thoughts of groups work together. Group thoughts are somewhat predictable, but individual thoughts are always different. When these two mix, they can be very unpredictable and dangerous.
