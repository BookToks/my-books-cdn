Some people had a more old-fashioned opinion: Bertrand Russell called The Prince "a handbook for gangsters." He was just repeating what Frederick the Great said when he wrote a book to argue against Machiavelli and show a more hopeful idea of how kings should rule.  

Others, like Jakob Burckhardt and Friedrich Meinecke, saw things differently. They thought Machiavelli’s new idea was to show leadership and building a nation as creative acts. They believed these should be judged not by what’s right or wrong, but by how impressive or powerful they look. This idea was kind of like what Nietzsche later said, that a strong leader makes himself and his government like a work of art.  

Mussolini just took the book exactly as it was. He loved it and called it a handy guide for politicians.  

No matter how you understand Machiavelli’s message, one thing is clear: The Prince never makes people feel indifferent. When you read it, you can’t help but think about the uncomfortable idea that politics might not follow the same moral rules we try to live by every day. And after you finish the book, it’s really hard to think about leaders the same way you did before.
