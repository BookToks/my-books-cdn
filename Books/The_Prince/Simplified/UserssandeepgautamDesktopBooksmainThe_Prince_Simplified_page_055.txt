The phrase is from the last paragraph of The Prince (the final part is quite different), and Machiavelli wanted to end with a strong and clever statement.

Here is Marriot’s version of the whole last paragraph: I think that since fortune changes but people stay the same, men do well when both match up, but fail when they don’t. I believe it’s better to be bold than careful because fortune is like a woman, and if you want to control her, you have to be forceful. She lets brave people control her more than those who are careful. She’s like a woman who loves young men because they are less careful, more forceful, and more daring.

And here is Bull’s version: I think that since fortune changes but men are stubborn, people succeed when fortune and their plans match, and fail when they clash. I believe it’s better to be impulsive than cautious because fortune is like a woman, and if you want her to obey, you have to push her around.
