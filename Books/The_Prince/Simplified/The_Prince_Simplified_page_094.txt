If you don’t do everything you need to at the start, like setting up a government with Oliverotto as the leader because you were badly advised or didn’t have the courage, then you’ll always have to keep using force. You’ll never be able to trust your people because if you use violence all the time, they won’t trust you back.

So, you should get the violence over with as quickly as possible. That way, people won’t have to live with it for long and they’ll be less angry. On the other hand, favors should be given slowly, one at a time, so people can really appreciate them.

Most importantly, a leader should have a relationship with their people where nothing that happens, good or bad, makes them change how they act. If tough times come, your cruelty might be too late, and any kindness you show will seem forced and won’t impress anyone.

You might wonder how people like Agathocles, who were cruel and betrayed others, could stay in power for years and defend themselves against enemies while others couldn’t hold on to power even in peace. It’s all about whether cruelty is used well or badly.

Cruelty used well is quick and only as much as needed to secure your position, then stops. You don’t keep being cruel but use the power you gained to help your people. Cruelty used badly means you’re not harsh enough at the start but get crueler over time instead of easing off. Leaders who use cruelty well can improve their position with their people and even with God; those who don’t have no chance.

When you take control of a state, you need to figure out how much violence is needed and get it done all at once so you don’t have to keep being cruel all the time. Once the violence stops, your people will feel safer, and then you can win them over with kindness.
