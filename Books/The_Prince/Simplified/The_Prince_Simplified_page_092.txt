Agathocles became King of Syracuse after a big massacre. He felt that working with others was beneath him and wanted to take full control. He gained support from some Carthaginians and then actually fought off a siege. Even though the people of the town had defeated him twice before, he managed to defend the city with help from Vitellozzo. He left some men behind to keep fighting and led the rest out of Syracuse to attack Africa.

The siege was lifted, and the Carthaginians were pushed back. They made a deal to keep Africa while Agathocles kept Sicily. He wrote to Giovanni Fogliani, saying that after so many years he was excited to come home, visit the town, and check on his property. Since he felt he had worked hard without getting anything but respect, he wanted to ride into town in style with a hundred friends and servants so people would see he hadn’t wasted his time. He also asked his uncle to arrange a big welcome that would honor both him and his uncle, who had raised him.

Giovanni worked hard to make his nephew proud. After the people of Fermo gave Agathocles a formal reception, Oliverotto was invited to stay at Giovanni’s house. A few days later, Oliverotto secretly planned a crime and threw a fancy party, inviting Giovanni Fogliani and other top leaders. After the party, Oliverotto started talking about the power of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare Borgia. Then, suddenly, he said they should continue the talk somewhere more private. As everyone followed him, Oliverotto’s soldiers jumped out and killed them all.

After the massacre, Oliverotto rode around the town and surrounded the main government leader. At the right moment, his soldiers attacked and killed everyone. Oliverotto was a strong and smart man who rose to the top quickly. But even though people like Agathocles and Oliverotto got power through tough and risky choices, their cruelty and crimes mean they aren’t admired for who they really were.
