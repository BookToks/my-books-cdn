In 1474, a treaty said the person himself was responsible for the murder. His short time as ruler was spent gaining the right to raise troops in Switzerland. But he stayed mostly in the east, where military losses weakened his power, and in the end, he was defeated by supporters of the 14-year-old Heliogabalus, the grandson of Caracalla’s aunt, Julia Maesa.

Louis XII (1462–1515) was King of France from 1498 to 1515. Originally Duke of Orleans, he took over after his cousin Charles VIII died in 1498. He quickly made a deal with Pope Alexander VI that let him divorce his first wife and marry Charles’s widow. This added Brittany to the French crown.

The House of Orleans had claims to Milan and Naples. Louis made an agreement with Venice to split Milan’s land and took the town in 1499. The Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, came back in 1500 but was pushed out again. Louis then made a deal with Spain to divide Naples and took the town for France in 1501. But the Spanish and French disagreed, and in 1503 the Spanish beat the French at Garliano.

In 1508, Louis joined the Holy Roman Empire, England, the Papal States, Florence, and Spain in the League of Cambrai, an aggressive alliance against Venice. Louis led the army and won a big victory at Agnadello in 1509. But after this, Rome and France became rivals. In 1510, Pope Julius II, along with England, Spain, Switzerland, and the Holy Roman Empire, formed the Holy League to push France out of Italy. France lost and Switzerland became independent in 1499.

Maximilian (1459–1519) was the Habsburg ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. He wanted to bring the empire’s many lands together under one government. He also wanted to take back the empire’s power in Italy and lead a Christian crusade against Islam. His domestic changes worked okay, but his foreign policies were confusing and weak, causing him to lose Switzerland.

In 1495, Maximilian joined the League of Venice to try to kick the French out of Italy but didn’t get much from it. In 1496, the Duke of Milan (who was his wife’s uncle) asked him to send an army to stop a French attack, but France didn’t attack. Maximilian then tried to help Pisa fight Florence, but the army failed to save the town. In 1507, he tried to take land from Venice but didn’t make much progress.

In 1512, Maximilian joined the Holy League to push the French out of Italy. When Francis I took Milan back for France in 1515, Maximilian tried again to stop France from taking more land but failed.
