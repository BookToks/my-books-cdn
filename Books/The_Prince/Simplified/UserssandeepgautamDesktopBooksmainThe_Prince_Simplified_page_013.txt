Savonarola strongly believed in living a simple, poor life. He wanted to burn any book or artwork that was seen as bad or sinful. He also warned the people of Florence that they would face disaster because of their sins, predicting a foreign invasion. In 1494, his prediction actually happened.

To understand Machiavelliâ€™s work, The Prince, you need to know about the complex politics of Italy during the 1400s and early 1500s. Something big changed in the 1490s that affected Italy for the next 350 years.

During most of the 1400s, five main powers controlled Italy: the Kingdom of Naples, the Papal States, Florence, Venice, and Milan. The Kingdom of Naples was the largest, stretching from just south of Rome to the very bottom of Italy.

Florence was in the middle but was the smallest and weakest, with limited access to the sea.

All five were fighting hard to take more land. Venice, having lost many overseas territories to the Turks, wanted to expand in northern Italy and along the Adriatic coast. Milan, worried about the powerful, united France to the north, aimed to gain land to the south and west. Florence just tried to grow bigger whenever it could.
