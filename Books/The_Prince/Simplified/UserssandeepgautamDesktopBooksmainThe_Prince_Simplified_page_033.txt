Machiavelli showed some dangerous ideas in his writing, which revealed a side of Renaissance Humanism that many people found unacceptable. Because of this, he became known for this negative image.

People still argue about how much the bad guy called “Machiavellian” in Elizabethan and Jacobean plays, by writers like Kyd, Marlowe, Middleton, Shakespeare, and Ben Jonson, came from Gentillet’s book ‘Anti-Machiavel’ or from the plays’ direct knowledge of Machiavelli’s work. In the 1580s, an Italian copy of The Prince was printed in England. It avoided being banned by lying on the cover, saying it was printed in Italy. Many educated English people then could read Italian well.

Sir Francis Bacon had definitely read The Prince before it was legally published in English in 1640. He even defended Machiavelli in his book Advancement of Learning (1605), saying: “We owe a lot to Machiavelli and others who write about what people actually do, not just what they should do.” But the idea of a “murderous Machiavellian,” who is mentioned over 400 times in Elizabethan drama and became the symbol of a villain for centuries, is a different story.

Long ago, the Roman writer Seneca started a tradition in tragic plays about an evil, sneaky ruler who would do anything to get all the power.
