Even though it might sound weird, sometimes I have to translate the word ‘virtù’ as ‘positive qualities’ or ‘strength of character.’ But, of course, there are times when Machiavelli really means ‘virtues’ in the moral sense. When that happens, he usually talks about how important it is to pretend to have them, even if you don’t. Pretending, when done smartly for the right reason, is actually another important kind of virtù. The idea of a spin doctor wasn’t something made up in the 1990s.

Connected to these problems with the words prince and virtue is a bigger issue: many of the key words Machiavelli uses have English relatives because of Latin – like virtù, audace, circospetto, malignità, diligente, and others.

Sometimes these words are true relatives – like prudente/prudent – but even then, using the English word can make the writing feel old-fashioned and boring. Aren’t words like ‘careful,’ ‘cautious,’ or ‘considered’ used more often now than ‘prudent’?

The same problem happens when there isn’t an English word that matches an old Italian word exactly, but there is a traditional dictionary version for it. Machiavelli often uses the word ‘savio,’ which usually gets translated as ‘wise.’ But again, this can make the English sound a bit stiff and old-fashioned, like how old great books are often translated. Sometimes ‘sensible’ or ‘shrewd’ work better, depending on the situation, because they fit the meaning well and make the writing sound more natural.
