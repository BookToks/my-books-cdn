Some people saw The Prince in an old-fashioned way. Bertrand Russell called it ‘a handbook for gangsters,’ which just repeated what Frederick the Great said when he wrote a book to argue against Machiavelli and share a more hopeful idea of how kings should rule.

Other thinkers, like Jakob Burckhardt and Friedrich Meinecke, didn’t fully hate or love it. They thought Machiavelli’s new idea was to show that leading a country is like creating art. Instead of judging leaders by right or wrong, we should look at their leadership like we look at art, which was an idea that came before Nietzsche’s view of powerful, inspiring leaders.

Mussolini simply accepted the book as it was. He thought it was a great guide for politicians and really liked it.

No matter how we understand Machiavelli’s ideas, one thing is clear: The Prince never makes people feel indifferent. When you read it, you can’t ignore the uncomfortable idea that politics might not follow the same moral rules we try to live by every day. And no matter how you feel about this, after finishing the book, it’s hard to think about leaders the same way again.
