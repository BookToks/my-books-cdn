A person who wins doesn’t want friends who might not help them when things get tough. And a person who loses won’t accept you because you didn’t choose to fight alongside them.

The second idea comes from George Bull, who wrote this in 1961.

A leader gains respect by being a true friend or a true enemy, meaning they clearly choose a side without holding back. This is better than staying neutral. For example, if the countries around you start fighting, either one of them winning will put you in danger, or it won’t.

In both cases, it’s better for you to pick a side and fight hard. If you don’t, and the winner is dangerous to you, you’ll be helpless and at the mercy of whoever wins. The winner doesn’t want friends who didn’t help during the fight, and the loser will reject you because you didn’t stand with them and fight.
