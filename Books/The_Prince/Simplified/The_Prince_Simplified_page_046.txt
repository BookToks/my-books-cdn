A leader will be respected when he is a true friend or a true enemy, meaning he clearly supports one side and opposes the other. This way of acting works better than staying neutral. 

For example, if you have two strong neighbors who start fighting, you might or might not be scared of the winner later. But it’s always better to pick a side and fight hard. If you are scared but don’t choose a side, the winner will still take over your land, and the loser will be happy about it. You won’t have any good reasons or help to protect yourself.

A winner doesn’t want friends who only help a little during a crisis. And the loser won’t trust you because you didn’t fight with them and share their problems.  

A tricky part here is when Machiavelli says about these neighbors: either you should be afraid of the winner or not, depending on their qualities.
