Three years later, Machiavelli was travelling with the future Pope Julius, who led the pope’s army. Julius wanted to enter the town of Perugia, so he went in with only a small group of guards and told the local ruler, Giampaolo Baglioni, to leave or be defeated. Machiavelli thought Baglioni would just kill Julius, but he was shocked when Baglioni gave up and ran away. The pope was so powerful that he then marched north to attack Bologna, forcing Florence to join a war it didn’t want to fight.

As Secretary of the Ten of War, Machiavelli had one moment of success in 1509. The citizen army he had helped create finally beat the Pisans and captured their town after a long siege. This win proved Machiavelli right because many attempts with hired soldiers had failed before. It was also the only time in fourteen years that Soderini, a leader, actually made a winning move.

But everything else got worse. Florence was barely holding on, and its freedom depended on others. Three years after taking Pisa, Pope Julius teamed up with the Spanish and defeated the French at Ravenna. Then he sent an army to Florence to bring back the Medici family and turn the city into a puppet controlled by Rome. After a short fight, the Florentine army was crushed at Prato, just a few miles from the city.
