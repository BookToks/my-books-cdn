If a monarchy is new, it often faces big problems. People don’t like to be ruled by someone they don’t know or trust. But if a monarchy has been around for a long time, where the ruler’s family has been in charge for generations, it’s much easier to keep control. The people are used to that family being in charge, so they’re less likely to rebel.

A good monarch just needs to change their policies when things go wrong and try not to upset the order set by their ancestors. If the ruler is okay at their job, they can usually stay in power for a long time. It takes a huge force to kick a monarch out, and even then, the ruler might come back if the people who took over run into problems.

When a ruler takes over new land, it’s normal for people there to be upset at first. They don’t like the new army or the unfair things that happen after an invasion. So, not only do you make enemies of those whose lives you disrupt, but you also lose the trust of the people who helped you take power because you can’t give them as much as they expected. You also can’t be too harsh on them because you still need their support to control the new area.

For example, in Italy, the Duchy of Ferrara was taken over twice—once by Venice and once by Pope Julius—in 1484 and 1510. These foreign powers didn’t keep control because Ferrara had a strong ruling family. A ruler who inherits power has less reason to upset the people and is usually better liked. If the ruler doesn’t do things to make people hate him, they’ll probably want him to stay.

When a ruling family lasts for many generations, people forget old reasons for change, and the country stays more stable. But if there’s trouble, it can lead to more problems later.

Louis XII of France took Milan quickly but lost it just as fast. The first time, Duke Ludovico was able to take it back because the people who opened the gates to Louis regretted it. They realized they didn’t get what they hoped for and didn’t want to deal with the harsh rules and taxes Louis’s rule brought.
