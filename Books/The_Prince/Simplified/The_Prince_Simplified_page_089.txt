By the time his Baglionis, Vitellis, and Orsinis showed up, no one went over to their side. When his father died, he had already reached three out of his four goals. Although Borgia couldn’t choose who would be the new pope, he was in a position to stop anyone he didn’t want from getting that job.

He had killed all the local rulers he could and hardly anyone had escaped. He had won over the Roman nobility and had a lot of influence over the Electoral College. He wanted to be the master of all Tuscany, having already taken Perugia and Piombino and protected Pisa.

As soon as France’s control got weaker—actually, it already had since the Kingdom of Naples was lost to Spain—the French and Spanish needed Borgia's support. He planned to grab Pisa, and soon Lucca and Siena would surrender because they were afraid and had old rivalries with Florence, which couldn’t defend itself.

If Borgia had done all this (and he was almost there the year his father died), he would have gained so much power and respect that he could have handled any attack by himself. He wouldn’t have needed anyone else’s armies or help.

But Alexander died just five years after he first started fighting. Borgia had only really taken control in Romagna; all his other lands were still unstable. He was stuck between two powerful, hostile armies and was very sick.

Borgia was so ruthless and skilled that he knew he had to either win over people or destroy them. He built strong power quickly, but if he hadn’t had those two armies threatening him or if he hadn’t been so sick, he could have overcome every obstacle.

The strong foundations Borgia built were clear when Romagna stayed loyal for over eight years.

One problem with Borgia was his part in choosing Pope Julius. He couldn’t pick the pope he wanted, but he had enough power to block the candidates he didn’t like. Still, he should never have let a cardinal who could hurt him or who, as pope, would fear him, win the election.
