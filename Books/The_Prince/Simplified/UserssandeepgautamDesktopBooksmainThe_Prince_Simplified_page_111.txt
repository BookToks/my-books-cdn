Many big cities fought against local nobles who needed the emperor’s help to keep their armies and control them. The Church supported the rebels to grow its own power by having citizen armies. In many towns, private citizens took over as rulers. Because much of Italy was now controlled by the Church and republics—people who didn’t have war experience—leaders started hiring soldiers from outside. The first successful mercenary leader was Alberigo da Conio from Romagna. Auxiliary armies—meaning when you ask a powerful ruler to send help to protect your town—were also not very useful.

Francesco Sforza and others became important players in Italy’s future. A recent example is Pope Julius during his campaign in Ferrara. After seeing how badly his mercenaries did in battle, he made a deal with Ferdinand, King of Spain, to bring his forces to help. Auxiliaries can be helpful when fighting for their own goals, but they usually cause problems for the people who ask them for help. If the mercenaries lose, you lose too, and if they win, you’re stuck depending on them.

Mercenaries tried to act like cavalry was more important than infantry. They couldn’t feed many foot soldiers, and small groups didn’t look strong enough, so they focused on cavalry and took care of fewer soldiers. For example, an army of 20,000 might have less than 2,000 infantry. Also, mercenaries avoided hard work and danger—they didn’t fight each other to death but took prisoners instead. They wouldn’t attack at night, leave their forts to fight, or build defenses around their camps. In winter, they didn’t camp outside at all. These habits became normal because mercenaries wanted to stay safe and avoid hard work.

This caused Italy to become weak and humiliated. Pope Julius II’s choice to fully trust a foreign army just to take Ferrara was very risky. But he got lucky. When his Spanish helpers lost at Ravenna, the Swiss suddenly showed up and surprisingly beat the French, saving the pope from being a prisoner. The Florentines, who had no armies, hired 10,000 French soldiers to attack Pisa, which actually put them in more danger than before.

To fight his neighbors, the emperor of Constantinople brought 10,000 Turks into Greece, and when the war ended, the Turks didn’t leave. This is how outsiders started taking control of Greece. The mercenaries, led by foreigners who didn’t believe in the local religion, were no good for the Syracusan armies either.
