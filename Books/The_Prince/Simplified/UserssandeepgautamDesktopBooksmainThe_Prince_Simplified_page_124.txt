Of course, when dealing with complaints and not getting scared, there are always reasons to take people’s stuff and not just for no reason. A ruler should handle things calmly and carefully. A leader who lives like this will never run out of good excuses for grabbing more. But reasons for punishing someone happen less often and don’t last long.

These thoughts make us ask: is it better to be loved or feared? The answer is that most people want both, but since that’s hard to do, it’s much safer to be feared than loved. Most people are ungrateful and unreliable—they lie, cheat, want money, and run away when things get tough. When you’re safe and on their side, they’d do anything for you, but when you need them, they disappear.

A ruler who only trusts promises and no other plans will lose. Love that costs something, not just people liking you, might be real, but you can’t count on it when you really need it. People are less worried about hurting someone who loves them than someone who scares them. Fear is about being scared of punishment, and people don’t forget that.

One great example is Hannibal. He led a huge, mixed army far from home, and his soldiers never rebelled or argued with him, whether they won or lost. This was because Hannibal was really tough, and his soldiers respected and feared him. If he hadn’t been strict, they wouldn’t have stayed loyal. Historians praise his success but also criticize how cruel he was, although the cruelty was what kept his army together.

To see that Hannibal’s other qualities weren’t enough alone, we can look at Scipio. He was a rare leader in history, but he was too easy-going and gave his soldiers too much freedom, which hurt discipline. His army even rebelled in Spain. Some people said he spoiled the Roman army. When his soldiers looted a town, he didn’t punish them because he was too kind, and some people said that was a mistake.

Still, a leader who wants to be feared shouldn’t make people hate him. Being feared can work without being hated if the ruler doesn’t take people’s stuff or harm their families. If someone must be executed, it should only happen for a clear, fair reason. Above all, a ruler shouldn’t steal from his people. People will forget their father’s death faster than they’ll forget losing their inheritance.

Even so, a leader must be careful before trusting too much.
