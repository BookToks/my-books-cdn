Let me give you an example from recent times. Bishop Luca Rainaldi, who is close to Emperor Maximilian, said that the emperor never listened to anyone's advice and never got his plans done. This happened because the emperor did the opposite of what I suggested.

The emperor kept his plans secret and didn’t ask for advice. But when he started acting on his ideas, his ministers told him he was wrong. He changed his mind too easily, so one day he would do something and the next day undo it. No one understood what he wanted or could plan for his decisions.

A ruler should always ask for advice, but only when he wants it, not when others want to give it. He should stop people from giving advice if he didn’t ask for it. But when an adviser tells the truth, the ruler should listen carefully. If someone is scared to speak up, the ruler should show that he’s upset about that.

Many people think a ruler is smart because his advisers are good. But that’s wrong. A leader who isn’t smart can’t get good advice, unless he trusts just one very clever minister. But if he does that, the minister might take over the whole government. If the ruler listens to many advisers, he will hear very different opinions and get confused. Each adviser thinks about their own interests, so the ruler won’t really understand what’s going on.

For example, the king of Macedonia, not Alexander’s dad but the Philip beaten by Titus Quintius, didn’t have the same resources as the Romans and Greeks who fought him. But because he was a good military leader and knew how to keep the people and nobles happy, he held on for many years. Even though he lost some towns in the end, he kept his kingdom for a long time.
