Albinus, from Lugdunum (now Lyons), either killed himself or was killed. Colleone was known for being loyal and never switching sides or trying to play one side against another. He is famous because there is a statue of him on his horse made by Andrea Verocchio in Venice.

Alexander the Great (356–323 BC) was the King of Macedonia (336–323 BC). He conquered Greece, Persia, and a large part of Asia.

Marcus Aurelius Alexander Severus (208–235) was a Roman emperor from 222 to 235. He was adopted by the emperor Heliogabalus, who was also his cousin. Alexander became Bishop of Pamplona at fifteen and a cardinal at eighteen but was eventually killed by his own soldiers.

Cesare Borgia (c.1475–1507) was the illegitimate son of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, who later became Pope Alexander VI. In 1497, after his older brother Giovanni was murdered, Cesare became the main person in his father’s plans to expand their territory. People suspected Cesare of killing Giovanni, but nothing was proven.

Rodrigo Borgia (1431–1503), born in Valencia with the Spanish last name Borja, later changed to Borgia in Italy, was elected pope in 1492. He openly admitted to having up to eight illegitimate children and tried to get them important jobs. The most famous were Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia. Rodrigo was known as one of the most corrupt Renaissance popes. Many thought he poisoned people, but there’s no clear proof that his sudden illness and death in 1503 were caused by poison.

In 1498, Cesare worked with King Louis XII of France to help end the king’s marriage so he could marry Charles VIII’s widow. This made the pope and Louis allies in trying to take Naples. Cesare was the first person to quit being a cardinal, and Louis made him Duke of Valentinois, so he was called Duke Valentino.

With Louis’s help, Cesare tried to take over Romagna, capturing many towns like Fano, Pesaro, Rimini, and more. In 1501, the pope made him Duke of Romagna. Cesare led French troops in the siege of Naples in 1501 and kept taking towns in the area. He even hired Leonardo da Vinci as his military engineer. When some mercenary leaders rebelled, Cesare tricked them into coming to Senigallia and then had them arrested and executed.

After his father died in 1503, Cesare lost control of Romagna, was captured, and sent to Spain, where he died while serving his brother-in-law, King John III of Navarre.

The Baglioni family ruled Perugia, a town between Florence and Rome, during the 1400s and 1500s.

Giovanni Bentivoglio (1438–1508) was the son of Annibale, ruler of Bologna, who was killed in 1445 when Giovanni was a child. Giovanni became ruler in 1462 but was forced to flee when Pope Julius II attacked Bologna in 1506.

Bartolomeo Colleone (c.1395–1475) was a mercenary leader who worked for Venice and fought many battles for and against most of the major Italian states.

Andrea Braccio da Montone (1368–1424) was another successful mercenary commander who led many campaigns in Italy.
