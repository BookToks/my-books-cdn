Then, with his own strength and the small support he has, he can easily weaken the stronger neighbors and take control of the area. But if an invader doesn’t handle the people around him well, he will lose the land he took. Even while holding onto it, he will face many problems and enemies.

You have to either treat people well or destroy them completely. If you only hurt them a little, they’ll fight back; if you hurt them badly, they won’t be able to. So if you plan to harm people, make sure they can’t fight back. If you choose to send an army instead of setting up colonies, it will cost a lot. All the money made from the new land will be spent on defending it, turning a gain into a loss.

Sending an army also causes more problems because soldiers moving around and taking food and shelter will upset everyone. This will make all the people enemies, and these enemies can fight back since they’re still on their own land. So, no matter how you look at it, soldiers in a new place are as useless as colonies can be helpful.

A leader who moves into a new place with a different language and customs must become the leader and protector of the weaker neighbors, while also trying to weaken the stronger ones. He must make sure no powerful foreign ruler can enter and take control. People unhappy with the new ruler will invite outside powers to help them, just like the Aetolians did when they asked the Romans to come into Greece.

The Romans followed these rules when they took new land: they sent settlers, made friends with weaker neighbors without letting them get too powerful, and stopped strong rulers outside the area from gaining control. They worked with local groups to keep peace and prevent anyone from becoming too strong. They never let powerful outsiders have influence in the region.

Wise rulers don’t just deal with current problems; they use every chance to stop future problems before they start. If you see trouble coming early, you can fix it easily. If you wait until it’s too late, the damage can’t be fixed.

Think about tuberculosis, a disease doctors talk about: early on, it’s easy to cure but hard to notice. If you don’t catch it early, it gets easier to see but harder to cure. The same goes for problems in ruling. Notice problems early and fix them fast. If you wait until they’re big, everyone will side against you and it will be too late to do anything.

When a strong ruler moves into a new place, the weaker local groups will support him, mostly because they don’t like the stronger neighbors who used to control them. So the new ruler will have no trouble getting their support. He just has to make sure they don’t try to take too much power for themselves.
