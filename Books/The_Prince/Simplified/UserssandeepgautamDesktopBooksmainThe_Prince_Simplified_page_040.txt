I used that statement as my guide while translating. I tried to remove old-fashioned words and weird expressions from older English versions. My goal was to get the real meaning of the original and give it to you clearly, like we do today (though maybe not in the future).

It’s not easy. The first problem, which causes all the others, is in the title: The Prince. What does Machiavelli mean by “prince”? Well, a duke is a prince. The pope is a prince. A Roman emperor is a prince. The King of France is a prince. The Lord of Imola is a prince.

This doesn’t work in modern English. The English have Prince Charles. The thing about Prince Charles is that he isn’t King Charles and probably never will be. Even if he became king, he wouldn’t have real power—not even the kind of power the pope has. And we never think of the pope as a king or prince.

The only other idea we have of “the prince” in English is Prince Charming. This idea is very different from the aging Prince Charles and even more different from the kind of prince Machiavelli meant. Machiavelli’s word “prince” doesn’t mean “the son of the king,” or “a good-looking young guy.” Machiavelli’s “principe” means men in power, men who rule a state.
