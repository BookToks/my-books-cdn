This was a really tough problem that caused many emperors to fail because Pertinax tried to force honesty and high standards on them. This made people hate him. It was hard to please both the people and the army at the same time. Also, Pertinax was old and disliked, so he was soon overthrown.

People wanted a quiet life and liked leaders who kept things low-key. But soldiers liked leaders who were bold and had military plans. They wanted the emperor to be tough so they could earn more money and act on their own greed. 

Because of this, emperors who didn’t have strong leadership or political skills couldn’t control both the soldiers and the people. This usually ended badly. When emperors saw how hard it was to keep everyone happy, most chose to please the army and ignored the people’s needs.

Alexander was a good man. During his fourteen years as emperor, he never had anyone killed without a trial. But even though many praised him, people didn’t like him much. They thought he was weak and said he let his mother run things. Because of this, the army turned against him and killed him.

Emperors had to avoid being hated by the groups that had the most power, like the army. New emperors often sided with the army instead of the people to stay in power, and this worked as long as they kept the soldiers happy.

Looking at emperors like Commodus, Severus, Antoninus Caracalla, and Maximinus, we see they were very cruel and greedy. They did terrible things to keep the army on their side. But Severus was different. He was strong and could be harsh to the people but still kept the army loyal. His leadership was successful because the soldiers respected him.

Even though Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander were kind and fair, only Marcus avoided a sad ending and kept respect when he died. That’s because he became emperor by family right, not by winning over soldiers or people. 

Severus had many good qualities and managed to keep both the people and army under control. No one hated or despised him. But Pertinax became emperor against the army’s wishes, and the army killed him.

Severus was smart. When he saw that the emperor Julian was weak, he convinced the army in Slavonia to march on Rome and take revenge for Pertinax, who had been killed by the Praetorian Guard.
