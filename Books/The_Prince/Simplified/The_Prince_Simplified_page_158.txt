Here’s what I think: just go for it. When a careful person finally has to act, it’s better to be quick and bold than slow and cautious. Luck is like a woman—she likes it when you’re bold. If you’re too careful, you’ll mess up. If you want to stay in control, you have to be confident and take action.

People who change their style to fit the times and situation get luck on their side. You’ll see that luck is more likely to favor those who are bold than those who just wait around. Luck doesn’t like people who act cold and distant. And since luck is like a woman, she prefers men who are young and daring because they’re wilder and more exciting when they take charge.

Take Pope Julius II as an example. He always acted fast and lived in a time when being impulsive worked well for him. Think about how he took over Bologna while the old ruler Giovanni Bentivoglio was still alive.

At that time, the Venetians didn’t like the idea, and neither did the King of Spain. Julius was still trying to work things out with the French. But even so, he rushed ahead and led the attack himself. This surprised the Venetians and the Spanish. The Venetians were scared, and the Spanish were waiting to get the Kingdom of Naples back. Meanwhile, the King of France joined Julius because he needed Rome as an ally to stop the Venetians. Once Julius made his move, the King of France couldn’t refuse to help without looking weak.

Because Julius acted so quickly, he achieved more than any other pope with all the planning in the world could have done. If he had waited to sort everything out and make all the deals first, the plan would have failed.

The King of France would have found reasons not to help, and the Venetians and Spanish would have kept warning him to stop. I won’t even talk about Julius’s other campaigns, which were all similar and successful. He died young, so he never had to face failure. If times had changed and being careful was needed, he would have been done for. He would never have changed because acting fast was just who he was.

So, to finish: luck changes, but men keep going no matter what.

When someone is used to always winning with a certain style, it’s hard to get them to change. If their way suits the times, they succeed; if it doesn’t, they don’t.
