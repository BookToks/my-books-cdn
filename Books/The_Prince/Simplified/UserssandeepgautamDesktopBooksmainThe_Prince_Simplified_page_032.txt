Here, the criticism gets closer to what Machiavelli really meant. During the Renaissance, people started thinking less about religious and spiritual questions and more about practical everyday problems. Usually, though, people still said that religion was the most important thing, and they didn’t suggest that different sets of values might completely clash. They thought it was possible to be a good Christian and a good political leader at the same time.

But Machiavelli thought differently. He said that Christian values and being a successful political leader didn’t always go together. Sometimes, you had to choose between them. His critics said he didn’t care about ethics at all, but that wasn’t true. He believed that things like the strength, unity, and independence of a country were worth fighting for. In a letter, he even said, “I love my country more than my soul.” 

Still, Machiavelli knew that these goals couldn’t always be reached while following Christian values. The two sets of values were often in conflict. What made it harder was that Machiavelli didn’t seem worried about this problem. He thought it was obvious that Christian values were good, but they didn’t always work for politicians in every situation. Believing that all human actions could be judged by one set of values was unrealistic and too idealistic.
