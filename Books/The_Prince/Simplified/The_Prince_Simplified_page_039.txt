This isn’t true for an original text. When we read Chaucer or Shakespeare, we might need some help, like a glossary or a modern version for Chaucer. But we only use these so we can enjoy the work as it was first written. We feel like it’s fresh and real, almost like we learned a new language quickly and easily.

But this is different with an old translation. If we read Pope’s translation of Homer today, we do it because we want to read Pope, not Homer. The language makes us focus more on the 18th century than on Homer or ancient Greece.

Trying a new translation of Machiavelli doesn’t mean the old ones were bad. It just means that older versions now show us how English has changed over time. My own translation will probably be seen that way in the future, too. This is a problem with Machiavelli, who said he only cared about style if it helped get his message across clearly without extra stuff. He said, “I didn’t make the book fancy or full of long sentences or big words. I didn’t want it to be liked for anything but the important and serious ideas it talks about.”
