So, when you think about it, if the ruler is smart, it won’t be too hard to keep people strong during a siege, as long as they have food to eat and weapons to defend themselves.

The last type of state we need to talk about is the Church state.

In this case, all the problems a ruler usually faces happen before they take power. While you need skill or luck to take control of a state like this, once you have it, you can keep it without needing either.

Church states are supported by old religious institutions that are so strong and well-established that their rulers stay in power no matter what they do or how they live. Only Church leaders have states they don’t have to defend and people they don’t have to govern. Even if they don’t protect their states, no one takes them away. Even if they don’t rule their people, the people don’t rebel or try to change rulers, and they probably couldn’t even if they wanted to. So, this is the only kind of government that is safe and easy.

But since Church states depend on things beyond human understanding, I won’t say much more about them. God made them and keeps them going, and it would be bold and rude for an ordinary person to talk about them. Still, if someone asked me how the Church got so much power recently—going from a time before Pope Alexander when even the smallest rulers in Italy didn’t care about the Church’s worldly power, to a time when a pope can scare the King of France, kick him out of Italy, and defeat the Venetians—I think it would be good to explain the facts clearly, even if most people already know them.
