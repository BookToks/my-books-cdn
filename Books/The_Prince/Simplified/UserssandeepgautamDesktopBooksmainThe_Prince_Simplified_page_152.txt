Let me give you a modern example. Bishop Luca Rainaldi, a man close to Emperor Maximilian, said the emperor never listened to advice and never got anything done. This happened because the emperor did the opposite of what I suggested.

The emperor kept his plans secret and didn’t ask for advice. But when he started acting on his ideas, his ministers told him he was wrong. He often changed his mind quickly. Because of this, no one knew what he really wanted or planned, and no one could prepare for his decisions.

A ruler should always take advice, but only when he wants it, not when others want to give it. He should stop people from giving advice if he didn’t ask for it. But if an adviser speaks honestly, the ruler should listen carefully. If someone is quiet because they’re scared, the ruler should show he’s upset about that.

Many people think a ruler seems smart because of the good advice from ministers, not because he is smart himself. But they’re wrong. A leader who isn’t smart can’t get good advice, unless he puts all power in the hands of one very smart minister. But then that minister might try to take over. If the ruler listens to many advisers, he’ll hear different opinions and won’t know what to do. Each adviser cares about their own interests, and the ruler won’t be able to understand what’s really going on. It’s not about avoiding flattery or listening to everyone's opinions too much—people will always try to trick you, and you’ll lose their respect.
