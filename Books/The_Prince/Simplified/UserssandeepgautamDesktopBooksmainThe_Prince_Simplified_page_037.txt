When a leader has to depend on looking respectable just to seem legitimate, they are in a really risky position.

Machiavelli’s little book was always a threat to this long show of fancy ceremonies and fake respect. It reminded people that power is always up for grabs, always about what can be taken by force or trickery, and no matter what rulers say, power is their main concern. When religious and government leaders tried to criticize The Prince, they focused on Machiavelli’s praise for the ruthless Borgia but ignored his real point: a ruler should avoid being hated by the people and must care more about the people than the rich nobles. Machiavelli believed that because there are so many people, real power belongs to them in the end.

Liberal and left-wing thinkers quickly noticed this side of the book. Rousseau thought The Prince was actually a trick: Machiavelli pretended to teach kings how to rule but really wanted to show people that royal power was just a fake act. Spinoza and later the Italian poet Ugo Foscolo agreed: The Prince was a warning about how power really works, meant to take away the respect and glamour of those in power and teach regular people how to fight back. Machiavelli even called himself a republican and a supporter of freedom. The communist leader Antonio Gramsci saw The Prince as predicting the rule of the working class.
