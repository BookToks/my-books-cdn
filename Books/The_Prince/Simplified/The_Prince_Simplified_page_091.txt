People attack each other because of fear or hate. The cardinals Borgia had wronged included Giuliano della Rovere, the cardinal of San Pietro, Cardinal Colonna, the cardinal of San Giorgio of Savona, and Ascanio Sforza. All the others, except the cardinal of Rouen and the Spanish cardinals, would have been scared of him if they became pope.

The cardinal of Rouen was very powerful because the King of France supported him, and the Spanish cardinals were connected to Borgia and owed him favors. So, the best choice for Borgia, besides being lucky and having good qualities, was to have a Spanish pope. If that didn’t happen, he should have supported Rouen.

There are two other ways a regular person can become a ruler and take the throne, but not Giuliano della Rovere. These ways belong more in a book about republics. One is when a man takes power by doing something terrible, and the other is when a private citizen becomes a hereditary ruler with the help of his fellow citizens.

We will talk about two examples of gaining power by crime, one from ancient times and one from modern times. We won’t go deeper because these examples are enough for anyone who has to follow this path.

Agathocles was from Sicily. He started as a regular citizen, actually one of the lowest. He became King of Syracuse.

He was born the son of a potter and lived a bad life, but he was smart and strong. He joined the Syracusan army, worked his way up, and became the commander-in-chief. When he was in charge, Agathocles wanted to be king. He was ready to use any violence needed to keep the power he had as commander, without owing anything to anyone.

He talked about his plans with Hamilcar, a Carthaginian whose army was fighting in Sicily, and they made a deal.

One morning, Agathocles called a meeting of the people and the Senate, pretending he had important state business to discuss.

At a secret signal, his soldiers attacked and killed all the people he wanted to get rid of.
