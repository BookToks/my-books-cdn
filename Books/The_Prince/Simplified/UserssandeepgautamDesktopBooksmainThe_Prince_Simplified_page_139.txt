But he didn’t last long. Two things made people hate and despise him. First, he came from a very low background—he had been a shepherd in Thrace, and everyone knew it, thinking it was shameful. Second, after becoming emperor, he refused to go to Rome for the formal ceremony and became known for being super cruel by ordering terrible acts all over the empire.

Everyone hated him because of his low birth and scary behavior. He faced rebellions first in Africa, then in the Senate. The Senate rebellion was supported by all the people of Rome. Then the whole of Italy joined against him, and they were even laying siege to a city called Aquileia. People got fed up with his cruelty, realized how many enemies he had, and finally his own army killed him.

Let’s get back to what we were talking about. Anyone thinking about this will see that hatred and contempt caused these Roman emperors to fall. Some behaved one way, some another, but there were both successes and failures in both groups. Since they took power instead of inheriting it, it was risky and stupid for Pertinax and Alexander to try to copy Marcus Aurelius, who inherited his job. Also, since they didn’t have the right qualities, it was a huge mistake for Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to copy Severus.

If a man takes power and starts a new monarchy, he can’t act like Marcus Aurelius. But that doesn’t mean he has to act like Severus either. What he should learn from Severus is how to create a state, and from Marcus Aurelius the policies that keep it stable and great once it’s set up.

The reason Roman emperors had to focus on pleasing the army before the people is because the army was stronger. Today, it’s more important for leaders (except Turkish and Egyptian sultans) to put the people first because the people are more powerful now.

I made an exception for the Turkish leader because he has a big army of 12,000 infantry and 15,000 cavalry right with him. Since his power depends on them, he has to keep them happy above everything else. Egypt is similar—it’s like the pope’s state, not exactly a monarchy or a normal kingdom. When a leader dies there, they don’t pass power to their children but elect a new leader. The old institutions are already set up, so new leaders don’t face the usual problems that new rulers usually have.

But if you don’t have your own army, you’ll have to hire mercenaries, and they come with their own problems that I talked about earlier.
