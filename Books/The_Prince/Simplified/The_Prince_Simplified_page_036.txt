Meanwhile, all across Europe, princes and princesses from old noble families kept marrying each other again and again. They did this to create strong alliances, hoping that having close family ties would protect them from people trying to take their power or from ideas like democracy and republics.

The Medici family was the best at this kind of high-class dating. Thanks to their many connections, they stayed in control of Florence for over 200 boring years. At the same time, in cities like Paris, Madrid, and Naples, royal clothes got fancier, statues and monuments became more showy, and royal events became more colorful and serious. They did this to make people believe that kings and dukes really deserved to rule. Many famous works of art were made to support this idea.

Most of all, Europe’s rulers worked hard to seem holy and religious. They wanted to protect their power by showing they were faithful, hoping this would distract people from wondering why they had special privileges. Later, especially after the French Revolution showed that kings didn’t have a real right to rule, rulers tried to look respectable. For example, after taking power, Napoleon told his court members to go to fancy parties with their wives to seem respectable and avoid rumors.
