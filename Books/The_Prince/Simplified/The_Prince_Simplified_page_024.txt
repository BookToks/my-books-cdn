The author, in a letter to a friend, explains how writing the book helped him feel better after he was fired, locked up, and tortured. Imagining himself back in the world of politics, even just on paper, made him feel like he was as important as the great heroes from history.

Every evening, he goes home and into his study. On the way, he changes out of his dirty, muddy clothes and puts on his fancy palace outfits. Once dressed, he joins the courts of the past, where the old rulers welcome him warmly. He feels at home there, eating the only kind of "food" he truly loves and was meant for.

He talks easily with these ancient leaders, asking why they did what they did, and they answer him kindly. For four hours at a time, he forgets all pain and worries, doesn’t fear being poor, and isn’t scared of dying. He fully puts himself in their minds.

The Prince stays convincing about how political power is gained and lost because it looks closely at how people think. It focuses on how individual minds and group feelings work together — groups are somewhat predictable, but individuals can be very different. When these two mix, things can become very unstable and dangerous.
