Monarchy with public support

A man who becomes king with the support of regular people usually holds power alone, and almost everyone around him listens to him. Also, you can’t fairly give the nobles everything they want without hurting others, but you can do that with the people. This is because the people want something better—they want to be free from being bossed around. Nobles, on the other hand, often want to control and oppress the people.

Now, let's look at another situation. A private citizen can become king in his own country not by doing something illegal or violent, but because the people support him. This is called a monarchy with public support. To become this kind of king, you don’t have to be super smart or super lucky—just clever in the right way.

To take control of this kind of state, you need support from either the common people or the rich nobles. In every city, there are two groups: the common people who don’t want to be controlled and are often treated badly by noble families, and the nobles who want to boss people around. These two groups have different goals, and that can lead to three situations: a monarchy, a republic, or chaos.

A monarchy can happen when either the people or the nobles find it useful. The rich families, seeing they can’t control the people, might make one of their own king to get what they want through him. The people, realizing they can’t beat the nobles, might make one citizen king to protect them. A king who gets power with help from the nobles has a harder time keeping it than one who gets support from the people. That’s because nobles see themselves as equals and don’t like just taking orders. A king backed by the people is surrounded by supporters who are loyal and easier to lead.
