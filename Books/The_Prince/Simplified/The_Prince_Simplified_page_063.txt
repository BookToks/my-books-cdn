Just like artists who want to draw landscapes have to go down into the valley to study the mountains and climb up the mountains to look down on the valley, a prince must really understand the people and the kinds of states he rules over to be a good leader.

Your Highness, please accept this small gift with the good intentions I have. If you study it carefully, you will see that I truly want you to become as great as your position and abilities promise.

From the high place you hold, if you ever look down on those below you, you will notice how unfair and harsh life can be for many people.

All governments that have ever ruled people have been either republics or monarchies. Monarchies can be hereditary, meaning the ruler’s family has been in charge for generations, or they can be new.

New monarchies happen when a ruler takes control of a place for the first time, like when Francesco Sforza took over Milan. Sometimes, a ruler adds new lands to their old kingdom by conquering them, like the King of Spain taking Naples.

These new lands might be used to having a king or might be used to governing themselves. They could be taken over by the ruler’s own army or by someone else’s, either by luck or because they deserved it.

I won’t talk about republics here since I’ve already written about them. When a monarchy is new, ruling is always harder.
