People who want freedom will always come together and fight for it, inspired by their old traditions and history. It doesn’t matter how long they’ve been controlled or how kind their rulers have been; they will never forget their desire for freedom. If the people haven’t been completely broken and made to forget their rights and traditions, they will rise up to fight for them as soon as they get a chance, just like the Pisans did after being ruled by Florence for a hundred years.

But if people have been used to having a ruler and that ruler and their family are gone, they won’t know how to pick a new leader or live freely without one. So, they will be slower to rebel and easier to be controlled by an invader. Republics, however, are different. They have more energy, more anger, and a stronger desire for revenge. They remember their old freedoms and won’t rest until they get them back. In these cases, the only options for the new ruler are to destroy the place completely or live there and keep control personally.

When talking about new governments where both the ruler and the system are new, it’s not surprising that I use the most famous examples. People almost always copy others when they try to succeed, but you can never exactly follow someone else’s path or match their skills. So, it’s smart to follow a trail left by someone really great, even if you aren’t as good as them. It’s like an archer who knows his bow can’t shoot very far, so he aims higher than usual, not because he wants the arrow to go that high, but because it will come down on the target from above.

To start, when a new ruler takes over a state, how easy or hard it is for them to keep power depends on their abilities or mistakes. You can’t just become a ruler out of nowhere without either talent or good luck, so one of these will help with many problems. Those who didn’t rely too much on luck usually stayed in power longer. Another good thing is that if the ruler doesn’t already have another state, they have to live in the new place and manage it themselves.

The biggest challenges come from the fact that to set up their government and keep it safe, new rulers need to be strong and smart. Some of the most famous leaders who did this well were Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, and Theseus.
