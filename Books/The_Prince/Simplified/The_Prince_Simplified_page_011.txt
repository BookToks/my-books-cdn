This lottery system was supposed to make sure that every important job and area of the city was fairly and always represented. Every person with a certain social status could expect to have some power for a short time so no one could keep it forever.

But the system didn’t work. Every two months, a new government might change its mind about important issues.

Because of this, the family in charge had to step in and keep things steady. Starting in 1434, the Medici family—first Cosimo, then Piero, then Lorenzo—controlled the election process so most of the people chosen for government would support them. So, even though the people of Florence liked to say they were free and didn’t answer to anyone, by the mid-1400s they were basically living under a dictatorship.

When the rival Pazzi family tried to kill Lorenzo in the church in April 1478, it was because they had no real way to treat him like a normal citizen. Machiavelli grew up in a place where how things really worked was very different from how people said they worked. He was almost nine years old when the caught Pazzi conspirators, including an archbishop, were hung upside down from the windows of the city’s main government building and left there to rot for weeks. He would have learned early on how dangerous politics could be if you made a mistake.
