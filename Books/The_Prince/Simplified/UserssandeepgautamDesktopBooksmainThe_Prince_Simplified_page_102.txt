So, when you think about it, if the ruler is smart, it won’t be too hard to keep people united during a siege, as long as they have food to eat and weapons to defend themselves.

Now, the last type of state we need to talk about is the Church state.

In this case, all the hard problems a ruler usually faces happen before they take power. Because while you need skill or luck to take control of a Church state, once you have it, you don’t need either to keep it.

Church states are supported by old religious institutions that are so strong and well-established that their rulers stay in power no matter what they do or how they live. Only Church leaders have states without needing to defend them and subjects without needing to rule them. Even when they don’t defend their states, no one takes them away; even when they don’t govern their people, the people don’t rebel. They don’t think about changing their ruler and wouldn’t be able to anyway. So this is the only kind of government that is safe and easy.

But because Church states depend on forces beyond what humans can understand, I won’t say more about them. God made them and keeps them going, and it would be rude and foolish for an ordinary person to talk about them.

Still, if someone asked me how the Church has gotten so much power in recent times—going from a time before Pope Alexander when even the smallest rulers in Italy didn’t care about the Church’s power, to now when a pope can scare the King of France and kick him out of Italy and defeat the Venetians—I think it would be worth explaining the facts clearly, even if people already know them.
