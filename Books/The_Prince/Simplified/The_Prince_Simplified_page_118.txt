I’m sure we’d all agree it would be great if a ruler had all the good qualities and none of the bad ones. But since it’s impossible to have all those qualities all the time, a ruler must be careful to avoid the kind of mistakes that could make him lose his power.

For mistakes that won’t cost him his position, he should try to avoid them if he can, but if he can’t, he shouldn’t worry too much. Also, he shouldn’t be too bothered by a bad reputation if it helps him keep power.

If you think about it, there will always be things that seem right but actually lead a ruler to fail, and things that seem wrong but bring success and safety.

Many writers have imagined perfect republics and kingdoms that don’t match real life. There’s a big difference between how people actually live and how they should live. If someone refuses to act like others and only tries to do what’s right, they’re setting themselves up for disaster and should forget about staying safe.

So, if a ruler wants to survive, he’ll have to stop being good sometimes, at least when it’s necessary.

Putting aside ideas about perfect rulers and looking at reality, we see that all people, especially leaders who are seen by everyone, get judged for their qualities. One person is called generous, another stingy; one is seen as kind, another greedy; one cruel, another nice; one untrustworthy, another loyal.

Some are seen as weak and scared, others brave; some thoughtful, others arrogant; some unfaithful, others loyal; some honest, others sneaky; some stubborn, others easy-going; some serious, others shallow; some religious, others not.

These are the kinds of things people praise or blame rulers for.
