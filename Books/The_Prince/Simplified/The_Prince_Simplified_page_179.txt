His passionate preaching in 197 BC, which kept him inside Macedonia, was against all kinds of corruption in the Church. He wanted the Church to follow the Bible closely, which eventually got him kicked out by Alexander VI. When he lost support in Florence, he was arrested, tortured, and burned alive in the town square.

Philopoemen (253–183 BC) was a Greek statesman and general who led the Achaean army many times.

Pyrrhus (318–272 BC) was the King of Epirus and a very successful military leader. He was a big threat to the Romans in southern Italy and Sicily, where he also fought the Carthaginians. His expensive win at the Battle of Asculum in 279 BC gave us the phrase "Pyrrhic victory."

Giorgio Scali was one of the leaders of the Ciompi (wool-workers) rebellion in Florence in 1378. He tried to stop officials from punishing a friend, but he was arrested and beheaded in 1382.

Romulus was the legendary founder and first king of Rome.

Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (around 234–183 BC) was a Roman general and leader best known for defeating Hannibal at the Battle of Zama in 201 BC. This big win gave him the name Africanus. He was accused of taking bribes from enemies, so he left Rome to live on the coast of Campania.

Georges d’Amboise (1460–1510) was a cardinal and later Archbishop of Rouen. He advised the Duke of Orleans, who became King Louis XII of France. Louis made d’Amboise prime minister and convinced Alexander VI to make him a cardinal to help bring peace between the two.

Lucius Septimius Severus (146–211) was a Roman emperor known for making the Roman government more military-focused. After holding military roles under earlier emperors, he took power in 193 by leading his army to Rome.

Girolamo Savonarola (1452–1498) was born in Ferrara. He studied philosophy and medicine before becoming a Dominican friar. He first preached in Florence between 1482 and 1487 but was mostly ignored until Lorenzo de’ Medici called him back to lead the monastery of San Marco in 1490. He gave many sermons against corruption and warned of doom and foreign invasion. When Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494 and the Medici fled, his preaching seemed right, and he became head of Florence’s government.

Ascanio Sforza (1455–1505) was the fifth child of Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan. He was made a cardinal in 1484 and tried many times to become pope but failed. He worked as a spy for Milan in Rome but was lowered in rank by Alexander VI when Milan helped the French invade Italy in 1494. Later, he was arrested by the French and imprisoned for three years before Georges d’Amboise, Archbishop of Rouen and advisor to Louis XII, convinced the king to free him, hoping Ascanio would support his bid for pope.

Pope Sixtus IV (Francesco della Rovere, 1414–1484) was elected pope in 1471.
