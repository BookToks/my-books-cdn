We are not talking about those fancy, complicated sentences that sound very elegant and were copied a lot by English writers in the past. Machiavelli’s style is more like how people actually speak. It’s flexible, convincing, and sometimes a bit rough. To make his tone work in English, you have to change the order of words in the sentences from the original Italian.

Here, to help you understand what to expect, I’m showing three versions of the same paragraph. The last one is my own. I didn’t pick anything really hard; it’s a pretty normal passage where Machiavelli describes a situation, then thinks about what might happen if you respond in different ways.

The first translation is by W. K. Marriot and was published in 1908.

A prince is respected when he is clearly either a true friend or a strong enemy. This means he openly supports one side against the other. This is better than staying neutral. If two powerful neighbors fight, they are the kind of people who, if one wins, you will either have to be afraid of him or not. So it is always better to choose a side and fight hard. If you don’t choose, the winner will take advantage of you, and the loser will be happy about it. You won’t have any good reasons or protection to save you.
