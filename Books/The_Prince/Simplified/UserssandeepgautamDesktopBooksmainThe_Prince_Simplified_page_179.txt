In 197 BC, his passionate preaching got him stuck within the borders of Macedonia. He was against all kinds of corruption in the Church and insisted on going back to pure scripture. Because of this, Alexander VI kicked him out of the Church. When he lost support in Florence, he was arrested, tortured, and burned alive in the town’s main square.

Philopoemen (253–183 BC) was a Greek statesman and general who led the Achaean army many times. Pyrrhus (318–272 BC), King of Epirus, was a very successful military leader and a big threat to the Romans in southern Italy and Sicily. He also fought the Carthaginians. His expensive win at the Battle of Asculum in 279 BC is why we say "Pyrrhic victory."

Giorgio Scali was one of the leaders of the Ciompi (wool-workers) rebellion in Florence in 1378. He tried to stop magistrates from punishing a friend but was arrested and beheaded in 1382.

Romulus is the legendary founder and first king of Rome. Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (c. 234–183 BC) was a Roman general and leader best known for beating Hannibal at the Battle of Zama in 201 BC. This big win gave him the name Africanus. After the Senate accused him of taking bribes from enemies, he left Rome and lived on the coast of Campania.

Georges d’Amboise (1460–1510) was a Cardinal and later Archbishop of Rouen. He was already an adviser to the Duke of Orleans when the duke became King Louis XII of France in 1498. Louis made d’Amboise prime minister and convinced Alexander VI to make him a cardinal to help improve relations.

Lucius Septimius Severus (146–211) was a Roman emperor known for making the Roman government very military-focused. After serving under emperors Marcus Aurelius and Commodus, he took power by leading his armies to Rome in 193 AD. He defeated rival leaders who claimed to be emperors and spent his last years fighting a long war in Britain, dying in York in 211.

Giuliano de’ Rovere became Pope Julius II. Cardinal Raffaello Riario of Savona and Roberto da San Severino were important figures in Italy during the late 1400s. San Severino was a mercenary leader who fought for Venice and died in battle in 1487.

Saul was the first king of Israel, chosen by the people around 1025 BC.

Girolamo Savonarola (1452–1498) was born in Ferrara. He studied philosophy and medicine before becoming a Dominican friar. He first preached in Florence from 1482 to 1487 but was mostly ignored. Then, on the advice of the thinker Pico della Mirandola, Lorenzo de’ Medici called him back to Florence in 1490 to lead the monastery of San Marco. He started giving sermons that criticized corruption and warned of doom and foreign invasion.

When Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494 and the Medici family fled, Savonarola’s preaching seemed true. He became the leader of Florence’s government.

Ascanio Sforza (1455–1505) was the fifth child of Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan. He was made a cardinal in 1484 and tried several times to become pope but failed. He acted as a spy for Milan in Rome but lost power when Alexander VI helped the French invade Milan in 1494. Ascanio was imprisoned by the French for three years before Georges d’Amboise, Archbishop of Rouen and adviser to Louis XII, convinced the king to free him, hoping Ascanio would support his own bid to become pope.

Francesco della Rovere (1414–1484) was elected pope as Sixtus IV.
