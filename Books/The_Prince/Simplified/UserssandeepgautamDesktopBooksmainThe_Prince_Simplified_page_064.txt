If a monarchy is new, it’s harder to keep control than if the people have been ruled by the same family for a long time. Hereditary monarchies, where rulers inherit power from their family, are easier to hold onto. The ruler just needs to avoid upsetting the order set by those before him and change policies carefully when problems come up. If he’s an average leader, he’ll probably keep his kingdom for life. Only something huge and powerful can take it away from him, and even then, he might win it back if the enemy has problems.

When a ruler takes over new land, problems happen. People don’t like being ruled by foreigners or armies that invade, and they suffer unfair treatment. So, not only do you lose the support of those whose interests you hurt, but you also lose the trust of the people who helped you take power because you can’t give them as much as they expected. You also can’t be too harsh with them since you still need their help. No matter how strong your army is, you’ll always need local support to control new territory.

For example, in Italy, the Duchy of Ferrara was taken over twice by foreign powers—the Venetians in 1484 and Pope Julius in 1510—but both times the rulers lost control again. This didn’t happen because Ferrara had a long-established ruling family. A ruler who inherits power has less reason to upset his people than a new one, so he is more loved. If he doesn’t make them hate him, it’s likely they will wish him well.

When a dynasty rules for many generations, memories of problems fade, and people don’t want change. But when a monarchy is new, things are harder. For example, Louis XII of France took Milan quickly but lost it just as fast. The first time, Duke Ludovico was able to take it back because the people who had opened the gates to Louis realized they weren’t getting the benefits they expected. They saw their mistake and supported their old ruler again.
