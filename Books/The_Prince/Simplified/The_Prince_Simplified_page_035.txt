In the mid-1600s, this character type stopped appearing much in British drama, but it still shows up sometimes, like in Rowan Atkinson’s Blackadder. There, the character is super scared and adds to Machiavelli’s list of bad traits.

A big reason Machiavelli’s book, The Prince, stayed popular—even though the church banned it—was because people thought his name meant pure evil. But there was another reason too.

As old religious ideas and medieval ways faded, and science and reason started to grow, people in Europe faced many different beliefs and ideas. So, the main question for any new ruler became: how can I make people believe I have the right to be in charge? In England, King Charles Stuart said that kings were chosen by God, even though many had taken power by force or trickery.

Interestingly, Charles’s enemy, Cromwell, also believed he had God’s support, but because of his faith, not family. Even though Cromwell was supposed to follow Parliament, he often ruled without it because he worried people wouldn’t agree with God’s plan.
