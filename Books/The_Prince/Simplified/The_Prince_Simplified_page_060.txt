People who want to get on a ruler’s good side usually give him something they really care about or something they know he likes a lot. So, rulers often receive horses, weapons, gold clothes, jewels, and other fancy gifts.

I wanted to give Your Highness a sign of my loyalty, and I realized that nothing is more valuable to me than my knowledge about great people and what they have done. I gained this knowledge through many years of watching current events and studying old history. After thinking hard about everything I’ve learned, I wrote it all down in a short book that I am now sending to Your Highness.

Although this gift might not seem very impressive, I believe the experience it shares will be useful. Especially when you consider that I can’t offer anything better than a chance to understand in a few hours what I have learned over many years, even through hard and dangerous times.

I didn’t make the book fancy or fill it with long sentences or big, showy words like many writers do. I only wanted it to focus on the important and serious topics. I also hope you won’t think it’s rude that someone from a very low social rank is trying to talk about how princes should rule.
