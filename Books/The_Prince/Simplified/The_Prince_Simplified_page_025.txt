The book isn’t a strict plan made ahead of time. Instead, Machiavelli quickly looks at different types of governments, situations, people, and their wins and losses. He finds two things that can’t be easily explained: luck and personality. By the end, he stops using heroes and success stories as examples because he knows one thing a person can’t easily change is who they really are. For example, Soderini couldn’t become like Borgia, and Borgia couldn’t become like Soderini.

Machiavelli is especially interested in how certain personality traits fit well or badly with certain historical situations. A person might do great in one time but fail badly in another. A plan that works now might be a total disaster later.

So, there isn’t just one perfect ruler. Different people are needed for different situations. The only way to always succeed in politics would be to change your deepest feelings to fit new events. But Machiavelli sadly says that would mean no more luck and no more surprises in history.

While writing The Prince, Machiavelli’s mind was very conflicted, and this struggle makes the book so interesting and sometimes confusing.

On one side, the book was like a kind of personal therapy for him. He wanted to find the truth about power and politics without bias. Understanding how countries gain or lose power gave him a feeling of control and made him feel better about himself.
