Machiavelli showed some risky ideas in his writing, which revealed a darker side of Renaissance Humanism. Because of this, people started to see him as connected to this less acceptable side.

In plays from the Elizabethan and Jacobean times, like those by Kyd, Marlowe, Middleton, Shakespeare, and Ben Jonson, the bad character called the "Machiavellian villain" appeared a lot. Scholars still argue about whether these characters came from reading Gentillet’s book ‘Anti-Machiavel’ or from directly knowing Machiavelli’s work. 

In the 1580s, an Italian version of Machiavelli’s book The Prince was printed in England, but it said it was printed in Italy to avoid a ban. Many educated English people could read Italian then. Sir Francis Bacon had read The Prince before it was officially published in English in 1640. He even defended Machiavelli in his book Advancement of Learning (1605), saying Machiavelli wrote about how people act, not how they should act.

But the idea of the "murderous Machiavel"—a bad guy who is sneaky and evil—became very popular in Elizabethan drama, with Machiavelli’s name mentioned over 400 times. This made Machiavelli known for being a symbol of villainy for a long time. The idea of an evil, power-hungry ruler was already common in tragic plays, thanks to the Roman writer Seneca, who wrote about cruel tyrants who would do anything to get more power.
