If you don’t do everything needed right at the start, you’ll always have to keep using force to stay in control. If you kill everyone who opposes you, you’ll never be able to trust your people because of all the violence. So, it’s better to get the violence over with quickly; that way, people will feel it less and won’t be as angry. On the other hand, favors should be given out slowly, one at a time, so people can really appreciate them.

Most importantly, a leader should have a relationship with their people where nothing that happens, good or bad, makes them change their mind. If times get tough, your harshness will come too late, and any kindness you show will seem forced and won’t impress anyone.

You might wonder how some leaders, like Agathocles, managed to stay in power for years despite all the betrayals and cruelty around them. The secret is whether cruelty is used well or badly. When cruelty is used well, it’s quick and only as much as needed to secure power, then it stops. You don’t keep being cruel but use the power you’ve gained to help your people. But cruelty is used badly if you’re not harsh enough at the beginning and then become more and more cruel later. Leaders who do this have no chance to keep control.

It’s important to figure out how much violence you need right away and get it done all at once. This way, you won’t have to keep being cruel all the time. Once you stop using violence, your people will feel safer, and you can win them over with kindness and generosity.
