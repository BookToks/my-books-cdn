This lottery system was supposed to make sure that every important job and every area was fairly and always represented. Each person with a certain social status could get a short time in power so that no one could keep it forever.

But the system didn’t work well. Every two months, a new government might change its mind on important issues.

Because of this, the most powerful family had to step in and keep things steady. Starting in 1434, the Medici family—first Cosimo, then Piero, then Lorenzo—started controlling the election process. They made sure that most of the names picked were people who supported them and that those chosen for government would follow the Medici’s rules. So, even though the people of Florence liked to say they were free and didn’t listen to anyone, by the middle of the fifteenth century, they were basically living under a dictatorship.

When the rival Pazzi family tried to kill Lorenzo in the Duomo in April 1478, it was because they had no real way to treat him like an ordinary citizen. Machiavelli grew up in a place where what really happened in politics was very different from what people said was happening. He was almost nine years old when the captured Pazzi conspirators, including an archbishop, were hung upside down from the tall windows of the city’s main government building and left there for weeks to rot. He would have learned very early how dangerous it was to make mistakes in politics.
