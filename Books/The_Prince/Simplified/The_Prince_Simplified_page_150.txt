A minister in charge of a state should never think about himself but only focus on the ruler’s business. To make sure this happens, the ruler must care about the minister, give him money and respect, help him, and share honors and jobs with him. This way, the minister will know he can’t survive without the ruler. He will have so many honors he won’t want more, so much money he won’t need more, and so many jobs that he will protect his position.

There is another important problem we need to think about: flatterers. Rulers can only avoid problems with flatterers if they are very smart or very good at picking their ministers.

Courts are always full of flatterers. People love to praise themselves and think they are better than they really are, so it’s easy to fall into this trap. But if you try to stop flatterers, people might start to hate you.

The only way to handle flattery is to let people know you don’t mind hearing the truth. But if everyone can tell you the truth all the time, you lose respect.

So, a smart ruler must find a balance. He should pick smart men as ministers and only let them tell him the truth, and only when he asks about specific things, not all the time. The ruler should ask his ministers about everything and listen carefully, but then decide for himself what to do. When the ministers give advice, the ruler should make it clear that honest opinions are welcome. After deciding, he should not listen to anyone else but stick to his choices and be firm. If he tries something else, he might be ruined by flatterers or lose control.
