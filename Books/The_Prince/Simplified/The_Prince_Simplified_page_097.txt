A king who comes to power with the support of regular people usually holds onto power by himself because almost everyone around him listens to him. You can’t please the nobles without hurting others, but you can please the people. That’s because the people want to be free, while nobles often want to control and oppress them.

Now, let’s talk about a king who becomes king not by doing anything bad but because the people choose him. This kind of king is called a monarchy with public support. To be this kind of king, you don’t have to be super smart or super lucky—just clever in the right way. To rule well, you need either the support of the common people or the rich nobles.

In every city, there are two groups: the common people who don’t want to be bossed around, and the nobles who want to boss them. These two groups create three possible outcomes: a monarchy, a republic, or chaos. A king always has to live with the common people, but he doesn’t need the nobles as much because he can give or take away their power whenever he wants.

A monarchy can happen when either the nobles or the people decide it’s the best for them. The rich families start to make one of their own king to get more power through him. The people, knowing they can’t beat the nobles by themselves, might choose a leader to protect them. A king who gets help from the nobles has a harder time staying in power than one who has the people’s support, because nobles often look out for themselves more than for the king.

Nobles can be split into two types: those who fully support the king’s rule and aren’t greedy, and those who don’t. The loyal nobles deserve respect and love, but the greedy ones only think about what benefits them. The people can also be split: some are weak and easily controlled, but others have good advice and can be useful, especially when things are going well or tough.
