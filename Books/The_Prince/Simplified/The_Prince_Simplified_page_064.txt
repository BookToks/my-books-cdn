If a monarchy is new, it’s harder to rule than if it’s been around for a long time.  

Hereditary monarchies, where people are used to the ruler’s family being in charge, are easier to hold onto. The monarch just needs to avoid upsetting the order set by previous rulers and adjust policies when things go wrong. If the ruler is average in skill, he’ll likely keep his kingdom for life. Only a huge force can take the kingdom away, and even then, he might get it back when the enemy struggles.  

When you take over new lands, you cause problems. First, the locals don’t like the occupying army. Then, they face unfair treatment from the invasion. This makes enemies out of those whose interests you hurt, and you can’t keep the friends who helped you take power because you can’t give them what they expect. You also can’t be too tough on them because you still need their support to control the new territory.  

A good example is the Duchy of Ferrara in Italy. It was taken over twice by foreign powers, Venice and Pope Julius, but these defeats weren’t because the place didn’t have a ruling family. When a ruler inherits power, he has less reason to upset the people and is usually better liked. If he doesn’t try to make people hate him, they’ll probably want him to stay.  

When a dynasty lasts for many generations, memories of past problems fade. This makes change harder because the system is already built up. But when a monarchy is new, things are always unstable.  

For example, Louis XII of France took Milan quickly but lost it just as fast. The first time, Duke Ludovico was able to take it back because the people who had helped Louis realized they wouldn’t get the benefits they hoped for.  

In short, new monarchies have a tough time because people are quick to rebel if they think things won’t get better.
