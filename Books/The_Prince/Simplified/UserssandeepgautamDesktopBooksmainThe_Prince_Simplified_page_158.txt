Here’s what I think: just go for it. When it’s time to act, it’s better to be impulsive than too careful. Luck is like a girl, and if you’re too careful, you’ll mess up. If he did change, and if you want to stay on top of her, you have to be bold and confident.

Personality has to fit with the times and situation for luck to work. You’ll see she’s more likely to respond to men who are bold than to those who just play it safe. Being a woman, she likes her men young and wild because they’re less scared and more daring when they take control.

Pope Julius II always acted on impulse and lived in a time where this worked well for him. Think about his first big win: taking Bologna while Giovanni Bentivoglio was still alive.

The Venetians and the King of Spain were against it, and Julius was still trying to get the French on his side. But, with his usual boldness, the pope led the attack himself. This shocked the Venetians and Spanish, who didn’t know how to react – the Venetians were scared, and the Spanish hoped to get the Kingdom of Naples back. Meanwhile, the King of France agreed to help because he needed Rome as an ally to keep the Venetians in check, and once Julius made his move, he couldn’t refuse to support him without causing problems.

Because of this risky move, Julius achieved more than any other pope with all the careful planning in the world could have done. If he had waited to arrange everything perfectly, like other popes would have, the plan would never have worked.

The King of France would have found endless excuses, and the Venetians and Spanish would have given endless warnings. I won’t go into Julius’s other missions, which were all similar and successful. He died young before he could fail. If times had changed and called for caution, he would have been finished because he would never have changed his impulsive ways.

So, to finish: luck changes, but men keep going no matter what.
