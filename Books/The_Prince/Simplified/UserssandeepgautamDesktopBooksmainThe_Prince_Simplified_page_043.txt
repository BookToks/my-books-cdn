When translating The Prince, one big question keeps coming up: what words would we use today to explain the ideas Machiavelli talks about?

Sometimes, there aren’t modern words because some things, like siege engines or cavalry attacks, aren’t talked about anymore. But mostly, Machiavelli is interested in how people think and act, especially in tough situations. If the translator avoids using confusing modern slang, they can make The Prince clear and easy to understand in today’s English.

The problem is made much harder because Machiavelli’s grammar and sentence structure are very unusual. The Prince was written in 1513, so even Italians today find it hard to understand. New versions of the book usually have the original text next to a modern Italian translation. The main problem for Italian readers isn’t the words themselves—they understand about 90% of them—but how the ideas are packed tightly together, with old and strange grammar, and lots of complicated sentence parts that modern readers aren’t used to.
