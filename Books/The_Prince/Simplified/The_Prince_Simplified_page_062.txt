Just like artists who want to draw mountains go down into the valley to study them, and then climb up the mountain to look down at the valley, a prince needs to understand the people and the different kinds of states he rules.

Your Highness, please accept this small gift with the good intention it is given. Study it carefully, and you will see that I truly want you to become as great as your position and talents promise.

From the high place of your power, if you ever look down on those below you, you will notice how unfair and unkind life can be.

All governments that have ruled people have been either republics or monarchies. Monarchies can be hereditary, where the ruler’s family has been in charge for many years, or they can be new.

New monarchies might be completely new, like when Francesco Sforza took control of Milan, or they could be lands added to an existing kingdom by conquest, like when the King of Spain took Naples.

A new territory won by conquest might be used to living under a ruler or might be used to governing themselves. It might be taken over by the new ruler’s army or by someone else’s, either by luck or because they deserved it.
