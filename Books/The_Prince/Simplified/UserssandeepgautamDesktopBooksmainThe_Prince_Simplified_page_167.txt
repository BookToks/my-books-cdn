In Lugdunum (now called Lyons), Albinus either killed himself or was killed. 

Colleone was known for not switching sides or trying to play one side against another. He is famous because of the statue of Alexander the Great (356–323 BC), King of Macedonia (336–323 BC). Alexander conquered Greece, Persia, and much of Asia. 

Marcus Aurelius Alexander Severus (208–235), a Roman emperor (222–235), was adopted as heir by Emperor Heliogabalus, who was also his first cousin. Alexander was made Bishop of Pamplona at fifteen and a cardinal at eighteen but was eventually murdered by his own soldiers. 

Rodrigo Borgia (1431–1503) was born in Valencia with the Spanish surname Borja, later changed to Borgia in Italy. He was elected pope in 1492 and openly admitted to having as many as eight illegitimate children, all of whom he tried to give important jobs. The most famous were Cesare Borgia and Lucrezia Borgia. 

Cesare was involved in many plots to gain more land and money. He was thought to have killed his older brother Giovanni, but this was never proven. In 1498, he worked with King Louis XII of France, helping him end his marriage so he could marry the widow of Charles VIII. Louis also made Cesare Duke of Valentinois, which gave him the nickname Duke Valentino. Cesare fought with Louis’s army and took over many towns in Italy with his father’s support. 

Antiochus the Great (about 241–187 BC), King of Syria (223–187 BC), spent most of his rule fighting wars, rebuilding his kingdom, and taking over much of Asia Minor. In 192 BC, he invaded Greece but was defeated by the Romans and lost Asia Minor too. 

Cesare Borgia led French soldiers during the siege of Naples in 1501, then returned to take control of other towns. He even hired Leonardo da Vinci as a military engineer. When some of his hired soldiers rebelled, Cesare tricked them into coming to a meeting and had them arrested and killed. After his father died in 1503, Cesare lost most of his power and was eventually exiled to Spain, where he died serving his brother-in-law, King John III of Navarre. 

Giovanni Bentivoglio (1438–1508) was the son of Annibale, who ruled Bologna but was killed when Giovanni was a child. Giovanni became ruler in 1462 but had to flee when Pope Julius II attacked the city in 1506. 

Bartolomeo Colleone (about 1395–1475) was a famous leader of hired soldiers who worked for Venice and fought in many battles for different Italian states.
