By this time, Lorenzo the Magnificent had been dead for two years, and his son Piero, who was not very capable, was in charge of the Medici family’s rule. Piero gave in to Charles without a fight and even gave up the city’s nearby lands. This made the people of Florence angry, and they rebelled against him. The Medici rule fell apart, and soon the preacher who had warned about this disaster became the leader of Florence. Unlike before, he was chosen to lead for a whole year instead of just two months.

Girolamo Savonarola ruled Florence from 1494 to 1498. During this time, the city changed from being a center of Renaissance thinking to a strict, religious place where books were burned. The Church in Rome saw Savonarola as a bigger threat than the Renaissance ideas and did everything they could to stop him. In 1498, after losing much support in Florence, Savonarola was found guilty of heresy and burned at the stake. Soon after this, Niccolò Machiavelli got important jobs in Florence’s government, including Secretary of the Second Chancery and Secretary of the Ten of War, which handled foreign affairs and war plans.

Machiavelli was only twenty-eight years old. We don’t know how he got such important jobs so young because there is no record of him having special experience. But within a few months, he was traveling to nearby states to represent Florence. Over the next fourteen years, he worked on important missions involving the King of France, the pope, the Holy Roman Emperor, Cesare Borgia, Caterina Sforza, and many others.
