A big hint for understanding the text comes at the start of the next paragraph where it says: "The only thing Borgia can be blamed for is his part in choosing Pope Julius, where he made a bad decision." This means that, for his own sake, Borgia backed the wrong guy.

Here we see the tricky part of Machiavelli’s writing: he’s not saying Borgia’s bad actions shouldn’t be criticized. Instead, Machiavelli just doesn’t care about talking about right or wrong from a Christian view.

For him, it’s about smart or bad choices, not good or evil. When he talks about Borgia as an example, it’s not about being moral or immoral, but about how this guy knew how to get power, keep it, and build a strong government.

Lastly, you can notice that older translations are a bit shy or careful. Machiavelli was famous for chasing women, and when he wrote The Prince, he was talking to men who didn’t care about being politically correct. When he says, "fortune is a woman, and if you want to keep her under control, you have to beat and push her," there’s a clear sexual meaning in those words.
