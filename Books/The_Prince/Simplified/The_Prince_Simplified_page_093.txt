Agathocles became King of Syracuse without any fight because the people accepted him. He had been defeated twice by the town’s citizens and the Carthaginians had even attacked the city. But Agathocles managed to defend his town with the help of Vitellozzo. He left some men behind to hold off the siege and led the rest of his army to attack Africa. The siege was broken, and the Carthaginians almost lost. They agreed to keep Africa, while Agathocles kept Sicily.

After many years, Agathocles wanted to come home and visit his uncle. He wrote that he had worked hard just for the respect his position gave him. He wanted to enter the town in style, with a hundred friends and servants riding with him, so people would see that he hadn’t wasted his time. He asked his uncle to organize a big welcome for him that would honor both him and his uncle, who raised him.

Giovanni, his uncle, worked hard to make his nephew proud. After the people of Fermo gave Agathocles a formal welcome, Oliverotto was invited into Giovanni’s house. A few days later, Oliverotto secretly planned a crime. He threw a fancy party and invited Giovanni and the town’s leaders. After the food and entertainment, Oliverotto started talking about the power of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare Borgia.

Then Oliverotto suddenly said they should talk in a more private room. Giovanni and the others followed him. But as soon as they sat down, Oliverotto’s soldiers jumped out from hiding and killed them all.

After the massacre, Oliverotto rode around the town and trapped the main leader in the palace. This forced the people to obey him. Oliverotto was a man from Fermo who lived during the time of Pope Alexander VI. He lost his father when he was young and was raised by his uncle Giovanni Fogliani. His uncle put him in the army, hoping that with training he would become important.

Oliverotto was smart and strong. After the death of one leader, he served under his brother Vitellozzo. He was known for being tough and powerful, but his way of gaining power was through violence, not kindness or loyalty.

Looking at Agathocles’ life, you can see he didn’t get lucky. He had no rich friends helping him when he took power but worked his way up through hard times and dangers. When he became king, he made tough choices to keep his rule. But killing friends and citizens, betraying others, and being cruel don’t show true talent. Those things might get you power, but not respect.

Agathocles was brave and took risks, which made him a great military leader. But because he was so brutal and cruel, he isn’t admired like some others. In the end, his success didn’t come from luck or good qualities but from his ability to survive and fight through anything.
