They are like this: if one of them wins, you either have to be afraid of him or not.

And Bull says: either they are like that, so if one wins, you will be in danger, or they are not.

Here, Bull’s version sounds more like how people speak today. But still, no one writing this idea now in English would add the "or they are not" at the end of the sentence after starting with "if." If we keep Bull’s basic idea but move the "or" part earlier – like, "either they are or they aren’t like that, so if one wins, you will be in danger" – the sentence sounds better.

In the end, the easiest way seemed to me to move the "or not" part closer to the word "fear" instead of describing the two states. This way, the meaning stays the same and the sentence feels more direct, like the original.

So it becomes: you may or may not have a reason to fear the winner afterwards.

Also, I want to say that I really respect these earlier translations and others too.
