We’re not talking about those fancy, complicated sentences that sound really smart and were copied a lot by English writers a long time ago. Machiavelli’s style is more like how people actually talk—flexible, convincing, and sometimes a bit rough. To get that same feeling in English, you have to change the sentence order from the original Italian.

To show you what to expect, here are three versions of the same paragraph. The last one is mine. I didn’t pick anything super hard; it’s a pretty normal passage where Machiavelli explains a situation, then thinks about what you could do and what might happen because of it. The first translation is by W. K. Marriot and came out in 1908.

A prince is respected when he is either a true friend or a clear enemy. That means he chooses one side without holding back. This is better than staying neutral because if two powerful neighbors fight, they are the kind of people who, if one wins, you will have to be afraid of him or not. Either way, it’s better for you to pick a side and fight hard. If you don’t, and one side wins, you will end up being controlled by the winner and the loser will be happy about it. You won’t have any good reasons or protection for yourself.
