It’s normal that when you try to avoid one danger, you might run into another. Being smart means you can think about the risks and pick the less bad option.

A ruler should also show that he respects people who do good work. He should give jobs to talented people and reward those who are really good at what they do. Also, the ruler should make sure his people feel safe doing their work, whether they are merchants, farmers, or have any other job. They shouldn’t worry about losing their money or being taxed too much if they start a business.

Choosing the ruler’s helpers, or ministers, is very important. The quality of these ministers shows if the ruler is wise or not and gives people their first idea of how the ruler runs things. If the ministers are smart and loyal, people will think the ruler is clever because he picked the right people. But if the ministers are bad, people will criticize the ruler because his first mistake was choosing the wrong helpers.

During the year, the ruler should have shows and festivals to entertain people. Since every city has groups and neighborhoods, he should respect these groups and visit their meetings sometimes. This shows he is kind and generous but still keeps his power.

There are three types of minds: one that understands things on its own, one that understands what others have figured out, and one that understands nothing. The first type is very valuable, the second is helpful, and the third is useless. Pandolfo didn’t have the first type but had the second type. If someone can tell what is right or wrong in another person’s ideas, even if they can’t come up with ideas themselves, they can still help by encouraging the good ones and fixing the bad ones. The minister will know he can’t trick the ruler and will have to act properly.

There is a sure way to check a minister’s trustworthiness: if you see a man thinking more about himself than others, you should assume any decision he makes might be dangerous.
