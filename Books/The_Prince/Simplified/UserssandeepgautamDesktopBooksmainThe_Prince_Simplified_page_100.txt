These towns are super well protected, so everyone knows it would be really hard and tiring to attack them. They have big moats and strong walls, the right weapons, and public storage with food, drinks, and firewood for a whole year. Plus, to keep people fed without wasting money, they stock up on materials for a year’s work in the trades that keep the city alive and pay the workers. They also take military training seriously and make sure it happens regularly.

When you look at different states, an important question is: if attacked, does the ruler have enough power to defend themselves alone, or will they always need help from others? To be more exact, a ruler who can gather enough men or money to build an army that can fight anyone is able to defend themselves. But a ruler who can’t fight outside the city walls and has to hide behind them will always need outside help.  

Someone might say, what if people live outside the walls and see their homes being burned? Won’t they get impatient and forget about their ruler? My answer is that a strong leader can handle these problems. They can give people hope that the siege won’t last long, scare them with stories about how cruel the enemy is, and quickly stop anyone from acting recklessly. It’s clear the enemy will burn the countryside as they approach, but the people in town will still want to fight.

A leader who has built strong defenses and treated their people well will make enemies think twice before attacking. People don’t like difficult problems, and attacking a well-defended town with a ruler who isn’t hated is never easy. People will support their ruler more because their homes and property were destroyed protecting him. It’s normal to feel loyal to a leader for what they’ve done for you, not just because of their name.

German cities are completely independent. They don’t have much land around them and only listen to the emperor when it suits them. They aren’t afraid of him or any other rulers nearby.
