Sharing Lombardy with the Venetians was something others did when they took over land, and it was understandable because it gave him a base in Italy. But there was no reason to share Naples with Spain, so that was a mistake.

Louis made five mistakes: he got rid of weaker states, made one strong state even stronger, brought in a powerful foreign king, didn’t put settlers in the land he gained, and didn’t set up colonies there.

I talked about this with the Cardinal of Rouen when Duke Valentino (people used to call Cesare Borgia that) was attacking Romagna. The cardinal said Italians didn’t know much about war, and I told him the French didn’t know much about politics, or else they wouldn’t have let the pope get so powerful.

Still, these mistakes might not have caused big problems while Louis was alive if he hadn’t made a sixth mistake: taking power away from Venice. If he hadn’t made the pope stronger and brought Spain into Italy, it would have made sense to weaken Venice a bit. But after all the other choices he made, he shouldn’t have made Venice so weak.

As long as Venice was strong, no one would try to take Lombardy from the French. The Venetians wouldn’t let another state attack unless they got land too, and other states wouldn’t want to attack France if it meant helping Venice. Plus, no one would dare fight France and Venice together.

Some people might say Louis gave Romagna to the pope and Naples to Spain to avoid war. But I say you should never ignore problems just to avoid war, because it won’t stop war—it will just give your enemy an advantage.

Others might say Louis promised the pope he would attack Venice if the pope helped him get a divorce and made the Archbishop of Rouen a cardinal. But I will explain later when rulers should or shouldn’t keep their promises.

So, Louis lost Lombardy because he didn’t take the right steps to protect it from another king.
