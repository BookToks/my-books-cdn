Let’s go back to the Kingdom of Darius, which was Turkish. Alexander had to first beat its whole army and take control of the country. After he did that and Darius died, Alexander was safely in charge for the reasons mentioned before. If his followers had stayed united, they could have easily ruled the area. The only problem would have been the fights they started among themselves.

When you take over places where people are used to running themselves without a king and living freely under their own laws, there are three ways to keep control. First, you can destroy the place completely. Second, you can move in and live there yourself. Third, you can let them keep living under their own laws but make them pay taxes and pick a few local leaders who support you to run things. Since these leaders rely on the new ruler’s support, they’ll do everything to protect their power.

If you don’t want to destroy a self-governing city, the best way to hold it is with the help of its own people.

Let’s look at Sparta and Rome as examples. The Spartans controlled Athens and Thebes by setting up governments run by a few local people, but they eventually lost those cities. The Romans destroyed cities like Capua, Carthage, and Numantia to keep control. They tried to control Greece like the Spartans did by letting it have its own laws, but it didn’t work. Eventually, the Romans had to destroy many cities to hold the whole region.

The truth is, the only sure way to keep control of places used to ruling themselves is to destroy them. If you conquer a city that’s used to self-government and don’t destroy it, you can expect trouble. Even if you get rid of the king’s family, there will always be nobles ready to take power when things change. Since you can’t give them everything they want or get rid of them all, you’ll lose the territory as soon as your enemies find a chance to rebel.
