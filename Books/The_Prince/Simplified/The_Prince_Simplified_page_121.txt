In our own time, the only leaders who did great things were often seen as stingy. The others failed. Pope Julius II used his image as a generous man to become pope, but then he happily spent money on wars. The current King of France has fought many wars without raising new taxes because he always cuts costs to pay for them. The current King of Spain wouldn’t have won his wars if people thought he was generous.

If we look at generosity, it seems good to be seen as generous. But a ruler doesn’t have to steal from his people or take advantage of others, and being generous just for show can hurt you. Real generosity, done with good intentions, often goes unnoticed. A ruler who has enough money to protect his country doesn’t need to worry about being called stingy. Being seen as stingy can actually help a ruler stay in power.

If someone says generosity won Caesar his empire and others rose to power by being generous, I’d say: A ruler who already has power must be careful with generosity. Caesar wanted power, but if he kept spending like that after becoming emperor, he would have ruined the empire. And if someone objects that many successful rulers were very generous, I’d say: Either they spent their own money and their people's money, or someone else’s money.

A ruler can’t be generous without risking his power. So, if he’s smart, he won’t mind having a reputation for stinginess. Over time, if people see he doesn’t need to raise taxes and still defends the country, they’ll start thinking he’s generous—generous with others’ money, that is.

When the money is his own or his people’s, he should be careful with it. But when it’s someone else’s money, he should spend it freely. A ruler who leads armies and lives off plunder and extortion is using other people’s money and should be generous with it, or the soldiers won’t follow him.

Giving away money that isn’t yours or your subjects’ actually makes you look better. Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander did this. Spending other people’s money doesn’t hurt your reputation—it improves it.
