When a leader is getting ready for war and then goes back to leading his armies, he must never stop thinking about war. There is nothing that can happen that he doesn’t know how to handle. Preparing for war and working on it during peace time is even more important than during war itself. He can do this in two ways: physically and mentally.

Physically, besides keeping his soldiers fit and disciplined, he should go hunting a lot. This will make his body stronger. It will also help him learn about different kinds of land, like mountains, valleys, plains, rivers, and swamps. He should study these carefully because this knowledge is useful in two ways. First, it will help him understand his own country better so he can defend it well. Second, knowing about these lands will make it easier for him to understand places he hasn’t seen before.

For example, the hills and rivers in one region are similar to those in others. So, learning about one place helps in understanding another. A leader who doesn’t know the land won’t be a good commander. Knowing the land helps find the enemy, lead the army by the right routes, pick good places to camp, plan battles, and attack towns in the best way.

Mentally, a leader must read and study history, especially stories about great leaders and their achievements. He should look at their war strategies and learn why they won or lost. He must try to avoid their mistakes and copy their successes. Most importantly, he should pick a great leader from the past as a role model and always remember their example and achievements.

For example, Alexander the Great copied Achilles, Caesar copied Alexander, and Scipio copied Cyrus. Anyone who reads about Cyrus can see how important his example was to Scipio. A smart leader never relaxes during peace but works hard to prepare. That way, when hard times come, he will be ready.

One famous leader, Philopoemen, always thought about military strategy even in peace. When he was with his friends, he would stop and ask questions like: If the enemy was on that hill and we were down here, who would have the better position? How could we attack without breaking our lines? If we had to run away, how would we do it? And if the enemy ran, how would we chase them?

He listened to his friends’ ideas and shared his own. This helped him think about all the problems an army might face.
