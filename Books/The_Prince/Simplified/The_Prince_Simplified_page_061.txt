People who want to get on the good side of a ruler usually give them something valuable to themselves or something they know the ruler really likes. So, rulers often receive horses, weapons, gold cloth, jewels, or other fancy gifts.

I wanted to give Your Highness a sign of my loyalty, and I realized that the most valuable thing I have is my knowledge about great leaders and what they did. I learned this through many years of watching current events and studying history. After thinking carefully about everything I know, I wrote it all down in a short book that I am now sending to Your Highness.

Even though this gift might not seem very impressive, I believe the experience inside will be appreciated. Especially because I can offer you the chance to understand in a few hours what took me many years of hard work and challenges to learn. 

I didn’t make the book look fancy or fill it with long sentences or showy words like many other writers do. I wanted it to be focused only on the important and serious topic. I also hope you won’t think it’s too bold for someone from a very low background like me to talk about how princes should rule their people.
