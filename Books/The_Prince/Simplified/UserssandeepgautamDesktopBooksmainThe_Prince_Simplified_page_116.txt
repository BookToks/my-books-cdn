When a leader comes back to lead his armies, he must always think about war. There is nothing that can happen in battle that he doesn’t know how to handle. Preparing for war is even more important during peace time than during war itself. He can prepare in two ways: physically and mentally.

Physically, besides keeping his soldiers active and disciplined, he should go hunting a lot. This will make his body stronger. It will also help him learn about different types of land—how mountains rise, how valleys open up, what plains are like, and where rivers and marshes are. He needs to study these carefully because this knowledge is useful in two ways. First, it helps him understand his own country better and how to protect it. Second, knowing these kinds of places makes it easier to understand new areas he hasn’t seen before.

For example, the hills, valleys, plains, rivers, and marshes in Tuscany are similar to those in other places. So, if a leader knows one area well, it’s easier to learn another. A leader who doesn’t know the land well can’t find the enemy, lead his army the right way, pick a good place to camp, plan a battle, or attack a town properly.

Mentally, a leader must read history, especially about great leaders and what they did. He should study their war strategies and learn from their wins and losses. Most importantly, he should try to copy a leader who was praised and admired. For example, Alexander the Great copied Achilles, Caesar copied Alexander, and Scipio copied Cyrus. If you read about Cyrus’s life, you’ll see how much Scipio learned from him. A smart leader never stops working hard during peace. He uses that time to get ready for tough times ahead. Then, when war comes, he’ll be prepared.

One leader historians liked was Philopoemen, who always thought about military strategy even when it was peace time. When he was with his friends in the country, he would ask questions like: If the enemy was on that hill and we were down here, who would have the better chance? How could we attack without breaking our lines? If we had to run away, how would we do it? If the enemy ran away, how would we chase them? As they walked, he would talk about all the problems an army might face.

He listened to his friends’ ideas and shared his own. By thinking about these things all the time, a leader earns his soldiers’ respect and trust. Without that, the soldiers won’t follow or believe in him.
