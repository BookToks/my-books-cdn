The papacy was challenged but resisted successfully, thanks partly to help from the French leader Fabius Maximus (around 280–203 BC), and partly because Ferrara had better cannons, which were very important and a source of pride for the duke.

In 1526–27, Alfonso joined Charles V (Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain) on an expedition that ended with the sacking of Rome.

Ferdinand of Aragon (1452–1516) married Isabella of Castile when they were 17 and 18 years old, which was a first step toward uniting Spain. They ruled Castile together from 1474, and Ferdinand became King of Aragon in 1479. After a long fight to take Granada, the last Muslim territory in Spain, Ferdinand finally won in 1492. That same year, he also expelled the Jews from Castile and Aragon. 

For the rest of his reign, Ferdinand fought against French expansion in Italy. From 1494 to 1496, he helped Italian leaders push Charles VIII of France out of Italy. In 1501 he made an agreement with Louis XII to split the Kingdom of Naples but later turned against France and captured the whole kingdom by 1504. When he died, Spain was the strongest country in Europe. His grandson, Charles of Austria, who was also the Holy Roman Emperor, took over.

The brothers Tiberius and Gaius Sempronius Gracchus were from an important Roman family in the 2nd century BC. Both became Tribunes of the Plebs (representatives of the common people) and tried to make reforms to reduce the power of the nobles. Sadly, both were killed because of this.

Ferrara had dukes from a family that ruled for about 400 years. 

(1) Ercole d'Este (1431–1505) was duke from 1471 to 1505. He was educated in Naples, married the daughter of King Ferrante of Naples, and supported Renaissance art.

(2) Alfonso d’Este (1476–1534) was duke from 1505 to 1534. He married Anna Sforza first, and later Lucrezia Borgia, daughter of Pope Alexander VI. In 1508, he joined the League of Cambrai, which wanted to destroy Venice’s power and divide its lands. After Pope Julius II switched sides to support Venice, Alfonso stayed loyal to France. Because of this, the pope excommunicated him and attacked him.

Guidobaldo da Montefeltro (1472–1508) became Duke of Urbino in 1482. He fought against Venice and the papacy with King Ferrante’s help but lost some land. He stayed neutral during the Italian War of 1494–98 but asked for French protection when the French took Milan in 1499. He fought as a military captain for Pope Alexander VI, Charles VIII of France, and later Venice. 

Caterina Sforza (1463–1509) was the illegitimate daughter of Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan. She married Girolamo Riario, who was officially the pope’s nephew but possibly his son. Riario was Count of Forlì but was killed in 1488. After his death, Caterina took control of the town until Cesare Borgia captured it in 1500. She is famous for refusing to give up the castle to rebels, even when they threatened to kill her children. She showed her strength by shouting from the castle walls that she could have more children.

Hamilcar Barca (around 270–228 BC) was a successful Carthaginian commander in the First Punic War against Rome. He launched an invasion of Roman forces in Sicily in 247 BC and ended Spartan dominance in Greece, making Carthage the strongest power there.
