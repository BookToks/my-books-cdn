Sharing Lombardy with the Venetians was something others did when they took over land, and it was okay because it gave him a place to start in Italy. But there was no need to share Naples with Spain, so that was a mistake.

Louis made five mistakes: he got rid of the weaker states; he made one of Italy’s strongest states even stronger; he brought in a very powerful foreign king; he didn’t put settlers in the land he took; and he didn’t set up colonies there.

I talked about this in Nantes with the Cardinal of Rouen when Duke Valentino (that’s what people called Cesare Borgia, Pope Alexander’s son) was invading Romagna. The cardinal said Italians didn’t know much about war, and I told him the French didn’t know much about politics. If they did, they wouldn’t have let the pope get so powerful.

Even so, these mistakes might not have caused big problems while Louis was alive if he hadn’t made a sixth mistake by taking away Venice’s power. If he hadn’t increased the pope’s power and brought Spain into Italy, it would have been okay to weaken Venice. But since he did, he shouldn’t have made Venice so weak.

As long as Venice was strong, no one would try to take Lombardy from the French. The Venetians wouldn’t let anyone attack unless they got land in return, and other states wouldn’t want to take Lombardy if it meant giving it to Venice. Plus, no one would dare fight both France and Venice together.

Someone might say Louis gave Romagna to the pope and Naples to Spain to avoid war. But I say never avoid trouble just to stop a war because it only delays it and helps your enemy. Others might say Louis promised the pope he would attack Venice if the pope helped him get a divorce, but I’ll talk later about when rulers should or shouldn’t keep their promises.

So Louis lost Lombardy because he didn’t do what was needed to hold onto it.
