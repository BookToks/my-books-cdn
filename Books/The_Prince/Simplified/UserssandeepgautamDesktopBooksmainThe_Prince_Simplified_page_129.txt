If all people were good, it would be easier to trust them and keep promises. But since most people aren’t, you don’t really need to keep your promises to them. A leader should always keep their promises, but if they can’t, they should have good reasons to explain why. Many times, leaders break promises, like peace treaties, and no one really stops them.

A leader has to be very careful about what they say. They should seem kind, loyal, honest, and religious. People judge leaders based on how they look and act, not on what they really are inside. Most people only see the surface and don’t know the real person. Only a few see the truth, but those few usually don’t speak up because the majority believes what the leader shows.

For example, Pope Alexander VI was always tricking people, but he was very good at it. He made promises he never kept and fooled many. Because he understood how people are, he stayed powerful. Leaders who do what it takes to keep power are often respected, even if they are dishonest. People care more about results and appearances than the truth.

So, a leader doesn’t have to be truly good, but they must seem good. It’s very important to appear compassionate, loyal, honest, and religious. You can even be those things sometimes, but a leader must be ready to change quickly if their power is in danger. A new leader especially can’t always act like a good person because staying in power often means doing things that go against loyalty, kindness, and religion.

Leaders face two big dangers: one from people inside their own country and one from other countries outside. They have to be strong and smart to handle both.
