Using this excuse and showing no easy way of living, the army really liked him. But his cruelty and wild behavior were so extreme that, after killing many people one by one, he wiped out much of Rome’s population and all the people of Alexandria. At this point, everyone really hated him, and even those close to him got nervous. In the end, a soldier killed him while he was with his army.

Severus had two big problems if he wanted to control the empire completely: one in Asia, where the army leader Pescennius Niger had made himself emperor; and the other in the west, where Albinus also wanted to be emperor. Thinking it would be dangerous to fight both at once, Severus decided to attack Niger and trick Albinus.

So Severus wrote to Albinus in France, saying that since the Senate had made him emperor, he wanted to share the power with him. He gave Albinus the title of Caesar and had the Senate name him co-emperor. Albinus believed him, but after Severus beat and killed Niger and took control of the eastern empire, he went back to Rome and told the Senate that Albinus was actually planning to kill him. So Severus went to France, took Albinus’s power away, and had him killed.

If we look closely at what Severus did, we see he was both fierce and clever. He was feared and respected by everyone and managed to avoid being hated by the army. It’s no surprise that even though he was new, he stayed in power because his strong reputation protected him from the hatred that might have come from his violent actions.

Severus’s son, Antoninus, was also a man with some great qualities. People thought he was amazing and the army liked him. He was a strong leader who could handle tough times and didn’t care for fancy food or luxury. But Antoninus’s brother had killed a soldier’s brother in a bad way and kept threatening the soldier every day, even keeping him close as a bodyguard. This reckless behavior caused problems and, in the end, Antoninus was killed by a conspiracy after people stopped trusting him.

Now let’s talk about Commodus, who could have easily kept the empire. He was the son of Marcus Aurelius and became emperor by right, so if he had just followed his father’s example, the army and people would have accepted him. But Commodus was cruel and wild. He liked to show off by fighting gladiators in the arena himself. He didn’t respect himself and did many bad things that made his soldiers hate him. Because people hated him and the army despised him, he was eventually killed in a plot.

Finally, there’s Maximinus. He was a real war lover. As I said before, the armies were fed up with the weak Alexander, and after they got rid of him, they chose Maximinus to be their leader.
