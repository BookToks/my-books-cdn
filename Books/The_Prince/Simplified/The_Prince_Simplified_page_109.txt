The Swiss are really well-armed and completely free. A good example of mercenaries in ancient times is Carthage. After their first war with Rome, the Carthaginians were almost overthrown by their mercenaries, even though these soldiers were led by Carthaginian citizens.

After Epaminondas died, the Thebans made Philip of Macedonia their army leader. As soon as he won the war, he took away their freedom. When Filippo Maria Visconti died, the Milanese hired Francesco Sforza to fight against the Venetians. After beating the Venetians at Caravaggio, Sforza joined them to overthrow his Milanese employers. Francesco’s father was mercenary commander for Queen Joanna of Naples, but he suddenly ran away, leaving her kingdom unprotected. She had to rely on the King of Aragon or risk losing her kingdom.

The Venetians fought confidently and successfully at sea, where both nobles and armed commoners were brave. But on land, they stopped using their own strengths and hired mercenaries like other Italian states did. At first, the Venetians didn’t need to worry about their mercenaries because they had little land and much prestige. But when they expanded on the mainland, led by Carmagnola, they learned how troublesome mercenaries could be. Carmagnola was a great commander, and the Venetians defeated the Duke of Milan under his leadership. But when Carmagnola lost interest in the war, the Venetians saw they couldn’t win anymore. They couldn’t fire him either because they’d lose what they had gained before, so they decided the safest thing was to kill him.

In the past, both Venice and Florence grew by using mercenaries who didn’t take power but defended their employers. The Florentines were lucky because some powerful captains didn’t win their wars, others faced strong enemies, or changed their goals. Giovanni Acuto (John Hawkwood) didn’t win, so we don’t know if he was loyal or not. But if he had won, the Florentines would have been at his mercy.

Francesco Sforza had the forces of Braccio da Montone against him, and the two commanders stopped each other. Sforza focused on Lombardy while Braccio fought Rome and Naples. But remember what happened not long ago: Florence hired Paulo Vitelli as military commander, a serious man who worked his way up from nothing.

Over recent centuries, as the empire lost control in Italy and the pope gained more power, the country broke into smaller states. This history shows how mercenaries bring slow, weak victories and sudden, confusing defeats. Since Italy has been run by mercenaries for many years, it’s important to look at the bigger picture to find a solution.
