At the same time, and maybe without even realizing it, he was enjoying, through the stories about Borgia and others, the kind of exciting political successes he never had. It’s interesting how quickly he skips over Borgia’s complete fall from power, his arrest, jail, and death, almost like he didn’t want to admit his hero could fail.

While this might have helped him feel better, The Prince was also clearly written to be published and seen by the public. Machiavelli loved to show off how smart he was, how much he knew, and how clever his ideas were. Even so, his reasons for writing were mixed and maybe even a bit confusing. When he was most serious, he wanted to argue with the great historians and thinkers of the past and prove to people at the time that his mind was just as sharp as theirs.

But when thinking more practically, Machiavelli was hoping the book would help him get a job again. He wanted the ruler he gave the book to see how good he was at analyzing things and want to hire him. That’s why the book starts with a very flattering dedication and ends with patriotic words saying this ruler should be the one to free Italy from foreign control.
