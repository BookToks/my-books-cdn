A king who comes to power with the support of regular people usually holds onto power by himself and doesn’t have many people around who disobey him. Also, you can’t really please the nobles without hurting others, but you can please the people. That’s because the people want to be free and treated fairly, while the nobles often want to control and oppress the people.

Now, let’s look at the second case, where a private citizen becomes king not by doing bad things, but because the other citizens support him. This is called a monarchy with public support. To become a king like this, you don’t have to be a genius or super lucky—just smart in the right way. To take over this kind of state, you need the support of either the common people or the rich noble families.

In every city, there are two groups fighting for power: the common people who don’t want to be bossed around by nobles, and the nobles who want to control the people. These opposite ideas can lead to three outcomes: a monarchy, a republic, or chaos. A king will always have to live with the people, but he can do without the nobles because he can make or break noblemen whenever he wants by giving or taking away their titles.

A monarchy can start either from the people or the nobles when it suits them. The rich families, realizing they can’t control the people directly, try to make one of their own king so they can get power behind the scenes. Similarly, the people, seeing they can’t beat the nobles, pick one man to be king so he can protect them.

A king who gains power with the nobles’ help has a harder time holding onto it than one who gets support from the people. That’s because nobles often look out for themselves first, while the people are more loyal when things are going well. But if the nobles are just waiting for their own chance, then the king needs to be careful.
