Every town had to send someone to represent them, and he took the chance. He realized too late that the growing power of Borgia and the Church could ruin them. The recent harsh actions had made some people hate him, so the Orsini planned to meet at Magione, near Perugia.

This meeting caused a rebellion in Urbino and uprisings in Romagna, causing lots of problems for Borgia. But with help from the French, he managed to get through it. After regaining trust, Borgia didn’t want to risk losing French loyalty or anyone else’s, so he started using trickery.

He was so good at hiding his real plans that even the Orsini made peace with him and sent Paulo Orsini as a mediator. Borgia was very generous to Paulo, giving him money, clothes, and horses until the Orsinis finally accepted an invitation to Senigallia, which put them under Borgia’s control. After killing the Orsini leaders and forcing their followers to join him, Borgia had a strong power base. He controlled Romagna and the Duchy of Urbino, and the local people were starting to enjoy some prosperity.

This last part is important. When Borgia took over Romagna, he found it had been run by weak leaders who stole from the people and caused fights instead of creating unity. There was a lot of theft, feuds, and injustice. So he decided to bring in good government to calm the area and make people respect authority.

To do this, he appointed Remirro de Orco, a harsh and strict man, and gave him full control. In a short time, de Orco united the area and earned a strong reputation. But Borgia thought this harsh rule might cause people to resent him, so he set up a civil court in the middle of the territory to keep things fair.

Borgia’s biggest worry for the future was that his father’s successor as pope would be hostile and try to take the lands his father had given him. He made four plans to protect himself: first, get rid of all the local rulers’ families to stop a new pope from returning them; second, win the support of Rome’s noble families to block any papal actions; third, gain as much control as possible.

That’s how Borgia handled the immediate problems.
