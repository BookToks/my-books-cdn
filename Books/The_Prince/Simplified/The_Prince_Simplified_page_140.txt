Even if your hired soldiers are good, they’ll never be good enough to protect your forts and plans against strong enemies and unfriendly people.

Rulers often use different strategies. Like I said, when a new ruler takes control of a new state, they always give weapons to their people. History shows many examples of this.

But when a ruler adds a new territory to an existing state, it’s different. They have to take weapons away from most people there, except those who helped them take over. Even those helpers should be watched carefully over time. To keep power safer, some rulers have disarmed weak citizens. Others have kept towns divided by encouraging fights among them. Some rulers made people dislike them on purpose. Others tried to win over people who didn’t trust them at first. Some built forts; others destroyed forts. It’s hard to judge these actions without knowing the specific situation, but I’ll try to explain the idea in general.

New rulers never start by taking weapons from their people. Instead, they give weapons to them. When you give people weapons, those weapons belong to you. People who might have been against you now owe you, and your loyal people become even more loyal. You can’t arm everyone, but if you arm some, you can feel safer about the rest.

The people you arm will feel loyal to you. The others won’t hate you because they know the armed people risk their lives for you and deserve better rewards. But if you take weapons away, people will get upset. It shows you don’t trust them, and they’ll start to hate you.

Also, when enemies come, towns divided by fights inside will fall quickly. The weaker side will join the enemy, and the stronger side won’t be able to fight both. 

Long ago, experts in Florence said you had to hold cities by using their internal fights and forts. They encouraged fights in some towns to control them better. Sometimes this worked when different groups were balanced, but I don’t think it’s a good rule today. Dividing people into factions never really helped. 

The Venetians tried something similar by encouraging fights between groups in towns they controlled. They stopped these fights from becoming full wars so the towns wouldn’t unite against Venice. This plan didn’t work well. After Venice lost a battle, one faction took control of towns quickly.

This kind of plan shows a ruler is weak. A strong, confident ruler doesn’t need to divide people to stay in power. If you can’t trust your people with weapons, you’ll need to hire soldiers who don’t belong to anyone, but those mercenaries have many problems too.
