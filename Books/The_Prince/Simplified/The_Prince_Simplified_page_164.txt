Machiavelli would have expected his readers to know a lot about the men he talks about from recent and modern times, but not so much about some people from ancient history. To help today’s readers understand better, I’ve given more information about the modern figures and less about the ones from Roman times and earlier.

Achilles was a Greek hero in the Trojan War. He was the son of the immortal nymph Thetis and was raised by Chiron the centaur.

Acuto, Giovanni is the Italian name for John Hawkwood (1320–1394). He served in the English army in France. In 1360, Hawkwood joined a group of mercenary soldiers in Burgundy and later led the White Company, fighting for different states and groups in Italy. He was good at playing his employers against their enemies and became very rich. From 1390, he led the Florentine armies in their war against the Visconti family of Milan.

Agathocles (361–289 BC) was the ruler of Syracuse from 317 to 289 BC and King of Sicily from 304 to 289 BC. He took power in Syracuse by forcing out and killing thousands of people. He built a strong army and controlled Sicily, which led to a long war with Carthage.

Albinus, Decimus Clodius Ceionius Septimius (around 150–197), was a Roman military leader in Britain. After the murder of Emperor Pertinax in 193, Albinus declared himself emperor. At first, he joined forces with Severus in Rome, who had also claimed to be emperor.
