A ruler isn’t smart just because he gets good advice; it’s his own good sense that helps him find the right advice.

For example, Bishop Luca Rainaldi, who is close to Emperor Maximilian, said the emperor never listened to anyone’s advice and never made his own plans work. The emperor kept his plans secret and didn’t ask for advice. But when he started acting on his ideas, his ministers told him he was wrong, so he kept changing his mind. Because of this, no one knew what he really wanted, and no one could plan or respond to his policies.

A ruler should always ask for advice—but only when he wants it, not when others try to give it without being asked. He should also listen carefully when an adviser tells the truth. If he notices someone is too scared to speak up, he should show that he’s annoyed about it.

Many people think a ruler is smart because of the good advice from his ministers, but that’s wrong. A leader who isn’t smart himself can’t get good advice—unless he puts all the power in one very clever minister. But then that minister might take control for himself. If the ruler listens to many advisers, he’ll hear lots of different opinions and won’t know what to do. Each adviser thinks about what’s best for them, and the ruler can’t keep everything under control.

Philip of Macedonia didn’t have the resources of the Romans and Greeks who attacked him, but because he was a good soldier and leader who kept both the people and nobles happy, he held on to his kingdom for many years. Even though he lost some towns in the end, he didn’t lose his whole kingdom.
