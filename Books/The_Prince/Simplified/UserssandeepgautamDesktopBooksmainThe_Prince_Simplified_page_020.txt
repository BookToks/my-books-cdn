Three years later, Machiavelli was traveling with the future Pope Julius who was leading the pope’s army. Julius wanted to enter the town of Perugia. He walked in with only a small group of guards and told the local ruler, Giampaolo Baglioni, to leave or be defeated. Machiavelli thought Baglioni would just kill Julius, but to his surprise, Baglioni gave up and ran away. This showed how powerful the pope was. Then Julius marched north to attack Bologna. Because of this, Florence had to join a war it didn’t want to be part of.

As Secretary of the Ten of War, Machiavelli had one big moment of success in 1509. He was finally allowed to create a citizen army, and they defeated Pisa after a long fight. Many times before, hired soldiers had failed to take Pisa. This win proved Machiavelli right that citizen armies were better. It was also the only time in fourteen years that Soderini, a leader in Florence, made a successful move.

But everything else kept getting worse. Florence was only safe because others allowed it to be. Three years after Pisa was captured, Pope Julius teamed up with the Spanish and beat the French at Ravenna. Right after, he sent an army to Florence to bring back the Medici family and turn the city into a puppet controlled by Rome. Florence tried to fight back, but their army was crushed at Prato, just a few miles from the city.
