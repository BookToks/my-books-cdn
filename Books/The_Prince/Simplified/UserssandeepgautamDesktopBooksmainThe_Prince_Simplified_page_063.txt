Just like artists who want to draw landscapes go down into the valley to study the mountains and climb up the mountains to look down on the valley, you need to be a prince to understand the character of a people and a man.

There are different kinds of states, and to know the character of a prince is important to conquer them. Your Highness, please accept this small gift with the good intentions it holds. Study it carefully, and you will see that my biggest wish is for you to reach the greatness your position and qualities promise.

Then, if from the high place of your power, you ever look down at those below, you will notice how unfairly and unkindly life often treats people.

All states and governments that have ever ruled people have been either republics or monarchies. Monarchies can be hereditary, meaning the ruler's family has been in charge for generations, or they can be new.

New monarchies can be completely new, like when Francesco Sforza took over Milan, or they can be lands added to an old hereditary kingdom by conquest, like when the King of Spain took Naples.

A new territory won by conquest might be used to having a monarch or might be used to ruling themselves. It might be taken over by the new ruler’s own army, by another army, by luck, or by right.

I won’t talk about republics because I have written about them before. When a monarchy is new, things are harder.
