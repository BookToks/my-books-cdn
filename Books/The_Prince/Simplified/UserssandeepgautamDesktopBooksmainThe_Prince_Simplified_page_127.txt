A ruler and his promises

Going back to the question of whether a ruler should be feared or loved, my conclusion is this: people decide for themselves if they want to love a ruler, but it’s the ruler who decides if people should fear him. So, a smart ruler will base his power on what he can control, not on what others can choose. But he must be careful that people don’t end up hating him.

Everyone knows it’s good for a ruler to keep his promises and be honest instead of lying. But nowadays, we have seen leaders who did great things without worrying too much about keeping their promises. By being clever and outsmarting their enemies, these leaders accomplished more than honest ones.

A leader should remember there are two ways to fight: using laws and using force. Usually, humans use laws and animals use force. But since laws alone often don’t work, it makes sense to use force sometimes too.

So, a ruler must be able to use both the human and animal sides of himself. Long ago, stories were told to teach this lesson. For example, leaders like Achilles were sent to a centaur named Chiron to be trained. The centaur was half-man and half-beast, showing that a ruler needs both sides to survive.

Since a ruler has to act like an animal sometimes, he should have the qualities of both a fox and a lion. The lion can’t protect itself from traps, and the fox can’t protect itself from wolves. So, you have to be like the fox to spot traps and like the lion to scare away wolves. A ruler who only acts like a lion and forgets to be like a fox doesn’t know what he’s doing.

That’s why a smart leader can’t always keep his promises if doing so puts him in danger. And if the reasons he gave his word in the first place are no longer true, he should change his actions.
