Soderini got away and the Medici family came back. Machiavelli lost his job and couldn’t find a new one.

The shocking part of The Prince wasn’t because Machiavelli wanted to surprise people on purpose. At first, the book was called On Principalities. It starts by sorting out different types of states and governments at different times in history. Then, it looks at old and new history to find some basic rules about how to gain and keep power in each type of state. Because Machiavelli knew a lot and was very honest, he had to say that sometimes, to win and keep political power, a leader had to do things that normal people would think were wrong. He explained that once a leader wins, people won’t punish them. Leaders are above the law.

If Machiavelli had complained about this sad truth, or talked about other ways to judge a leader besides just staying in power and making a strong state, or said that power isn’t worth it if you have to lose your morals, he might have avoided a lot of criticism. But except for a few small comments wishing the world was a nicer place, Machiavelli doesn’t do this.
