A minister running a state should never think about himself, only about the ruler, and focus only on the ruler’s business. To make sure the minister does this, the ruler must care about him, give him money and respect, help him, and share honors and jobs with him. This way, the minister will know he can’t live without the ruler. He will have so many honors that he won’t want more, so much money that he won’t look for more, and so many jobs that he will want to keep things the same.

There’s another important problem to think about, which smart rulers can avoid by choosing their ministers carefully. I’m talking about flatterers.

Courts are always full of these flatterers. People like to praise themselves and think they are better than they really are, so it’s easy to fall for this mistake. But if you try to protect yourself from flatterers, you risk having people hate you.

The only way to stop flattery is to show that you don’t mind people telling you the truth. But if everyone can tell you the truth whenever they want, you lose respect.

So a smart ruler should find a middle way. He should pick smart men as ministers and only let them tell him the truth, and only about things he asks. The ruler should ask his ministers about everything and listen to what they say, but then decide on his own. He should make it clear that the more honestly they speak, the more welcome their advice is. After that, he shouldn’t listen to anyone else but should stick to his decisions firmly. If he tries anything else, he’ll either be ruined by flatterers or keep changing his mind so much that people stop respecting him.
