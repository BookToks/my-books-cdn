He couldn’t keep the first people who believed in him or force the doubters to change their minds. But any new leader who takes over a state by luck will face big problems and dangers, mostly at the start, and must use his own skills to get through them. Once he does that and gets rid of those who don’t like what he’s done, so that people begin to respect and admire him, then he can enjoy his power safely and live with honor and satisfaction.

I’ve talked about four amazing leaders, but now I want to mention a less impressive man, Hiero of Syracuse, who didn’t have to try hard to take control of his state but still needed some of the same qualities as the others and would have to work hard to keep it. Hiero was originally just a regular citizen who became king. The luck he had was in how things started: the people of Syracuse were threatened by Carthage, so they chose him as their army leader, and since he did well, they made him king. Even as a regular person, he was capable, and one writer said about him: “He had everything it takes to be a king except the kingdom.”

Hiero got rid of the old army and made a new one. He broke old alliances and made new ones; with his own soldiers and friends supporting him, he built the base for whatever he wanted. It took him a lot of effort to gain power, but once he had it, it was easy to keep.

These kinds of men depend completely on the people who gave them power, which is very risky and unstable. They don’t know how to hold on to power and even if they did, they probably couldn’t. This is because, unless they are very talented, their lives as regular people don’t prepare them to be leaders. Also, they don’t have an army that they can trust to stay loyal. Like anything that appears suddenly and grows quickly, new regimes have weak foundations and usually fall apart in the first big problem. Unless, of course, the man suddenly made ruler is very special.
