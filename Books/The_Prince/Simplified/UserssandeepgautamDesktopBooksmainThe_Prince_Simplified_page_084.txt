Before Alexander came to power, the situation was unstable, and he had to weaken his rivals to take control of some of their lands. This was easier than expected because the Venetians wanted to bring the French back into Italy. Instead of fighting this, the pope helped by ending King Louis’s first marriage.

So, the French king entered Italy with help from Venice and the pope’s approval. As soon as he took Milan, the pope got the king to send troops to help his son, Cesare Borgia, take Romagna. Without the king’s support, this wouldn’t have been possible. Borgia had two big problems: his own army, which he thought might betray him, and French politics. He used the Orsini family’s forces but was afraid they might stop listening to him, which could stop him from gaining more land.

Borgia also worried about the King of France. After capturing Faenza, he attacked Bologna, but his soldiers didn’t seem happy. When he took Urbino and tried to move into Tuscany, the French king told him to stop. After that, Borgia decided not to rely on others’ armies again.

When Pope Alexander VI made his son a powerful duke, there were many challenges. Borgia couldn’t make him ruler anywhere except Church lands because giving away Church land would upset the Duke of Milan and the Venetians. Since Faenza and Rimini were already protected by Venice, this was a problem. Also, most armies in Italy were controlled by families like the Orsini and Colonna, who didn’t trust the pope because they feared his power.

So, Borgia weakened these families by paying their supporters well and giving them important jobs. Soon, old loyalties were forgotten, and everyone supported the duke. After breaking the Colonna leaders, he waited for more help. If a ruler is lucky enough to get power, they should work hard to protect it and build a strong base, just like Borgia tried to do.
