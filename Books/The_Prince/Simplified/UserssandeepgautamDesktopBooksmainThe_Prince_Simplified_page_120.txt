In our own time, the only leaders who did great things were known for being mean. The others failed. Pope Julius II used his reputation for being generous to become pope, but then he quickly spent money on his wars. The current King of France has fought many wars without raising new taxes because he is always cutting costs. The King of Spain wouldn’t have won so many wars if he was known for being generous.

If we look at generosity, it sounds nice to be seen as generous. But a ruler doesn’t have to steal from his people or others, and being generous just for show can hurt him. A ruler who is truly generous shouldn’t worry about being called mean because being mean can actually help keep him in power. Some might say generosity helped Caesar win the empire and others rise to power, but I say: a ruler who already has power must be careful with generosity. Caesar wanted power, and he was willing to spend a lot to get it.

If a ruler already in power gives away too much, he will run out of money. Then, to keep his reputation, he will have to raise special taxes and find other ways to get cash. People will start to hate him, and no one will respect him if he has no money left. Since his generosity helps only a few and hurts most, he is in danger of being overthrown. If he tries to stop being generous, people will call him mean.

Some might argue that many great military leaders were very generous. But either a ruler spends his own or his people’s money, or someone else’s. When a ruler spends his own or his subjects’ money, he should be careful. When he spends someone else’s money, he should be as generous as possible.

A smart ruler doesn’t mind being called mean if it means he won’t have to raise taxes or risk losing power. Over time, if people see he can protect the country without hurting them, they will think he is generous – generous to almost everyone because he doesn’t take from them.

A ruler who leads armies and lives by taking things from others should be generous with that money, or his soldiers won’t follow him. Giving away other people’s money doesn’t lower his status – it actually makes him look more generous. Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander all did this. Spending other people’s money freely is a smart move for a ruler.
