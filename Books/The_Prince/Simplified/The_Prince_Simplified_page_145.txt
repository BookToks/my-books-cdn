At that time, no foreign enemies could help the people. Later, her fortresses didn’t protect her when Cesare Borgia attacked the town, and the people, who didn’t like her, fought for him. She would have been safer if she had tried to get along with the people instead of just trusting her fortresses.

I think rulers who build fortresses and those who don’t both have their reasons. But I will always criticize any ruler who thinks it doesn’t matter if people hate him and only relies on fortresses for safety. Nothing makes a ruler respected like big military wins and showing strong personal qualities.

A good example is Ferdinand of Aragon, the King of Spain. At first, he was a weak king, but he became one of the most famous and respected leaders in Christendom. He did amazing things. Early in his reign, he invaded Granada, which helped him gain power. He did this when things were calm at home, so he didn’t have to worry about problems inside Spain. The war kept the Castilian nobles busy so they couldn’t cause trouble, while Ferdinand’s power quietly grew.

He used money from the Church and the people to support his armies, which let him fight a long war and build a strong military for the future. After that, to get even more support from the Church, he cruelly took wealth from the Marrano Jews and kicked them out of his kingdom—a shocking and painful move.

He also attacked Africa, then Italy, and finally France, always under the cover of religion. He kept planning and doing great things, keeping his people focused on his campaigns. So, when you think about staying neutral, remember: ignoring these actions could hurt your interests. You won’t get any thanks or results from being passive.
