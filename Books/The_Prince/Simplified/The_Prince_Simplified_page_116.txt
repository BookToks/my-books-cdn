When a leader comes back to lead his army, he must always think about war. There is nothing that can happen that he doesn’t know how to handle. He must prepare for war even more during peace time than during war.

He can do this in two ways: physically and mentally. Physically, besides keeping his soldiers fit and disciplined, he should go hunting a lot. This will make his body stronger. It will also help him learn about different kinds of land—how mountains rise, how valleys open up, what plains look like, and where rivers and marshes are. This knowledge is useful in two ways. First, it helps him understand his own country better, so he can defend it well. Second, knowing about land like hills, valleys, plains, rivers, and marshes will make it easier to understand new places he hasn’t seen before. For example, the hills and valleys in Tuscany are similar to those in other places, so if you know one, it’s easier to learn another.

A leader who doesn’t understand the land is missing something very important. Knowing the land helps you find the enemy, lead your army the right way, choose a good place to camp, plan battles, and attack or defend towns in the best way.

Another important thing a leader must do is read history, especially stories about great leaders and their achievements. He should study their war strategies, learn why they won or lost, and try to copy their successes while avoiding their mistakes. Above all, he should follow the example of a leader who is admired. For instance, Alexander the Great copied Achilles, Caesar copied Alexander, and Scipio copied Cyrus. If you read about their lives, you see how useful these examples were. A smart leader never relaxes in peace but works hard to prepare so when hard times come, he is ready.

One famous leader, Philopoemen, even in peace time, always thought about war. When he was with friends, he would stop and ask questions like: If the enemy was on that hill and we were down here, who would have the better position? How could we attack without breaking our lines? What if we had to retreat? How would we do that? What if the enemy retreated, how would we catch them? As they walked, he would talk about all the problems an army might face.

He listened to his friends’ ideas and shared his own. A leader who works hard like this will earn respect from his soldiers and they will trust him.
