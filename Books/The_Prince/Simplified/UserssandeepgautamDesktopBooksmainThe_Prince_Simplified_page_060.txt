People who want to get on good terms with a ruler usually give him something they really care about or something they know he likes a lot. So rulers often get gifts like horses, weapons, gold cloth, jewels, and other fancy things.

I wanted to show Your Highness that I am loyal, and I realized that nothing is more valuable to me than my knowledge about great people and what they did. I learned this through a lot of experience with current events and by studying old history. After thinking hard about everything I’ve learned, I wrote it all down in a short book that I am now sending to Your Highness.

Even though this gift might seem small compared to what you deserve, I believe the knowledge inside will be useful to you. Especially because I am giving you the chance to understand in just a few hours what I have learned through many years of hard work and danger. 

I didn’t make the book fancy or fill it with long, complicated sentences or big, showy words like many writers do. I only wanted it to focus on the important and serious topic it talks about. I also hope you won’t think it’s rude that someone like me, who comes from a very low social position, is trying to talk about how princes should rule.
