Alexander the Great took over the Kingdom of Darius, and the barons there had special rights that only a king could take away. Because of this, the kingdom didn’t rebel against Alexander or his successors after his death. Why?  

Looking at two types of states, it’s clear that Turkey is hard to conquer but easy to keep control of once you do. France, on the other hand, is easier to conquer but much harder to hold onto.  

The reason it’s hard to conquer a place like Turkey is that there aren’t any barons to invite you in, and you can’t expect anyone to help you by rebelling against their king. All the people there are loyal servants to their ruler and don’t have a reason to betray him.  

Now that we know how tough it is to keep control of land you’ve taken, some might remember what happened when Alexander conquered Asia. He died soon after his victory, but instead of the area rebelling, his successors kept control. The only problems they had were because of their own fights and personal goals.  

To understand this, remember that all monarchies are run one of two ways: either by a king and his appointed ministers, or by a king and several barons who keep their power because their families have had it for a long time.  

Barons have their own lands and subjects who are loyal to them. When a state is ruled by a king and his ministers, the king is more powerful because he is the only person everyone sees as the boss. People only obey others because the king says so, not because they feel loyal to them.  

Turkey is an example of a kingdom ruled by one ruler, or sultan. Everyone serves him, and he divides the land into provinces and sends administrators who work for him. He can hire and fire them whenever he wants.  

France is different. The King of France is surrounded by many barons who have had their rights for a very long time and are loved by their subjects.  

In countries like France, you can win support from some barons who don’t like the king and want change. These barons can help you take over. But after you win, it’s very hard to keep control because you have to deal with those who fought with you, those who fought against you, and the barons who don’t want to lose their power.
