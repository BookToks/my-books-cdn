It’s normal that when you try to avoid one danger, you end up facing another. Being smart means understanding the risks and picking the smaller problem.  

A leader should also appreciate when others do well. He should give jobs to talented people and reward those who are really good at their work. He should make sure his people feel safe to do their jobs, like being merchants, farmers, or anything else, without worrying about losing their money or being taxed too much if they start a business.  

Choosing the right ministers is very important for a leader. Good ministers show that the leader is smart, while bad ones give a bad impression. If the ministers are loyal and capable, people will respect the leader because he can see their talents and earn their trust. But if the ministers are not good, people will criticize the leader because he chose poorly.  

At the right times, the leader should organize fun events and festivals. Since cities have different groups and neighborhoods, the leader should respect these groups and visit their meetings to show he cares, but still keep his authority.  

There are three types of minds: one understands things on its own, another understands what someone else has learned, and the last one understands nothing. The first kind is the best, the second is useful, and the third is useless. Pandolfo didn’t have the first kind, but he had the second. If a person can tell what’s right and wrong in someone else’s ideas, even if they can’t come up with ideas themselves, they can still support the good ones and fix the bad ones. This makes the minister realize he can’t trick the leader and needs to behave well.  

One sure way to judge a minister is to see if he thinks for himself or just follows orders. If he thinks for himself, that’s better. But the leader should remember that any decision can be risky.
