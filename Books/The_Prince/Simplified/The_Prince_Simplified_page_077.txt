If we look back at the Kingdom of Darius, it was a Turkish kingdom. So, Alexander first had to defeat its entire army and take control of the country. But once he did that, and after Darius died, he was safely in charge for the reasons mentioned before.

If his followers had stayed united, they could have ruled the area without problems. The only trouble would have been the fights they started themselves. But places set up like the French way can never be held easily.

When you invade states that were used to ruling themselves without a king and living under their own laws, there are three ways to keep control. The first way is to destroy them completely. The second is to move there yourself. The third is to let them live under their own laws, make them pay taxes, and put a few local leaders in charge to keep things friendly.

Since the invading ruler sets up this government, the local leaders know they can’t survive without his support. They will do anything to keep his power. If you decide not to destroy the place, the best way to control a self-governing city is with help from its own people.

Let’s look at Sparta and Rome as examples. The Spartans controlled Athens and Thebes by putting local people in charge, but they eventually lost those cities. The Romans destroyed Capua, Carthage, and Numantia to hold onto them. They tried to control Greece like the Spartans did, letting it keep its laws, but it didn’t work. In the end, they had to destroy many cities to keep control of the whole area.

The truth is, the only sure way to hold places used to ruling themselves is to destroy them. If you conquer a city that was used to self-government and don’t destroy it, you can expect it to destroy you.
