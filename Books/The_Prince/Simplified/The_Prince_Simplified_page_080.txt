They have to set up a new way of running things and new rules. Even though we don’t know much about Moses, since he followed God’s orders, we should still admire him for being chosen by God. But let’s also think about Cyrus and other men who became kings and started kingdoms. When we study what they did and the systems they created, we see they aren’t very different from what Moses did with God’s help.

Starting a new government is really hard. The person making the changes will make enemies of people who liked the old way, while the people who might benefit from the new way won’t fully support it. This is partly because they are scared of the opponents, who still control the laws, and partly because people don’t usually trust change until they see it actually works. So, when the opponents see a chance, they attack hard, while the supporters only try a little, which makes the new leader’s position weak.

To understand this better, we have to ask: Does the leader have his own resources, or does he need other people’s help? Does he have to beg for help to reach his goals, or can he make things happen by himself? If he has to ask for help, he will probably fail. But if he has his own power and can push his plans through, then he’s less likely to be in serious danger. That’s why leaders with an army usually win, while those without one often lose.

We also need to remember that the public’s mood changes. It’s easy to get people excited about something new, but it’s hard to keep them believing in it. So when people stop trusting you, you have to be able to make them believe again.

Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus couldn’t have kept people following their new laws for long if they didn’t have armed forces. We saw in our times that states won by the ruler’s own army lasted longer. The first problems come because setting up a government and keeping it safe is tough.

For leaders who became rulers because of their own skills, like Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, and Theseus, the initial struggle was hard, but once they were in power, they held on to it fairly easily.
