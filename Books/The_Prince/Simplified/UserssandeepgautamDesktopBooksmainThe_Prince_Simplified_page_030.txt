After being shared for years as a handwritten copy and then in a printed Latin version called On Principalities, the book finally came out in Italian in 1532. But in 1559, Pope Paul IV banned it, partly because the English cardinal Reginald Pole said it was written by ‘Satan’s finger’ and blamed The Prince for Henry VIII’s decision to break away from the Roman Church.

Meanwhile, in France, the fight between the Protestant Huguenots and the Catholics was getting worse. This tension would explode during the rule of the weak young king Charles IX, who was mostly controlled by his mother, Catherine de’ Medici. She was Italian, from Florence, and the daughter of Lorenzo de’ Medici, the same man Machiavelli had dedicated The Prince to. Catherine brought many Italian friends to the French court, which made the French people dislike Italians even more. She tried to calm the religious fighting that was tearing France apart, but she was blamed for the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre in 1572, when thousands of Huguenots were killed. One person who almost died, Innocent Gentillet, escaped to Protestant Geneva and wrote a book called Discours contre Machiavel, which started a long history of people criticizing Machiavelli.

This book was meant to attack Catherine de’ Medici and the strong French Catholics while defending the Huguenots. It said Catherine loved reading Machiavelli and, using the dislike of Italians, claimed that both the queen and Machiavelli showed a cruel and evil side of Italian character.
