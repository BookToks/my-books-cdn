Of course, when dealing with complaints and not getting scared, there are always reasons for taking people’s stuff and not just for no reason. A leader should stay calm and careful. A ruler who learns to act this way will always find reasons to take more power or property. But if he trusts too much, he’ll get careless, and if he trusts no one, he’ll become unbearable. Good reasons for punishing someone happen less often and don’t last long.

This makes us ask: is it better to be loved or feared? It’s best to be both, but since that’s hard, it’s safer to be feared than loved. Most people are ungrateful and unreliable; they lie, cheat, want money, and run away when things get tough. When things are calm, they might seem loyal and would do anything for you, but when danger comes, they turn their backs. A ruler who only trusts promises and nothing else will lose in the end.

Men care more about letting down someone who loves them than someone who just scares them. Love creates bonds when someone feels grateful, but people forget that easily. Fear is about punishment, which people never forget. Hannibal was great because he led a big, mixed army far from home without any fights or rebellions. His soldiers respected and feared him. Without his cruelty, his good qualities wouldn’t have worked. Historians admire him but also criticize his harshness because it made his success possible.

To prove Hannibal’s qualities weren’t enough alone, look at Scipio. He was a rare leader who was too relaxed and gave his soldiers too much freedom, which hurt discipline. His army even rebelled in Spain. Fabius Maximus said Scipio spoiled the Roman army. When some officers looted a town, Scipio didn’t punish them, showing he was soft. If he had kept being easy, his army might have fallen apart.

Still, a ruler who wants to be feared must avoid being hated. Being feared can be good if the ruler doesn’t steal from people or hurt their families. If someone must be executed, it should only happen for a good reason. Above all, a ruler must not take other people’s property. People forget the death of their father sooner than they forget losing their inheritance.

So, a leader must think carefully before trusting others and act with both cruelty and kindness when needed.
