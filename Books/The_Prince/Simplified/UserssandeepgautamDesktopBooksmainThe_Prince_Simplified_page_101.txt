These towns are super well protected, so everyone knows it would be really hard and tiring to attack them. They all have big moats and strong walls. They also have the right weapons and public warehouses stocked with food, drink, and firewood to last a whole year. Plus, to keep people fed without spending too much money, they store materials for a year’s work in the trades that keep the city alive and the people working.

They take military training seriously and make sure everyone practices regularly. 

An important question to ask when thinking about these states is: if attacked, does a ruler have enough power to defend himself, or will he have to rely on others? To be more specific, a ruler who has enough men or money to build an army that can fight anyone is able to defend himself. But if a ruler can’t fight outside the city and has to hide behind his walls, he will always need outside help.

Some might say, what if people have houses outside the walls and watch them burn? Won’t they get impatient and worried about their future and forget about their ruler?

A strong leader with power and personality will handle problems like this. He can make people hopeful that the siege won’t last long. He can scare them with stories about how cruel the enemy is. He can act fast to stop anyone who seems too rebellious. Also, it’s clear the enemy will be burning the countryside as they get closer to the town, but the people inside will still want to fight. This actually helps the ruler because after a few days, when the excitement fades, the damage is done and people will support their leader even more. They’ll feel tied to him not just for the good he’s done but also for protecting them during tough times.

German cities are totally independent. They don’t have much land around them and only listen to the emperor when it suits him. They aren’t scared of him or any other powerful leader. It’s just human nature to stick with a leader who has helped you, especially when you’ve suffered together.
