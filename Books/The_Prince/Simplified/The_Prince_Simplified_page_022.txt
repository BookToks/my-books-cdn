It wasn’t his idea. Instead, he assumes we already understand that life, especially politics, is often really harsh and sometimes unbelievably cruel. Once someone is in power, they might have no choice but to kill or be killed.

This is where words like ‘must’ and ‘have to’ sound really serious. The Prince is most powerful and shocking not because of its famous sayings—like “the end justifies the means,” or “people must be treated either very well or crushed,” or “the best way to keep a conquered land is to destroy it completely.” It’s because of the many real stories Machiavelli shares about cruel actions that just had to happen.

For example, the Venetians notice their mercenary leader Carmagnola isn’t trying hard in battle anymore. But they’re scared that if they fire him, he might take the land he won for them. So, the only safe choice was to kill him. 

Another story is about Hiero of Syracuse, who takes charge of the army only to find they are all mercenaries. He realizes he can’t use them or let them go, so he has them all killed.

The most extreme example is Cesare Borgia, who Machiavelli shows as a model for anyone wanting to win a state—like building a house or starting a business. Borgia had a cruel helper, Remirro de Orco, who helped him control and unite a region called Romagna. To stop people from hating himself, Borgia blamed all the bad things on de Orco and then killed him. He even displayed de Orco’s body in the town square with a wooden block and bloody knife beside it.
