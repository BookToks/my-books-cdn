Between these missions, he was often busy with Florence’s ongoing war to take back Pisa. Pisa had become independent again during the French invasion. Pisa was very important for Florence’s trade because it gave the city access to the sea.

People usually say Machiavelli wasn’t a great diplomat. They think these years were only useful because they gave him ideas for his writing after he lost his job.

But Machiavelli wouldn’t have agreed. For more than ten years, he was Florence’s top diplomat and proud of it. If his missions didn’t have big successes, it was mostly because he was working for the weakest major state in Italy during a very confusing and dangerous time. Four foreign powers—France, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and Switzerland—were all fighting in Italy.

Savonarola pushed Florence to team up with France. The leaders after him kept this idea but had no clear plan for how the city could stay safe and stable in the future. Things got worse when, in 1502, the Florentines decided their leader, called the gonfaloniere, should be chosen for life. They picked Piero Soderini, a good man but someone who couldn’t make strong or bold choices.
