In 1471, Francesco della Rovere became Pope Sixtus IV. Sixtus was known for favoring his family and friends. In 1478, he took part in the Pazzi conspiracy to overthrow the Medici family in Florence.

After the failed attempt to kill Lorenzo il Magnifico and the execution of the attackers, Sixtus excommunicated Lorenzo and placed Florence under church punishment. He teamed up with Naples and declared war on the city.

Sixtus’s nephew, Giuliano della Rovere, later became Pope Julius II in 1503.

Francesco Sforza (1401–66) was the most successful soldier-for-hire of his time. He often fought for Filippo Visconti, Duke of Milan. Visconti had only one daughter, Bianca Maria, who married Sforza to keep him on Milan’s side.

After Visconti died in 1447, the people of Milan declared the city a republic. Sforza first fought for the republic against Venice but then betrayed it and made himself duke in 1450.

Giocomo (Muzio) Attendolo Sforza (1369–1424) was Francesco’s father. He joined a mercenary army in the 1380s and earned the nickname Sforza for his strength and determination. He often fought against Braccio da Montone, another famous mercenary. Sforza died while serving Joanna of Naples.

Ludovico Sforza (1452–1508) was Francesco’s second son and Duke of Milan from 1494 to 1500. When his older brother, Galeazzo Maria, was killed in 1476, Ludovico took control of Milan, even though the title passed to Galeazzo’s young son.

Ludovico supported the French king Charles VIII’s claim to Naples and encouraged his invasion of Italy in 1494. Later, he joined an alliance called the League of Venice to push the French out of Italy.

In 1499, Ludovico lost Milan to the French but briefly regained it in 1500. He was eventually defeated and imprisoned until his death in 1508. Ludovico is best remembered for supporting Leonardo da Vinci.

Antonio da Venafro (1459–1530) helped Pandolfo Petrucci become ruler of Siena and became his top adviser. Antonio did important diplomatic work and was involved in political plots. After Petrucci’s family lost power in 1516, Antonio went back to his hometown but later worked for the government of Naples, where he died.

These historical events show how power struggles, family ties, and wars shaped Italy during this time.
