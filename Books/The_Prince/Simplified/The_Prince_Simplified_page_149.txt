It’s normal that when you try to avoid one problem, you might run into another. Being smart means knowing how to judge dangers and pick the smaller problem to deal with.

A ruler should also respect people who do good work. He should give jobs to talented people and reward those who are really good at what they do. 

He needs to make sure people can do their jobs—like merchants or farmers—without worrying that their money will be taken or that they’ll get taxed too much if they start a business. Instead, a ruler should encourage people who want to work hard and help grow the city or country.

Choosing the right ministers is very important for a ruler. Good ministers show the ruler is smart and responsible. Bad choices will make people criticize the ruler. If ministers are loyal and capable, people will respect the ruler because he knows how to pick the right leaders.

At the right times, the ruler should also hold fun events like shows and festivals. Since every city has different groups and neighborhoods, he should respect these groups and visit their meetings sometimes. This shows he cares but still keeps control.

Everyone who knew Antonio da Venafro, a minister for Pandolfo Petrucci in Siena, thought Pandolfo was really smart for choosing him. There are three types of minds: one that understands things on its own, one that understands things by learning from others, and one that understands nothing at all. The first is the best, the second is good, and the third is useless.

Pandolfo didn’t have the first kind of mind, but he had the second. This means even if he couldn’t come up with new ideas, he could tell which of his ministers’ ideas were good or bad, support the good ones, and fix the bad ones. The ministers knew they couldn’t trick the ruler, so they had to behave well.

There’s one sure way to tell if a minister is trustworthy: if he thinks more about himself than about the ruler or the country, and if all his plans only help himself, then he’s not a good minister and you can’t trust him.
