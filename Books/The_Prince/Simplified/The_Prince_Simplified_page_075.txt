Alexander the Great conquered a big kingdom ruled by Darius. This kingdom didn’t rebel right after Alexander’s death. Looking at two types of states, it’s clear that Turkey is really hard to conquer, but once you do, it’s easy to keep control. Why is that?

France, on the other hand, is easier to conquer but much harder to hold onto.

The reason Turkey is hard to conquer is because there are no local leaders, or barons, who can help an invader by rebelling against their king. Since everyone serves the king directly, it’s hard to bribe or turn them against him. Also, the king doesn’t let local people join the invading army. So, anyone attacking Turkey will find the country united against them and will have to rely only on their own soldiers.

Once you win and defeat the enemy’s armies, the only threat left is the king and his family. If you get rid of them, no one else can challenge you because the people only obey the king or his officials. But if there are barons with their own lands and followers, they have their own power and loyalty from the people.

In countries like Turkey, the king is very powerful because everyone recognizes him as the top leader. But in countries like France, power is shared with barons who inherited their positions. When you try to take over France, you can win support from some unhappy barons who want change. These barons can help you at first, but later they will cause problems.

After winning in France, you will have a hard time keeping control because the barons will always want more power. You can’t give them everything, and you can’t get rid of all of them. So, when your enemies get a chance, these barons might rebel and make you lose the land you took.

How to rule cities and states is different depending on whether they have strong kings or powerful barons.
