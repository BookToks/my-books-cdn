Because each thing happens because of the one before it, the ruler never gave powerful men in the country any free time between wars to plan against him.

A leader can also gain respect by showing strong character in how he handles problems at home, like Bernabo` Visconti did in Milan. Whenever someone does something big, good or bad, in civil life, people think up rewards or punishments that cause a buzz. But most importantly, a ruler must make sure everyone thinks he is a great person with amazing skills.

A ruler will be respected when he is a true friend and a true enemy, meaning he clearly takes one side and opposes the other. This approach usually works better than staying neutral. For example, if you have two powerful neighbors who go to war, you might or might not fear the winner afterward. Either way, it’s smarter to pick a side and fight hard.

If you have a reason to be afraid but stay neutral, you will still get swallowed up by the winner, who will feel happy about it, while the loser will be angry with you. You won’t have any excuses or ways to defend yourself.

It’s important that a ruler never teams up with someone stronger just to attack his enemies, unless it’s absolutely necessary. When you win, you’ll owe your ally, and rulers should avoid being controlled by anyone else.

For example, when Antiochus was sent to Greece to fight the Romans, he asked the Achaeans to stay neutral. But the Romans told them to join their side instead. The Achaeans talked about it, and after Antiochus asked for neutrality, the Roman ambassador replied strongly.

In general, a ruler should never think any decision he makes is completely safe. Instead, he should expect that every choice could be risky.
