When translating The Prince, one big question is: what words would we use today to explain the ideas Machiavelli talks about?

Sometimes, there aren’t modern words because some things, like siege engines or cavalry attacks, aren’t common anymore. But mostly, Machiavelli is interested in how people think and act, especially during tough situations. If the translator avoids using confusing modern slang, they can explain The Prince clearly in today’s English.

But it’s hard to choose the right words because Machiavelli’s grammar and sentence structure are all over the place. He wrote The Prince in 1513, so even Italians today find it hard to understand. New versions usually have the original text next to a modern Italian translation.

For Italian readers, the problem isn’t the words themselves — they understand about 90% of them. The real problem is that Machiavelli’s writing is very compressed, uses old and strange grammar, and has lots of complicated sentence parts that modern readers aren’t used to.
