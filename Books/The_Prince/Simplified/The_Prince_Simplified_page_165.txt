Machiavelli expected his readers to know about the famous people he talked about from recent times, but not so much about the ones from ancient history. To help today’s readers, I have given more information about the people from modern history and less about those from Roman times or earlier.

Achilles was a Greek hero in the Trojan War. He was the son of the immortal nymph Thetis and was raised by a centaur named Chiron.

Giovanni Acuto is the Italian name for John Hawkwood (1320–1394). He fought with the English army in France, then joined mercenary soldiers in Burgundy. Later, he led the White Company, a group of soldiers who fought for different states in Italy. He was smart and made a lot of money by playing his employers against their enemies. From 1390, he led the armies of Florence in their war against the Visconti family of Milan.

Agathocles (361–289 BC) was the ruler of Syracuse from 317 to 289 BC and the King of Sicily from 304 to 289 BC. He took power in Syracuse by forcing out and killing thousands of people. He built a strong army and controlled Sicily, which caused a long fight with Carthage.

Albinus, whose full name was Decimus Clodius Ceionius Septimius (around 150–197 AD), was a Roman military leader in Britain. After the murder of Emperor Pertinax in 193 AD, Albinus declared himself emperor. At first, he worked with Severus, who also claimed to be emperor in Rome, but they later became enemies. In 197, Albinus lost a battle to Severus.
