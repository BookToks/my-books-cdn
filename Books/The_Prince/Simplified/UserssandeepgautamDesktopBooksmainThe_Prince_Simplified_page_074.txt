Alexander the Great conquered many lands, including the Kingdom of Darius. This kingdom didn’t rebel against him, even though he died soon after. Why? Because some places, like Turkey, are really hard to conquer but easy to keep control of once you do.

On the other hand, places like France are easier to conquer but much harder to hold onto.

The reason Turkey is hard to conquer is that there are no powerful local leaders, called barons, to help an invader. Also, people don’t rebel to make the invasion easier. This is because everyone serves the king and owes him loyalty, so it’s hard to bribe or trick them. Since Alexander couldn’t bring local people to help him, his successors only had problems from their own fights, not from local rebellions.

Most monarchies are run in one of two ways: either by a king and his appointed ministers or by a king and powerful barons who hold their positions because of family heritage. Barons have their own lands and people who obey them. In a kingdom ruled only by a king and his ministers, like Turkey, the king is very powerful because everyone answers only to him. There are no barons to cause trouble or challenge the king’s rule.

In countries like France, the king has many barons who have rights going back a long time. These barons are loved and respected by their people. This makes France easier to invade since you can win over a baron or two who don’t like the king. They can help you gain a foothold.

But after winning, holding onto the land is much harder in places like France. You’ll face problems from people who fought for you and those who fought against you, plus struggles between different barons. In Turkey, once you win, you just need to deal with the king and his family. Remove them, and no one else can threaten you because the people don’t owe loyalty to anyone else.

So, conquering Turkey is tough, but keeping it is easier. Conquering France is easier, but holding it is much harder.
