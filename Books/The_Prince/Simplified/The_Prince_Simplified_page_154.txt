So, these rulers we have—kings and dukes who were already in charge but still lost their lands—should stop blaming bad luck. It’s really their own fault.  

When a new ruler takes over, they often don’t expect anything to change because things have been calm for so long. When trouble comes, their first reaction is to run away instead of fighting. They hope the people will get angry at the invaders and bring them back. That’s not a bad plan if you have no other choice, but relying on that is a big mistake. A ruler should never just accept losing power because they expect someone else to help them later.  

People pay more attention to what a new ruler does than what an old king did. If a new ruler does great things, people will trust and support him more than someone from a royal family. People care about what’s happening now, not the past. When things are good, they’ll stay loyal and defend their leader, as long as he doesn’t mess up in other ways. This way, a ruler can be proud of both starting a new kingdom and making it strong with good laws, a strong army, good allies, and smart policies.  

On the other hand, someone born into power who acts badly and loses it is embarrassed twice as much.  

Looking at recent Italian rulers who lost power—like the King of Naples and the Duke of Milan—we see they all had weak armies, which I already explained.  

Some didn’t have the people on their side, and even if they did, they couldn’t keep the nobles loyal. Without a strong army and support from both the people and nobles, you can’t keep your state.  

Philip of Macedonia, not Alexander’s dad but the other Philip who was defeated by Titus Quintius, didn’t have the resources of the Romans and Greeks attacking him. Still, because he was a good military leader and knew how to keep the people and nobles happy, he held on for many years. Even though he lost a few towns in the end, he kept control of his kingdom.
