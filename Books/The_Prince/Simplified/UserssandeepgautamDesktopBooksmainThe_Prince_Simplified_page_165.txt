Machiavelli expected his readers to know about the actions of the men he talks about from recent and modern times, but they might not have known much about some people from ancient history. To help today’s readers understand better, I have given more information about people from recent history and less about those from Roman times and earlier.

Achilles was a Greek hero in the Trojan War. He was the son of the immortal nymph Thetis and was raised by Chiron, the centaur.

Acuto, Giovanni is the Italian name for John Hawkwood (1320–1394). He fought in the English army in France, then joined mercenary soldiers in Burgundy in 1360. Later, he led the White Company, fighting for different groups in Italy. He was good at playing his employers against their enemies and became very rich. From 1390, he led the Florentine armies in their war against the Visconti family of Milan.

Agathocles (361–289 BC) was the ruler of Syracuse from 317 to 289 BC and King of Sicily from 304 to 289 BC. He took power in Syracuse by forcing out and killing thousands of people. He built a strong army and controlled Sicily, which caused a long fight with Carthage.

Albinus, whose full name was Decimus Clodius Ceionius Septimius (around 150–197), was a Roman military commander in Britain. After the murder of Emperor Pertinax in 193, Albinus declared himself emperor. At first, he teamed up with Severus in Rome, who also claimed to be emperor, but they later became enemies. In 197, after losing a battle, Albinus was defeated by Venetian forces fighting for Milan.
