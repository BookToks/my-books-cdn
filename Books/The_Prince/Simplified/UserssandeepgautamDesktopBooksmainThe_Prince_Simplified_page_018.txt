Machiavelli spent most of his job trying to stop other nearby countries from bothering Florence. He also tried to make sure Florence didn’t have to help with their wars by giving money or soldiers. If there was any long-term plan, it was mostly about avoiding trouble. When he was far from home, he often got confusing orders after he had already started talking with other leaders. When he got to other cities, he didn’t have enough money to pay messengers to send news back to Florence. Sometimes, he barely had enough money to eat or buy clothes. The more powerful kings didn’t respect him much, so he had to wait days or even weeks before he could meet them.

Because of these problems, Machiavelli became really focused on the idea of creating an army made up of regular citizens, which you can see a lot in his book, The Prince.

Florence was weak not just because it was small but mainly because it didn’t have its own army. It used mercenaries—soldiers for hire—who were known to run away when things got hard, like when they were defending Pisa.

Machiavelli thought that having a strong, loyal citizen army would give him more power and respect when he talked to other leaders. At least, that’s what he hoped.

In June 1502, after working for four years, Machiavelli met Cesare Borgia, who was the son of Pope Alexander VI.
