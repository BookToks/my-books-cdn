Since each event happens because of the one before it, the ruler never gave the powerful men in the country any free time between wars to plot against him.

A leader can also gain respect by showing strong character in how he handles problems at home, like Bernabo` Visconti did in Milan. Whenever someone does something big, good or bad, in public life, people come up with rewards or punishments to make a point. But most importantly, a ruler must make sure people think he’s a great person with special skills.

A ruler will also be respected when he’s a true friend and a real enemy, meaning he clearly supports one side and opposes the other. This is better than staying neutral. For example, if you have two powerful neighbors who go to war, you might or might not be afraid of the winner afterward. Either way, it’s better to pick a side and fight hard. If you have to fear someone but stay neutral, the winner will still take over you, and the loser will be happy about it; you’ll have no excuses or protection.

A ruler should never team up with someone stronger just to attack his enemies, unless it’s absolutely necessary. When you win, you’ll be at your ally’s mercy, and rulers should avoid putting themselves under someone else’s control. The Venetians joined France to fight the Duke of Milan, which they could have avoided, and it ended badly. But if an alliance can’t be avoided, like when Florence had to choose between the pope and Spain attacking Lombardy, the ruler must pick a side for the reasons explained above.

No ruler should ever think any decision is totally safe; in fact, every choice can be risky.
