If you don’t do everything needed right at the start, and you set up a government with Oliverotto as the leader because you were badly advised or too scared, then you’ll always have to keep using force. You’ll never be able to trust your people, because if you use violence all the time, they won’t trust you back.

So, it’s better to get the violence over with as quickly as possible. That way, people will feel the harshness for a short time and then be less angry. On the other hand, favors should be given slowly, one at a time, so people can really appreciate them.

Oliverotto killed everyone who stood against him and built a new army and government. Within a year, he was the clear ruler of Fermo and a serious threat to nearby towns. Like Agathocles, it would have been really hard to remove Oliverotto if he hadn’t been tricked by Cesare Borgia. Borgia invited the Orsini and Vitelli men to Senigallia, and Oliverotto went with them. Just a year after killing his uncle, he was strangled along with his brave and cunning mentor.

You might wonder how people like Agathocles could stay in power for years, even with all their betrayals and cruelty, while others couldn’t keep control in peaceful times, let alone during war. The answer is how cruelty is used. If cruelty is used well—which means quickly and only as much as needed to secure power—then it stops. The leader then uses his power to help his people.

But if a leader isn’t harsh enough at first and then becomes more and more cruel, that’s bad. People will see him as weak and will never respect him. A leader who is harsh at the start has a chance to improve his relationship with his people and maybe even with God. The other way, there’s no chance at all.

When you take control of a state, you have to figure out how much violence you need and get it done fast. If you stop being violent after that, your people will feel safe and you can win their support. If a leader is surrounded by people who think they are his equals, it becomes hard for him to give orders or run things the way he wants.
