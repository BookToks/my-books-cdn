By the time his Baglionis, Vitellis, and Orsinis showed up, no one switched sides. Father had died, and he had already reached three of his four goals. Even though Borgia wasn’t able to pick who would be the new pope, at least he was in a position to stop anyone he didn’t want from winning.

He had killed all the local rulers he could get rid of, and hardly anyone had escaped. He had also won over the Roman nobility and had huge influence over the Electoral College. When it came to expanding his land, he wanted to be the master of all Tuscany, having already taken Perugia and Piombino and putting Pisa under his protection.

As France’s control weakened (actually, it already had because it lost the Kingdom of Naples to Spain), both the French and Spanish needed Borgia’s support. So, he planned to take Pisa. Lucca and Siena would probably give up quickly, partly because they were scared and partly because they hated Florence, which couldn’t defend them.

If Borgia had managed all this—and he almost did the year Alexander died—he would have gained so much power and respect that he could have fought off attacks using his own forces and skills without needing help from anyone else.

A new ruler who knows they must fight off enemies and make friends, who overcomes problems by force or trickery, is loved and feared by their people, followed by their soldiers who get rid of threats, fixes old systems, is both strict and kind, breaks up disloyal groups and creates new ones, keeps kings and queens as friends so they respect or think twice before hurting him, won’t find a better example than Cesare Borgia.

The only problem with Borgia was his role in choosing Pope Julius. Borgia couldn’t force the pope he wanted but could stop the ones he didn’t want. Still, he should never have let a cardinal who he had problems with—or who would be scared of him as pope—win the election.

Borgia was so smart and ruthless, and he knew that to stay in power, you have to either win people over or destroy them. He built strong power fast, but two big armies threatened him, and he got very sick. If not for those things, he would have beaten every problem.

In Romagna, Borgia had made his power strong, but all his other lands were still shaky. He was stuck between two powerful enemy armies and was very sick. Even so, the way he dealt with everything shows why he’s a good example for anyone who comes to power through luck or with help from another ruler’s army.
