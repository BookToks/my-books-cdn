Here’s what I think: just drop it. When it’s time for a careful guy to act, it’s better to be impulsive than cautious. Luck is like a girl, and if you’re too careful, you’ll mess up. If he did change, and you want to stay on her good side, you have to be bold and take action.

You’ll see she’s more likely to respond to guys who are daring than to those who just stand still. Being a woman, she likes men who are young and wild, not shy or boring, because they’re more exciting when they win her over.

Pope Julius II was always impulsive and lived in times that matched his style, so things usually went well for him. Think about when he took over Bologna while Giovanni Bentivoglio was still in charge.

The Venetians didn’t like the idea, the King of Spain didn’t either, and Julius was still trying to work things out with the French. But, with his usual boldness, the pope led the attack himself. This confused the Venetians and Spanish—they were scared and unsure what to do. The Spanish hoped to get the Kingdom of Naples back. Meanwhile, the King of France joined in because he wanted Rome as an ally to stop Venice, and once Julius made his move, he couldn’t refuse to help without looking bad.

Because of this impulsive choice, Julius did more than any other pope with all the careful planning in the world could have done. If he had waited to sort everything out first, the plan would have failed.

The King of France would have found endless excuses, and the Venetians and Spanish would have kept warning him. I won’t talk about Julius’s other campaigns, which were similar and all successful. He died young, so he never faced failure. If times had changed and needed caution, he would have been finished because he never changed his ways—they were natural to him.

So, to finish: luck changes, but men keep going no matter what.
