Sure, mercenaries seem happy to be your soldiers when there’s no war, but as soon as a real fight starts, they either run away or just disappear.

It’s easy to believe this because Italy’s problems happened mainly because they relied too much on mercenaries. Mercenaries did win some battles and looked brave when fighting other mercenaries, but when a real foreign army showed up, sometimes they didn’t even fight. They just marked buildings with chalk to show where they would stay. When Savonarola said we brought this on ourselves because of our sins, he was right—but the sins were actually those of our rulers. So, our rulers were the ones who paid the price.

Now that I’ve explained the states and what made them strong or weak, I want to talk about how states attack and defend themselves. A ruler’s power must be based on strong foundations; otherwise, they will fall. The main foundations of any state, whether new or old, are good laws and good armies. You can’t have good laws without good armies, and if you have good armies, good laws will follow. I’ll skip talking more about laws and focus on armies.

The armies a ruler uses to defend their state can be their own, mercenaries, auxiliaries, or a mix. Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous. If you rely on mercenaries to defend you, your state will never be stable or safe. Mercenaries are greedy, undisciplined, disloyal, and they fight among themselves. They’re brave with friends and scared of enemies. They don’t fear God and don’t keep promises. With mercenaries, the only way to avoid disaster is to delay battle. In peace, they rob you; in war, they let the enemy rob you. Why? Because they only care about the small pay you give them, not enough to make them want to die for you.

A ruler must be the commander and lead personally. A republic must send its own citizens to fight. If a bad leader is chosen, they must replace him. If a good one is chosen, laws must keep him from going too far. Only rulers and republics with their own armies make real progress. Mercenaries only cause problems. Also, a republic with a citizen army is less likely to be overthrown than one that pays for mercenary armies.
