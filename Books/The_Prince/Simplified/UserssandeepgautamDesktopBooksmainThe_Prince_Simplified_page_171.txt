The papacy resisted successfully, partly thanks to help from the French leader Fabius Maximus (around 280–203 BC), a statesman and military commander who was famous for his cautious delaying tactics against Hannibal during the Second Punic War. The duke was very proud of the superior cannons made in Ferrara, which were an important part of their defense.

In 1526–27, Alfonso joined the expedition of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, which led to the sacking of Rome.

Ferdinand of Aragon (1452–1516) was just seventeen when he married Isabella of Castile, who was eighteen. This marriage was the first step toward uniting Spain. They ruled Castile together from 1474 and Ferdinand became King of Aragon in 1479. After a long campaign to take Granada, the last Muslim territory in Spain, Ferdinand finally won in 1492. That same year, he also expelled the Jews from both Castile and Aragon.

For the second half of his reign, Ferdinand worked to stop French expansion in Italy. From 1494 to 1496, he helped Italian leaders fight to drive Charles VIII of France out of Italy. In 1501, he agreed with Louis XII to split the Kingdom of Naples, but later turned against France and took over the whole kingdom by 1504. When he died, Spain was the strongest country in Europe. His grandson Charles of Austria, who was also Holy Roman Emperor, took over.

The brothers Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Sempronius Gracchus were important Roman leaders in the second century BC. Both tried to limit the power of the rich nobles and introduce reforms to help regular people, but both were killed for it.

The dukes of Ferrara were from a family that ruled for about four hundred years. 

(1) Ercole d’Este (1431–1505) was duke from 1471 to 1505. He was educated in Naples, married the daughter of King Ferrante, and became a big supporter of Renaissance art. In 1481, he fought against Venice and the papacy along with Ferrante, but lost some land. He stayed neutral during the Italian War from 1494 to 1498, but when the French took Milan in 1499, he asked for and got French protection.

(2) Alfonso d’Este (1476–1534) was duke from 1505 to 1534. He married Anna Sforza first, and later Lucrezia Borgia, daughter of Pope Alexander VI. In 1508, he joined the League of Cambrai, which wanted to destroy Venice's power and divide its lands. When Pope Julius II switched sides to support Venice, Alfonso stayed loyal to France.

Hamilcar Barca (around 270–228 BC) was a successful Carthaginian commander in the First Punic War against Rome. He invaded Spain in 236 BC and became a virtual dictator of Carthage before dying in battle.

Francesco Sforza was one of the most successful mercenary commanders of his time.
