Before Alexander came to power, what he had was actually weakening the rules and power of his rivals so he could take control of some of their lands. This was pretty easy because the Venetians wanted to bring the French back into Italy. Instead of fighting against this, the pope helped by ending King Louis’s first marriage.

So the French king came into Italy with help from Venice and the pope’s approval. As soon as he took Milan, the pope got the king to send troops to help his son, Borgia, take Romagna. This would have been impossible without the king’s support. After defeating the Colonna family, Borgia faced two big problems if he wanted to keep Romagna and get more land: his own army, which he thought might not be loyal, and the French king’s plans.

Duke Valentino, as Borgia was called, had been using the Orsini family’s forces but worried they might stop obeying him, maybe even take his land. He also worried about the King of France. His fears were confirmed when he attacked Bologna after taking Faenza, and the soldiers didn’t seem excited about it. When Borgia took Urbino and moved toward Tuscany, the French king told him to stop. After that, Borgia decided never to trust other people’s armies and power again.

When Pope Alexander VI wanted to make his son a powerful duke, there were many problems. First, he didn’t see how his son could rule anywhere except Church lands. But he knew if he gave away Church land, the Duke of Milan and Venetians would block him because Faenza and Rimini were already under Venetian protection. Also, the armies in Italy, especially those the pope could use, wouldn’t help.

So Borgia weakened the Orsini and Colonna families in Rome by paying the noblemen who supported them with good salaries and important jobs that matched their rank. In just a few months, old loyalties disappeared, and everyone supported the duke. After breaking up the Colonna leaders, Borgia waited for a chance to get rid of the main Orsini men.
