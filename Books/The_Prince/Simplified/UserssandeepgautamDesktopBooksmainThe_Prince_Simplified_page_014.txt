Over the last hundred years, the people of Florence had taken control of Arezzo, Pisa, and Cortona. They also spent a lot of energy trying, but failing, to take over Lucca.

The goal of Rome, no matter which pope was in charge, was always to grow its power north and east into Romagna and Emilia. They wanted to take over cities like Perugia, Bologna, Rimini, and Forlì. This plan would cause fights with both Venice and Florence. 

In the far south, Naples was ruled by a branch of the Aragon family. But the French kings from the Angevin family and the Spanish royal family (also Aragons), who already ruled Sicily, also wanted the throne.

So, things were pretty complicated. Between the big states, there were at least twenty smaller ones, some only as big as a town and nearby fields. These small states were always in danger of being attacked by enemies. Even though things were always changing, big changes were rare. When one power won a big battle, the others quickly teamed up to stop it from gaining more power. Florence stayed independent mainly because if Venice, Milan, or Rome tried to take it over, the other two would step in to stop them. This kept a balance of power for over a hundred years. But everything changed when the French invaded in 1494.

The invasion, as Machiavelli explains in The Prince, was mostly the Italians’ own fault. For a while, the five main states had been scaring each other by threatening to ask foreign countries for help.
