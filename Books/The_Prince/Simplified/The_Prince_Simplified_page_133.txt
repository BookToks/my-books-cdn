They thought they needed a bit more control in the back of their minds.

The king knew that the people really didn’t like or trust the nobles, and he wanted to protect them. But it was important that the king shouldn’t be the one to take the blame for anything bad that happened, because then the nobles might accuse him of being too nice to the people, or the people might think he favored the nobles. So, he created a group called parliament to keep the nobles in check and protect the people without the king having to be responsible. This was a smart idea that helped keep the king and the kingdom safe.

I could give lots of examples, but here’s one from not too long ago. Annibale Bentivogli, the grandfather of the current Annibale, was the Duke of Bologna when a group called the Canneschis plotted against him and killed him. At that time, the only Bentivogli left was his baby son, Giovanni. Right after the murder, the people got angry and killed all the Canneschis because the Bentivogli family was very popular.

With Annibale gone, there was no one else in the family able to run the town. So, the people went to Florence to find a man who claimed to be a Bentivogli. He said he was the son of a blacksmith, but they asked him to govern Bologna until Giovanni was old enough to take over, and he did.

My point is, as long as a leader has the support of the people, he doesn’t have to worry much about conspiracies. But if the people hate him, he has to be very careful and watch his every move. Good rulers always try not to upset the nobles too much and keep the people happy because that’s one of the most important jobs of a leader.

One of the best-run countries today is France. It has lots of good systems that keep the king safe and free to make decisions. The most important of these is parliament. 

Unlike other places where a ruler only has to worry about the nobles being greedy or the people disrespecting him, Roman emperors had a third problem: the army, which could be very greedy and cruel.

Commodus was an emperor whose soldiers had gotten used to a lazy and spoiled lifestyle.
