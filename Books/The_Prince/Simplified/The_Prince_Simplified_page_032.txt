Here, the criticism gets closer to what Machiavelli really believed. During the Renaissance, people started thinking more about practical, everyday human problems instead of just religious or philosophical questions. Usually, though, people still said religion was the most important thing and avoided saying that different belief systems might clash. They thought it was possible to be both a good Christian and a good political leader.

But Machiavelli disagreed. He said that Christian values and being a strong political leader didn’t always go together. Sometimes, you had to choose between the two. He didn’t reject all moral values like his critics said. He believed that keeping a country strong, united, and independent was very important. In fact, he once said, "I love my country more than my soul."

However, Machiavelli thought these goals couldn’t always happen if you followed Christian rules. The two sets of values could conflict with each other. What made it harder was that Machiavelli didn’t seem worried about this problem. He saw it as a fact: Christian values were good, but they didn’t always work for politicians. Thinking that all human actions could be judged by just one set of values was unrealistic and too idealistic.
