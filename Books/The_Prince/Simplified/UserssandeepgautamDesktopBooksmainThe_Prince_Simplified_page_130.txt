To protect yourself from other countries, you need a strong army and good friends. If your army is strong, you’ll have good friends, and when you’re safe from outside threats, you’ll also be safe inside your own country — unless there’s already a secret plan against you. Then, even if another country attacks, if you’ve prepared like I said, you just have to stay calm and you’ll survive every attack, like the Spartan leader Nabis I mentioned earlier.

Now that I’ve talked about the most important qualities, I want to quickly look at others. When there’s no threat from outside, a leader must make sure people don’t start planning against him. He can stop this by making sure people don’t hate or dislike him and that they’re happy. This is really important, as I explained before. One of the best ways to stop secret plans is to not be hated by most people.

People who want to plan against a leader must believe that killing him will be popular. If they see it’s not popular, they give up because secret plans are very hard to succeed. For every plan that works, many fail. A person planning a secret plan can’t do it alone and only asks people who are unhappy. But if they tell someone else about it, that person might betray them to get a better position.

A leader will be looked down on if he seems weak, changeable, or scared. So he must avoid these things and act in a way that shows he is strong, serious, and important. When settling arguments between people, he should make sure his decision is final and no one thinks they can trick him.

If a leader shows these qualities, people will respect him and it will be hard to plan against him. If he is respected and known for being great, other countries will also find it hard to attack him.

To sum up: a leader faces two dangers — one from inside his country and one from outside.
