Filippo Visconti (1392–1447) was the Duke of Milan from 1412 to 1447. He was cruel and paranoid, but he rebuilt Milan’s power with the help of mercenary leaders like Carmagnola and Francesco Sforza. To keep Sforza loyal, Filippo promised him his only child and heir, Bianca Maria, in marriage, but then made him wait many years for the wedding.

Niccolò Vitelli (1414–1486) was a military commander who was always fighting the pope’s forces for control of Città di Castello, a town near Perugia in Umbria. In 1475, Pope Sixtus IV forced him out of the town. After the failed Pazzi conspiracy, the Medici supported Niccolò. When he took the town back, he destroyed the fortresses the pope had built while he was gone.

Paulo Vitelli (1461–1499) was Niccolò’s son and a mercenary leader. He led the Florentine army during its siege of Pisa in 1498. Even though he broke through the city walls, he acted very cautiously and didn’t take advantage of his success. Because of this, people thought he betrayed them. He was arrested and executed.

The Vitelli were a noble family of mercenary commanders who controlled Città di Castello near Perugia for most of the 1400s.

Vitellozzo Vitelli (around 1458–1502) was Niccolò’s son and Paulo’s brother. He was serving Florence with Paulo when Paulo was arrested and executed for treason. Vitellozzo escaped and later worked for Cesare Borgia. Along with the Orsini family, he plotted against Borgia and was killed by him in Senigallia in 1502.

Xenophon (431–354 BC) was an Athenian and a friend of Socrates. He didn’t like democracy and spent much of his life in Sparta. He joined 10,000 mercenaries who fought for Cyrus during a war in Asia Minor in 401 BC. After Cyrus died, Xenophon helped lead the mercenaries on a 1,000-mile retreat home, though fewer than 6,000 survived. He wrote about this adventure in his book called Anabasis.

Bernabò Visconti (1323–1385) ruled Milan with his two brothers from 1354 to 1385.
