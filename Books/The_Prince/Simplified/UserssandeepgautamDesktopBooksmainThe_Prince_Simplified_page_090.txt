People attack each other because of fear or hate. The cardinals Borgia had hurt included Giuliano della Rovere, the cardinal of San Pietro ad Vincula, Cardinal Colonna, the cardinal of San Giorgio of Savona, and Ascanio Sforza. All the others, except the cardinal of Rouen and the Spanish cardinals, would have been afraid of him if they had become pope.

With the King of France supporting him, the cardinal of Rouen was very powerful. The Spanish cardinals were related to Borgia and owed him favors. So, besides lucky breaks and good qualities, there was a Spanish pope. If not, Borgia should have let Rouen win.

There are two other ways a private citizen can become a ruler and take the throne, but not Giuliano della Rovere. These ways belong more to discussions about republics. First, a man can grab power through a terrible crime. Second, a private citizen can become a hereditary ruler with help from other citizens. We will talk about two examples of becoming king by crime, one from ancient times and one from modern times, to help anyone who has to take this path.

Agathocles was from Sicily. He started as a private citizen, actually one of the lowest in society, and became King of Syracuse.

He was born a potterâ€™s son and lived a bad life from beginning to end. Still, he had strong mind and body. He joined the Syracusan army, rose through the ranks, and finally became commander-in-chief. After that, Agathocles decided to make himself king, using any violence needed to keep the power he had as commander without owing anything to anyone. He talked about his plans with Hamilcar, a Carthaginian whose army was fighting in Sicily, and they made an agreement.

One morning, he called a meeting of the people and the Senate, acting like he had important state business to discuss.
