But he didn’t last long. Two things made people hate and despise him. First, he came from a very low background; he had been a shepherd in Thrace, and everyone knew it and thought it was scandalous. Second, when he became emperor, he refused to go to Rome for the official ceremony and got a reputation for being extremely cruel by ordering his officials in Rome and across the empire to commit many terrible acts.

Everyone hated him because of his low birth and cruelty. He faced rebellions first in Africa, then in the Senate. Even the Senate rebellion had the full support of the people of Rome. Then the whole of Italy turned against him, and finally, his own army got involved; they were attacking Aquileia and things were getting really tough. They were also tired of his cruelty, and when they saw how many enemies he had, they stopped fearing him and killed him.

But let’s get back to the main point. Anyone thinking about this will see that hatred or contempt caused these Roman emperors to fall. You’ll also understand that while some emperors acted one way and others acted differently, there were both successes and failures in each group. Since these emperors took power instead of inheriting it, it was useless and dangerous for leaders like Pertinax and Alexander to try to copy Marcus Aurelius, who became emperor because he inherited the position.

Also, because they didn’t have the right qualities, it was a big mistake for Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to try to act like Severus. If someone takes power and starts a new monarchy, they can’t be like Marcus Aurelius. But they should learn from Severus how to create a strong state, and from Marcus Aurelius how to make a state stable and respected once it is set up.

Nowadays, rulers don’t have to worry as much about pleasing the army like Roman emperors did. Sure, they still need to keep the army happy, but the problem is much easier now because no modern ruler has to deal with armies that have a lot of experience running the government and managing provinces like the Roman armies did. The emperors had to put the army first because the army was more powerful. Today, except for Turkish and Egyptian rulers, it’s more important for leaders to put the people before the army because the people are more powerful.

I made an exception for the Turkish leader because he has a big army of 12,000 foot soldiers and 15,000 horsemen with him all the time. He depends on them for his power and safety, so he has to keep them happy above all else. Egypt is similar in this way; it is completely under the control of its army, and the sultan has to please the soldiers before thinking about the people.
