Machiavelli should have known that being honest in his book wouldn’t help his diplomatic career. Being honest and trying to get ahead in politics didn’t really work together.

He was surprised and upset that The Prince didn’t make him successful, so he went back to chasing women. Besides just hooking up, he quickly fell in and out of love, following his feelings without thinking much. He was better at romance than politics, and he also did better writing funny, sexy plays than serious political stuff. In 1518, his play The Mandragola, about a guy who uses crazy tricks to sleep with a married woman, made him famous right away. A few years later, another play called Clizia, about an older man trying to get a young woman, showed he was really talented.

But Machiavelli didn’t just want to be a writer. He really wanted to be involved in politics. He spent about ten years working on books like Discourses on Livy, a history of Florence, and The Art of War. Still, he always missed his old job as the city’s main ambassador. Finally, in 1525, Pope Clement VII, who was related to the Medici family, brought Machiavelli back to politics and asked him for advice about the fight between the French and the Spanish.
