Luck plays a big part in what happens to people, especially leaders and countries. If a country had been properly prepared, like Germany, Spain, or France, then big disasters like floods wouldn’t have caused so much damage or might not have happened at all.

That’s pretty much all you need to know about how to handle luck in general.

But if you look closer, you’ll see how a ruler can be doing great one day and lose everything the next without changing who they are. Many people think this happens just because of luck or fate. I believe the world is controlled by God and luck. Sometimes smart people can’t do much about luck, so they just trust it and fall apart when luck changes.

Because they can’t protect themselves, some rulers give up trying and just leave things to chance. This way of thinking is more common now because the world is changing a lot and fast, in ways no one expected. Sometimes I feel this way too, but other times I don’t.

Still, I think luck decides about half of what happens to us, and the other half depends on what we do. It’s like a wild river that sometimes floods. Everyone tries to stay safe, but you can’t stop the river. Even so, people build walls and dams to prepare for floods when the water is low. This helps keep the damage small when the river rises.

Luck is like that river. It causes problems where no one is ready for it, but if you prepare, you can reduce the harm. Leaders who change their plans to fit the times do well. Those who don’t adapt fail because they’re stuck doing things the old way. People want power and money, but they try to get it in different ways. Some are careful, some impulsive; some use force, others use cleverness; some wait patiently, others rush. All these ways can work.

Sometimes two careful people have different results: one wins, the other loses. Sometimes two people both succeed but use different styles. Whether they win depends on if their way fits the situation. That’s why people’s luck goes up and down.

In short, when leaders’ actions match the times, they succeed. When they don’t, they fail. And because people tend to stick to what they know, it’s hard for them to change, even if the world around them does.
