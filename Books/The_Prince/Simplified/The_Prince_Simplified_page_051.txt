Remember, Machiavelli is dealing with people who say that whether or not the people hate their ruler isn’t the main way to tell if that leader will stay in power. These people are using examples from Roman emperors.

Machiavelli will explain that the power and political system in the Roman empire were very different from those in a modern state of his time (early 1500s). The big difference was that Rome had a strong army that the leader had to keep happy before thinking about the people. This army was often allowed to treat the people badly, like stealing and hurting them, to stay loyal.

This part is getting us ready for how Machiavelli will answer the objections. He says it’s important to understand the different historical situation.

The word ‘parte’ might mean ‘apart’ or ‘in part,’ as both Italian translations say. So, the sentence might mean: To answer these objections, I will look at some emperors, showing how their downfalls fit with what I said before, and adding some important historical details.

The original phrase ‘mettere in considerazione’ means ‘put in consideration’ and is used only once in The Prince. So, instead of saying ‘submit for consideration,’ the translator uses ‘bringing into the argument’ to explain that Machiavelli wants to add more background for these examples.
