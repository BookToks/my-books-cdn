As a big fight between two powerful countries in Italy got closer, Machiavelli was put in charge of taking care of Florence’s city walls. But when the time came, the armies from Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, who were now ruled by the same king, didn’t even bother with Florence. They went straight to Rome and attacked it badly. It was one of the worst acts of cruelty Italy had seen in hundreds of years.

After that, the Medici rulers in Florence lost power, and Machiavelli was not popular anymore. Feeling very sad and taking medicines that were bad for him, he died in June 1527 at the age of fifty-eight. He probably accepted death knowing it was coming.

Machiavelli knew that there are many ways to become famous or infamous, and that what a person does can mix with history in surprising ways. So he would have found it ironic that because of Luther’s Protestant Reformation and the wars that followed, his name became hated by many but also very well known.

The big change happened in 1572. The Prince was not published while Machiavelli was still alive.
