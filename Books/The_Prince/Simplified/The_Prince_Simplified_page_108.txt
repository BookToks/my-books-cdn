The Swiss are very well armed and completely free. A good example of using mercenaries long ago is Carthage. After the first war with Rome, the Carthaginians were almost overthrown by their mercenaries, even though these soldiers were led by Carthaginian citizens. 

After the death of Epaminondas, the Thebans made Philip of Macedonia their army leader. But as soon as he won the war, he took away their freedom. When Filippo Maria Visconti died, the Milanese hired Francesco Sforza to fight against the Venetians. After beating the Venetians at Caravaggio, Sforza joined them to overthrow the Milanese who had paid him.  

Francesco’s father was a mercenary commander for Queen Joanna of Naples. One day, he ran away, leaving her kingdom unprotected, so she had to give it to the King of Aragon or risk losing it.  

Venice and Florence increased their lands by using mercenaries. These mercenaries did not take power but helped protect the rulers. The Florentines were lucky because many powerful captains were threats but didn’t win their wars, or they moved on to other things.  

One mercenary, Giovanni Acuto (also called John Hawkwood), didn’t win, so we don’t know if he was loyal or not. But if he had won, the Florentines would have been at his mercy. Francesco Sforza had to face another commander, Braccio da Montone, and they kept each other from becoming too powerful. Sforza focused on Lombardy while Braccio fought in Rome and Naples.  

Let’s remember what happened recently. Florence hired Paulo Vitelli as their military leader. He was a serious man who started with nothing and worked his way up.  

Over many years, Italy has been full of mercenaries, so understanding where this problem began makes it easier to find a solution.  

What’s important to remember is that for centuries, places like Rome and Sparta stayed armed and free by themselves.
