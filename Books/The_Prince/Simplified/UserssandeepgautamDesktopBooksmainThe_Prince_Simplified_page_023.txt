The wild and intense show left people both satisfied and shocked. When we read the chapters about Borgia, it feels like Machiavelli’s book changes from a smart but calm guide about rulers into something much more powerful and disturbing, which later became known as The Prince.

Basically, Machiavelli stops just studying different political systems and starts telling a gripping story about a leader who ignores Christian morals and lives only for power. Machiavelli was a diplomat who spent his life around powerful people but never really had control himself. He was so honest that when he was suspected of stealing money, he was actually paid back what he was owed. So, it’s easy to see why he might feel jealous and almost wishful when thinking about the amazing Borgia, who didn’t care about being honest and took whatever he wanted without hesitation.

At a deeper level, the shock of The Prince is connected to the shock all writers feel when they secretly enjoy the ruthless actions of the people they write about. But Machiavelli is different because he doesn’t just describe this behavior; he organizes it and seems to support it, especially for those who want to win and keep political power.
