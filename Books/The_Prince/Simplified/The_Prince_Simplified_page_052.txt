I understood the word ‘parte’ to mean ‘in part,’ and to make the sentence flow better, I translated it as ‘some.’ The author can’t include all the background, but just some of it.

We can’t be sure if this is exactly what Machiavelli meant, but this version makes the passage fit together better than other translations.

If we look back at the original sentence word by word – ‘and part I will put in consideration those things that are important to people who read the events of those times’ – we can see that it matches the way we translated it.

One big problem translators face with The Prince is the book’s reputation. Everyone learns Machiavelli is controversial because he cares more about the results than the way you get there. He even seems to accept violence, cruelty, and betrayal, which Christian and modern western values say are wrong. For example, we don’t approve of killing someone just because it stops a riot, and we’re uncomfortable with torture, even if it might stop a terrorist attack.
