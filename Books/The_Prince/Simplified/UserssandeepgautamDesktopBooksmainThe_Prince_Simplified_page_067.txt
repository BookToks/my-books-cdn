When a king takes over new land, his old land and the new land will soon become one country.

Of course, when a king tries to get back land after it has rebelled, he is less likely to lose it again. He learns from the rebellion and becomes stricter with troublemakers, checks suspects carefully, and makes his defenses stronger.

The first time Louis invaded Milan, it was easy because the other side just made small threats. But the second time, it took a huge effort to defeat his armies and push them out of Italy. This happened for the reasons already mentioned. Still, they were driven out both times.

Holding onto new land is hard if the people speak a different language, have different customs, and different ways of living. You need a lot of luck and hard work. The best way to keep control is for the new ruler to actually live there. This makes the place safer and more stable. The Turkish sultan did this in Greece, and it helped him hold on to his country.

When you live there, you can quickly see when things start going wrong and stop rebellions early. If you stay far away, you only find out when it’s too late. Another good thing about living there is that your officials won’t steal from the people. The people will be happy to have a ruler living among them. If they want to be loyal, they’ll love you more. If not, they’ll be afraid of you. Anyone thinking of attacking will think twice. So, if you move to the new land, you are very unlikely to lose it.

Sometimes the new land is not in the same area, and people speak a different language. If you share the language, it’s easier to keep control, especially if the people aren’t used to ruling themselves. In this case, you just need to get rid of the previous ruler’s family. Then the rest of the laws can stay the same, and people will accept this quietly.

This has worked in places like Burgundy, Brittany, Gascony, and Normandy, which have been under French rule for many years. Even when people speak different languages, their customs are similar, so they get along. A ruler who takes lands like this must do two things: first, get rid of the old ruler’s family; second, leave the laws alone.

Another good idea is to set up colonies in one or two places. These colonies act like chains, linking the captured land to your own. If you don’t do this, you will have to keep a lot of soldiers there all the time.

Colonies don’t cost much to keep. You can send people to live there cheaply. Only a small number of locals will lose their homes and land to the colonists. Since this is a small part of the population and many of those people will leave, they can’t cause much trouble. Everyone else won’t be affected much, so they are likely to stay calm and not rebel because they are scared of losing their homes.

In conclusion, colonies are cheap, more loyal, and cause less anger among the people. They help keep your power and control.
