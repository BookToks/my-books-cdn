Meanwhile, all over Europe, princes and princesses from old noble families kept marrying each other again and again. They did this to create a strong network of alliances, hoping that having the right family background would protect them from people trying to take their power or from new ideas like democracy.  

No family was better at this fancy “dating” game than the Medici. Because of their many connections, they stayed in control of Florence for more than 200 boring years.  

At the same time, from Paris to Madrid to Naples, royal clothes got fancier, statues and monuments became more showy, and the whole royal ceremony got more colorful and serious. It was like they wanted people to be impressed and believe that kings and dukes really deserved to rule. Many famous artworks were made to support this idea.  

But mostly, Europe’s rulers worked hard to seem religious and to protect their faith. They thought this would make them look better and distract people from wondering why they had so much power.  

Later, especially after the French Revolution showed that kings had no special rights, rulers tried to look “respectable.” For example, after taking power, Napoleon told his court members to attend parties with their wives so people wouldn’t gossip about them.
