A ruler and his promises

Going back to the question of being feared or loved, my conclusion is that people decide for themselves whether to love a ruler or not, but it’s the ruler who decides if people will fear him. So, a smart ruler should base his power on what he can control, not on what people are free to choose. But he must be careful, like I said, that people don’t end up hating him.

Everyone will see how great it is for a ruler to keep his promises and be honest instead of lying. However, nowadays we’ve seen leaders who did big things without worrying too much about keeping their word. Using their cleverness to trick enemies, these leaders got more done than those who always acted honestly.

A leader should remember there are two ways to fight: using laws and using force. Usually, people use laws and animals use force. But since following the law isn’t always enough, it makes sense to use force sometimes too.

So, a ruler must be able to use both the human and animal sides inside him fully. Long ago, writers used stories to teach this lesson: they said Achilles and other leaders were raised by the centaur Chiron, who was half-man and half-beast. This story meant a ruler has to use both sides. If he only had one, he wouldn’t survive.

Since a ruler must act like a beast sometimes, he should have the traits of both a fox and a lion. The lion can’t protect itself from traps, and the fox can’t protect itself from wolves. So you have to act like a fox to spot traps and like a lion to scare off wolves. A ruler who only acts like a lion and forgets about being a fox doesn’t know what he’s doing. That’s why a smart leader can’t always keep his promises if doing so would put him in danger or weaken his power.
