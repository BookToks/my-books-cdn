Spending your own money is the only thing that really puts you at risk.

Generosity can be a problem because when you give a lot, you might lose the resources you need to keep giving. You could end up poor and looked down on, or you might become greedy and hateful to avoid being poor. It’s better for a leader to be feared or loved, but most importantly, they should avoid being hated or despised.

Being generous can lead to both respect and hatred. It’s smarter to have a reputation for being stingy, which people don’t like but don’t hate, than to try to be generous and end up being seen as greedy, which makes people hate you.

Every leader wants to be seen as kind instead of cruel. But a leader has to be careful not to show kindness in the wrong way. For example, Cesare Borgia was called cruel, but his harsh actions actually brought peace and order to Romagna. In fact, he was kinder than the Florentines, who were too afraid to seem cruel and ended up causing chaos in Pistoia. A ruler shouldn’t worry about being called cruel if it means keeping people loyal and peaceful. Being strict sometimes is better than being too nice and letting crime and chaos happen. Those problems hurt everyone, while punishments only affect a few people. New leaders especially can’t avoid being seen as cruel because new territories are dangerous. As Queen Dido said, the hard situation and the newness of her kingdom forced her to do tough things and protect her borders everywhere.
