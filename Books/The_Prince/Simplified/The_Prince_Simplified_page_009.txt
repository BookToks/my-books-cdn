Must. Have to. Definitely. For sure. These are the words that keep showing up in The Prince. And also: success, winning, respect, achievement, and on the other side: loss, failure, losing, death. These opposite ideas are connected by words like because, so, hence, therefore, as a result, and as a consequence. From beginning to end, the book shows people trying to survive in a tricky web of cause and effect. Staying alive is what really matters. Anything extra is just a bonus.

The Prince was written by a 44-year-old diplomat who was about to lose everything. After 14 years of power and respect, a new government kicked him out. They thought he was working against them, so they locked him up and tortured him. His life changed fast and badly. But after they found out he was innocent, they let him go. He left the city to live quietly with his wife and family on a small farm.

For a man who loved the busy city life and was used to dating many women, this felt like a punishment. Bored and angry, he walked the hills during the day and, in the long, lonely evenings, he started writing down his thoughts on how to get power and, most importantly, how to keep it and not be a victim of bad luck.
