Having taken control of Naples, Florence, and Charleston, Naples became the ruler of Perugia in 1495. At this time, other Italian powers were also active, including Julius Caesar (around 100–44 BC). After winning important battles in Gaul and Britain, Julius Caesar made himself dictator, starting the change from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire. He was killed by a group of senators, including his friend Marcus Junius Brutus.

The Colonna family was very powerful in medieval and Renaissance Rome. They often fought with the Bentivogli family over control of Bologna. The Bentivoglis were backed by Venice and produced one pope, Martin V (who ruled from 1417 to 1431), but later they were excommunicated and lost their lands to Alexander VI. In 1445, with help from Milan, Battista Canneschi, head of the Colonna family, had Annibale Bentivogli murdered. However, the people of Bologna turned against the Canneschis and killed Battista, forcing his family to run away.

Roman Emperor Commodus (161–193) was the son of Marcus Aurelius. He ignored his father’s strict and simple lifestyle, choosing instead to enjoy pleasure and fun. After his father died, Commodus ruled with his brother Geta, but soon had him killed. Proud of his body, Commodus liked to fight as a gladiator. He also made all free people in the empire Roman citizens. Eventually, he was strangled by a wrestler named Narcissus.

Alberigo da Barbiano (around 1348–1409) was originally from Romagna but later became Count of Conio, a small town near the Italian Riviera. He was the first mercenary leader to insist that his army be made only of Italians. Francesco Bussone, Count of Carmagnola (around 1432–82), was hired first by the Duke of Milan and later by the Venetians to fight Milan. After winning the battle of Maclodio in 1427, Carmagnola was accused of betrayal, arrested, and executed.

Cyrus (around 576–529 BC) founded the Persian Empire, which grew to cover much of central and southwest Asia. Darius, the last great king of Persia (336–331 BC), was murdered by one of his governors.

Charles VII (1403–61), King of France from 1422 to 1461, was inspired by Joan of Arc. He united France under one ruler and pushed the English out of most of their French lands except Calais. Charles built a strong standing army.

David (around 1012–972 BC), the second king of Israel after Saul, is famous for defeating the giant Philistine warrior Goliath with just a sling and stones. He captured Jerusalem, making it his capital, and expanded his kingdom over modern Jordan and Syria.

Charles VIII (1470–98), King of France from 1483 to 1498, took full power in 1492 after his sister Anne’s regency ended. Encouraged by the pope and the Duke of Milan, Charles gathered an army of 25,000 men and in 1494 marched into Italy. He made many enemies among the major Italian states but tried to claim the throne of Naples.
