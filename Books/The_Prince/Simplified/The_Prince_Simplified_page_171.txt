The papacy resisted successfully, partly thanks to help from the French leader Fabius Maximus (around 280–203 BC), who was a statesman and military commander. He was famous for his cautious delaying tactics against Hannibal in the Second Punic War and his dislike of Scipio. Also, Ferrara had better cannons, which was important to the duke.

In 1526–27, Alfonso joined the expedition of Charles V (Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain) that led to the sacking of Rome.

Ferdinand of Aragon (1452–1516) married Isabella of Castile when he was seventeen and she was eighteen. This was the first step toward uniting Spain. They ruled Castile together from 1474 and Ferdinand became King of Aragon in 1479. After a long fight to capture Granada, the last Muslim territory in Spain, Ferdinand finally won in 1492. The same year, he forced the Jews to leave Castile and Aragon.

The second half of Ferdinand’s rule was spent fighting French expansion in Italy. From 1494 to 1496, he helped Italian leaders push Charles VIII of France out of Italy. In 1501, he agreed with Louis XII to split the Kingdom of Naples, but later took control of the entire kingdom by 1504. When he died, Spain was the most powerful country in Europe, a power that grew when his grandson Charles of Austria became Holy Roman Emperor.

The Gracchi brothers, Tiberius and Gaius, were from an important Roman family in the second century BC. Both became Tribunes of the Plebs but were killed after trying to limit the power of the nobles and push reforms for the common people.

The dukes of Ferrara came from a family that ruled for about four centuries. (1) Ercole d’Este (1431–1505) was duke from 1471 to 1505. He was educated in Naples and married the daughter of King Ferrante. He supported Renaissance art.

(2) Alfonso d’Este (1476–1534), duke from 1505 to 1534, first married Anna Sforza, then Lucrezia Borgia, daughter of Pope Alexander VI. In 1508, he joined the League of Cambrai, which aimed to destroy Venice’s power and divide its lands. When Pope Julius II switched sides to support Venice, Alfonso stayed loyal to France.

Guidobaldo da Montefeltro (1472–1508) became Duke of Urbino in 1482. He fought as a military leader for Pope Alexander VI and Charles VIII of France, and later for Venice against Charles. He stayed neutral in the Italian War of 1494–98 but asked for French protection when Milan was taken by the French in 1499. Under his rule, Urbino’s court was one of the most refined in Europe and inspired Baldassare Castiglione’s Book of the Courtier, which talks about the perfect qualities of a courtier.

Hamilcar Barca (around 270–228 BC) was a successful Carthaginian commander in the First Punic War against Rome. He invaded Hispania in 236 BC and became the virtual dictator of Carthage before dying in battle.
