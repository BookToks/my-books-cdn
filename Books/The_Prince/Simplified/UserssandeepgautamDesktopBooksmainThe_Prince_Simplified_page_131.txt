To protect yourself from other countries, you need a strong army and good friends. If your army is strong, you’ll have good friends, and when you’re safe from outside threats, you’ll be safe inside too, as long as no one is already planning against you. Then, even if another country attacks, if you’ve prepared like I said, you just have to stay calm and you’ll survive any attack, like the Spartan ruler Nabis I talked about before.

Now that I’ve talked about the most important qualities, I want to quickly explain the others. When there’s no threat from outside, a ruler must make sure people don’t start planning against him. He can do this by making sure he’s not hated and that people are happy, which is very important. One big reason rulers get hated is if they steal people’s stuff or take their women. A ruler should never do that. If you don’t take people’s things or honor, most will be okay, and you only have to watch out for a few ambitious people who might cause trouble.

People will dislike you if you seem weak, fake, scared, or unsure. So, a ruler must avoid acting like that and always show strength, seriousness, and confidence. When solving fights between people, the ruler should make sure his decision is final, and no one thinks they can trick or beat him. If a ruler seems strong and respected, it’s hard for people to plan against him.

People who want to start a plan against the ruler need to believe that killing him will be popular. If they think most people won’t like it, they lose hope because plans like that are very risky and usually fail. A person planning a conspiracy can’t do it alone; they need others who are unhappy. But if they tell someone their plan, that person might betray them to get an advantage.

A ruler who shows he is strong and respected will be well-liked and hard to attack, both from inside and outside. To sum up: people wanting to betray you are motivated by fear, jealousy, and the risk of punishment, while the ruler has the power of the government, laws, friends, and the state to protect him.
