Every town had to send someone to represent it, and he took that chance. He realized too late that the growing power of Borgia and the Church could ruin them. The Orsini arranged a meeting at Magione, near Perugia, because they wanted to stop hating Borgia and maybe join his side. This meeting caused a rebellion in Urbino, uprisings in Romagna, and lots of problems for Borgia. But with help from the French, he managed to get through it.

Borgia wanted to prove that if his rule had been harsh, it was because of his brutal minister, not him. So, when he found a reason, he had Orcobeheaded and his body displayed in Cesena’s main square with a wooden block and a bloody knife next to it. The scary sight shocked and satisfied people.

Now, Borgia made peace with the Orsini, sending Paulo Orsini as a mediator. He was very kind to Paulo, giving him money, clothes, and horses until the Orsinis finally accepted an invitation to Senigallia, putting themselves under Borgia’s control. After killing the Orsini leaders and forcing their followers to join him, Borgia had a strong base. He controlled Romagna and the Duchy of Urbino, and the local people were starting to enjoy some peace and wealth.

When Borgia took over Romagna, he found it full of weak rulers who stole from the people and caused fights instead of bringing peace. Theft, fights, and unfairness were everywhere. So he decided to bring good government to calm things down and make people respect the law. He put Remirro de Orco, a harsh and strict man, in charge. De Orco quickly brought order and became well-known for it. But Borgia thought such harsh rule might cause anger, so he set up a court in the middle of the area to keep things fair.

Borgia had built up his power and army, getting rid of most threats. The only big problem left was the King of France. Borgia knew the king regretted supporting him before and wouldn’t let him cause more trouble. So Borgia looked for new allies and wasn’t very helpful when Louis marched south to fight the Spanish in Naples. His goal was to stay safe from French interference, something he might have done if his father, Pope Alexander, hadn’t died.

Borgia’s biggest worry was that the next pope might be his enemy and try to take away the lands his father had given him. To stop this, he planned four things: first, get rid of the families of local rulers in his lands so a new pope couldn’t bring them back; second, get support from the noble families in Rome to block any pope’s plans; third, control the group that chooses the next pope; and fourth, take as much land as possible before the pope died so he could defend it himself.

While the pope was weak and sick in Rome, no one tried to take advantage, and Borgia worked hard to make sure he’d be ready for whatever came next.
