Men like our Italian leaders knew that if they didn’t use their soldiers properly or just let them go, things would go badly. So, they cut their troops into smaller groups and only fought with their own soldiers.

If you want to find a situation where you can’t win, don’t choose auxiliaries. They are even more dangerous than mercenaries. Auxiliaries are a tight group and follow only one leader. Mercenaries need time and a chance to attack because they aren’t united. When you hire mercenaries, you pay them, and the leader needs time to get control. So, mercenaries can be unsure, but auxiliaries are very determined. 

I want to share a story from the Old Testament. When David wanted to fight the Philistine giant Goliath for King Saul, Saul gave David his weapons to help him feel brave. But David refused and said he would fight with his own sling and knife. This shows that using your own weapons and skills is better than relying on others.

Good rulers always try to avoid using auxiliaries and mercenaries. They prefer their own soldiers and would rather lose with them than win with others. Cesare Borgia is a good example. He invaded Romagna with only French auxiliaries and took cities with them. But when he found some hired soldiers were disloyal, he killed them and trained his own men.

Charles VII, the father of Louis XI, pushed the English out of France and saw it was important to have his own army of cavalry and infantry. Later, Louis hired Swiss mercenaries, but this caused problems. The French army started to depend on the Swiss and couldn’t fight well without them. So, the army became a mix of mercenaries and French soldiers, which isn’t as good as having your own men.

France’s troubles show this clearly. If their standing army had been stronger and kept to just French soldiers, they would be unbeatable. But people often choose what seems easy or good without thinking about the hidden dangers, like ignoring a sickness until it’s too late.
