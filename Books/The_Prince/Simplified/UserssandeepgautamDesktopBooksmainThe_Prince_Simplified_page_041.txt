The prince is the most important man.

So the translator wants to use the word ‘king’. In the past, a king was at the top of a system and was the most important person. But it’s hard to call the lord of Imola, a pope, or a Roman emperor a ‘king’ when translating Machiavelli. In the end, I decided to use the less exciting word ‘ruler’ or the more general word ‘leader’, but I always make it clear we mean the political leader of a state. However, the book’s famous title has to stay the same.

It’s even harder to translate the word ‘virtù’ and some other related words. It would be easy to use the English word ‘virtue’, which means being good or moral, but that’s not what Machiavelli meant. He wasn’t talking about good vs. evil. He cared about winning and losing, being strong or weak, success or failure.

For Machiavelli, ‘virtù’ means any quality that helps you get or keep political power. It could be bravery in battle, a strong personality, being smart in politics, or even being harsh enough to show people you’re serious.

But you can’t just write ‘cunning’ or ‘cruelty’ instead of ‘virtù’, even if that fits here. That’s because Machiavelli isn’t talking about usual moral qualities, but he still wants these traits to sound positive. This kind of cruelty is meant to fix problems, keep power, and make the state strong, so in this case, it’s a ‘virtù’.
