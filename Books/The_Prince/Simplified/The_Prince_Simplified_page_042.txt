Even though it might sound ugly, sometimes I have to translate ‘virtù’ as ‘positive qualities’ or ‘strength of character.’ But when Machiavelli means ‘virtues’ in the moral sense, he usually talks about how important it is to pretend to have them, even if you don’t. Pretending, when used smartly for the right reason, is another important kind of virtù. The idea of a spin doctor wasn’t made up in the 1990s.

There’s also a bigger problem with some key words Machiavelli uses. Many of them have English words that come from Latin, like fortuna, audace, circospetto, malignità, and diligente.

Sometimes these words really do mean the same thing, like prudente and prudent. But even then, using the English word sounds old-fashioned. Isn’t it more common now to say ‘careful,’ ‘cautious,’ or ‘considered’ instead of ‘prudent’?

The same problem happens when there isn’t an English word that matches exactly, but there’s an old dictionary word for the Italian term. Machiavelli often uses the word ‘savio,’ which is usually translated as ‘wise.’ But that can make the English sound old and stiff, like in many old famous books. Words like ‘sensible’ or ‘shrewd’ can be better choices depending on the situation because they are accurate and sound more natural.
