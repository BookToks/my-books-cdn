At that time, no foreign enemies could help the people. But later, her fortresses didn’t help much when Cesare Borgia attacked the town, and the people, who didn’t like her, fought on his side. She would have been safer if she had made friends with the people instead of just trusting her fortresses.

I think rulers who build fortresses and those who don’t can both be okay. But I don’t like rulers who think it doesn’t matter if people hate them and only trust fortresses for safety. Nothing makes a ruler respected like winning important battles and showing great personal qualities.

A good example is Ferdinand of Aragon, the King of Spain. He started off as a weak king but became very famous and respected. At the start of his rule, he invaded Granada, which helped him gain power. He did this when things were calm at home so no one could stop him. The war kept the powerful Castilian nobles busy so they didn’t try to take over. While this happened, Ferdinand’s power and fame grew without them noticing.

He paid for his armies with money from the Church and the people, which let him fight a long war and build a strong military for the future. After that, to keep the Church’s support for even bigger wars, he acted cruelly but said it was for religious reasons. He took the wealth from Marrano Jews and kicked them out of his kingdom, which was very harsh and shocking.

Using religion as an excuse again, he attacked Africa, then Italy, and finally France. So he was always in control.
