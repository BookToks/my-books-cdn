At that time, no foreign enemies could help the people. Later, her forts didn’t help much when Cesare Borgia attacked the town, and the people, who didn’t like her, joined him. Both then and before, she would have been safer if she had not made the people hate her instead of just relying on forts.

I respect rulers who build forts and those who don’t, but I always criticize any ruler who thinks it doesn’t matter if the people hate him and just trusts forts to keep safe. Nothing earns a ruler respect like big military wins and showing strong personal qualities.

A good example today is Ferdinand of Aragon, the King of Spain. He started as a weak king but became very famous and respected in Europe. At the start of his rule, he invaded Granada, which helped him gain power. It was smart to do this when the country was peaceful so no one could stop him. The war kept the Castilian nobles busy so they didn’t cause trouble inside Spain. Meanwhile, Ferdinand’s power and reputation grew without them noticing.

He paid for his army with money from the Church and the people, which let him keep fighting and build a strong military for the future. After that, to get even more support from the Church, he did something cruel but called it religious—he took money from the Marrano Jews and kicked them out of his kingdom, a move that was very harsh and shocking.

Again using religion as an excuse, he attacked Africa, then moved into Italy, and finally attacked France. So, he was always in control.
