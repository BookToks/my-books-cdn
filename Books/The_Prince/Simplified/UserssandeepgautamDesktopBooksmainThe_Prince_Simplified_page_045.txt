If you win, you don’t want friends who might not help you when things get tough. And if you lose, the winner won’t keep you around because you didn’t choose to fight with them.

The second part is from George Bull, written in 1961.

A leader gets respect for being a true friend or a true enemy, meaning they show clearly which side they are on. This is better than staying neutral. For example, if the countries near you start fighting, either one of them will win and threaten you, or they won’t.

In both cases, it’s better for you to choose a side and fight hard. If you don’t, the winner might control you, while the loser will be mad because you didn’t help them fight. The winner doesn’t want friends who aren’t loyal, and the loser won’t trust you because you didn’t support them with your own strength.
