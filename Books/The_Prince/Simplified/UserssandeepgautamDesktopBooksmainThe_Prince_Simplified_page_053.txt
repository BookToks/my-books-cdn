The most intense part of this scandal is when the author talks about Cesare Borgia, a guy who gained power and kept it by being really sneaky and cruel. The translator might be tempted to focus on the book’s wild ideas, making sure readers aren’t disappointed, even if the tone and details aren’t exactly what people expected.

At the end of the part about Borgia, after explaining how he lost power when his dad, Pope Alexander, died suddenly and a new pope who didn’t like Borgia was chosen, Machiavelli writes: “Having gathered then all the actions of the duke, I would not know how to reproach him.” One translator, Bull, says it like this: “So having summed up all that the duke did, I cannot possibly censure him.” The word “censure” means a serious moral judgment, and adding “can’t possibly” makes it sound even stronger. It seems like Machiavelli is saying he doesn’t have any moral complaints about what Cesare Borgia did, which fits with his reputation for being pretty cynical.

Another translator, Marriot, is more careful and says: “When all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to blame him.” Both Italian translations agree with this. The important thing is that just like the word “virtù” isn’t usually about morals, the word “riprendere,” which means “reproach,” isn’t about moral behavior either. It’s more about whether the duke made a mistake or did something wrong.
