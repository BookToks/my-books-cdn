In Lugdunum (now called Lyons), Albinus either killed himself or was killed. Colleone was known for never switching sides or trying to play both sides against each other. He is famous for the statue of Alexander the Great (356–323 BC), King of Macedonia (336–323 BC), who conquered Greece, Persia, and much of Asia.

Marcus Aurelius Alexander Severus (208–235), a Roman emperor (222–235), was adopted by Emperor Heliogabalus, who was also his cousin. Alexander became Bishop of Pamplona at fifteen and a cardinal at eighteen but was eventually killed by his own soldiers.

Rodrigo Borgia (1431–1503), born in Valencia with the Spanish name Borja, Italianized to Borgia, became Pope Alexander VI in 1492. He openly admitted to having many illegitimate children, including Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia, and tried to give them powerful positions.

Cesare Borgia was suspected of murdering his older brother Giovanni in 1497 but wasn’t proven guilty. In 1498, he worked with King Louis XII of France to end Louis’s marriage so he could marry the widow of Charles VIII. This helped form a strong military alliance with the pope to take Naples.

Cesare was the first person ever to quit being a cardinal. After that, Louis made him Duke of Valentinois, so he was called Duke Valentino. With Louis’s help, Cesare took over towns in the Romagna region, becoming Duke of Romagna in 1501.

Cesare led French troops at the siege of Naples in 1501 and then captured Urbino and Camerino in 1502. He hired Leonardo da Vinci as a military engineer. When some of his hired soldiers rebelled, Cesare tricked them into a meeting and then locked them up and killed them.

After his father died in 1503, Cesare lost his lands and was eventually imprisoned and sent to Spain, where he died while serving his brother-in-law, King John III of Navarre.

Giovanni Bentivoglio (1438–1508) was the son of Annibale, ruler of Bologna, who was killed when Giovanni was a child. Giovanni became ruler in 1462 but had to flee when Pope Julius II attacked Bologna in 1506.

Bartolomeo Colleone (c.1395–1475) was a mercenary leader for Venice and led their forces against Milan after another leader named Carmagnola was killed.

Andrea Braccio da Montone (1368–1424) was a successful mercenary commander who fought in many battles.
