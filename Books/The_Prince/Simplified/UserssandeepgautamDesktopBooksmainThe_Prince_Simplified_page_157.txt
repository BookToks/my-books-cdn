Luck plays a big part in what happens to people and countries. If some countries like Germany, Spain, and France had been better prepared, the floods wouldn’t have caused such big problems or might not have happened at all.

That’s mostly all you need to know about how to handle luck in general.

But if you look closer, you can see how a leader might be doing great one day and lose power the next, even if they haven’t changed. Many people think this is because the world is controlled by both God and chance. Sometimes leaders just trust luck too much and don’t protect themselves.

Because of that, some leaders think it’s not worth trying and just let things happen. This way of thinking has become more common because the world is changing so fast. I believe a good leader is the one who changes with the times. A leader fails when they don’t adjust to what’s going on around them.

Everyone wants fame and money, but they try to get these things in different ways. Some are careful, some act without thinking; some use force, others are smart about it; some wait patiently, others rush. All these ways can work.

Also, two people can both be careful but have different results—one wins, the other loses. Or two people might both succeed but use different methods. Whether they win or lose depends on if their way fits the situation.

It’s like a river that sometimes floods and destroys everything. People can’t stop the flood, but they can build walls and banks to protect themselves. Luck is like that flood. It’s strongest where no one prepares for it and can cause a lot of damage.

When a leader’s way matches the situation, they do well. But if the situation changes and they don’t change too, things go badly. Leaders don’t easily change how they act because they’re used to doing things a certain way, especially if it has worked before.

So, luck decides about half of what happens to us, but the other half depends on what we do. When people’s actions fit the times, they succeed. When they don’t, they fail.
