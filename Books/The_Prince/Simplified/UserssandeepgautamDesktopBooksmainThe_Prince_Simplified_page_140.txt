Even if your hired soldiers are good, they’ll never be good enough to completely protect your castles and other defenses from strong enemies and unfriendly people.

Leaders often use different methods to stay in control. Like I said, a new leader in a new country always arms the people living there. History shows this happens all the time.

But when a leader takes over a new area and adds it to an existing country, they usually take away weapons from the people there—except from the men who helped him take the land. Over time, even those men should be watched closely.

To keep power safe, some leaders disarm their citizens so they are weak and can’t fight back. Some keep towns divided and fighting each other. Others make people hate the leader so they won’t work together. Some try to win over the people who don’t trust them at first. Some build forts, while others destroy them. Even though it’s hard to say which method is best without knowing the details, I will try to explain the ideas in general.

No new leader ever disarms their people right away. Instead, they give them weapons. When you give people weapons, those weapons belong to you. People who might have been against you become loyal, and those already loyal become even stronger supporters. You can’t arm everyone, but if you give weapons to some, you can trust them better.

The people you arm will feel loyal to you. The others won’t be angry because they know the armed people are risking their lives for you and deserve more rewards. But if you take weapons away from people, you upset them. It shows you don’t trust them, and soon they will start to hate you. If you don’t trust your own people, you’ll have to hire mercenary soldiers, and they have many problems I talked about before.

Long ago, experts in Florence said you had to control the city of Pistoia by encouraging fights between its groups, and control Pisa by holding its forts. So, they made some towns fight among themselves to keep control. When there was a balance of power between groups in Italy, this worked well. But I don’t think this idea works today.

When a town is divided by fights, it will fall quickly if an enemy attacks. The weaker group will join the enemy, and the stronger won’t be able to fight both. The Venetians thought the same way when they encouraged fights between groups called Guelphs and Ghibellines in the towns they controlled. They stopped the groups from fighting each other violently but kept them divided so they couldn’t unite against Venice.

This plan didn’t work well. After Venice lost a battle at Vaila`, one group got brave and took control of different towns. This kind of plan shows a weak leader. In a strong and confident country, leaders don’t need to divide their people like this.
