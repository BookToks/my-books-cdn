Over the last hundred years, the people of Florence took control of Arezzo, Pisa, and Cortona. They also spent a lot of energy trying, but failing, to take over Lucca.

Rome, under any pope, always wanted to grow bigger by taking over areas to the north and east like Romagna and Emilia. They hoped to take cities like Perugia, Bologna, Rimini, and Forlì. This plan would cause fights with both Venice and Florence. In the far south, Naples was ruled by a branch of the Aragon family. But the French kings from the Angevin family and the Spanish royal family (also Aragons) both wanted to control Naples, which made things even more complicated.

The situation was really messy. Besides the big states, there were at least twenty smaller ones, some just towns with fields around them. These small states were always in danger of being attacked by others. Even though things were always changing, big changes didn’t happen often. Whenever one power won a big battle, the others would team up to stop it from getting stronger. Florence stayed independent mostly because if Venice, Milan, or Rome tried to take it over, the other two would jump in to stop them. So, for over a hundred years, there was a kind of balance between the powers. This all changed when the French invaded in 1494.

The invasion, as Machiavelli explains in his book The Prince, was mostly the Italians’ own fault. For a long time, the five main states had been scaring each other by threatening to bring in foreign armies.
