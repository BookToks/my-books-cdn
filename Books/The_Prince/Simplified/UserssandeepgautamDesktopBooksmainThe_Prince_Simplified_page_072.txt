Sharing Lombardy with the Venetians was a choice others made when they took over land, and it was understandable because it gave him a base in Italy. But there was no need to share Naples with Spain, so that was a mistake.  

Louis made five mistakes: he got rid of the weaker states; he made one of Italy’s strongest states even more powerful; he brought in a very powerful foreign king; he didn’t put settlers in the land he took; and he didn’t set up colonies there.  

I talked about this with the Cardinal of Rouen when Duke Valentino (that was what people called Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander) was attacking Romagna. The cardinal said Italians didn’t know anything about war, and I told him the French didn’t know much about politics. If they did, they wouldn’t let the pope get so powerful.  

Still, these mistakes might not have caused big problems while Louis was alive if he hadn’t made a sixth mistake: taking power away from Venice. If he hadn’t helped the pope and brought Spain into Italy, it would have made sense to weaken Venice. But after the choices he already made, he should never have made Venice so weak.  

As long as Venice was strong in the military, no one would try to take Lombardy from France. The Venetians wouldn’t let another state attack unless they got land too, and other states wouldn’t want to take Lombardy from France if it meant giving it to Venice. Also, no one would dare fight both France and Venice at the same time.  

Some might say Louis gave Romagna to the pope and Naples to Spain to avoid war. But I repeat: you must never avoid trouble just to skip war because in the end, you don’t avoid it—you just give your enemy an advantage. Others might say Louis promised the pope he’d attack Venice if the pope let him get a divorce and made the Archbishop of Rouen a cardinal. I’ll talk later about when rulers should or shouldn’t keep their promises.  

So Louis lost Lombardy because he didn’t take the right steps.
