If a person can’t see problems coming, they can’t be a smart leader. But only a few people have this skill. If you want to know why the Roman Empire fell, it started when they began hiring Goths as soldiers. From that point, the empire got weaker, and its enemies got stronger.

So, to finish: no country is safe without its own army. If it doesn’t have people ready to defend it with loyalty and courage during hard times, it’s just hoping for luck. Leaders who understand this know that their only focus should be on building a strong army and keeping good discipline. This is the main job of someone in charge.

Having your own army means having soldiers who are your own people—citizens or subjects who depend on you. Other forces, like mercenaries or helpers, aren’t as reliable. To learn how to build your own army, just look at how leaders like Philip, Alexander the Great’s dad, or others did it. They are good examples.

A military leader with his own army, like Francesco Sforza, could rise from a common person to Duke of Milan. But if his sons avoided the hard parts of war, they lost their power and became commoners again. One big problem with not having an army is that people will see you as weak, and that’s something a leader must avoid. 

The truth is, a person with an army is way more powerful than one without. Someone who commands soldiers won’t easily listen to someone who doesn’t have any army. They might not trust each other and won’t work well together. So, besides other problems, a leader who doesn’t care about war won’t earn the respect or trust of their soldiers.
