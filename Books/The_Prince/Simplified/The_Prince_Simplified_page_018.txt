Machiavelli spent most of his job trying to convince other nearby countries not to attack Florence or expect help from Florence in their wars. Basically, his main plan was to avoid trouble as much as possible. When he was far from home, he often got confusing orders after he had already started talking to other leaders.  

When he reached other cities, he found that the money he was given wasn’t enough to pay messengers to send news back to Florence. Sometimes, he barely had enough money for food and clothes. Because the more powerful rulers didn’t respect him, he often had to wait days or even weeks before they would meet with him.  

These problems helped explain why Machiavelli became so focused on creating an army made up of regular citizens, which you can see in his book, The Prince.  

Florence was weak not just because it was small, but mostly because it didn’t have its own soldiers. It used hired armies, but these armies often ran away when things got hard, like during the battle at Pisa.  

Machiavelli hoped that having a strong and loyal citizen army would give him more power and respect when he talked to other leaders.  

In June 1502, after working for four years, Machiavelli met Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI.
