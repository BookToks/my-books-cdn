So, these rulers we had, who were already kings and dukes but still lost their lands, shouldn’t blame bad luck. They only have themselves to blame.

Usually, when things are peaceful, they don’t expect anything to change. A new ruler often thinks it’s normal to not prepare for problems when everything seems calm. When trouble comes, their first reaction is to run away instead of fighting. They hope the people will be angry at the invaders and call the ruler back. This might work if there’s no other choice, but it’s a big mistake to rely on that instead of being ready. A ruler should never accept losing power just because they expect to be brought back later. Maybe people won’t help, and even if they do, you won’t be safe because your plan was weak and depended on others.

The only strong and lasting defense comes from relying on yourself – having good laws, a strong army, good allies, and smart policies. On the other hand, a person born into power who acts foolishly and loses it is embarrassed twice as much.

Looking at some Italian rulers who lost power recently – like the King of Naples and the Duke of Milan – the first problem was their weak armies. Also, some didn’t have the support of the people, or if they did, they lost the support of the nobles. Without fixing these problems, you can’t keep control of a state strong enough to have an army.

If you look at Italy, which has seen many big changes and started some revolutions, you’ll notice it doesn’t have natural defenses like rivers or mountains to protect it.
