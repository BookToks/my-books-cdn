Monarchy with public support

A man who comes to power with the support of regular people usually holds it by himself and has almost no one around who refuses to obey him. Also, you can’t fairly give the nobles what they want without hurting others, but you can do that with the people. This is because the people want something better than the nobles do: the nobles want to control and hurt the people, while the people want to be free from control.

Now, let’s talk about a second case, where a private citizen becomes king in his own country not by crime or bad actions, but with the support of other citizens. This is called a monarchy with public support. To become this kind of king, you don’t have to be super smart or lucky, just clever in the right way.

To take control of this kind of state, you need the support of either the common people or the rich nobles. In every city, you find two different political groups: there are the common people who don’t want to be bossed around or hurt by the noble families, and there are nobles who want to control and boss around the common people. These opposite ideas can lead to three things: a monarchy, a republic, or chaos.

A monarchy can happen because of either the common people or the nobles, whenever one side finds it useful. Since the wealthy families can’t control the people, they start focusing their power on some of their own and make one of them king to get what they want from him. Similarly, the people, who can’t beat the nobles, put their trust in one person and make him king to protect them.

A king who is helped by the rich nobles will have a harder time keeping power than one who gets help from the people. This is because the nobles might be waiting for the right moment to turn against him. But a king supported by the people will be surrounded by men who see themselves as equals, and that can make it harder for him to give orders or control things as he wants.
