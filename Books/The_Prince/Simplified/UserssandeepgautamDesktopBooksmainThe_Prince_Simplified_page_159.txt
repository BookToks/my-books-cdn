Here’s what I think: just drop it. When it’s time for a careful guy to act, it’s better to be impulsive than too cautious. Luck is like a woman, and if a guy is too careful, he can mess up. If he wants to keep control, he has to be bold and take action.

Luck changes with the times and situations. You’ll see that luck is more likely to favor guys who are bold than those who just stay still. Since luck is like a woman, she likes her men young because they’re less scared, wilder, and braver when they deal with her.

Pope Julius II always acted quickly and lived in a time that suited this style, so things always went well for him. For example, his first success was taking Bologna while Giovanni Bentivoglio was still alive.

The Venetians and the King of Spain didn’t like the idea, and Julius was still trying to negotiate with the French. But still, with his usual energy and quick decisions, Julius led the attack himself. This confused the Venetians and Spanish—they couldn’t react because the Venetians were scared and the Spanish wanted to get the Kingdom of Naples back. At the same time, Julius got the King of France on his side. The King needed Rome as an ally against Venice and decided he couldn’t refuse Julius’s request for help without causing problems.

Because of this quick decision, Julius achieved more than any other pope using all the careful planning in the world could have done. If he had waited to arrange everything perfectly before leaving Rome, the plan would never have worked.

The King of France would have found endless excuses, and the Venetians and Spanish would have given endless warnings. I won’t go into Julius’s other campaigns, which were similar and all successful. He died young before he faced failure. If times had changed and required caution, he would have been finished. He never would have changed because that was just who he was.

So, in conclusion: luck changes, but men keep going no matter what.
