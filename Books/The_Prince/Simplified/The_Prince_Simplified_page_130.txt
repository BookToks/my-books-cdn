To protect yourself from other countries, you need a strong army and good friends. If your army is strong, you’ll also have good allies. When you’re safe from outside threats, you’ll usually be safe inside your own country too, as long as no one is already planning against you. Then, if another country tries to attack, if you’ve prepared like I said, you just have to stay calm and you’ll survive, like the Spartan leader Nabis I talked about earlier.

Now that I’ve talked about the most important qualities, I want to quickly explain the others. When there’s no threat from outside, a ruler has to make sure his people don’t start planning against him. He can do this by making sure he’s not hated and that people are happy with him. This is really important, as I explained before.

One of the best ways to stop conspiracies is to not be hated by most people. People who want to overthrow a ruler have to believe that killing him will be popular. If they think it won’t be, they will give up because conspiracies are always really hard to pull off. A person planning a conspiracy can’t do it alone; they need others who are unhappy. But as soon as they tell someone else, that person might betray them to get something out of it.

A ruler will be disliked if he seems weak, always changing his mind, or afraid. So, a ruler should avoid those things and act confident, serious, and strong. When solving arguments between people, he should make sure everyone knows his decision is final and no one can trick him.

If a ruler acts this way, people will respect him and it will be hard for others to plan against him. Also, if he has a good reputation, it will be hard for enemies from outside to attack him.

To sum up: a ruler has to protect himself from two dangers—one from inside the country, from his own people, and one from outside, from foreign enemies.
