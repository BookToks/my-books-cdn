In our own time, the only leaders we've seen doing great things were all known for being stingy. The others failed. Pope Julius II used his reputation for generosity to become pope, but then happily let it go to pay for his wars. The current King of France has fought many wars without raising new taxes because he constantly cuts costs to cover the extra spending. The current King of Spain wouldn’t have won so many wars if he had been known for being generous.

If we look at generosity first, it sounds nice to be seen as generous. But a ruler doesn’t have to steal from people or take advantage of others, and being generous just to look generous will actually hurt you. A ruler who truly gives from kindness might be ignored, and you won’t escape being called stingy. So, if you want people to think you’re generous, you’ll have to be generous in every way. But this will use up all your money, and to keep up the image, you’ll have to raise special taxes and do everything to get more cash. People will start hating you, and no one will respect you once you’re broke.

Because your generosity helps only a few and hurts most, you’ll be in danger when bad news comes. If you realize this and try to change, people will call you stingy. Some say generosity helped Caesar win the empire and others reach top power. But a ruler already in power must be careful; generosity is risky for him. Caesar wanted to be emperor, but if he had kept spending like that, he would have destroyed the empire.

Some argue many great military leaders were very generous. I’d say a ruler spends either his own money, his people’s money, or someone else’s. If it’s his own or his people’s money, he should be careful. If it’s someone else’s money, he should be as generous as possible.

A smart ruler won’t mind being called stingy at first. Over time, if people see he doesn’t need to raise taxes and can defend the country and fight wars without hurting his people, they’ll think he’s generous. This kind of generosity is towards almost everyone and especially those who get nothing from him.

A ruler who fights wars and lives on loot and extortion uses other people’s money and should be generous with it, or his soldiers won’t follow him. Giving away what isn’t yours or your people’s money is easy. Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander did this. Spending other people’s money doesn’t make you look bad – it actually makes you look better.
