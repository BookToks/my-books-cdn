Experience shows that women are more often won over by men who are bold and active than by those who act distant and cold. Because she is a woman, she prefers young men since they are less careful and more passionate, and they take charge with more confidence.

I hope I’m starting to understand what Machiavelli meant, and here’s what I think: In the end, luck changes, but people keep going no matter what.

When their actions fit the times, they succeed, and when they don’t, they fail. My view is this: it’s better to be daring than too careful. Luck is like a woman, and if you want to stay in control of her, you have to be bold and take action. She’s more likely to respond to that than to guys who are cold and distant. Also, since she’s a woman, she likes young men because they aren’t so cautious—they’re wilder and braver when they take charge.
