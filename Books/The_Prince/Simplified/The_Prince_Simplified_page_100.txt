These towns are really well protected, so everyone knows it would be super hard and tiring to attack them. They have big moats and strong walls, the right weapons, and public stores with food, drinks, and firewood that can last a whole year. They also keep materials for important jobs that help the city survive, so people can keep working without using up all the city’s money. The towns also take their military training seriously and make sure everyone practices a lot.

When thinking about how strong a state is, an important question is: if attacked, can the ruler defend themselves with their own resources, or will they always need help from others? More clearly, if a ruler has enough soldiers or money to make an army that can fight anyone, I say they can defend themselves. But if a ruler can’t fight outside the city and has to hide behind the walls, they’ll always need help from others.

You might wonder, what if people live outside the walls and see their homes being burned? Won’t they get angry and lose faith in their ruler during a long siege? A strong leader with power and a good personality can handle this. They can make people hopeful that the siege won’t last long, scare them with stories about how harsh the enemy is, and stop anyone from acting too rashly. Also, the enemy will burn the countryside while the people inside the town are still ready to fight. After a few days, when people’s anger cools down, the damage is done and there’s no going back. This makes people support their ruler even more because they feel they owe him for protecting their homes.

Cities in Germany are totally independent, with little land around them, and they only listen to the emperor when it suits them. They aren’t scared of him or any other powerful rulers nearby.
