I owe a lot to them because, even though I always translate straight from the original, I also check these and modern Italian translations to see where they disagree and think about what I can learn from them. The original text is tricky, and sometimes all four translations—two English and two Italian—have different meanings. In those cases, you really have to understand how Machiavelli thinks, how he focuses on logic, reason, and careful thinking. You also have to remember that every sentence, and even every word, is there for a reason.

Here’s a small example. Machiavelli says that rulers must never be hated by their people, because hatred usually causes a leader to lose power. But he knows some people will say that many Roman emperors stayed in power even though they were hated, or lost power even though they were loved. To answer this, he says he will look at some of these emperors and explain how the reasons they lost power actually fit with his ideas.

So far, so good, but then the sentence ends with a phrase in Italian: ". . . e parte metterò in considerazione quelle cose che sono notabili a chi legge le azioni di quelli tempi."

If you translate it word for word, it means: . . .
