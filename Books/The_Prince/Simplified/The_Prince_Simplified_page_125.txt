Of course, when dealing with complaints and not getting scared, there are always reasons for taking people’s stuff, and it’s not done without a cause. A ruler should act calmly and carefully. A leader who lives this way will never run out of reasons to take more. But if he trusts too much, he’ll get careless, and if he trusts no one, he’ll become unbearable. The reasons for punishing someone happen less often and don’t last long.

This makes us ask: is it better to be loved or feared? The answer is that it’s best to be both, but since that rarely happens, it’s much safer to be feared than loved. Most people are ungrateful and unreliable; they lie, cheat, and run away when things get tough. While you’re safe, they’ll be loyal and even sacrifice for you, but when danger comes, they’ll leave you. A ruler who only trusts promises and takes no other steps is doomed to fail.

Men care less about letting down someone who loves them and more about someone who makes them afraid. Love creates bonds when people feel grateful, but since people often forget gratitude quickly, fear of punishment is something they always remember. Hannibal was a great example. He led a huge, mixed army far from home without any rebellion or complaints, whether winning or losing. This happened because of his great cruelty, which made his soldiers respect and fear him. Without that cruelty, his other good qualities wouldn’t have worked.

We can also look at Scipio. He was a rare leader but too easy-going, letting his soldiers have too much freedom. This hurt discipline, and his army rebelled in Spain. When his officers destroyed a town, he didn’t punish them, which made people think he was weak. If he had kept strict order, his reputation might have been better. Still, a ruler who wants to be feared must avoid being hated. He shouldn’t take people’s property or harm their families unfairly. If he has to punish someone, there must be a clear reason.

Scipio’s way of leading would have damaged his fame if he had kept going, but because he followed the Senate’s orders, his mistakes were overlooked and his reputation stayed strong.
