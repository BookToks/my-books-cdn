You can see the country is praying to God to send someone to save her from the cruelty and harshness of foreigners. She wants someone to conquer Italy and free it from foreign rule. You can see she is ready and willing to fight under a flag, if only someone would raise one up.

What I can’t see is any family the country could trust right now, except your famous house, blessed with good qualities and wealth, favored by God and the Church – actually running the Church, in fact – and so well placed to lead Italy to freedom. If you remember the lives and achievements of the men I’ve talked about, then this job won’t be too hard. It’s true they were rare and amazing men, but they were still just men, and none had a better chance than you do now. The things they did weren’t easier or more justified; God hasn’t been kinder to them than He has been to you. Justice is always on your side because “war is just when there’s no alternative, and weapons are sacred when they are your only hope.”

I honestly don’t know a better time than now for a new leader in Italy. The situation is very favorable, and when things are favorable, success can’t be too hard. All you have to do is follow the examples of the men I’ve suggested. What’s more, God has shown us amazing, never-before-seen signs: the sea and sky have parted; a cloud has guided the way; stone has given us water; manna has rained down from heaven. Everything has come together to make you great. The rest depends on you. God isn’t doing everything himself; He wants us to use our free will and earn our share of glory.

There was one man who showed signs of greatness, the kind that made you think he was sent by God for the country’s freedom, but then his luck changed at the worst moment. Now Italy lies half-dead, waiting for someone to heal her wounds and stop the damage in Lombardy, the heavy taxes in Tuscany and Naples, and to fix problems that have lasted too long.
