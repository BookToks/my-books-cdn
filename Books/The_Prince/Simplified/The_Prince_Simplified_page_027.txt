Who was this ruler? Just before Machiavelli got out of prison, Pope Julius died and was replaced by Giovanni de’ Medici, the son of il Magnifico. Giovanni had become a cardinal when he was only thirteen. This happened in March 1513. A few months later, when Machiavelli started writing The Prince, he planned to dedicate the book to Giovanni’s brother, Giuliano, who was in charge of Florence after the Medicis came back. But when Giuliano, who didn’t seem very interested in politics, stepped back and his bold and tough nephew Lorenzo took over, Machiavelli decided to dedicate the book to Lorenzo instead.

So far, Machiavelli was willing to change his plans depending on what was happening. But there is something honest and almost sweet about his mistake here. The smart thinking he used to convince himself that he understood politics and history perfectly, and the deep analysis he wanted to show off to other smart people, were probably too complicated for a young Medici prince who hadn’t read much and wasn’t likely to understand or enjoy it.

When Lorenzo got the book in 1515, he probably never even opened it and definitely didn’t spend time reading Machiavelli’s careful thoughts. And even if he had read it, would Lorenzo, or any other ruler, have wanted a diplomat who openly said that trickery was a big part of politics? Or that having real religious faith didn’t matter much, as long as you looked like you had it?
