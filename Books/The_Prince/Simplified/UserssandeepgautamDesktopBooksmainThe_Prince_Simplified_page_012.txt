When Machiavelli was young, he might have thought that religion and politics were basically the same thing. The pope supported a plan called the Pazzi conspiracy, priests helped try to kill Lorenzo, and after it failed, Lorenzo was kicked out of the church. So, religious rules were really used as political tools.

A war broke out between Florence and Rome. It only stopped in 1480 when Turkish attacks on southern Italy made everyone come together for a bit. Years later, Lorenzo got on the good side of a new pope and even got his son Giovanni a big church job at just thirteen. Going from being kicked out of the church to being the pope’s favorite was a huge change, and again, it was more about politics than true faith. It seemed like money and smart deals could get you anything.

At this time, Machiavelli was twenty-one. We don’t know much about his early adult life, but we do know he listened to a passionate preacher named Girolamo Savonarola. Savonarola led an important monastery and believed in a very strict kind of Christianity. Unlike the corrupt and pleasure-loving church leaders, he wanted to go back to the Bible as the only true guide. He saw the Church as under attack in a world that cared more about new ideas than about the Bible.
