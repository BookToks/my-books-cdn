During the Renaissance in Italy, theatre changed the typical villain by adding ideas from Machiavelli. This made the villain a sneaky courtier who enjoyed being cruel and cunning. English theatre then copied this idea, creating many tricky bad guys—like pimps, stingy people, or jealous husbands—who were good at using poison and always carried a dagger.

For playwrights, a dishonest character with secret plans and a belief that they are smarter than everyone else is really interesting. This kind of character makes the story exciting, keeps things moving, and allows the good guys to win in the end after the bad guy causes trouble. Even though the audience might dislike characters like Marlowe’s Jew of Malta, Webster’s Flamineo, or Shakespeare’s Iago, there’s also a thrill in imagining someone who can control life, trick others, and chase their own goals without caring about right or wrong. In this way, the Machiavellian villain shows a dark side of being selfish and powerful.

There’s also fun in watching the clever villain get caught in their own trap.

As time went on, and the serious Jacobean tragedies turned into comedies by writers like Ben Jonson, the evil Machiavellian villain became more of a joke. Their evil plans always failed, and they ended up looking foolish.
