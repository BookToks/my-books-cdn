When people rebel, they always come together because they want freedom and are inspired by their old traditions. It doesn’t matter how long they’ve been controlled or if the control seems kind—these feelings never go away. If the people haven’t been completely defeated and forgotten, they will rise up to fight for their freedom as soon as they get a chance, like the Pisans did after being ruled by Florence for a hundred years.

But if a group of people is used to having a ruler and that ruler and their family are removed, they won’t know how to pick a new leader or live freely on their own. So, they will be slower to act. In the next part, I’ll talk about places where both the leader and the government are completely new. It’s normal to use examples from well-known cases.

People almost always rebel, and an invader can win them over more easily. But republics are different—they have more energy, more hatred, and want revenge more. They remember their old freedoms and won’t rest until they get them back. In these situations, your only choices are to destroy the place or live there yourself.

When trying to copy someone great, you can’t follow their path exactly or be just like them. So, it’s smart to follow the example of someone truly great, even if you can’t be as good. It’s like a smart archer who knows his bow can’t shoot far enough, so he aims high so the arrow will land on the target.

Now, let's start by saying that when a new leader takes over a place completely new to them, how easy or hard it is to stay in power depends on their skills or mistakes. You can’t go from being a normal person to a ruler without either talent or good luck. Usually, one of these helps to get through the difficulties. Leaders who don’t depend too much on luck usually last longer. Another good thing is that if the leader doesn’t already have another state, they’ll have to live in their new place.
