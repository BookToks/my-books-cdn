He found a new way to increase the Church’s income that had never been used before.

The country was controlled by the pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and the Florentines. These powerful states had two main goals: to keep foreign armies out of Italy and to stop each other from taking more land. The pope and the Venetians wanted to expand the most.

Julius not only followed what Alexander did but went even further. He planned to take Bologna, beat the Venetians, and push the French out of Italy. In the end, he succeeded in all three, and he got more credit because he did it for the glory of the Church, not for personal gain.

He kept the Orsini and Colonna families, two powerful groups, under control. Even though some leaders tried to change things, two problems stopped them: the Church’s power scared them, and they had no cardinals. Cardinals usually cause fights, but without them, these groups stayed weak and indecisive.

The barons were split into two groups, the Orsinis and the Colonnas, and they always fought each other. Even when a strong pope like Sixtus came along, he couldn’t fix the problem because the cardinals caused too much conflict. Popes usually didn’t last long, about ten years on average, so if one pope weakened one group, the next might support the other. That’s why the Italian states didn’t respect the pope’s political power much.

Then came Alexander VI, who showed what could be done with money and military force. Using his son Valentino Borgia and the French’s internal problems, he made great gains. Although Alexander wanted to make his son powerful, his actions also made the Church stronger, which lasted after both their deaths.

When Julius became pope, the Church already controlled all of Romagna and was stronger because Alexander had defeated the Roman barons.

The soldiers in these armies only fought because they were paid a small salary, which wasn’t enough to make them want to die for their leaders.
