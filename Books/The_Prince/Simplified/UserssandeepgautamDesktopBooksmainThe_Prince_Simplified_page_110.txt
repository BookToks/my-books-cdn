A lot of big cities fought against the local nobles who needed the emperor’s support to keep control over their soldiers. The Church helped the rebels because it wanted to have more influence and build citizen armies. In many other towns, private citizens took over as leaders. 

Because much of Italy was now controlled by the Church and republics—people who didn’t have war experience—leaders started hiring soldiers from outside. The first successful mercenary leader was Alberigo da Conio from Romagna. Auxiliary armies, which means asking a powerful ruler for military help to defend your town, didn’t work well.

Francesco Sforza and others became important leaders in Italy’s future. Recently, we can look at Pope Julius during his campaign in Ferrara as an example. After seeing how badly his mercenary soldiers fought, he made a deal with King Ferdinand of Spain to get help. Auxiliary armies can be useful for their own goals, but they usually cause problems for the people who hire them. If they lose, you lose; if they win, you are at their mercy.

Mercenaries didn’t want to use many infantry soldiers because they were hard to feed and not impressive enough. They focused on cavalry, which are soldiers on horses, and kept their numbers smaller. For example, an army of 20,000 might have fewer than 2,000 infantry. Mercenaries tried to avoid hard work and danger—they wouldn’t fight each other to the death, only take prisoners, and didn’t ask for ransom. They avoided night attacks and didn’t leave their own camps to fight. They didn’t build defenses or camp in winter. They wanted to avoid risk and hard work.

All this behavior caused Italy to fall into chaos and humiliation. Ancient history shows many examples, but Pope Julius II’s choice to rely totally on a foreign army to take Ferrara was especially risky. Luckily for him, the Spanish soldiers were defeated at Ravenna, but the Swiss unexpectedly came and defeated the French. This saved Pope Julius from being captured by his enemies or his own soldiers. 

Meanwhile, the Florentines, who had no army, captured 10,000 French soldiers to lay siege to Pisa. This decision put them in more danger than they had ever faced. Because of these fights, the emperor started losing control of Italy, while the pope gained more power. This made Italy split into smaller states.
