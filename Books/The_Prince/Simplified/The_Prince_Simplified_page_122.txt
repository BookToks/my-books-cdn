Spending only your own money is what really puts you at risk.

Generosity can use itself up because when you give a lot, you lose the resources you need to keep giving. You might end up poor and looked down on, or you might become stingy and hated to avoid being poor. A leader has to be careful not to be hated or looked down on.

Being generous can cause problems. It’s smarter to be known as a little stingy, which has a bad reputation but doesn’t make people hate you, than to try to seem generous but end up being seen as greedy and hated. Every leader wants to be seen as kind instead of cruel.

But a leader must be careful how they show kindness. Cesare Borgia was called cruel, but his harsh actions brought peace and loyalty to Romagna. In a way, he was kinder than the leaders in Florence, who were too worried about seeming cruel and caused chaos in Pistoia. A leader shouldn’t worry about being called cruel if it keeps people loyal and united. Sometimes, being strict is kinder than being too soft, which can lead to crime and disorder. Crime hurts everyone, but punishments only affect the people involved. New rulers especially can’t avoid being seen as cruel because new territories are dangerous. As Queen Dido says, having a new kingdom forces a ruler to act tough and protect their borders.
