With his own strength and the support of a few people who are angry but can’t fight back because they’ve lost everything, he can easily weaken the stronger neighbors and take control of the area. But if an invader doesn’t manage his new neighbors well, he will lose the land he took. Even while holding on to it, he will face many problems and hatred.

You have to either treat people well or destroy them completely. If you only hurt them a little, they will fight back; if you hurt them badly, they won’t be able to. So, if you want to hurt people, make sure you don’t have to worry about their reaction. If you send an army to occupy a place instead of setting up colonies, it will cost a lot and all the money you get from the territory will be used to defend it, turning a gain into a loss. You’ll also cause more hatred because an army moving around and taking over homes will damage the whole area, making everyone angry. These are enemies who can fight back, even if they’ve been beaten but are still on their own land. So, no matter how you look at it, military bases are useless, but colonies are helpful.

A ruler who moves into a new place where people speak a different language and have different customs must become the leader and protector of weaker neighbors, while also weakening the stronger ones. He must make sure no powerful foreign ruler can gain power there. The Romans did this well when they took over new provinces: they sent settlers, made friends with weaker neighbors without letting them get too strong, weakened stronger neighbors, and stopped powerful rulers outside the region from gaining influence. Their way of handling Greece is a good example. They made friends with the Achaeans and Aetolians, weakened Macedonia, and drove out Antiochus. They didn’t give the Achaeans and Aetolians more land even though they behaved well, and whenever Philip made friends with them, they became weaker. Antiochus, even though he was strong, was never allowed to have power in the region. The Romans were just doing what smart rulers always do: not only dealing with current problems but also using every way they can to see and stop future problems.

If you see trouble coming early, you can fix it easily; if you wait until it’s already a big problem, it’s too late to do anything. Think about what doctors say about tuberculosis: it’s easy to cure early but hard to find, and if you don’t treat it, it gets easy to find but hard to cure. The same goes for running a country. If you notice problems early (and you have to be smart about it), you can fix them fast. If you miss them, everyone will join the strongest power, and by the time you realize it, it’s too late to stop.

Every time the Romans moved into a new area, it was because local people invited them. This is natural because when a powerful foreign ruler moves into a place, all the weaker local groups support him, even if it’s just because they don’t like the stronger states that kept them down before. So, the new ruler can easily get their support. He just has to make sure they don’t take too much power for themselves. Because the Romans could see threats coming early, they always knew how to respond.
