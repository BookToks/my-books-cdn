...and part I will think about the things that matter to people who read about events from those times.

What is this about? Why did Machiavelli feel the need to add these words to a sentence that already seems clear? Bull says: ... I will share examples that students of the time know well.

This might sound smart and academic, but it’s not quite right. The word ‘parte’ is missing; ‘submit for consideration’ is a common English phrase, but does it really mean the same as Machiavelli’s unusual phrase ‘put in consideration’? The word ‘notabile’ doesn’t mean ‘well known’ but more like ‘important’ or ‘worth noticing.’ Marriot says: ... at the same time, I will only share things that are important to someone who studies what happened back then.

Again, we see the usual phrase ‘submit for consideration,’ but the words ‘at the same time’ and ‘only’ were added by the translator. Now it sounds like Machiavelli is trying to reassure us that he will only focus on examples that matter, but this kind of carefulness isn’t how the author usually writes.
