At this time, other Italian powers were involved, including Julius Caesar (around 100–44 BC).

He was killed by a group of senators, including his former friend Marcus Junius Brutus.

The Colonna family was powerful during the Middle Ages and Renaissance in Rome. They fought with the Bentivogli family over control of Bologna. The Bentivoglis were supported by Venice, while the Canneschis, allied with the Viscontis of Milan, were later excommunicated and had their lands taken away by Pope Alexander VII. In 1445, with help from Milan, Battista Canneschi had Annibale Bentivogli killed. But the people of Bologna turned on the Canneschis and killed Battista, forcing the rest of the family to flee.

Roman Emperor Commodus (161–193) was the son of Marcus Aurelius. He rejected his father’s strict lifestyle and focused on pleasure and fun. He allowed favorites to run the empire but was eventually murdered along with his supporters. Commodus liked to fight as a gladiator and was proud of his physical strength. He made all free people in the empire Roman citizens and kept the army happy by increasing soldiers’ pay. However, he was strangled by a wrestler named Narcissus.

Alberigo da Barbiano (around 1348–1409) was from Romagna but later became Count of Conio, a small town in the Italian hills by the Riviera. He was the first mercenary leader to insist his army be made up only of Italians. Carmagnola, a mercenary hired by Milan’s Duke Visconti, fought for Milan against Florence and Venice. After a victory in 1427, Carmagnola was accused of betrayal, arrested, and killed.

Cyrus (around 576–529 BC) founded the Persian Empire, which included much of central and southwest Asia.

Charles VII (1403–1461), King of France, was inspired by Joan of Arc. He united France under one ruler by driving out the English from most French lands, except Calais. He built a strong standing army.

David (around 1010–972 BC) was the second king of Israel.
