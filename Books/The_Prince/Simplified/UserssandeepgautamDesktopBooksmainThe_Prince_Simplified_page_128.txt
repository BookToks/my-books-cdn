If all people were good, you could trust them and keep your promises easily. But since most people aren’t that great and don’t keep their promises, you don’t really need to keep yours to them. A ruler will always have plenty of reasons to explain why they broke a promise.

There are many examples from today where leaders didn’t keep peace treaties or other promises. Those who are clever and tricky have done better than those who are honest. But you have to know how to hide your true intentions and act like something you are not. Most people are too busy or too trusting, so a con artist will always find someone to fool.

One famous example is Pope Alexander VI. He only cared about tricking people and always found victims. No one ever made more promises or swore more oaths, but he never kept any of them. His lies worked because he understood human nature so well.

A leader doesn’t have to be truly good, but he must look like he is. People judge by what they see, not by what they know. So if a leader does whatever it takes to get and keep power, his actions will be seen as honorable and praised. Most people follow the crowd and don’t listen to those who disagree.

There’s a certain king today* who never stops talking about peace and trust but actually works against both. If he really followed his words, he would have lost power many times. 

It’s important for a leader to seem compassionate, loyal, honest, and religious. You can even be those things sometimes, but you must be ready to change when your position is in danger. A new ruler can’t always act like a good person because to stay in power, he often has to go against loyalty, kindness, and religion.

What matters is that a ruler can change when he needs to and doesn’t put himself at risk by keeping promises that no longer make sense.
