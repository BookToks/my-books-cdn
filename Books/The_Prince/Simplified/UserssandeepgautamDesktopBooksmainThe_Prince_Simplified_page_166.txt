Albinus, from Lugdunum (now Lyons), either killed himself or was killed.

Colleone was special because he didn’t switch sides or try to trick people by playing both sides. He is famous in a statue by Andrea Verocchio in Venice, which shows him on his horse.

Alexander the Great (356–323 BC) was the King of Macedonia (336–323 BC). He conquered Greece, Persia, and much of Asia.

Marcus Aurelius Alexander Severus (208–235) was a Roman emperor (222–235). He was adopted as heir by Emperor Heliogabalus, who was also his cousin. Alexander was made Bishop of Pamplona at fifteen and a cardinal at eighteen but was eventually killed by his own soldiers.

Cesare Borgia (c.1475–1507) was the illegitimate son of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, who later became Pope Alexander VI (1431–1503). Born in Valencia, Rodrigo’s last name changed from Borja to Borgia in Italy.

Rodrigo Borgia became pope in 1492 and openly admitted to having as many as eight illegitimate children, all of whom he tried to give important jobs. The most famous were Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia.

Cesare was involved in many plots to gain more land and money. He was suspected of killing his older brother Giovanni, but no proof was found. After Giovanni’s murder in 1497, Cesare became the main person his father trusted for expanding their power.

In 1498, Cesare made a deal with King Louis XII of France. Louis’s marriage was ended so he could marry the widow of Charles VIII. Louis also agreed to work with the pope to take over Naples.

Cesare gave up being a cardinal and Louis made him Duke of Valentinois, so he was called Duke Valentino. Cesare married Charlotte d’Albret, Louis’s cousin, and fought with Louis’s army when they took Milan in 1499.

With support from his father and Louis, Cesare aimed to control Romagna, capturing towns like Fano, Pesaro, Rimini, Cesena, Forlì, Faenza, and Imola. In 1501, the pope named him Duke of Romagna.

Cesare led French troops at the siege of Naples in 1501 and then went back to Romagna to take Urbino and Camerino in 1502. He hired Leonardo da Vinci as his military engineer.

When some mercenary leaders rebelled, Cesare tricked them into coming to Senigallia, where he arrested and killed them all.

When his father died in 1503, Cesare lost power and Romagna was taken back. He was imprisoned and sent to Spain, where he died while serving his brother-in-law, King John III of Navarre.

Giovanni Bentivoglio (1438–1508) was the son of Annibale, who ruled Bologna. Giovanni’s father was murdered when he was a child. Giovanni took over in 1462 but had to flee when Pope Julius II attacked the town in 1506.

Bartolomeo Colleone (c.1395–1475) was a mercenary leader for Venice and fought against Milan after Carmagnola died.

Andrea Braccio da Montone (1368–1424) was a successful mercenary commander who fought many battles.
