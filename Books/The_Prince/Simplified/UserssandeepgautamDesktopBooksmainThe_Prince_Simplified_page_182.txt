Filippo Visconti (1392–1447) was the Duke of Milan from 1412 to 1447. He was a cruel and suspicious leader who used mercenary soldiers like Carmagnola and Francesco Sforza to rebuild his kingdom. To keep Sforza loyal, Filippo promised him his only child, Bianca Maria, in marriage but made him wait many years before the wedding.

Niccolò Vitelli (1414–1486) was a military commander who fought constantly against the pope’s forces to control the town of Città di Castello near Perugia, in Umbria. He was kicked out of the town by Pope Sixtus IV in 1475. After the failed Pazzi conspiracy, the Medici family supported him. When he got the town back, he destroyed the fortresses the pope had built while he was gone.

Paulo Vitelli (1461–1499), Niccolò’s son, was a mercenary leader who led the Florentine army during the siege of Pisa in 1498. Even though he broke through the city walls, Paulo acted very carefully and didn’t push forward. Because of this, people thought he was a traitor, and he was arrested and executed.

The Vitelli family was a noble family of mercenary commanders who controlled the town of Città di Castello near Perugia for most of the 1400s.

Vitellozzo Vitelli (around 1458–1502) was Niccolò’s son and Paulo’s brother. He was working for Florence with Paulo when Paulo was arrested and executed for treason. Vitellozzo escaped and then worked for Cesare Borgia. Later, he joined a group that planned against Borgia and was killed with other conspirators in Senigallia in 1502.

Xenophon (431–354 BC) was an Athenian and a friend of Socrates. He didn’t like democracy and spent much of his life in Sparta. He joined 10,000 mercenaries who fought for Cyrus in a campaign against Artaxerxes in Asia Minor in 401 BC. After Cyrus died, Xenophon helped lead the mercenaries on a long, 1,000-mile journey home, though fewer than 6,000 survived. He wrote about the campaign in a book called Anabasis.

Bernabò Visconti (1323–1385) ruled Milan with his two brothers from 1354 to 1385.
