Must. Have to. Definitely. Sure to happen. These are the words that keep showing up again and again in The Prince. And then there are words like success, winning, respect, achievement, and on the other side: loss, failure, defeat, death. These opposites are connected by words like because, so, hence, therefore, as a result, and because of that. From beginning to end, the book shows people trying to survive in a tricky web of cause and effect. What really matters is staying alive. Anything extra is just a bonus.

The Prince was written by a 44-year-old diplomat who was facing disaster. After 14 years of power and respect, a new government kicked him out. They thought he was plotting against them, so they put him in jail and tortured him. His life changed really fast and it was a huge shock. After they found out he was innocent and let him go, he left the city to live with his wife and family on a small farm.

For a man used to being busy and a womanizer who loved the excitement of public life, this felt like a punishment too. Bored and angry, he walked around the hills during the day and, in the long, lonely evenings, he started writing down his thoughts about how to gain power and, most importantly, how to keep it, so you donâ€™t become a victim of bad luck.
