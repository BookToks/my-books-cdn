A minister in charge of a state should never think about himself, only about the ruler, and focus completely on the ruler’s business. To make sure the minister does this, the ruler must care about him, give him money and respect, help him, and share honors and jobs with him. This way, the minister will know he can’t live without the ruler. He’ll have so many honors and so much money that he won’t want more, and so many important jobs that he will protect the current situation.

There is another problem rulers have to deal with, which they can only avoid if they are very smart or very good at picking ministers. I’m talking about flatterers.

Courts are full of flatterers, and people love to praise themselves and think they are more successful than they really are, so it’s easy to fall into this trap. But if you try to protect yourself from flatterers, people might start to hate you.

The only way to avoid flattery is to show people that you don’t mind hearing the truth. But if everyone can tell you the truth all the time, you lose respect.

So, a smart ruler should find a balance. He should pick smart men as ministers and let only them tell him the truth, and only when he asks them about something specific. The ruler should ask his ministers about everything and listen to what they say, but then decide on his own using his own judgment. When talking to his advisers, he should make it clear that the more honestly they speak, the more he welcomes their advice. After that, he shouldn’t listen to anyone else but should stick to his decisions firmly. If he doesn’t do this, he will either be fooled by flatterers or change his mind so often that people will stop respecting him.
