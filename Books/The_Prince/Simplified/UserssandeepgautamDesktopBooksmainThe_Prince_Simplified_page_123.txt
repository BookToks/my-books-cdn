Spending only your own money is what really puts you at risk.

Generosity can actually hurt itself because when you give a lot, you lose the resources to keep being generous. You might end up poor and people might look down on you. Or, to avoid being poor, you could become greedy and mean. It’s better for a leader to be feared or loved, but most importantly, not to be hated or despised.

Being generous can lead to both respect and hate. It’s smarter to have a reputation for being stingy, which some people don’t like, but at least it doesn’t make them hate you. Trying to seem generous but ending up being seen as greedy makes people hate you even more. Every leader wants to be seen as kind rather than cruel.

Still, a leader has to be careful about how they show kindness. Cesare Borgia was called cruel, but his harsh actions brought peace and order to Romagna, making the people loyal. In fact, he was kinder than the leaders in Florence who were too afraid to seem cruel and caused problems in Pistoia. A leader shouldn’t worry about being called cruel if it keeps the people loyal and united. Sometimes being strict helps more than being too nice, which can lead to crime and chaos. Crime hurts everyone, while punishments only affect the people involved.

For new rulers, it’s almost impossible to avoid being seen as cruel because new territories are dangerous. Virgil wrote about Queen Dido saying that the hard situation and newness of her kingdom forced her to act tough and protect her borders.

Still, a leader should think carefully before acting cruelly, because the consequences can be serious.
