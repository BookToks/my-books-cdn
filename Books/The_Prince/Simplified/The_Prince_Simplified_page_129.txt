If all people were good, you could trust them and keep your promises easily. But since most people aren’t that great and often break their promises, you don’t really need to keep yours all the time.

A leader must be very careful about what they say. They should always seem kind, loyal, honest, and religious. People usually judge others by how they look and act, not by what they really are. Most people only see the surface, so it’s important to hide any sneaky or bad behavior.

There are many examples of leaders who broke their promises and lied, but still stayed in power. The best liars are the best at pretending to be good. For instance, Pope Alexander VI was famous for tricking people. He never kept his promises but was very good at making people believe him.

Leaders don’t have to be truly good, but they must look like they are. If a leader always acts in a good way, they might lose power because they can’t always do what’s necessary to stay in charge. Sometimes, a ruler has to do things that seem bad, like going against loyalty or kindness, to protect their power.

There’s a king today who always talks about peace and trust but actually works against both. If he really believed in those things, he would have lost his power many times by now.

So, it’s not about being truly good all the time. It’s about seeming good and being ready to change quickly when your power is at risk. A new ruler especially can’t always act like a good person because they have to deal with dangers from inside their country and from other countries.
