Sure, mercenaries are happy to be your soldiers when there’s no war, but when fighting starts, they run away or just disappear.

It shouldn’t be hard to believe this, since Italy’s problems happened because it relied too much on mercenaries for a long time. Mercenaries did win some battles and seemed brave when fighting other mercenaries; but when a real foreign army showed up, sometimes they didn’t even fight. They just marked the buildings they planned to use as places to stay. When Savonarola said we brought this trouble on ourselves because of our sins, he was right—but he wasn’t thinking about the same sins I mean. The real problem was our rulers’ mistakes, and they were the ones who suffered.

Now that I’ve talked about the different states and why some were strong or weak, I want to explain better why mercenaries are a bad idea. A mercenary leader can be a great military boss: if he is, you can’t trust him because he might want power for himself by attacking you, his employer, or others. But if he’s not good, he’ll ruin you anyway. If someone says it doesn’t matter who commands the army because all leaders act like that, whether mercenary or not, here’s my answer: armed forces always serve the ruler or the republic.

A ruler has to be the one to lead and command his army, and a republic must send its own citizens. If a republic sends someone who turns out bad, it must replace him; if he’s good, it must keep him under control with laws. Experience shows only rulers and republics with their own armies make real progress, while mercenaries cause nothing but trouble.

Mercenaries are greedy, undisciplined, disloyal, and they fight among themselves. They are brave with friends but cowardly with enemies. They don’t fear God and don’t keep promises. When there’s peace, they steal from you, and when there’s war, they let the enemy steal from you. Why? Because mercenaries only care about themselves.

A republic with citizen soldiers is less likely to be taken over by a coup than one that pays mercenaries.

Rome and Sparta stayed free and strong for many years because they had armies made up of their own citizens.
