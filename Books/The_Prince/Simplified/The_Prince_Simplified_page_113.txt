Men like our Italian commanders knew they couldn’t use auxiliaries well or just let them go, so they made them cut into smaller groups and only fought with their own soldiers.

If you want a no-win situation, don’t pick auxiliaries because they’re even more dangerous than mercenaries. Auxiliaries are a tight group and follow someone else’s orders exactly. Mercenaries are less united and take time to trust their leader. When mercenaries win, it’s only after they get a chance to plan and attack. With auxiliaries, you’re paying them but they follow their own leader, so they can be too loose, too strict, or too slow.

I want to share an old story from the Bible. When David wanted to fight the giant Goliath for King Saul, Saul gave David his weapons to help him feel brave. But David refused and said he felt better fighting with just his sling and knife. This shows that using other people’s weapons or help doesn’t always feel right or work well.

After Charles VII kicked the English out of France, he saw that a ruler needs his own soldiers. So, he made a permanent army with both cavalry and infantry. Later, his son Louis hired Swiss mercenaries but mixed them with his own troops. This was a mistake that caused problems for France later.

Cesare Borgia is a good example. He used an army made up of French auxiliaries and captured places like Imola and Forlì with them. But when he hired other mercenary groups like the Orsini and Vitelli, they were unreliable and disloyal, so he killed them and trained his own soldiers instead. You can see the difference in how his power grew when he used his own men compared to when he relied on mercenaries.

The French now have mixed forces, part mercenary and part their own troops. These mixed armies are better than just mercenaries or auxiliaries alone, but still worse than having all your own men. If the French had kept their standing army strong, they would be unbeatable. But people often choose what seems easy or fun without thinking about the hidden problems, like not treating a sickness until it’s too late.
