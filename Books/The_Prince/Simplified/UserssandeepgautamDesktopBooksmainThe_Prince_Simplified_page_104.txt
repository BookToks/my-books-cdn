He also found a new way to increase the Church’s income that had never been used before.*

The country was controlled by the pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and the Florentines. Julius not only followed Alexander’s lead but went even further.

These powerful states had two main concerns: to keep foreign armies out of Italy and to stop each other from taking more land. The pope and the Venetians wanted to expand the most. The only way to stop the Venetians was for all the other states to work together, like they did to defend Ferrara.

To annoy the pope, they relied on the Roman barons. These barons were split into two groups, the Orsinis and the Colonnas. They always fought each other, which kept the pope weak and unsure what to do. Sometimes a strong pope like Sixtus could beat one group, but the next pope would support the other, so the fighting never really ended.

The reason for this was that popes usually didn’t last long. On average, a pope was in power for about ten years. During that time, he might weaken one group, but the other would come back later. This made the Italian states not take the pope’s political power very seriously.

Then came Alexander VI, who showed what could be done with money and military force. Using his son Valentino Borgia and taking advantage of the French, he made many gains. Even though Alexander wanted to make his son powerful, his actions also made the Church stronger. After Alexander and Valentino died, the Church kept their conquests.

So, when Pope Julius was elected, he took over a Church that now controlled all of Romagna and was stronger because Alexander had defeated the Roman barons.
