Imprisoned and killed by his nephew Gian Galeazzo Visconti.

Visconti, Filippo (1392–1447) Duke of Milan (1412–47).

Filippo was a cruel and paranoid ruler who rebuilt the Duchy of Milan by hiring mercenary leaders like Carmagnola and Francesco Sforza. To keep Sforza loyal, he promised him his only child and heir, Bianca Maria, in marriage but made him wait many years for the wedding.

Vitelli, Niccolò (1414–86) was a military commander who was always fighting the papal forces to control Città di Castello, a town near Perugia in Umbria. He was forced out of the town by Pope Sixtus IV in 1475 but got support from the Medici family after the failed Pazzi conspiracy involving the pope. When he took back the town, he destroyed the forts that Sixtus had built while he was gone.

Vitelli, Paulo (1461–99) was Niccolò's son and a mercenary leader who led the Florentine army during the siege of Pisa in 1498. After breaking through the city walls, Paulo acted strangely cautious and didn’t take full advantage. Because of this, people thought he might have betrayed them, so he was arrested and executed.

Vitelli was a noble family of mercenary commanders who controlled the town of Città di Castello near Perugia in Umbria for most of the 15th century.

Vitellozzo Vitelli (c.1458–1502) was Niccolò’s son and Paulo’s brother. He was serving Florence with Paulo when Paulo was arrested and executed for treason. Vitellozzo escaped and worked for Cesare Borgia. Later, he joined a group with the Orsini family to plot against Borgia, but he was killed with the other conspirators in Senigallia in 1502.

Xenophon (431–354 BC) was an Athenian and friend of Socrates. He didn’t like democracy and spent much time in Sparta. He joined 10,000 mercenaries who fought for Cyrus in his campaign against Artaxerxes in Asia Minor in 401 BC. After Cyrus was killed, Xenophon helped lead the mercenaries on a long retreat of 1,000 miles back home, though fewer than 6,000 survived. He wrote about this journey in his book called Anabasis.
