When people are being controlled by someone else, they will always want freedom and remember their old ways. It doesn’t matter how long they’ve been ruled or if the rulers are kind, they won’t forget. If the people haven’t been completely crushed and made to forget their freedoms and traditions, they will fight to get them back as soon as they can—just like the Pisans did after being ruled by Florence for a hundred years.

But if people have been used to living under a ruler and that ruler and their family are gone, they won’t know how to pick a new leader or live freely without one. Because of this, they will be slower to act.

When talking about places where both the leader and the government are totally new, it makes sense to look at the strongest examples. People usually copy others who are great, but you can’t exactly follow someone else’s path or be just like them. So, if you’re smart, you try to follow someone truly great, so even if you’re not as good, you’ll still show some of their greatness. It’s like a smart archer who knows the target is too far, so he aims higher than usual—not because he wants the arrow that high, but so it will come down onto the target.

Now, when a new leader takes control of a place, how easy or hard it is for them to keep power depends on their skills or mistakes. You can’t go from being a normal person to ruler without either talent or good luck, so one of those will help you deal with problems. Usually, leaders who don’t just rely on luck last longer. Another good thing is that, since the leader doesn’t already control another place, they have to live in the new one.
