So, when you think about it, if the leader of an 11th-century state is smart, it won’t be too hard to keep people strong during a siege, as long as they have food to eat and weapons to defend themselves.

Now, the last type of state we need to talk about is the Church state.

In this case, all the hard problems a ruler usually faces happen before they take power. Because while you need skill or luck to take control of a Church state, you can keep it without either.

Church states are supported by old religious institutions that are so powerful and established that their rulers stay in power no matter what they do or how they live. Only Church leaders have states without needing to defend them and subjects without needing to rule them.

Even when their lands are undefended, their states aren’t taken away; and even if they don’t govern their people, the people don’t rebel or try to change rulers, and they probably couldn’t even if they wanted to. So this type of government is the only one that’s safe and chill.

But because Church states rely on things beyond normal human understanding, I won’t say more about them. God made them and keeps them going, and it would be risky and rude for a normal person to talk about them.

Still, if someone asked me how the Church got so much more power recently, going from a time before Pope Alexander when even small rulers in Italy didn’t care much about the Church’s political power, to a time when the Pope can scare the King of France, kick him out of Italy, and defeat Venice, I think it would be good to explain the facts clearly, even if many people already know them.
