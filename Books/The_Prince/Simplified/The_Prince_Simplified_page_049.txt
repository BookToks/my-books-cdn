. . and part I will put in consideration those things that are important to people who read the events of those times.
 
 What is this about? Why did Machiavelli feel the need to add these words to a sentence that already seems clear enough. Bull offers: . . . I shall submit for consideration examples which are well known to students of the period.
 
 This may sound sensible and vaguely academic, but it simply isn’t accurate: the word ‘parte’ has gone; to ‘submit for consideration’ may be a standard English formula, but does it mean the same as Machiavelli’s actually rather unusual ‘put in consideration’? ‘Notabile’ doesn’t so much mean ‘well known’ as ‘worthy of note’ or ‘important’. Marriot gives: . . . at the same time I will only submit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the affairs of those times.
 
 Again we have the standard ‘submit for consideration’, while ‘at the same time’ and ‘only’ are both translator’s additions. It now sounds as if Machiavelli is reassuring us xlix 9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd 49 21/05/15 3:00 PM Translator’s Note that he will only look at examples that are relevant, but this sort of defensiveness is not the author’s way.
