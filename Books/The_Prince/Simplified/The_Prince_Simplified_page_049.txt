... and part I will think about the things that matter to people who read about what happened back then.

What is this about? Why did Machiavelli feel the need to add these words to a sentence that already seems clear enough? Bull says: ... I will share examples that students of that time already know.

This might sound smart and a bit academic, but it’s not quite right: the word ‘parte’ is missing; ‘submit for consideration’ is a common English phrase, but does it really mean the same as Machiavelli’s unusual phrase ‘put in consideration’? ‘Notabile’ doesn’t mean ‘well known’ as much as it means ‘important’ or ‘worth paying attention to.’ Marriot says: ... at the same time, I will only share things that are important to someone studying what happened in those times.

Again, we see the usual phrase ‘submit for consideration,’ and ‘at the same time’ and ‘only’ are added by the translator. Now it sounds like Machiavelli is trying to reassure us that he will only look at examples that matter, but this kind of carefulness isn’t really how the author writes.
