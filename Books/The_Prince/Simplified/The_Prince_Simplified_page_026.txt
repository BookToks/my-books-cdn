At the same time, and maybe without even realizing it, he was enjoying the exciting political stories about Borgia and others—things he never got to do himself. It’s interesting how quickly he skips over Borgia’s big fall, his arrest, prison, and death, almost like he didn’t want to admit his hero could fail.

Writing The Prince might have helped him feel better, but it was also meant to be published and shown off. Machiavelli liked to prove how smart he was, how much he knew, and how good his ideas were. Even so, his goals were mixed and a bit confusing. When he was really focused, he wanted to argue with the greatest thinkers from history and prove he was just as clever as them.

But at the same time, Machiavelli was hoping the book would help him get a job again. He wanted the ruler he gave the book to notice how sharp his thinking was and want to hire him. That’s why the opening dedication is so flattering, and why the last pages of The Prince talk about how this ruler should be the one to free Italy from foreign control.
