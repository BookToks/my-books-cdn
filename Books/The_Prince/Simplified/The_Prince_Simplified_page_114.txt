If a person can’t see a problem coming, they can’t be a smart leader. But very few people have this skill. If you look at why the Roman Empire fell, you’ll see it started when they hired Goths as mercenaries. From that point, the empire got weaker, and its enemies got stronger.

So, to finish: no country is safe without its own army. If it doesn’t have people ready to protect it loyally during a crisis, it’s just hoping for luck. Leaders who really get this have no other goal but to focus on war, the army, and military discipline. This is the only real job of a leader. Having your own army means you have soldiers who belong to your country and depend on you. All other soldiers are either hired outsiders or helpers.

To figure out how to build your own army, just look at how important leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great organized theirs. They are great examples. When leaders care more about fancy things than fighting, they lose power. The main reason a leader loses power is because they ignore war skills; the main reason they gain power is by being good at war.

Francesco Sforza was a soldier with his own army who went from being a commoner to Duke of Milan. But his sons avoided the hard life of soldiers, and they lost their power. One big problem with not having an army is that people will see you as weak, and a leader must avoid this at all costs. The truth is, someone who has an army is nothing like someone who doesn’t. There’s no reason why a soldier should obey a leader without an army, or why a leader without an army should feel safe around soldiers. They will distrust and disrespect each other, and won’t work well together. So, besides all the other problems, a leader who ignores military matters is in big trouble.
