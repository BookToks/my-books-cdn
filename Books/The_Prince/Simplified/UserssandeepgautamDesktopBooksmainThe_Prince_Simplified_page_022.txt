It wasn’t his idea. He just assumes we already know that life, especially in politics, is often really harsh and sometimes terribly cruel. Once someone gets power, they might have no choice but to kill or be killed.

This is where words like ‘must’ and ‘have to’ sound really serious. The Prince is most powerful and shocking not because of its famous ideas—like the idea that the end justifies the means, or that people must be spoiled or crushed, or that the best way to hold onto a conquered place is to destroy it completely—but because of the many real stories of cruel actions Machiavelli shares. He doesn’t act shocked; he treats these things as if they had to happen.

For example, the Venetians notice their hired army leader Carmagnola isn’t trying hard anymore, but they’re scared that if they fire him, he’ll take the land he won for them. So, the only safe thing to do was to kill him. Another example is Hiero of Syracuse. When he took command of his army, he realized they were all mercenaries who couldn’t be trusted or let go, so he had them all killed.

The most extreme example is Cesare Borgia, who Machiavelli shows as a perfect example for anyone wanting to take control of a state (like starting a business or building a house). After using his cruel helper Remirro de Orco to control the Romagna region, Borgia blamed all the terrible acts on him and then had him killed. He even showed off de Orco’s dead body in public with a wooden block and bloody knife nearby to make people hate the minister, not himself.
