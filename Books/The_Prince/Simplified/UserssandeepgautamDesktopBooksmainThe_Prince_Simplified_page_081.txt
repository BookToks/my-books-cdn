They have to create a new system to manage things and set up new rules. Changing how a government works is really hard. The person making these changes will have enemies—people who liked the old ways—and only some support from those who want the new system. This happens because people are naturally scared of change and don’t fully trust it until they see it actually working. So, once the people against the new system get a chance, they will fight back hard, while the supporters might only help a little. This can make it risky for the new leader.

To understand this better, we need to ask: Is the leader trying to make changes by themselves, or do they need help from others? If they have to beg for help, they will probably fail. But if they have their own power and can force their plans, then they are more likely to succeed. Leaders with armed forces usually win, while those without power often lose.

Think about Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus. None of them could have become leaders or kept their power without the right situation or support. Moses needed the Israelites to be slaves and in need of a leader. Romulus had to be abandoned and then choose to leave his home. Cyrus needed the Persians ready to fight back. Theseus could only show his skills after the Athenians were defeated and scattered. These challenges were chances they recognized and used to become successful.

These leaders also needed armed forces to keep people following their new laws. For example, when people stopped believing in Girolamo Savonarola, he lost his power and all his reforms disappeared.

So, to make big changes and keep control, a leader must have power, support, and be able to convince people to believe in them—even when things get tough.
