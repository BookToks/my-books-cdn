So, if the ruler of a place is smart, it’s not too hard to keep people loyal during a siege, as long as they have enough food and weapons to defend themselves.

Now, the last kind of state we need to talk about is the Church state.

In this type of state, all the tough problems a ruler usually faces happen before they take power. Once they’re in charge, they don’t need skill or luck to stay there.

Church states are supported by old religious institutions that are super strong and well-known. This keeps their leaders in power no matter what they do or how they act. Only Church leaders have states without needing to defend them or manage their people. Even if they don’t protect their land or govern their people, their subjects don’t rebel or think about changing rulers. They probably couldn’t even if they wanted to. This makes Church states the only kind of government that is really safe and chill.

But since Church states depend on things beyond human understanding, I won’t say much more about them. God created and supports them, and it would be bold and disrespectful for an ordinary person to talk about them. 

Still, if someone asked me how the Church got so much worldly power recently—going from a time before Pope Alexander when even the smallest rulers in Italy didn’t care about the Church to a time when a pope could scare the King of France, kick him out of Italy, and defeat the Venetians—I think it would be worth explaining what happened, even if most people already know.
