I used that idea as my guide while translating, trying whenever I could to get rid of old-fashioned and confusing English words from earlier versions. I wanted to focus on the original meaning and deliver it clearly, like we do today, even if that might change in the future.

It’s not easy. The first problem, which causes all the others, is in the title: The Prince. What does Machiavelli mean by a prince? Well, a duke is a prince. The pope is a prince. A Roman emperor is a prince. The King of France is a prince. The Lord of Imola is a prince.

This doesn’t work in modern English. In England, we have Prince Charles. But Prince Charles is not King Charles and probably never will be. Even if he became king, he wouldn’t have real power, not even like the pope does. And we never think of the pope as a king or prince.

The only other idea we have for ‘the prince’ in English is Prince Charming. That idea is very different from the older Prince Charles, and even more different from the kind of prince Machiavelli meant. Machiavelli’s word ‘prince’ doesn’t mean ‘the son of the king’ or ‘a good-looking young guy.’ It means men in power, men who rule a state.
