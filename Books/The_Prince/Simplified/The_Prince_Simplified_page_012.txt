When Machiavelli was young, he might have thought there wasn’t much difference between religion and politics. The pope supported a plot called the Pazzi conspiracy, priests took part in trying to kill Lorenzo, and Lorenzo was kicked out of the church when the plan failed. So, religious orders were really just tools for political power.

This led to a war between Florence and Rome, which only stopped in 1480 when Turkish attacks on southern Italy made everyone come together for once. Years later, Lorenzo became so close to a new pope that his son Giovanni became a cardinal at just thirteen years old. Going from being kicked out of the church to being the pope’s favorite was a big change, and it was more about politics than actual faith. It seemed like money and smart deals could get you anything.

At this time, Machiavelli was twenty-one. We don’t know much about his early adult life, but we do know he listened to a passionate preacher named Girolamo Savonarola, who led the important San Marco monastery. Savonarola’s Christianity was different from the corrupt and pleasure-loving church leaders. He was an intense monk who believed the Bible was the only real authority and saw the Church as under attack in a world that cared less about religious values.
