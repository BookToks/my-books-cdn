Many big cities fought against the local nobles who needed the emperor’s support to keep control of their armies. The Church backed the rebels because it wanted more power through citizen armies. In other towns, private citizens took over as rulers. This meant that much of Italy was now controlled by the Church and republics, groups of people with no war experience. So, leaders started hiring soldiers from outside.

The first successful mercenary commander was Alberigo da Conio from Romagna. Auxiliary armies—when a powerful ruler sends troops to help defend your town—were also not very useful.

Francesco Sforza and others would later become important leaders in Italy’s future. A recent example is Pope Julius during his campaign in Ferrara. After seeing how badly his mercenaries fought, he made a deal with King Ferdinand of Spain to bring in more forces. Auxiliaries can be helpful for their own goals, but they often cause problems for those who hire them. If mercenaries lose, you lose too, and if they win, you’re at their mercy.

Mercenaries tried to make themselves look more important by downplaying the value of infantry soldiers. They didn’t have their own land and survived by looting, so they focused on cavalry (soldiers on horses). Armies had fewer infantry and more cavalry because cavalry was easier to feed and more respected. For example, an army of 20,000 might have fewer than 2,000 infantry.

Mercenaries avoided danger and hard work. They wouldn’t fight each other to the death but took prisoners instead. They didn’t attack forts at night or leave their own camps to fight. They didn’t dig trenches or build defenses around their camps, and in winter, they often didn’t camp out at all. These lazy habits became normal because the mercenaries just wanted to stay safe.

This behavior caused Italy to fall into slavery and shame. To fight his neighbors, the emperor of Constantinople brought 10,000 Turkish soldiers into Greece. After the war, the Turks didn’t leave, which is how they started taking control of Greece. 

Hiero, leader of the Syracusan armies, soon realized that the mercenaries among them were useless because they were poorly led and not loyal.
