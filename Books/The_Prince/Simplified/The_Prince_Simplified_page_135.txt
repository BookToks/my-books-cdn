This was a really tough problem that caused many emperors to fail. Pertinax tried to make everyone honest, but people didn’t like that. It made them hate him. Also, because he was old, he was soon kicked out.

People wanted a calm life and liked leaders who kept things low-key. Soldiers, on the other hand, liked leaders who were bold and wanted war. They wanted the emperor to be greedy and cruel so they could make more money and act selfishly.  

Because of this, emperors who weren’t naturally strong or smart in politics couldn’t control both soldiers and people. This usually ended badly. Many new rulers tried to please the army and ignored the people, which caused problems.  

If a ruler wants to stay in power, they often have to ignore doing good things because powerful groups like the army or nobles might be corrupt. So, it’s safer for rulers to keep these groups happy, even if it means doing bad things.

Alexander was a good guy. During his 14 years as emperor, he never had anyone killed without a trial. But people still didn’t like him. They thought he was weak and said his mother ran the government. Because of this, the army turned against him and killed him.

When a ruler can’t avoid being hated, they try to avoid being hated by the groups with the most power. New emperors usually relied on the army’s support rather than the people’s. This worked as long as the soldiers liked them.

Looking at emperors like Commodus, Severus, Antoninus Caracalla, and Maximinus, we see they were very cruel and greedy. To keep the army happy, they did all sorts of bad things to their people. All except Severus, who was strong and smart enough to keep the army friendly even while ruling harshly.

Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander were kind and fair, and they lived simple lives. They impressed the people and the army, but only Marcus avoided a bad ending and was respected when he died.

Severus came to power because he inherited it, not because the soldiers or people chose him. He had many good qualities and kept both the people and army under control during his reign, so no one hated him.

When Emperor Julian seemed weak, Severus convinced the army in Slavonia to march to Rome and get revenge for Pertinax, who was killed by the Praetorian Guard.
