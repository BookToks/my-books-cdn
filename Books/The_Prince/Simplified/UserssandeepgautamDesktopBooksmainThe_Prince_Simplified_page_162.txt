When plans are made carefully and show clear vision, you can see it at the battle of Ravenna when the Spanish earned respect and admiration. Italy has plenty of foot soldiers who are healthy and strong, but they need a good leader to guide them. Italians are better and more skilled than foreigners in one-on-one fights or small battles. But when it comes to large armies, they don’t do well because their leaders are not good. The capable men are ignored, and the less capable are put in charge. So far, no one has had the skill and luck to win big battles that would make others step aside.

That’s why, in the last twenty years, every time an army made only of Italians fought, they failed badly. Look at the battles of Taro, Alessandria, Capua, Genova, Vailà, Bologna, and Mestre. If your important family wants to be like the great leaders who saved their people, the first step is to create an army made up of your own citizens. You can’t get soldiers who are more loyal, determined, or better than your own people. And if each soldier is good, imagine how strong they would be if they were all together, led, fed, and respected by their own ruler.

Building an army like this is very important if we want to use Italian strength to defend ourselves from foreign enemies. It’s true that the Swiss and Spanish foot soldiers are very tough, but both have weak spots that a new kind of army could use to face and even beat them. The Spanish can’t handle cavalry attacks well, and the Swiss struggle when they meet soldiers as determined as themselves. That’s why, as we’ve seen and will see again, the Spanish can’t stop a French cavalry charge, and the Swiss fall apart against infantry like the Spanish.

Though we don’t yet have full proof of these Swiss weak points, it’s clear that a smart new army and new tactics can make a big difference. A new ruler will be remembered more for the changes he brings than for his laws and rules.
