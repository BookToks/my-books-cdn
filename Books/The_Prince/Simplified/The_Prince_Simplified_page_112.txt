Commanders like the Italian ones knew they couldn’t just use mercenaries or auxiliaries without problems. So, one leader cut his auxiliaries into pieces and only fought with his own soldiers after that.

If you want to find a no-win situation, try using auxiliaries. They are even more dangerous than mercenaries. Auxiliaries are a tight group who listen only to one leader. Mercenaries, on the other hand, need time and the right chance to attack, because they’re not a solid group. When you hire mercenaries, you have to pay them, but they might not listen right away. So, mercenaries can be slow to act, and auxiliaries can be too determined.

I want to share a story from the Old Testament. When David offered to fight the giant Goliath for King Saul, Saul gave David his own weapons to help him feel brave. But David refused and said he wanted to fight with just his sling and knife. He believed in himself and didn’t want to depend on others’ weapons.

The big problem with mercenaries is that they can be unsure and slow to act. With auxiliaries, the problem is they act too strongly and without doubt. Wise rulers usually avoid using both mercenaries and auxiliaries. Instead, they prefer to use their own troops. They would rather lose with their own men than win with others. A victory won with foreign troops isn’t a real victory.

Cesare Borgia is a good example. He invaded Romagna with an army made of French auxiliaries and took some cities easily. But he didn’t fully trust them, so he hired other mercenary armies too. When he saw that these mercenaries were unreliable and disloyal, he killed them and trained his own soldiers. It’s clear that armies made of your own men are better than relying on outsiders.

Later, Louis XI of France hired Swiss mercenaries. This was a mistake because his own army didn’t have enough soldiers, so they depended on the Swiss. After fighting with the Swiss, the French troops started to believe they couldn’t win without them. This made the French army mixed—part mercenary and part their own men. Although this kind of mixed army is better than only auxiliaries or only mercenaries, it’s still worse than having all your own troops.

France’s problems show this clearly. If their standing army had been stronger and kept up, they would have been unbeatable. But people don’t think carefully and choose what seems easy or fun, without realizing it might be dangerous.

I also want to mention Hiero of Syracuse. He led an army that included mercenaries and soon realized they were useless because they didn’t fight well. This is like what happened in Greece when the Turks came in with 10,000 soldiers and didn’t leave after the war ended. That’s how the Turks started taking control of Greece.
