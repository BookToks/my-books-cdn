When they are planned well and show clear ideas, you can see it at the battle of Ravenna when the Spanish brought a leader who earned respect and admiration. Italy has plenty of soldiers ready to fight, and their men are strong and healthy; all they need is a good leader to guide them.

Look at how much better Italians are than foreigners in one-on-one fights or small battles. But when it comes to whole armies, they can’t compete because their leaders are not good. The talented men are ignored, and the weak ones are put in charge. So far, no one has had the skill and luck to succeed in big battles that would make others step back. That’s why, in the last twenty years, whenever armies made only of Italians fought, they always lost badly, like in the battles of Taro, Alessandria, Capua, Genova, Vailà, Bologna, and Mestre.

It would be a huge mistake now, after all this time, to miss the chance to save Italy. Words can’t explain how much people would welcome a hero who could save them from foreign invaders. The desire for revenge, trust, loyalty, and tears would open every door for such a man. Everyone would obey him. No one could stop him. Italians hate being ruled by foreigners. So, may your family take on this job with hope and spirit, so our country can be honored under your name and protection. As Petrarch said:

Virtue against fury  
Shall take up arms; and the fight be short;  
For ancient valor  
Is not dead in Italian hearts.

The Swiss and Spanish soldiers are strong but both have weaknesses that a third group could use to fight and even beat them. The Spanish can’t fight well against cavalry, and the Swiss struggle when they meet infantry as determined as themselves. That’s why the Spanish lose to French cavalry charges, and the Swiss fall to Spanish-style infantry.

If Italy’s own people are trained, led, and respected by their rulers, they can become the best soldiers and defend the country against foreign enemies.
