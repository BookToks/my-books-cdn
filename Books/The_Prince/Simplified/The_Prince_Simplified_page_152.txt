Let me give you an example from today. Bishop Luca Rainaldi is a man close to Emperor Maximilian. The emperor isn’t smart because he’s getting good advice; instead, it’s his own good sense that helps him get the right advice.

The emperor never listens to anyone’s advice and never makes good decisions. This is because he does the opposite of what I suggested. He keeps his plans secret and doesn’t ask for advice. But when he starts acting on his plans and people see what he’s doing, his ministers tell him he’s wrong and he quickly changes his mind. Because of this, whatever he does one day, he undoes the next. No one understands what he wants, and no one can plan because his policies keep changing.

A ruler should always take advice, but only when he wants it, not when others push it on him. He should also stop people from giving advice when he hasn’t asked for it. But when he does ask, he should listen carefully and patiently if the adviser tells the truth. If someone stays quiet because they’re scared, the ruler should show that he’s annoyed.

Many people think a ruler seems smart because of the good advice from ministers, not because the ruler is smart himself. But they’re wrong. The rule is simple: a leader who isn’t smart can’t get good advice, unless he gives all power to one very smart minister. But even then, that minister might take over the government soon. If the ruler listens to more than one adviser, he will hear different opinions and won’t know what to do. Each adviser thinks about their own interests, and the ruler won’t understand what’s really happening. It’s not about listening to everyone’s opinions all the time; people will always try to trick you, and if you listen to everyone, people will stop respecting you.
