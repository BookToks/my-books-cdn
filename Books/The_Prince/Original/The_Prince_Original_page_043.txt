So the constantly recurring question as one translates The Prince is: what words would we use today to describe the qualities and situations Machiavelli is talking about?
 
 Of course sometimes there are no modern words, because there are certain things – siege engines, cavalry attacks – that we don’t talk about any more. On the whole, though, Machiavelli is chiefly interested in psychology or, rather, in the interaction of different personalities in crisis situations, and here, so long as the translator avoids the temptation to introduce misleading contemporary jargon, a great deal can be done to get The Prince into clear, contemporary English.
 
 However, the difficulty of these lexical choices is infinitely compounded by Machiavelli’s wayward grammar and extremely flexible syntax. Written in 1513, The Prince is not easily comprehensible to Italians today. Recent editions of the work are usually parallel texts with a modern Italian translation printed beside the original. The obstacle for the Italian reader, however, is hardly lexical at all – in the end he can understand a good ninety per cent of the words Machiavelli is using – r ather it has to do with a combination of extreme compression of thought, obsolete, sometimes xliii 9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd 43 21/05/15 3:00 PM Translator’s Note erratic grammar, and, above all, a syntax where subordinate and pre- modifying clauses abound in ways that the modern reader is not used to.
