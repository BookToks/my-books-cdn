THIRD MUNDAKA i HE (the Seer of Truth) knows the highest abode of Brahman, in which all this universe rests and which shines with pure radiance. Discerning men, without desire, by serving reverently such a knower (of Self) go beyond the seed.
 
 THE Seer who has realized the Supreme and has united himself with the Source of knowledge, becomes a connecting link between God and the worshipper. Whatever homage or reverence is paid to him, he does not take for himself. Being entirely free from egotism and self-importance, he offers it all to God. Those who seek out and serve such an illumined soul gradually partake of his wisdom and pass beyond the need of birth and death. Every desire is a seed from which spring birth, death and all mortal afflictions. Illumination alone will destroy this seed.
 
 II HE who broods on objects of desire and covets them, is born here and there according to his desires but he whose desires are ; fulfilled and who has known the Self, his desires vanish even here.
