Nachiketas, do not ask regarding death.
 
 HpHE third boon asked by Nachiketas concerning the great Hereafter was one which could be granted only to those who were freed from all mortal desires and limitations; therefore Yama first tested Nachiketas to see whether he was ready to receive such knowledge. "Do not press me regarding this secret," he said. "Even wise mencannotunderstanditandthouartamerelad.
 
 Take, rather, longlife, wealth, whatever will give thee happiness on the mortal plane." But the boy proved his strength andworthinessbyremainingfirminhisresolutiontoknow the great secret of life and death.
 
 XXVI lyTACHIKETAS said: Death, these are L^ fleeting; they weaken the vigor of all the senses in man. Even the longest life is short. Keep thou thy chariots, dance and music.

 Shall we possess wealth when we see thee (Death)? Shall we continue to live as long as thou rulest? Therefore that boon alone is to be chosen by me.
