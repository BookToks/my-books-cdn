THIRD MUNDAKA fart 3Ftral i TWO inseparable companions of golden plumage perch on the same tree. One of them eats the pleasing fruit (of the tree), the other looks on as a witness without eating.
 
 II ON the sametree (of life) man sits, drowned in grief, overpowered by his own helplessness. But when he beholds the other, the Lord, majestic and full of glory, then his grief passes away.
 
 THE two birds represent the higher Self and the lower self. The lower self is absorbed in tasting the sweet and bitter fruits of this life, and imagines it cannot escape from the reactions caused by them When, however, in its struggle it looks up to that other transcendent Self and perceives how alike they are, it realizes its true nature. The Jiva or individual soul is merely the reflex of the Paratndtman or Supreme Soul. The apparent man has its root in the real man. As soon as we realize this, the two become one. It is the sense of ego in us which divides and separates; and whenever we separate ourselves from our Divine part, we feel a lack. When, however, we discover our relation with the inexhaustible Source, all Mundaka-Upanishad 145 our selfish appetites which now drive us from branch to branch of the tree of life will vanish and no cause for grief will remain.
