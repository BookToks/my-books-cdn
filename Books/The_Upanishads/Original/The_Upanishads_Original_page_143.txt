142 The Upanishads IX WHEN He is seen, Who is both high and low, the fetters of the heart are broken, all doubts are cut asunder, and all Karma (bondage of work) is destroyed.
 
 WHEN the vision of Him, Who is all there is, high or low, subtle or gross, vast or small, dawns within us, the heart is at once freed from the fetters of attachment, egotism and every form of selfishness ; all the perplexities and doubts of the mind are cleared away. This does not happen when we gain intellectual knowledge only. The more we read and analyze, the more confused and entangled the mind becomes. But when we behold God directly, at once all the darkness of doubt disappears in the glory of His self-effulgent light, as the night goes when the morning comes. That brightness no one can define. As long as we need someone to prove Truth to us, we have not found it. But when His light shines in our heart, Truth becomes self-evident. Without this light the outside world will always be full of shadows for us ; but when that light is found, the whole universe glows with its radiance. Then all the chains of Karma past, present and future are shattered, and the soul enjoys perfect freedom.
 
 X THAT stainless indivisible Brahman, pure, Light of all lights, dwells in the innermost golden sheath (the core of the heart). Thus do the knowers of Self know Him.
