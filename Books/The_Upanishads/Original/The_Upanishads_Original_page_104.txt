Although the disciple had listened to the teacher with unquestioning mind and was intellectually convinced of the truth of his words, it was now necessary forhimtoprovebyhisown experiencewhathehadheard.
 
 Guided by the teacher, he sought within himself through meditation the meaning of Brahman; and having gained a new vision, he approached the teacher once more.
 
 II THE disciple said: I do not think I know It well, nor do I think that I do not know It. He among us who knows It truly, knows (what is meant by) "I know" and also what is meant by "I know It not." T^HISappearstobecontradictory, butitisnot. Inthe previous chapter we learned that Brahman is "distinct from theknown" and "beyond the unknown." The disciple,realizing this,says: "So far as mortal conception isconcerned, I donot thinkI know, because I understand that It is beyond mind and speech; yet from the higher point of view, I cannot say that I do not know; for the veryfactthatIexist,thatIcanseekIt, showsthatIknow; for Itisthesourceofmy being. I donotknow, however, in the sense of knowing the whole Infinite Ocean of existence." The word knowledge is used ordinarily to signify acquaintancewithphenomenaonly,butmanmusttranscend this relative knowledge before he can have a clear conceptionofGod.
