Onlythroughsimiliescansomeidea of It be conveyed. That is the reason why all the great Teachers of the world have so often taught in the fcrm of parables. So here the Ruler of Death represents the Self as the lord of this chariot of the body. The intellect or discriminative faculty is the driver, who controls these wild horses of the sensesby holding firmly the reins of the mind. The roadsover which thesehorses travel are made up of all the external objects which attract or repel the senses: the sense of smelling follows the path of sweet odors, the sense of seeing the way of beautiful sights.
 
 Thus each sense, unless restrained by the discriminative faculty, seekstogoout towardsitsspecial objects. When the Self isjoined with body, mind and senses, It is called the intelligent enjoyer; because It is the one who wills, feels, perceives and does everything.
 
 HE who is without discrimination and whose mind is always uncontrolled, his senses are unmanageable, like the vicious horses of a driver.
 
 VI BUT he who is full of discrimination and whose mind is always controlled, his senses are manageable, like the good horses of a driver.
