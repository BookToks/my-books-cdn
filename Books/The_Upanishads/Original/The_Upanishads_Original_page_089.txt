The Upanishads AS in a mirror, so is He seen within oneself; as in a dream, so (is He seen) in the world of the fathers (departed spirits); as in water, so (is He seen) in the world of Gandharoas (the angelic realm). As light and shadow, so (is He seen) in the world of Brahma (the Creator).
 
 VIT'HEX by means of a purified understanding one beholds God within, the image is distinct as in a polished mirror; but one cannot have clear vision of the Supreme by attaining to the various realms known as heavens, where one reaps the fruit of his good deeds. It is only by developing one's highest consciousness here in this life that perfect God-vision can be attained.
 
 VI that the senses are distinct KNOWING (from the Atman) and their rising and setting separate (from the Atman}, a wise man grieves no more.
 
 A WISE man never confounds the Atman, which is !*^ birthlessanddeathless, withthatwhichhasbeginning and end. Therefore, when he sees his senses and his physical organism waxing and waning, he knows that his real Self within can never be affected by these outer changes, so he remains unmoved.
