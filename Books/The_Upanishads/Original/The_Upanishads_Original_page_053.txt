52 The U pantshads IV WIDE apart are these two, ignorance and what is known as wisdom, leading in opposite directions. I believe Nachiketas to be one who longs for wisdom, since many tempting objects have not turned thee aside.

He who follows one inevitably goes away from the other; because, like light and darkness, they conflict. One leads to the imperishable spiritual realm; the other to the perishable physical realm. Both confrontaman at every step oflife. The discerningman, distinguishing between the two, chooses the Real and Eternal, and he alone attains the highest; while the ignorant man, preferring that whichbrings him immediate and tangible results, misses the true purpose of his existence. Although Yama put before Nachiketas many temptations to test his sincerity and earnestness, he, judging them at their real value, refused them all, saying: "I have come from the mortal realm, shall I ask for what is mortal? I desire only that which is eternal." Then Death said to him: "I now see that thou art a sincere desirer of Truth. I offered thee vast wealth, long life andeveryformofpleasurewhich temptsanddeludesmen; butthouhastproved thyworthinessbyrejectingthemall." Katha-Upanishad 53 dwelling in ignorance, yet imaginFOOLS ing themselves wise and learned, go round and round in crooked ways, like the blind led by the blind.
