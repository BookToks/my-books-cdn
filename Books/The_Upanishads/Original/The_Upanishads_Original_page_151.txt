150 The Upanishads A SELFISH man, who is identified with the flesh, clings to the small and finite ; and however covetous of a larger life he may be, he cannot attain it. A man may wish to go to the other shore ; but if he does not pull up the anchor, his boat will not move.
 
 Ill Self cannot be attained by the study THIS of the Scriptures, nor by intellectual perception, nor by frequent hearing of It. He whom the Self chooses, by him alone is It attained. To him the Self reveals Its true nature.
 
 same verse appears in the Katha-UpaniTHIS shad (Part II, V. 23) and is explained at length there. Only he whose heart is wholly purified and made ready can receive the revelation therefore the ; Self naturally chooses that one and no other. This means that we have to give ourselves whollybefore we can get the higher vision.
 
 IV THIS Self cannot be attained by one who is devoid of strength, or by one who is unmindful, or by one whose austerity is without renunciation. But if the wise man strives by these means, his Self enters into the abode of Brahman.
 
 THE Upanishads lay frequent emphasis on the idea that no weak person can attain Truth but ; Mundaka-U panishad 151 this does not mean mere physical weakness.
