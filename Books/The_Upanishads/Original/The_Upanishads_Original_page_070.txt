Over the mind the determinative faculty exercises power; this determinative faculty is governed by the individual Self; beyond this Self is the undifferentiated creative energy known as Avyaklam; and above this is the Purusha or Supreme Self.
 
 Than this there is nothing higher. That is the goal, the Highest Abode of Peace and Bliss.
 
 XII THIS Atman (Self), hidden in all beings, does not shine forth; but It is seen by subtle seers through keen and subtle understanding.
 
 TF It dwells in all living beings, why do we not see It?
 
 * Because theordinaryman's vision is too dull and distracted. It is visible to those alone whose intellect has been purified by constant thought on the Supreme, and whose sight therefore has become refined and sharpened.
 
 This keenness of vision comes only when all our forces have been made one-pointed through steadfast practice ofconcentration and meditation.
 
 XIII A WISE man should control speech by mind, mind by intellect, intellect by the great Atman, and that by the Peaceful One (the Paramdtman or Supreme Self).
