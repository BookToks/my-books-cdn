KENA-UPANISHAD AY IV/f my limbs, speech, Prdna (life-*-*â€” and force), sight, hearing, strength all my senses, gain in vigor. All is the Brahman (Supreme Lord) of the Upanishads.
 
 May I never deny the Brahman. May the Brahman never deny me. May there be no denial of the Brahman. May there be no separation from the Brahman. May all the virtues declared in the sacred Upanishads be manifest in me, who am devoted to the Atman (Higher Self). May they be manifest in me.
 
 OM! PEACE! PEACE! PEACE!
