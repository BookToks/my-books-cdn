Katha-Upanishad 45 XIV YAMA replied: I know well that fire which leads to the realm of heaven. I shall tell it to thee. Listen to me. Know, O Nachiketas, that this is the means of attaining endless worlds and their support. It is hidden in the heart of all beings.
 
 XV YAMA then told him that fire-sacrifice, the beginning of all the worlds; what bricks, how many and how laid for the altar.
 
 Nachiketas repeated all as it was told to him.
 
 Then Death, being pleased with him, again said: XVI THE great-souled Yama, being well pleased, said to him (Nachiketas): I give thee now another boon. This fire (sacrifice) shall be named after thee. Take also this garland of many colors.
 
 XVII HE who performs this Nachiketa firesacrifice three times, being united with the three (mother, father and teacher), 46 The Upanishads and who fulfills the three-fold duty (study of the Vedas, sacrifice and alms-giving) crosses over birth and death.
