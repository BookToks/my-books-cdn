Kena-U panishad 101 VII THAT which cannot be heard by the ear, but by which the ear is able to hear: know that alone to be Brahman, not this which people worship here.
 
 VIII '"T^HAT which none breathes with the A breath, but by which breath is inbreathed: know that alone to be the Brahman, not this which people worship here.
 
 /^RDINARILY we know three states of consciousness ^"^ only, waking, dreaming and sleeping. There is, however, a fourth state, the superconscious, which transcends these. In the first three states the mind is not clearenough tosaveusfromerror; but in thefourthstate it gains such purity of vision that it can perceive the Divine. If God could be known by the limited mind and senses, then God-knowledge would be like any other knowledge and spiritual science like any physical science.
 
 He can be known, however, by the purified mind only.
 
 Therefore to know God, man must purify himself. The mind described in the Upanishads is the superconscious mind. According to the Vedic Sages the mind in its ordinary state is only another sense organ. This mind is limited, but when it becomes illumined by the light of the Cosmic Intelligence, or the "mind of the mind," thenit is able to apprehend the First Cause or That which stands behind allexternal activities.
