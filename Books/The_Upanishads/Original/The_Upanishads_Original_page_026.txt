ISA-UPANISHAD PEACE CHANT OM! That (the Invisible-Absolute) is whole; whole is this (thevisiblephenomenal); from the Invisible Whole comes forth the visible whole. Though the visible whole has come out from that Invisible Whole, yet the Whole remains unaltered.
 
 OM! PEACE! PEACE! PEACE!
 
 'TpHEindefinite term "That" is used in theUpanishads todesignate the Invisible-Absolute, because no word orname can fully define It. A finite object, like a table ora tree,can be defined; but God,who is infinite and unbounded, cannot beexpressed by finite language. Therefore the Rishis or Divine Seers, desirous not to limit the Unlimited, chose the indefinite term " That" to designate theAbsolute.
 
 In the light of true wisdom the phenomenal and the Absoluteare inseparable. AllexistenceisintheAbsolute; and whateverexists, must existinIt; henceallmanifestation ismerely a modification of the One Supreme Whole, and neitherincreases nordiminishes It. TheWholethereforeremains unaltered.
