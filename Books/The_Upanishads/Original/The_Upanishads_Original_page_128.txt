VIII Tapas Brahman expands THROUGH ; from this, food is produced ; from food come Prana (energy), mind, the elements, the worlds, good works and their immortal fruit.
 
 IX FROM that one Who is all-perceiving and all-knowing, Whose Tapas consists of wisdom, are born Brahma (the Creator), name, form and food.
 
 TAPAS signifies spiritual discipline, known variously as penance, austerity, etc. The word Tafia means literally heat, and is employed in this case because spiritual practice is supposed to act on the system like fire, consuming all impurities. This interpretation, however, cannot be applied to the present text, as it is evident that Brahman, the Supreme Lord, has no need of purification. It is used here to signify the fire of wisdom, which like all fire expands. Out of this wisdom fire, burning in the mind of Brahman, come forth, first the creative power, and thence all forms of material manifestation.
