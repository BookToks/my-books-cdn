It has been called a Mantra-Upanishad as it is composed of verses in the form of Mantras or prayer-chants. Commentators observe that these Mantras are not for the purpose of ceremonial worship as are those of the Karma-Kanda or sacrificial portion of the Vedas.
 
 This Upanishad lays particular emphasis upon the means of attaining Brahma-Vidya or knowledge of the Absolute. The question is asked: "What is that, Sire, by knowing vvhich everything else becomes knozvnf" The sage answered that to acquire theHighest Wisdom, one must transcend the vanity of lower knowledge. Supreme Wisdom cannot be attained by superficial study of the Scriptures, nor by observing religious rites, nor by good works. It can only be realized by the man of meditation one ivho has been purified through the practice of discrimination and renunciation.
 
 It is difficult to trace the meaning of the title "Mundaka." The literal translation of the word is ''shavenhead." This may imply that the author of the book zvas a Rishi or seer with shaven-head or it may indicate that the Upanishad itself is shorn of all nonessentials like the mind illumined by Brahma-Vidyti.
