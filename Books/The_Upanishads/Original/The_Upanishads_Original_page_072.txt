'HpHE Ruler of Death defineshere the innermost essence * of our being. Because of its extreme subtlety, it cannot be heard or felt or smelled or tasted like any ordinary object. It never dies. It has no beginning or end.
 
 It is unchangeable. Realizing this Supreme Reality, man escapes from death and attains everlasting life. Thus the TeacherhasgraduallyledNachiketas to apoint where he can reveal to him the secret of death. The boy had thought that there was a place where he could stay and become immortal. But Yama shows him that immortalityis a state of consciousness and is not gained so long asman clings to name and form,or to perishable objects.
 
 What dies? Form. Therefore theformfulman dies; but not that which dwells within. Although inconceivably subtle, the Sages have always made an effort through similies and analogies to give some idea of this inner Self or the God within. They have described It as beyond mind and speech; too subtle for ordinary perception, but not beyond the range of purified vision.
 
 XVI THE intelligent man, who has heard and repeated the ancient story of Nachiketas, told by the Ruler of Death, is glorified in the world of Brahman.
