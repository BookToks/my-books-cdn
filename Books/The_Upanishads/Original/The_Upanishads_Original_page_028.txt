Isa-Upanishad 27 TF a man still clings to longlifeandearthly possessions, and is therefore unable to follow the path of Selfknowledge (Gndna-Nishta) as prescribed in the first Mantram (text), then he may follow the path of right action (Karma-Nishld). Karma here means actions performed without selfish motive, for the sake of the Lord alone. When a man performsactions clingingblindlyto hislowerdesires, then hisactionsbind him to theplane of ignorance or the plane of birth and death; but when the same actions are performed with surrender to God, they purifyandliberate him.

Those who hold themselves under the sway of ignorance, who serve the flesh and neglect theAtman orthereal Self, arenotable toperceive theeffulgentandindestructiblenatureoftheirSoul; hence they fall into the realm where the Soul light does not shine. Here the Upanishad shows that the only hell is absence of knowledge. As long as man is overpowered 28 The Upanishads bythedarknessofignorance, heistheslaveofNatureand must accept whatever comes as the fruit of his thoughts and deeds.
