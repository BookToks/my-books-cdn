Katha-Upanishad 61 XXI THOUGH sitting, It travels far; though Who lying, It goes everywhere. else saveme is fit toknow that God, who is (both) and joyful joyless?
 
 'HpHE Self is all-pervading, hence It is that which sits * still and that which travels, that which is active and that which is inactive. It is both stationary and moving, and It is the basis of all forms of existence; therefore whateverexistsinthe universe, whetherjoyorjoylessness, pleasureorpain, mustspring from It. Who isbetterable to know God than I myself, since He resides in my heart and is the very essence of my being? Such should be the attitude of one who is seeking.
 
 XXII THE wise who know the Self, bodiless, seated within perishable bodies, great and all-pervading, grieve not.
 
 WHEN a wise man through the practice of discrimination has seen clearly the distinction between bodyand Soul, heknowsthat histrueSelfisnot thebody, though It dwells in the body. Thus realizing the indestructible, all-pervading nature of his real Self, he surmountsallfearofdeathorloss, andisnotmovedeven by thegreatestsorrow.
