He dwells in sacrifice. He dwells in the ether. He is (all that is) born in water, (all that) is born in earth, (all that) is born in sacrifice, (all that) is born on mountains. He is the True and the Great.
 
 Ill HE it is who sends the (in-coming) Prana (life-breath) upward and throws the (out-going) breath downward. Him all the senses worship, the adorable Atman, seated in the centre (theheart).
 
 IV WHEN this Atman, which is seated in the body, goes out (from the body), what remains then? This verily is That.
 
 V NO mortal lives by the in-coming breath (Prana) or by the out-going breath (Apdna), but he lives by another on which these two depend.
