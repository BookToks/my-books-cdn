92 The Upanishads XVI r I ^HERE are a hundred and one nerves of JL the heart. One of them penetrates the centre of the head. Going upward through it, one attains immortality. The other (hundred nerve-courses) lead, in departing, to different worlds.
 
 ' I''HE nervous system of the body provides the channels through which the mind travels; the direction in whichitmovesisdeterminedbyitsdesiresand tendencies.
 
 When the mind becomes pure and desireless, it takes the upward course and at the time of departing passes out through the imperceptible opening at the crown of the head; but aslongasit remains full of desires, itscourseis downward towards the realms where those desires can be satisfied.
 
 XVII THE Puruska, the inner Self, of the size of a thumb, is ever seated in the heart of all living beings. With perseverance man should draw Him out from his body as one draws the inner stalk from a blade of grass.
 
 One should know Him as pure and deathless, as pure and deathless.
