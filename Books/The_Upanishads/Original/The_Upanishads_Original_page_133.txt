THEY whose sphere of vision is wholly limited to this plane believe that when they have achieved a certain success in the world, they have gained all that there is to be gained ; and they bind themselves with their own vanity and egoism. Even when the great Saviours come and strive to awaken them, they still cling stubbornly to their own point of view. We see this in the life of Jesus the Christ. The scholars, those who knew the letter of the law and regarded themselves to be wise, were the last to accept His message.
 
 Whatever a man earns by finite actions, however good, cannot be permanent ; so all heavenly pleasure must come to an end and he must return once more to the plane of struggle and discipline.
 
 XI BUT those wise men of tranquil heart, who practice Shraddha (faith) and Tapasya (austerity) in the forest, living on alms, free from all impurities, travel by the path of the sun to where the immortal, imperishable Being dwells.
 
 XII a Brahmana (God-seeker), after havLET ing examined all these words attained Mundaka-Upanishad 133 through Karma-Marga (sacrifices and good deeds), become free from all desires; realizing that the Eternal cannot be gained by the noneternal.
