 TXT'E cover all things with the Lord by perceiving the DivinePresenceeverywhere.

If we do not have this knowledge, we cannot be happy;becausenothing on this external plane ofphenomena is permanent or dependable. He who is rich in the knowledge of the Self does not covet external power or possession.
 
 II one should desire to live in this world IF a hundred years, one should live performing Karma (righteous deeds). Thus thou mayest live; there is no other way. By doing this, Karma (the fruits of thy actions) will not defile thee.
