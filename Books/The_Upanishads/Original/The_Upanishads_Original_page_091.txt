90 The Upanishads X WHEN the five organs of perception become still, together with the mind, and the intellect ceases to be active : that is called the highest state.
 
 ~*HE teacher now shows Nachiketas the process by which the transcendental vision can be attained.
 
 The out-going senses, seeing, hearing, smelling, touching,tasting; the restless mind and the intellect: all must be indrawn and quieted. The state of equilibrium thus attained is called the highest state, because all the forces of one's being become united and focused; and this inevitably leads to supersensuous vision.
 
 XI THIS firm holding back of the senses is what is known as Yoga. Then one should become watchful, for Yoga comes and goes.
 
 literally means to join or to unite the lower self with the Higher Self, the object with thesubject, the worshipperwithGod. Inordertogainthisunion,however, one must first disunite oneself from all that scatters the physical, mental and intellectual forces; so the outgoing perceptions must bedetached from the external world and indrawn. When this is accomplished through constant practice of concentration and meditation, the union takes place of its own accord. But it may be lost again, unless oneiswatchful.
