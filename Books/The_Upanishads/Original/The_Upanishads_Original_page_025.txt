" The use of Isa (Lord) a more personal name of the Supreme Being than Brahman, Atman or Self,the names usuallyfound in the Upanishads constitutes one of Us peculiarities. It forms the closing chapter ofthe Yajur-Veda, known as Shukla (White).
 
 Oneness ofthe Soul and God, and the value ofbothfaith and works as means of ultimate attainment are the leading themes of this Upanishad. The general teaching of the Upanishads is that works alone, even the highest, can bring only temporary happiness and must inevitably bind a man, unless through them he gains knowledge of his real Self.
 
 To help him acquire this knowledge is the aim of this and all Upanishads.
