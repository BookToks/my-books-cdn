Over a decade ago, I had the great privilege of studying the Upanishads in the original Sanskrit under Swami Paramananda. He, like the true illumined teacher, imparted to me the essence of these lofty teachings in a manner known to the initiates of the land where the Forest-books were born. The experience was more than that of learning the text or its meaning. It was partaking of the light that streams from the mind of the master to that of an aspiring disciple.
 
 This was the beginning of a new era in my own life for soon afterwards, I received my ordination and commission to expound Ved^nta from the Swami's platform. The early classes on the theme of the Upanishads were conducted A A under the open sky at Ananda Ashrama, California. My first sermon-lecture was on "Exaltation of the Upanishads." Through long and close association with one who was truly wise ; whose learning was only a cloak for his inner realization who made the ; letter of the Scriptures living by his example, I now dare hope that someday I may be used to complete the work he had begun. As his stu- dent and follower, I humbly pray that through.
