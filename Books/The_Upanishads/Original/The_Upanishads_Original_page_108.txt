This glory is ours." 13RAHMAN heredoesnotmeanapersonalDeity. There is a Brahma, the first person of the Hindu Trinity; but Brahman is the Absolute, the One without a second, the essence of all. There are different names and forms which represent certain personal aspects of Divinity, such asBrahma the Creator, Vishnu the PreserverandSiva the Transformer; but no one of these can fully represent the Whole. Brahman is the vast ocean of being, on which risenumberlessripplesandwaves ofmanifestation. From the smallest atomic form to a Deva or an angel, all spring from that limitless ocean of Brahman, the inexhaustible Source of life. No manifested form of life can be independent of its source, just as no wave, however mighty, canbeindependentoftheocean. Nothingmoveswithout that Power. He is the only Doer. But the Devas thought: "This victoryis ours, thisglory isours." II THE Brahman perceived this and appeared before them. They did not know what mysterious form it was.
