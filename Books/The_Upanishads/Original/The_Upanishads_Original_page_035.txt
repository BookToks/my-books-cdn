Om!
 
 O mind, remember thy deeds! O mind, remember, remember thy deeds! Remember!
 
 CEEK not fleeting results as the rewardof thyactions, O mind! Strive only for the Imperishable. This Manlram or text is often chanted at the hour of death to remind one of the perishable nature of the body and the eternal nature of the Soul. When the clear vision of the distinction between the mortal body and the immortal Soul dawns in the heart, then all craving for physical pleasure or material possession drops away; and one can say, let the body be burned to ashes that the Soul may attain its freedom; for death is nothing more than the casting-off of a worn-out garment.
