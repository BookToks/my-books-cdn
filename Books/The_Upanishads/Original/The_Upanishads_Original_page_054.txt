VI THE Hereafter never rises before the thoughtless child (the ignorant), deluded by the glamour of wealth. "This world alone is, there is none other": thinking thus, he falls under my sway again and again.
 
 'TpHERE are many in the world, who, puffed up with * intellectual conceit, believe that they are capable of guiding others. But although they may possess a certain amount of worldly wisdom, they are devoid of deeper understanding; thereforeall thattheysaymerelyincreases doubtand confusion in the mindsofthose whohear them.
 
 Hence they are likened to blind men leading the blind.
 
 The Hereafter does not shine before those who are lacking in the power of discrimination and are easily carried away therefore by the charm of fleeting objects As children are tempted by toys, so they arc tempted by pleasure, power, name and fame. To them these seem the only realities. Being thus attached to perishable things, they come many times under the dominion of death. There is one part of us which must die; there is 54 The Upanishads anotherpart which never dies.
