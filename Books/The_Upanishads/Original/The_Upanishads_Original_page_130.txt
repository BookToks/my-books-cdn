Mundaka-Upanishad 129 II WHEN the sacrificial fire is kindled and the flames rise, let a man offer his oblations devoutly between the flames.
 
 Ill the fire sacrifice (Agnihotra) is not perIF formed at the new moon and the full moon, during the autumn season and at harvest time, and is not attended by guests, or is without offerings, or is without the Vaiswadeva sacrifice, or is offered contrary to the Scriptural injunctions, it will destroy the seven worlds ofthe sacrificer.
 
 times and conditions, determined by the CERTAIN position of the stars, planets or satellites, by the season, by the attendant circumstances, were regarded as peculiarly auspicious for performing sacrifice. If these were not observed, then the sacrifice was considered barren and the sacrificer lost all the benefits to be derived in the seven worlds from his sacrifice. The seven worlds represent the rising grades of heavenly pleasure. We find the same idea in the Western expression "seventh heaven." IV K ALI (dark), Karali (terrific), Manojava (swift as thought), Sulohita (very 130 The Upanishads Sudhumravarna red), (deep purple), Sphulingini (sparkling), Viswaruchi (universal light) are the seven flaming tongues of fire.
