62 The Upanishads XXIII Ft ^HIS Self cannot be attained by study A of the Scriptures, nor by intellectual perception, nor by frequent hearing (of It); He whom the Self chooses, by him aloneis It attained. To him the Self reveals Its true nature.
 
 WE may imagine thatbymuch studywecan find out God; butmerelyhearingaboutathingandgaining an intellectual comprehension of it does not mean attaining true knowledge of it. Knowledge only comes through direct perception, and direct perception of God is possible for those alone who are pure in heart and spiritually awakened. Although He is alike to all beings and His mercy is on all, yet the impure and worldy-minded do not get the blessing, because they do not know how to open their hearts to it. He who longs for God, him the Lord chooses; because to him alone can He reveal His true nature.
 
 XXIV HE who has not turned away from evil conduct,whosesensesareuncontrolled, who is not tranquil, whosemind is notat rest, he can never attain this Atman even by knowledge.
