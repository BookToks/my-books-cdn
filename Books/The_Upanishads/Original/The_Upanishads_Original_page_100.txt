Kena-Upanishad 99 A N ordinary man hears, sees, thinks, but he is satisfied to know only as much as can be known through the senses; he does not analyze and try to find that which stands behind the ear or eye or mind. He is completely identified with his external nature. His conception does not go beyond thelittlecircle ofhisbodilylife, whichconcerns the outer man only. He has no consciousness of that which enables his senses and organs to perform their tasks.
 
 There is a vast difference between the manifested form and That which is manifested through the form. When we know That, we shall not die with the body. One who clings tothesensesand tothingsthat areephemeral, must die manydeaths; but that man who knows the eyeof the eye, the ear of the ear, having severed himself from his physical nature, becomes immortal. Immortality is attained when man transcends his apparent nature and finds that subtle, eternal and inexhaustible essence which iswithinhim.
 
 Ill THERE the eye does not go, nor speech, nor mind. We do not know That; we do not understand how It can be taught.
 
 It is distinct from the known and also It is beyond the unknown. Thus we have heard from the ancient (teachers) who told us about It.
 
 A I AHESE physical eyes are unable to perceive that subtle essence. Nor can it be expressed by finite language or known by finite intelligence, because it is ioo The Upanishads infinite.
