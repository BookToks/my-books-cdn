Who tells the mind where to focus? Who makes the life force move? Whose choice makes people talk? What power controls the eyes and ears?

A student came to the Master and asked about what causes life and human actions.

He really wanted to know the truth. He asked who really sees and hears, and who controls the body. He noticed the world around him, which he could see and feel, but he wanted to understand the invisible world behind it all. He wondered if the mind is all-powerful or if something else moves it. He asked who gives the vital energy that keeps everything alive.

The teacher answered, “It is the ear behind the ear, the mind behind the mind, the speech behind the speech, the life behind life, and the eye behind the eye. Those who are wise and free from desires and senses become immortal after leaving this world.”
