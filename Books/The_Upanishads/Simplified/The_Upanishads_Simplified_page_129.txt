i THIS is the Truth : the sacrificial rites which the sages found in the hymns are described variously in the three Vedas. Perform them faithfully, O ye Truth-seekers ; this is the path that leads to the world of good deeds.
 
 THIS chapter deals in greater detail with the lower knowledge (Apard, Vidya} which according to the previous chapter includes all forms of intellectual study, ceremonial, ritual, etc. The Vedic teaching is divided into two distinct parts. The one, called GndnaKdnda, deals with the subtlest phases of spiritual philosophy ; the other, called Karma-Kdnda, shows to those who still cling to worldly things how by the performance of certain rites and sacrifices they may attain the fulfillment of their desires. The altar fire plays an important part in these sacrifices, because fire is regarded as one of the truest symbols of Divinity. It consumes all impurities without itself being contaminated. It has also a deeper significance. The real fire which every worshipper must light is the fire of wisdom upon which every morning, noon and night he must pour the oblation of his thoughts, words and deeds. This lower knowledge is described at length in order to make plain to the disciple the perishable nature of the fruits of all sacrifice. Also to test whether his mind is wholly free from desire for earthly rewards and ready for the higher knowledge.
