Here is the truth: the sacrifices that wise people found in the hymns are described in different ways in the three Vedas. Do them carefully, truth-seekers; this is the way to a good life.

This chapter talks more about lower knowledge, which includes all kinds of study, ceremonies, and rituals, like the last chapter said.

Vedic teaching has two parts. One part, called GndnaKdnda, deals with the deepest ideas of spiritual philosophy. The other part, called Karma-Kdnda, shows how people who still care about the world can do certain rites and sacrifices to get what they want.

The altar fire is very important in these sacrifices because fire is seen as a true symbol of God. It burns away all dirt but stays pure. It also has a deeper meaning. The real fire every worshipper must light is the fire of wisdom, which they should feed every morning, noon, and night with their thoughts, words, and actions.

This lower knowledge is explained clearly to help the learner understand that the results of sacrifices donâ€™t last forever. It also checks if their mind is free from wanting earthly rewards and ready for higher knowledge.
