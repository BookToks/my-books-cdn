8 Preface

The Swami has tried to make the translation clear and easy to understand while staying true to the original Sanskrit text. He kept the rhythm and old style of the lines but made sure the language is simple and direct. When there was no exact English word for a Sanskrit term, he used the Sanskrit word and explained it with a familiar English word in brackets. He did all this so readers from the West wouldnâ€™t feel lost or confused by new ideas.

The Swami also focused more on the meaning and spirit behind the words rather than just the exact letter. Scriptures are not just historical documents. Looking at them only as something to study with your brain misses their deeper message. To get the most from them, you need to connect with their spiritual meaning. One great thing about this translation is that the Swami worked on it not just as a careful scholar but also as a devoted believer who respects the text deeply.
