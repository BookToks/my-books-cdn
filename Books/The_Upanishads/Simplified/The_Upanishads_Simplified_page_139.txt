In the heart, there is a bright, shining Being who supports everything. Everything that moves, breathes, or blinks depends on Him. Know that He is both real and not real, beyond what people can understand, the highest and most lovable One.

The Supreme Lord lives in every heart, and all actions come from Him. Nothing can exist without Him. The whole universe is centered in Him. He has form and no form. He is in all the shapes we see, but you can’t point to any shape and say, “This is God.” He is both a person and not a person. He is what we can see and what we cannot see. He is the ultimate goal of all we do.

That which shines brighter than anything else, and holds up all worlds and everyone in them, is the everlasting Brahman. That is breath, speech, and mind. That is the truth, the Immortal. That is the target you must reach. Go for it, young one!
