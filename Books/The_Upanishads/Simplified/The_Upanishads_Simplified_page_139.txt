SECOND MUNDAKA i well-seated in the heart, moving SHINING, in the heart, is the Great Being, the Support of all. In Him all is fixed, whatsoever moves, breathes and winks. Know Him Who is both being and non-being, Who is beyond the reach of human understanding, the highest and most adorable One.
 
 THE Supreme Lord abides in every heart and from Him alone springs all activity. Nothing can exist apart from Him. In Him the whole universe is centered. He is both formful and formless. He is present in all the forms we see, yet we cannot lay our hands on any form and say, "This is God." He is both personal and impersonal. He is the manifested and the unmanifested (being and non-being). He is the final goal of all effort.
 
 II THAT which is effulgent, subtler than the subtlest, on which all worlds and those who dwell in them rest, that is the imperishable Brahman that is PrSna (breath), that is speech ; and mind. That is the true, that is the Immortal. That mark is to be hit. Hit it, O gentle youth!
