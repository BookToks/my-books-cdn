The Brahman once helped the Devas win a battle. Because of this win, the Devas felt very proud. They thought, "This victory is ours. This glory belongs to us."

Brahman doesn’t mean a personal god. There is a god named Brahma, who is part of the Hindu Trinity, but Brahman is something bigger. Brahman is the ultimate, the one true reality behind everything. 

There are different gods like Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Siva the Transformer, but none of them shows the whole picture. Brahman is like a huge ocean of being. On this ocean, many waves and ripples appear. Everything—from tiny atoms to angels—comes from this endless ocean of Brahman, the source of all life. 

No living thing can exist without its source, just like no wave can exist without the ocean. Nothing happens without that power. Brahman is the only one who truly acts. But the Devas thought, "This victory is ours, this glory is ours."

The Brahman saw this and showed itself to them. They didn’t understand what this strange form was.
