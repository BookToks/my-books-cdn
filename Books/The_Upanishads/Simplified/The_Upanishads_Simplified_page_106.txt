At the end of the passage, the teacher points out a big difference between two types of people. One is a wise person who actually knows a lot but thinks they don’t know much. The other is a person who doesn’t know much but thinks they know everything.

The true Self, called Brahman, is understood only when it is known in every state of consciousness. When someone understands this, they reach immortality.

By finding this Self, a person gets real strength. And by knowing the Self, they become immortal.

We have learned that people who only trust their senses don’t know Brahman. But those with a pure and clear mind can see Brahman as the base of all consciousness and the core of everything. This higher knowledge helps a person become immortal because they realize that even though their body can die, their true self doesn’t.

This knowledge also gives unlimited strength because the person sees themselves as connected to the ultimate source.

Strength from muscles, brain, or personal power is limited and can’t save a person from death. But the strength from Self-knowledge leads to immortality. When someone truly understands this unchanging inner self, they stop fearing death and become immortal.
