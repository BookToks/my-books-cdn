" In the last portion of the text, the teacher draws an impressive contrast between the attitude of the wise man who knows, but thinks he does not know; and that of the ignorant who does not know, but thinks he knows.
 
 IV (Brahman) is known, when It is known IT ineverystateofconsciousness. (Through such knowledge) one attains immortality.
 
 By attaining this Self, man gains strength; and by Self-knowledge immortality is attained.
 
 "V\7"E have learned from the previous text that the Brahman is unknown to those whose knowledge is limited to sense experience; but He is not unknown to those whose purified intelligence perceives Him as the basis of all states of consciousness and the essence of all things. By this higher knowledge a man attains immortality, because he knows that although his body may decay and die, the subtle essence of his being remains untouched. Such anonealsoacquiresunlimitedstrength, because he identifies himself with the ultimate Source.
 
 The strength which comes from one's own muscle and brain or from one'sindividual powermust be limited and mortal and therefore cannot lift one beyond death; but through the strength which Atma-gndnaor Self-knowledge gives, immortality is reached. Whenever knowledge is based on direct perception of this undying essence, one transcendsallfearofdeath andbecomesimmortal.
