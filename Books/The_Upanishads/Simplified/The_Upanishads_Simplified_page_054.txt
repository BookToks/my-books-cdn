The idea of life after death never comes to the mind of a careless person who only cares about money. They think, "This world is all there is," and because of this, they keep falling under my control again and again.

There are many people who think they are smart enough to guide others. But even though they know some things about the world, they don’t really understand the deeper truth. So, what they say only makes people more confused and unsure.

That’s why they are like blind people trying to lead other blind people.

People who can’t tell what’s really important get distracted by things that don’t last. Just like kids want toys, they want pleasure, power, fame, and respect. To them, these are the only real things. Because they care so much about things that don’t last, they keep coming under the power of death many times.

There is one part of us that must die, and another part that never dies.
