Wise people understand this and connect with their Higher Self, so they can rise above sadness.

He who knows this Atman—the part that experiences and enjoys things—always stays close. He is the master of the past and future, so he doesn’t fear anymore. This is the truth.

He who sees Him in the five elements, born from the fire of Brahman, before water existed; who lives inside the heart like a cave—this is the truth.

This verse shows that He, the Great Self, is the cause of everything created. The Vedas say His first form was Brahma, the Creator God, born from the fire of wisdom. He existed before the five elements—earth, water, fire, air, and ether—so He was “born before water.” He lives in the hearts of all beings.

He who knows Aditi, who rises with Prana (the life force), and exists in all gods; who lives inside the heart and was born from the elements—this is the truth.
