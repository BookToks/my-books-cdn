Katha-Upanishad 41

He asked his father, "Dear father, who will you give me to?" He asked two more times. Finally, his father said, "I will give you to Death."

Being a good son and wanting to make up for his father's weak sacrifice, he tried to remind him that he hadn’t kept his promise to give away everything, since he hadn’t even offered his own son, who would be a better gift than useless animals. His father knew he wasn’t doing a real sacrifice and tried to ignore the questions. But the boy kept asking, and his father got annoyed and said, "I give you to Yama, the Lord of Death." The fact that his father got angry so quickly showed he didn’t have the right attitude for a sacrificer, who should always be calm, peaceful, and without pride.

Nachiketas thought: "Among many students of my father, I am the best; among others, I’m in the middle, never last. What will my father gain by sending me to Yama today?"

It wasn’t pride that made Nachiketas think this way. He was trying to understand his value as a son and student to see if he was a worthy gift. He knew his father’s harsh answer was just a quick, angry reaction, but he believed his father might be in trouble if he didn’t keep his promise.
