Katha-Upanishad 41 IV HE said to his father: Dear father, to whom wilt thou give me? He said it a second time, then a third time. The father replied: I shall give thee unto Death.
 
 , being a dutiful son and eager to atone for his father's inadequate sacrifice, tried to remind him thusindirectly thathehadnot fulfilled hispromise to give away all his possessions, since he had not yet offered his own son, who would be a worthier gift than useless cattle. His father, conscious that he was not making a true sacrifice, tried to ignore the boy's questions; but irritated by his persistence, he at last impatiently made answer: "I give thee to Yama,theLordof Death." The fact that anger could so quickly rise in his heart proved that he had not the proper attitude of a sacrificer, who must always be tranquil, uplifted and free from egoism.
 
 V I^TACHIKETAS thought: Among many -L^l (of my father's pupils) I stand first; among many (others) I stand in the middle (but never last). What will be accomplished formy father bymy going this day to Yama?
 
 TT was not conceit which led Nachiketas to consider his own standing and importance. He was weighing his valueasasonandpupilinordertobeabletojudgewhether or not he had merit enough to prove a worthy gift. Although he realized that his father's harsh reply was only 42 The Upanishads the expression of a momentary outburst of anger; yet he believed that greater harm might befall his father, if his word was not kept.
