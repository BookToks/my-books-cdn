He who gives these undoubtedly goes to joyless realms.
 
 TN India'the idea of sacrifice has always been to give freely for the joy of giving, without asking anything inreturn; and thewholepurposeand meritofthe sacrifice is lost, if the giver entertains the least thought of name, fame or individual benefit. The special Viswajit sacrifice which Vajasrava was making required of him to give awayallthathepossessed. When,however, thegiftswere broughtforwardtobeoffered,hissonNachiketas,although probably a lad about twelve years of age, observed how worthless were the animals which his father was offering.
 
 His heart at once became filled with Shraddhd. There is nooneEnglishwordwhichcanconvey themeaningof this Sanskrit term. It is more than mere faith. It also implies self-reliance, an independent sense of right and wrong,andthecourageofone'sownconviction. Asaboy of tender age, Nachiketas had no right to question his father's action: yet, impelled by the sudden awakening of his higher nature, he could not but reflect: "By merely givingtheseuselesscows,myfathercannotgainanymerit.
 
 Ifhehasvowedtogiveallhispossessions,thenhemustalso give me. Otherwise his sacrifice will not be complete and fruitful." Therefore, anxious for his father's welfare, he approachedhimgentlyand reverently.
