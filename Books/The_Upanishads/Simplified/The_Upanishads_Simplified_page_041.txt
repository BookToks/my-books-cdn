If someone gives without meaning it, they end up going to sad places.

In India, the idea of sacrifice has always been to give freely just for the happiness of giving, without expecting anything back. The whole point of sacrifice is lost if the giver thinks about getting fame, name, or personal gain. The special Viswajit sacrifice that Vajasrava was doing meant he had to give away everything he owned. But when the gifts were brought forward, his son Nachiketas, who was probably about twelve years old, saw that the animals his father wanted to give were useless.

His heart was filled with Shraddha. There’s no English word that fully explains this Sanskrit word. It means more than just faith. It also means believing in yourself, knowing right from wrong, and having the courage to stand by what you think is right. Even though Nachiketas was young and didn’t have the right to question his father, he felt something inside him telling him, “If my father just gives these useless cows, he won’t really get any good from it.

If he promised to give everything he owns, then he must also give me. Otherwise, his sacrifice won’t be complete or successful.” So, worried about his father’s well-being, he went to him gently and respectfully.
