The Katha-Upanishad 63 VTAMA first explains what the Atman is, and now it tells us how to reach it. A person must try to control their lower nature and gain control over their body and senses.

They need to overcome selfish desires that disturb their peace of mind so that their mind can become calm and peaceful. In other words, they must live a good life and develop all spiritual qualities to understand the Atman.

Who can know where this powerful Self is? This Self is so great that even the Brāhmanas (priests) and Kshatriyas (warriors) are like food to Him, and death itself is like a spice.

This part shows how amazing and powerful the Supreme Being is. The Brāhmanas represent spiritual strength, and the Kshatriyas represent physical strength, but both are weaker compared to His power. Life and death are both like food for Him. Just like the big sun shines brighter than all other lights in the universe, all worlds disappear in the great light of the Eternal, Ever-Present Being.
