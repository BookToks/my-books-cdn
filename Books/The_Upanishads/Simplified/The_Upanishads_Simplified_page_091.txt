When the five senses stop moving, along with the mind and the thinking part of the brain, that is called the highest state.

The teacher now explains to Nachiketas how to reach this special kind of vision.

The senses that go out—like seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, and tasting—as well as the busy mind and thinking, all need to be pulled back and calmed down. When everything is balanced like this, it’s called the highest state because all parts of a person come together and focus. This leads to a vision beyond normal senses.

Holding the senses back like this is called Yoga. But you have to be careful because Yoga can come and go.

Yoga means joining the lower self with the Higher Self, or joining the person with God. To do this, you first have to separate yourself from everything that spreads out your physical, mental, and thinking energy. You have to pull your senses away from the outside world and bring them inward. When you keep practicing focusing and meditating, this joining happens naturally. But you have to stay alert, or you might lose it again.
