This really is That.

The seat of the Purusha (the soul) is said to be the heart, so it "lives in the middle of the body." Even though it is unlimited and everywhere, it is shown as small in the heart, about the size of a thumb. This actually means the heart, which looks like a thumb. Just like light is everywhere, but we see it clearly in a lamp and think it’s only there, the life energy flows everywhere in the body, but the heart is seen as its special home.

That Purusha, the size of a thumb, is like a clear light without smoke, the ruler of the past and the future. It is the same today and tomorrow. This really is That.

Here, the teacher explains that the soul shines brightly like a clean flame without smoke.

He also answers Nachiketas’s question about what happens after death, saying nothing really changes because the soul always stays the same.

When rain falls on a mountain top, it runs down over the rocks in all directions. In the same way, a person who sees only differences between things runs after them in many directions.
