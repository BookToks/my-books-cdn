This text is important because it talks about learning about Brahman, the Supreme Being, in two ways: seen and unseen.  

Brahman is seen as the Lord of sacrifice for people who follow rituals.  

He is unseen, eternal, and the universal Supreme Being for those who follow wisdom.  

The "other shore" means the place of immortality. It is said to be free from fear because things like sickness and death don’t happen there.  

Many people think the first two verses were added later.  

I will know the Atman (Self) as the lord of a chariot, with the body as the chariot.  

The intellect is like the driver, and the mind is inside it.  

The senses are like horses, and sense objects are the roads. When the Atman connects with the body, senses, and mind, wise people call it the enjoyer.  

In the third chapter, Yama explains which parts of us die and which parts are immortal. He tells what is mortal and what is not.  

But the Atman, or Higher Self, is so beyond human understanding that it’s impossible to fully describe it.  

The Upanishads try to explain it, but it’s hard to give a simple definition.
