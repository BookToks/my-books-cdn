Our conception of knowing finite things is to know their name and form; but knowledge of God must be distinct from such knowledge. This is why some declare God tobe unknown and unknowable; because He is far more than eye or mind or speech can perceive, comprehendorexpress. The Upanishad doesnot say that He cannot be known. He is unknowable to man's finite nature. How can a finite mortal apprehend the Infinite Whole? But He can be known by man's God-like nature.
 
 IV THAT which speech does not illumine, but which illumines speech: know that alone tobetheBrahman (the Supreme Being), not thiswhichpeople worship here.
 
 THAT which cannot be thought bymind, but by which, they say, mind is able to think: know that alone to be the Brahman, not this which people worship here.
 
 VI THAT which is not seen by the eye, but by which the eye is able to see : know that alone to be the Brahman, not this which people worship here.
