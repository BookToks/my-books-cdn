Knowing things that have limits means knowing their name and shape. But knowing God is different from that. Some people say God can’t be known because He is way beyond what our eyes, minds, or words can understand or explain. The Upanishad doesn’t say God can’t be known. It says God can’t be fully understood by our limited human nature. How can a limited human understand something infinite? But God can be known through the part of us that is like God.

The Upanishad says:  

What doesn’t need words to understand, but helps us use words—know that alone as the Brahman, the Supreme Being, not what people usually worship.  

What can’t be thought about by the mind, but helps the mind to think—know that alone as the Brahman, not what people usually worship.  

What can’t be seen by the eyes, but helps the eyes to see—know that alone as the Brahman, not what people usually worship.
