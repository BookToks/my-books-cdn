I know the highest place where Brahman lives, the one where the whole universe rests and shines brightly. Wise people, without wanting anything for themselves, respect and serve someone who truly understands the Self, and by doing this, they go beyond the beginning of life.

The person who realizes the highest truth and connects with the source of knowledge becomes a bridge between God and people who worship. When others show respect to this person, he doesnâ€™t keep it for himself. Free from pride, he gives all the honor to God. People who find and serve someone like this slowly gain wisdom and no longer need to be born or die again. Every desire is like a seed that causes birth, death, and all suffering. Only true understanding can destroy this seed.

People who keep thinking about what they want and crave things are born again and again based on their desires. But those who have fulfilled their desires and truly know themselves lose all desires, even while living here.
