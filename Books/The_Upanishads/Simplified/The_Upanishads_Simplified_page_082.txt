He lives in sacrifice. He lives in the air. He is everything born in water, on land, through sacrifice, and on mountains. He is the True and the Great.

It is He who moves the life-breath up and sends the breath out down. All the senses worship Him, the lovable Atman, sitting in the center of the heart.

When this Atman, which sits in the body, leaves the body, what is left then? That is truly Him.

No one lives just by breathing in or breathing out, but by another life force that these two depend on.
