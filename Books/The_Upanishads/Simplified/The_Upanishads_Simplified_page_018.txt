No matter what new ideas future philosophy comes up with, one thing will always stay true and can never be changed. If we ever figure out the big mystery of life, the answer will only come from looking inside ourselves, where natureâ€™s secret is hidden.

This is exactly where the first thinkers of the Upanishads discovered the truth, which is why they are so respected. 

The Upanishads were first introduced to the Western world when they were translated into Persian in the seventeenth century. Then, more than a hundred years later, a famous French scholar named Anquetil Duperron brought a copy from Persia to France. He translated it into French and Latin, but only published the Latin version.
