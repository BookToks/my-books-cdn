The name Isa (Lord) is a more personal way to talk about the Supreme Being than other names like Brahman, Atman, or Self, which are usually found in the Upanishads. Isa is used in the last chapter of the Yajur-Veda, called Shukla (White).

The main ideas in this Upanishad are that the Soul and God are one, and that both faith and good actions are important for reaching the highest goal.

The Upanishads teach that doing good works alone, even the best ones, can only bring temporary happiness. These works can tie a person down unless they help him understand his true Self.

The goal of this Upanishad, and all Upanishads, is to help people gain this deeper knowledge.
