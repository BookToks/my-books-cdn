KENA-UPANISHAD AY IV/f my body, speech, life, energy, sight, hearing, strength, and all my senses become stronger. Everything is the Brahman (the Supreme Lord) mentioned in the Upanishads.

I hope I never reject the Brahman. I hope the Brahman never rejects me. I hope there is no denial of the Brahman. I hope I am never separated from the Brahman.

May all the good qualities talked about in the sacred Upanishads show up in me, who is dedicated to the Atman (Higher Self). May they appear in me.

OM! PEACE! PEACE! PEACE!
