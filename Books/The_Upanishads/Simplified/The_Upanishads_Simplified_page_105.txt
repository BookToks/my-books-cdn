Material science looks only at things we can see and touch, so it misses what’s beyond that. Because of this, it is always limited and keeps changing. It found atoms, then discovered electrons, but when it found one, it had to give up the other. This kind of knowledge can never explain the Infinite because it focuses only on parts, not the whole. Spiritual science isn’t just about the mind or brain; it depends on waking up our hidden, higher consciousness.

The one who thinks they don’t know the truth actually knows it.

The one who thinks they know the truth, actually doesn’t know it. Real knowers understand they can never fully know the Infinite, while ignorant people think they do.

This text shows that Brahman (the ultimate reality) can’t be thought about because it has no limits. So it says: only the person who thinks of Brahman as beyond thoughts, senses, mind, and speech truly understands it. People who judge someone by how they look or by their senses don’t really know them; the real Self is inside, the part that hears, speaks, and sees. In the same way, someone who thinks they know Brahman just by its name or form doesn’t really know it. Proud and foolish people think they know everything, but true knowers are humble. They say, “How can I know You, who are unlimited and beyond the mind and speech?”
