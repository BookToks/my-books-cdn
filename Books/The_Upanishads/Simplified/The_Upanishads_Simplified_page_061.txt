The person who thinks they are killing someone, or the person who thinks they are being killed, both are wrong. Because the true Self neither kills nor can be killed.

The Self is more delicate than anything delicate, and greater than anything great. It lives in the heart of every living thing. A person who has no desire, no sadness, and a calm mind and body can see the true Self’s greatness.

Even though the Self lives in everyone’s heart, regular people don’t notice it because it is so subtle. You can’t see it with your eyes; you need a special kind of spiritual vision. Your heart must be pure and free from selfish wishes. Your mind should stop focusing on outside things. When your whole being is calm and peaceful, then you can feel that shining Self. It is subtler than anything because it is the invisible core of everything. It is greater than anything because it is the endless power that holds the whole universe together. Everything exists because of it.
