Part YAMA said: Good things and fun things are not the same. They have different goals and can control a person. The person who picks the good is doing well. The one who picks only fun misses what really matters.

Good and fun both come to people. A smart person looks at both and tells the difference. The smart person picks good over fun, but a silly person picks fun because they like feeling good.

After thinking carefully, ONACHIKETAS, you have given up fun and all things that just feel good. You didnâ€™t take this valuable garland that many people want so much they lose themselves.
