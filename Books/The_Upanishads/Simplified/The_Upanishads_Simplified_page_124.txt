MUNDAKA UPANISHAD PEACE CHANT OM  
May we hear with our ears what is good, O Devas!  
May we see with our eyes what is good!  

With a strong, steady body and a respectful heart, may we enjoy life and do things that please the Deity.  

OM! PEACE! PEACE! PEACE!  

OM! Brahma was the first of the Devas, the Creator of the universe and the Protector of the world. He taught his oldest son Atharva about Brahman (the Supreme), which is the base of all knowledge.  

The word Om, often said at the start of Vedic study, means "Hail to You" or "Respect to the Supreme." Brahma is the personal form of God, different from Brahman, the Absolute. He shows the creative power of the universe.
