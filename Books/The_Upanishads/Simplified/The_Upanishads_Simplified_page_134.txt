To learn about the Eternal, a person should go to a Guru (spiritual teacher) with some kind of offering, like firewood for a ritual.  

The Guru should be someone who knows the Vedas (holy books) well and understands Brahman (the highest reality).  

When the student approaches respectfully, with a calm heart and controlled senses, the wise Guru can teach the true knowledge of Brahman.  

This knowledge helps the student understand the real and eternal Being.
