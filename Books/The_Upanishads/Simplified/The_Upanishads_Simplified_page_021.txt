Every Upanishad starts with a Peace Chant called Shanti-patha to create a calm and pure mood. To learn about God, everyone needs to be ready together with kind hearts. Both the teacher and students pray to the Supreme Being for help and protection. It’s hard to understand life’s deep problems unless your mind is calm and focused.

Until we stop being distracted by everyday worries, we can’t really connect with higher religious learning. Studying won’t help if our inner self isn’t in the right mood. We need to have a peaceful attitude toward all living things. If we don’t have it, we should work hard to develop it by chanting or repeating holy words. 

Jesus taught the same idea when He said: "If you bring a gift to the altar and remember your brother is upset with you, leave your gift there and first make peace with your brother, then come back and offer your gift."
