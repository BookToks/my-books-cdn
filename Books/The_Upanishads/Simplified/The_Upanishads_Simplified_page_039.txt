It was early translated into Persian and through this renderingfirst made its way into Europe. Later Rdjd Ram Mohun Roy brought out an English version. It has since appeared in various languages; and English, German and French writers are all agreed in pronouncing it one of the most perfect expressions of the religion and philosophy of the Vedas. Sir Ed-win Arnold popularized it by his metrical rendering under the name of "The Secret ofDeath," and Ralph Waldo Emerson gives its story in brief at the close ofhis essay on "Immortality." There is no consensus of opinion regarding the place of this Upanishad in Vedic literature. Some authorities declare it to belong to the Yajur-Veda, others to the SamaVeda, while a large number put it down as a part of the Atharva-Veda. The story is first suggested in the RigVeda; it is told more definitely in the Yajur-Veda; and in the Katha-Upanishad it appearsfully elaborated and interwoven with the loftiest Vedic teaching. There is, nothing, however, to indicate the special place of this final version, nor has any meaning beenfoundfor the name Katha.
