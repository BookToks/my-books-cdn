When you truly see Him, who is both high and low, the chains around your heart break, all your doubts disappear, and all the bonds of your actions are destroyed.

When you realize that He is everything—big or small, obvious or hidden—your heart becomes free from attachment, selfishness, and ego. All the confusion and questions in your mind vanish. This doesn’t happen just by learning facts or thinking hard. The more you study, the more mixed up your mind can get. But when you actually experience God directly, all doubt disappears like night turning into day. This light is so bright no one can fully explain it. If you still need proof to believe the Truth, then you haven’t truly found it yet. But when this light shines inside your heart, the Truth becomes clear on its own. Without this light, the world seems full of shadows, but with it, everything shines brightly. Then all the chains from your past, present, and future actions are broken, and your soul is completely free.

That pure, unbroken Brahman, the brightest light of all, lives deep inside the heart. This is how those who know themselves understand Him.
