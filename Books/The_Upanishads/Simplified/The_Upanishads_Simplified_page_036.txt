The main idea is that we can’t really enjoy life or be truly happy unless we always remember the all-present Lord. If we don’t realize what keeps us alive, how can we live smart and do what’s right?

Everything we see, whether it moves or not, good or bad, is all connected. We shouldn’t think of the world as separate parts because then we only understand a little bit and limit ourselves.

Someone who sees all living things as part of themselves, and themselves in all living things, never suffers. This is because when they see everyone as part of their true self, feelings like jealousy, sadness, and hate disappear. Only this person can truly love. This all-powerful One is bright, without beginning or end, pure, and free from sin and pain. Knowing this helps a person break free from the material world and go beyond death. Going beyond death means understanding the difference between the body and the Soul and realizing you are the Soul. When we see the Soul inside us that never dies, we stop thinking of ourselves as just a body that dies.

Learning about ourselves has always been important to wise people. The Upanishads, ancient teachings, focus on knowing the Self and God, because they are the same. What comes from the whole infinite universe must also be infinite, so the Self is infinite. The Upanishads say we are like drops in the ocean.
