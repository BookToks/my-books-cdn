The Kena-Upanishad says that the true Brahman, or ultimate reality, is something you cannot hear with your ears, but because of it, your ears can hear. It is not the thing that people usually worship.

It also says that Brahman is not the breath we breathe, but the one that makes breathing possible.

Usually, we know three states of consciousness: awake, dreaming, and sleeping. But there is a fourth state called the superconscious, which is beyond these three. In the first three states, our mind is not clear enough to avoid mistakes. But in the fourth state, the mind becomes pure and can see the Divine.

If God could be known by our normal mind and senses, then knowing God would be like learning any other subject. But God can only be known by a pure mind.

So, to know God, a person must make their mind pure. The Upanishads say the mind we usually have is just another sense. This normal mind is limited. But when it is lit up by the Cosmic Intelligence, or the "mind of the mind," it can understand the First Causeâ€”the source behind everything we see and do.
