Yama gives a practical way to realize the Supreme. The word "speech" means all the senses. First, a person must control their senses by using the mind. Then, the mind must be controlled by the ability to tell what is important and what is not. This means stopping the mind from focusing on useless things.

This ability to judge must be controlled by a higher intelligence, and this higher intelligence must be guided completely by the Supreme Intelligence.  

The great teachers who have reached this understanding say the path is very sharp and hard to follow, like a razorâ€™s edge.

They say, "Wake up from the sleep of not knowing! Get up and find those who truly know the Truth because only they can teach it. Respect them and ask them to guide you."

The path is really hard to walk. It is not for lazy or careless people. You have to be strong, alert, and keep trying.

Knowing the Supreme means knowing something without sound, touch, shape, smell, or taste. It never dies, has no beginning, no end, and never changes. When a person understands this, they escape death.
