When someone gets lost in fake ideas, wise people say they hurt themselves. This is because if you think your body, which can break and die, is the real you, you will have to face death many times.

There is something that never moves but is faster than your mind. Your senses can’t catch it because it’s always ahead. Even though it doesn’t move, it travels faster than anyone running. This thing helps the air that all living things need to breathe.

This verse talks about the Atman, or the true Self.

A regular thing can only be in one place at a time. But the Atman is everywhere. So, even if you run really fast to catch it, it’s already there before you get there.

The air that is everywhere depends on this Self because it never ends. Since all living things need air to live, they get their life from the Cosmic Self.

It moves but doesn’t move. It is far away and also very close. It is inside everything and also outside everything.
