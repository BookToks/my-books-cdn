Om!

Hey mind, remember what you’ve done! Hey mind, don’t forget your actions! Keep remembering!

Don’t just look for quick rewards from what you do, mind! Aim for something that lasts forever. This chant is often said when someone is dying to remind them that the body doesn’t last, but the Soul does.

When you truly understand that the body is temporary and the Soul is forever, all the desire for fun or stuff goes away. Then you can say, it’s okay if the body turns to ashes because the Soul will be free. Death is just like taking off old clothes.

XVIII O Agni (Bright One)! Please guide us on the right path to happiness.

Oh Lord!

You know everything we do. Please take away all our mistakes and confusion. We bow down and ask you for help again and again.

This is the end of the Isa-Upanishad 35. This Upanishad is also called Isa-Vasya-Upanishad, which means it teaches about the All-Pervading God.
