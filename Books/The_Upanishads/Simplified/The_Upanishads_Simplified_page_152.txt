The strength needed for spiritual vision comes from inner energy.

The wise teachers carefully picked students who were full of energy, loyal, and ready to do anything. Even hard and strict practice won’t help if the heart is still stuck on selfish desires.

The wise people, called Rishis, become peaceful and satisfied when they gain true knowledge. Once they reach their goal and let go of all wants, they feel calm. These self-controlled wise ones understand that the Spirit is everywhere and in everything.

They become one with everything because they see that all life is connected. They “see themselves in all beings and all beings in themselves” (Bhagavad Gita). The spiritually dedicated seekers, who understand the true meaning of Vedanta, clean their nature by giving up attachments and realize the highest form of life. After death, they become free and united with Brahman, the ultimate reality.
