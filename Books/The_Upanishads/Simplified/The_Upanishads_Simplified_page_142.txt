Where all the nerves in the body come together, like spokes meeting at the center of a wheel, the Atman (the inner self) lives. It shows itself in many ways. Think about that Atman as the sound "Om." I hope nothing stops you from moving from darkness to light!

The place where this Divine Principle lives in us is the heart. This inner self or soul never changes, but it seems to feel things like happiness, sadness, anger, jealousy, hate, love, and more. That’s why it appears in different ways.

Since "Om" is the most important name of the Supreme, and Atman is the same as the Supreme, when we focus on "Om" as the Atman, we aim our mind at the highest truth and move beyond the darkness of not knowing.

The Self, who knows and sees everything, and who owns all the universe’s glory, lives in the heart, which is like a heavenly city.

This Self takes the shape of the mind and becomes the boss of the body and senses. Being in the heart, it keeps the body alive through the food we eat.

Wise people who understand this see the Self shining brightly, forever happy and never dying.
