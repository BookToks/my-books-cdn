Mundaka-Upanishad 141 VI WHERE the nerves of the body meet together as the spokes in the nave of a wheel, here the Atman dwells, variously manifested. Meditate upon that Atman as Om. May there be no obstacle in thy crossing to the other of darkness!
 
 side, THE seat of this Divine Principle in us is the heart. This inner Principle or Soul is in Itself unchanging, but It appears to take the modifications of the mind, such as joy, grief, anger, jealousy, hatred, love, etc. Thus It manifests variously. Since Om is the ultimate Name of the Supreme and Atman is identical with the Supreme, by meditating on Om as the Atman we direct our thoughts toward the highest and pass beyond the darkness of ignorance.
 
 VII HE Who is all-knowing and all-perceiving, Whom to belongs all the glory of the universe, that Self dwells in the heavenly city of Brahman (the heart).
 
 VIII HE takes the form of mind and becomes the ruler of the body and the senses. Being in the heart, He sustains the body by food.
 
 The wise, who realize this, behold Him shining forth, immortal and all-blissful.
