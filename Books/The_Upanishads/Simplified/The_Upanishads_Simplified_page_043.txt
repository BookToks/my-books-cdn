So, he tried to make his dad stronger in his decision by reminding him that life doesn’t last forever. He said: Look back at the people who lived before and look at those who live now. Like grain, people die and like grain, they are born again.

Everything dies, only the truth stays forever. So why be afraid to send me too? Nachiketas convinced his dad to keep his promise and send him to Yama, the Lord of Death. Then Nachiketas went to Death’s home, but Yama wasn’t there, so the boy waited without eating or drinking for three days.

When Yama came back, one of his helpers said: Fire is like a guest in a Brahmana’s house. Fire can be put out with an offering. So Vaivaswata, bring water.

A foolish man who doesn’t feed a Brahmana guest loses all his hopes and good things. All the good he got from being with holy people, his good words and actions, even his children and cattle, are destroyed.
