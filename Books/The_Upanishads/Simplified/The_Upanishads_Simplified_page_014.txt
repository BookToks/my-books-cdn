INTRODUCTION HE JL Upanishads represent the loftiest heights of ancient Indo-Aryan thought and culture. They form the wisdom portion or Gndna-Kdnda of the Vedas, as contrasted with the Karma-Kdnda or sacrificial portion. In each of the four great Vedas known as Rik, Yajur, Sama and Atharva there is a large portion which deals predominantly with rituals and ceremonials, and which has for its aim to show man how by the path of right action he may prepare himself for higher attainment. Following this in each Veda is another portion called the Upanishad, which deals wholly with the essentials of philosophic discrimination and ultimate spiritual vision. For this reason the Upanishads are known as the Veddnta, that is, the end or final goal of wisdom (Veda, wisdom; anta, end).
 
 The name Upanishad has been variously interpreted. Many claim that it is a compound Sanskrit word Upa-ni-shad, signi- 14 Introduction " fying sitting at the feet or in the presence of a teacher"; while according to other authorities it means "to shatter" or "to destroy" the fetters of ignorance.
