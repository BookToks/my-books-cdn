INTRODUCTION

The Upanishads are the highest ideas of ancient Indo-Aryan culture and thinking. They are the wisdom part of the Vedas, called Gndna-Kdnda, which is different from the Karma-Kdnda, or the part about rituals and ceremonies.

Each of the four big Vedas—Rik, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva—has a large section focused mostly on rituals. These parts teach people how to prepare themselves for higher goals by doing the right actions. After this, each Veda has another section called the Upanishad, which is all about deep thinking and spiritual understanding.

Because of this, the Upanishads are known as the Veddnta, meaning the end or final goal of wisdom (Veda means wisdom, and anta means end).

The word Upanishad has different meanings. Many say it comes from the Sanskrit words Upa-ni-shad, meaning sitting close to a teacher. Others say it means to break or destroy the chains of ignorance.
