By carefully learning to tell the difference between the Soul and the body, just like you separate the soft part from a reed, you can understand what really matters.

Nachiketas, after learning this wisdom from the Ruler of Death and following all the Yoga rules, became free from impurity and death and reached Brahman, the highest truth. Anyone else who understands the Self in the same way can do this too.

PEACE CHANT  
May the Supreme Being protect us both. May He be happy with us.

May we become strong. May our learning bring us light. May we have no enemies.

OM! PEACE! PEACE! PEACE!

This is the end of this Upanishad.
