A long time ago, there was a special Aswattha tree with its roots above and branches below. That tree is pure and is called Brahman. It is the only thing that never dies. All worlds exist because of it.

Nothing can go beyond Brahman. This is the truth.

This verse talks about the tree of creation, which has its roots in Brahman, the highest power, and its branches reaching down into our world. Things like heat and cold, happiness and pain, birth and death, and all the changes we see are like the branches. But Brahman, the root, is pure, never changes, and never dies. Everything, from the biggest angel to the tiniest atom, comes from Him.

He is the base of the whole universe. Nothing is greater than Him.

Everything in the universe comes from Prana, the life energy, and moves because of it. This power is strong and scary, like a lightning bolt. People who understand this become immortal.
