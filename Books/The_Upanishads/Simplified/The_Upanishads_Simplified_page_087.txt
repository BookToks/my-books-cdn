Part ancient Aswattha tree has its root THIS above and branches below. That is pure, That is Brahman, That alone is called the Immortal. All the worlds rest in That.
 
 None goes beyond That. This verily is That.
 
 ' I ''HIS verse indicates the origin of the tree of creation (the Samsdra-Vriksha), which is rooted above in Brahman, the Supreme, and sends its branches downward into the phenomenal world. Heat and cold, pleasure and pain,birthanddeath, andalltheshiftingconditionsof the mortal realm these are the branches ; but the origin of the tree, the Brahman, is eternally pure, unchanging, free and deathless. From the highest angelic form to the minutest atom, allcreated thingshave theirorigininHim.
 
 He is the foundation of the universe. There is nothing beyondHim.
 
 II WHATEVER there is in the universe is evolved from Prdna and vibrates in Prana. That is a mighty terror, like an upraised thunderbolt. Theywhoknow That become immortal.
