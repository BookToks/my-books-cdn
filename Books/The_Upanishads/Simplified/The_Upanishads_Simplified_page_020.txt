Since then, there have been many European translations of the Upanishads in French, German, Italian, and English. But just translating them, even if done carefully, is not enough to help Western people really understand them. Professor Max Müller, who worked on this for his whole life, honestly said: "Modern words are soft and round, while ancient words are sharp and square. Trying to explain the old ideas of the Vedas in modern English is like trying to make a circle into a square." Without extra explanations, it’s almost impossible to get the spirit or meaning of the Upanishads. They were never meant to be easy, popular books.

They basically grew as textbooks about knowing God and knowing yourself. And like any textbook, they need someone to explain them.

Because these teachings were passed down by word of mouth from teacher to student, the style had to be very short and packed, using quick sayings.

The language was often full of hidden meanings and was hard to understand. But if you keep trying to look past these surface problems, it’s totally worth it. These ancient sacred books have some of the most amazing spiritual ideas ever.
