Since that time there have been various European translations French, German, Italian and English. But .a mere translation, however accurate and sympathetic, is not sufficient to make the Upanishads accessible to the Occidental mind. Professor Max Miiller after a lifetime of arduous labor in this field frankly confesses: "Modern words are round, ancient words are square, and we may as well hope to solve the quadrature of the circle, as to express adequately the ancient thought of the Vedas in modern English." Without a commentary it is practically impossible to understand either the spirit or the meaning of the Upanishads. They were never designed as popular Scriptures.
 
 They grew up essentially as text books of God-knowledge and Self-knowledge, and like all text books they need interpretation.
 
 Being transmitted orally from teacher to disciple, the style was necessarily extremely condensed and in the form of aphorisms.
 
 The language also was often metaphorical and obscure. Yet if one has the perse- 2O Introduction verance to penetrate beneath these mere surface difficulties, one is repaid a hundredfold; for these ancient Sacred Books contain the most precious gems of spiritual thought.
