The Self, which exists on its own, created our senses to look outward. That’s why people see the outside world but don’t see their true inner Self.

Some wise people, though, want to live forever. They stop focusing on the outside and look inside to see the real Self.

In the last chapter, the Ruler of Death taught Nachiketas about the true nature and greatness of the Self. Now, he explains why most people don’t see the Self.

It’s because our minds are always pulled toward the outside world through our senses, so we can’t see the inner Self. But sometimes, a smarter seeker looks inside and finds the undying Self.

Kids or people who don’t understand just chase after outside pleasures. Because of this, they get caught in the trap of death. But the wise know what immortality really means and don’t try to find something permanent in things that don’t last.
