The subtle Self can be understood by a pure heart, where the life-force, called Prana, enters in five different ways. Every creatureâ€™s mind is connected to the senses. When the mind becomes pure, the true Self shines on its own.

The five ways the vital energy works in the body are called Prana, Apana, Samana, Vyana, and Udhana. These relate to breathing in, breathing out, balancing the breath, moving the breath around, and breathing upward. These actions control different nerve currents in the body. This idea is explained in the Indian Yoga system.

Prana controls breathing, Apana handles waste removal, Samana helps with digestion, Vyana moves nerve signals all over the body, and Udhana is connected to speech. The senses are also called Pranas because they connect the outside world to the inside. The things we sense affect our thoughts, and only when the mind is free from these influences can the soul show its true self.
