IX subtle Self is to be realized by a pure THIS heart as seated there where the PransL (life-force) has entered in five-fold form. The mind of every creature is interwoven with the senses. When it is purified, then the Self shines forth of itself.
 
 THE five different forms through which the vital energy manifests in the body are Prana, Apana Samana, Vyctna and Udhdna. These represent inbreathing, out-breathing, equalizing the breath, circulating the breath, and up-breathing. By these various actions of the vital energy different nerve currents an controlled. This has been elaborately worked out it the Indian Yoga system. Prana governs respiration Apana, the organs of excretion ; Samana, digestion ; Vyana, the general nerve currents of the body, and Udhana, speech. The senses also are often spoken of in the Upanishads as Prtinas, because they are the avenues through which the vital energy connects the outer world with the inner. The sense impressions gained through these channels color all our mental activities ; and not until the mind is freed from these obscuring impressions can the soul manifest its true nature.
