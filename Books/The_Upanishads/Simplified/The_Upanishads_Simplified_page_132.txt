People who don’t really understand things but think they are smart and knowledgeable keep going in confusing circles. They have lots of problems, like blind people trying to lead other blind people.

This idea also appears in the Katha-Upanishad, where it talks about how just knowing facts can make someone proud. This pride makes them believe they can guide others, even in spiritual matters, but they don’t truly understand. They want to be leaders, but the Vedas say only people with real spiritual insight should lead others.

Many people, because they don’t see clearly, think they have reached their goals.

Those who do rituals and sacrifices get attached to the rewards they receive. After enjoying these heavenly rewards for a while, they end up back in suffering.

These ignorant people think doing sacrifices and good deeds is the highest goal. After enjoying the pleasures they earned, they come back to this world or go to a lower one.
