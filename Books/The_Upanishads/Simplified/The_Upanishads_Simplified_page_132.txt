Here it seeks to emphasize the danger of mere intellectual learning which, fostering a man's pride, leads him to believe that he is capable of guiding others, even in spiritual matters, although he himself is devoid of spiritual understanding. He wishes to be a leader, but in the Vedas it is insistently taught that no one save the man of direct vision shall venture to lead others.
