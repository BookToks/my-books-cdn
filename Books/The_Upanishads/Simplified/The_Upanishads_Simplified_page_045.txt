44 YAMA said: Because of my will, your father Auddalaki Aruni will recognize you and treat you the same as before.

He will sleep peacefully at night. He won’t be angry when he sees you safe after facing death.

12 IYACHIKETAS said: In heaven, there is no fear, Death. You are not there, and there is no fear of getting old.

Those who have gone beyond hunger, thirst, and sadness are happy in heaven.

13 O Death, you know the fire sacrifice that leads to heaven. Please tell me about it, because I have faith and really want to know. Those who live in heaven don’t have to worry about death. This is my second wish.
