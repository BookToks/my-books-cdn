Everything in the universe should be seen as part of the Lord.

Let go of things that aren’t real and enjoy what is truly real. Don’t be jealous of other people’s wealth.

You can see the Lord everywhere by understanding that the Divine is in all things. When your mind focuses on God, you stop seeing everything as separate because the One Cosmic Existence is in everything. As you get wiser, you stop holding onto things that aren’t real and find happiness in what is truly real.

The word "enjoy" can also mean "protect," according to the great teacher Sankaracharya. Knowing your true Self is the best way to protect and support yourself. Without this knowledge, you can’t be truly happy because nothing in the outside world lasts or can be trusted. Someone who knows their true Self doesn’t want power or stuff from outside.

If you want to live in this world for a hundred years, you should do good and right things. That’s the only way to live well. By doing good actions, the results won’t harm you.
