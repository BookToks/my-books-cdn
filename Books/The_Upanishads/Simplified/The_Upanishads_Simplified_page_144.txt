Mundaka-Upanishad 143 XI THE sun does not shine there, nor the moon, nor the stars, nor do these lightnings shine there, much less this fire. When He shines, everything shines after Him ; by His light all is lighted.
 
 T HIS same verse also appears in the KathaUpanishad, Part V, v. 15.
 
 XII THAT immortal Brahman is before, that Brahman is behind, that Brahman is to the right and to the left; that Brahman extends above and below. The Supreme Brahman alone is the whole Universe.
