The sun doesn’t shine there, nor the moon, nor the stars, and even lightning or fire don’t shine there. When He shines, everything else shines because of Him; His light makes everything bright.

This same idea is also found in another book called the Katha Upanishad, Part V, verse 15.

That immortal Brahman is in front, behind, to the right, and to the left. Brahman is all around, above and below. The Supreme Brahman is the entire Universe.
