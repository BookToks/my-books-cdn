Knowing this special shining fire, which comes from Brahman, and understanding Him, a person finds forever peace.

  
He who knows the three-part Nachiketa fire and does the Nachiketa fire sacrifice with full knowledge, breaking free from death and sadness, feels happy in heaven.

  
This is your fire, Nachiketas, that leads to heaven, which you chose as your second wish. People will name this fire after you. Now ask for your third wish, Nachiketas.

  
Fire is called "the base of all worlds" because it shows how creation happens. Without fire or light, nothing would be seen. In the Bible, it says, "In the beginning, the Lord said, 'Let there be light.'"

  
So, the fire we see outside as a pure sign of the Divine also lives inside every living thing as the energy that keeps life going.
