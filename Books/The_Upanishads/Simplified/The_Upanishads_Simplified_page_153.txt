All fifteen parts come back to where they started; all the senses go back to their own gods. The Self, along with its actions and learned knowledge, becomes one with the highest, unchanging Brahman.

The fifteen parts are life, faith, ether, air, fire, water, earth, senses, mind, food, energy, discipline, holy texts, sacrifice, and the worlds made of names and forms. Faith is mentioned after life because it is the strongest force in life. When a person truly understands, all the physical, mental, and moral parts of them come together as one and join with the Supreme.

Just like rivers flow into the ocean and lose their names and shapes, the person who knows the truth also gives up their name and form and reaches the brightest, highest Being.

A person's awareness grows into the universal awareness, and the limits of self-awareness disappear; but they donâ€™t lose who they really are. When they realize their true Self, they go beyond names and forms and join fully with the universal Source of all existence and knowledge. As the Mundaka-Upanishad says: "He becomes without parts and immortal."
