148 The Upanishads X WHATEVER worlds the man of purified mind covets, and whatever objects he desires, he obtains those worlds and those objects. Therefore, let the man who longs for his spiritual welfare, worship that one who knows the Self.
 
 WHEN a man's mind is purified, he realizes his oneness with the cosmic life and will desire only what is in harmony with the cosmic will ; therefore, his desires fulfill themselves by the natural course of law. Purity of mind is most quickly gained by "worshipping," that is, by revering and serving those who possess the higher knowledge.
