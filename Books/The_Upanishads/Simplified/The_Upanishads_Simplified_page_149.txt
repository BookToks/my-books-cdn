148 The Upanishads X

When a person’s mind is pure, they get whatever worlds and things they want. So, if someone wants to grow spiritually, they should admire and learn from those who understand the true Self.

When a person’s mind is clean and clear, they see that they are connected to the universe. They will only want things that fit with the universe’s plan, and their wishes will come true naturally. 

The fastest way to make your mind pure is by respecting and helping people who have deep knowledge.
