82 Hey Gautama (Nachiketas), I’m going to tell you the secret about the eternal Brahman and what happens to the Self after death.

VII Souls (individual Jivas) go into some wombs to be born as living beings; others go into things that don’t move, based on their actions and knowledge.

This text explains how the law of cause and effect works for all life. What you think and do in this life decides your future birth and surroundings.

VIII The Being who stays awake while everyone else sleeps, who gives all wishes, is pure and is Brahman. Only That is truly immortal. All worlds rest on That.

No one goes beyond That. That is really the truth.

IX Just like fire is one but changes depending on what it burns, the Atman (Self) inside all living things is one but changes based on what it enters.
