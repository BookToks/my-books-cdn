"Find out what this mystery is," he said. "Yes," someone answered, and ran toward it, but it disappeared before him.

Then, right there, he saw a woman named Uma. She was very beautiful, had golden skin, and was the daughter of Haimavat (the Himalaya).

He asked, "What is this great mystery?" Here we see how the Absolute, or the ultimate reality, takes a clear form to help people who really want to understand Him.

Brahman, the deep and unknown mystery, disappeared, and instead, a personal form appeared to represent Him.

This is a subtle way to show the difference between the Absolute and the personal sides of God. The Absolute is said to be impossible to fully know or think about, but He takes on personal forms to make Himself known to His followers. So, Uma, the daughter of the Himalaya, shows that personal side, while the Himalaya itself stands for the Eternal, Unchanging One.
