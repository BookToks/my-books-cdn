48 The Upanishads

XXII O Nachiketas, even the gods had questions about death, and it is not easy to understand.

There is no other teacher like you. So, no other wish can be better than this one.

XXIII Yama said: Ask for sons and grandsons who will live a hundred years, many cows, elephants, gold, and horses. Ask for large lands and live as many years as you want.

XXIV If you think any other wish is as good as this, ask for wealth and a long life; be the ruler over all the earth. O Nachiketas, I will make you enjoy all your desires.

XXV Whatever things people find hard to get, ask for all of them. I will give you beautiful girls with chariots and musical instruments that ordinary people canâ€™t have.
