48 The Upanishads XXII O said: Death, thou NACHIKETAS sayest that even the Devas had doubts about this, and that it is not easy to know.
 
 Another teacher like unto thee is not to be found. Therefore no other boon can be equal to this one.
 
 XXIII YAM A said: Ask for sons and grandsons who shall live a hundred years, many cattle, elephants, gold and horses. Ask for lands of vast extent and live thyself as many autumns as thou desirest.
 
 XXIV thou thinkest of any other boon equal IF to this, ask for wealth and long life; be ruler over the wide earth. O Nachiketas, I shall make thee enjoyer of all desires.
 
 XXV WHATSOEVER objects of desire are difficult to obtain in the realm of mortals, ask them all as thou desirest; these lovely maidens with their chariots and Katha-Upanishad 49 musical instruments, such as are not obtainable by mortals be served by these whom I give to thee.
