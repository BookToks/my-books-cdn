ii2 The Upanishads III Indra excels all other THEREFORE Devas, because he came nearest to Brahman, and because he first (before all others) knew this spirit as Brahman.
 
 A GNI, Vayu and Indra were superior to the other Devas because theygained acloser vision; and they were able to do this because they were purer; while Indra stands as the head of the Devas, because he realized the Truth directly, he reached Brahman. The significance of this is that whoever comes in direct touch with Brahman or the Supreme is glorified.
 
 IV THUS the teaching of Brahman is here illustrated in regard to the Devas.
 
 He flashed like lightning, and appeared and disappeared just as the eye winks.
 
 ' I AHE teaching as regards the Devas was that Brahman is the only Doer. He had appeared before them in a mysterious form; but the whole of the unfathomable Brahman could not be seen in any definite form; so at the moment of vanishing, He manifested more of His immeasurable glory and fleetness of action by a sudden dazzlingflashoflight.
