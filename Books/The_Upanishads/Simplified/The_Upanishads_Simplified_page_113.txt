Indra is better than all the other gods because he got closest to Brahman, the ultimate spirit, and he was the first to understand it.

Agni, Vayu, and Indra were better than the other gods because they could see things more clearly. They could do this because they were purer. Indra is the leader of the gods because he directly realized the Truth and reached Brahman. This means that anyone who connects directly with Brahman or the Supreme is honored.

This story shows the teaching about Brahman and the gods.

He appeared quickly like lightning and disappeared just as fast as an eye blink.

The lesson about the gods is that Brahman is the only one who truly acts. He showed himself to them in a mysterious way, but no one could see all of Brahman in one clear form. When he vanished, he showed even more of his endless power and speed by flashing a bright light suddenly.
