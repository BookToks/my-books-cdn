Kena-Upanishad 115 '~T"*HIS Upanishad is called Kena, because it begins * with the inquiry: "By whom" (Kena) willed or directed does the mind go towards its object? From whom comes life? What enables man to speak, to hear and see? And the teacher in reply gives him the definition of Brahman, the Source and Basis of existence.
 
 The spirit of the Upanishads is always to show that no matter where we look or what we see or feel in the visible world, it all proceeds from one Source.
 
 The prevailing note of all Vedic teaching is this: One tremendous Whole becoming the world, and again the world merging in that Whole. It also strives in various ways to define that Source, knowing which all else is known and without which no knowledge can be well established. So here the teacher replies: That which is the eye of the eye, the ear of the ear, that is the inexhaustible river of being which flows on eternally; while bubbles of creation rise on the surface, live for a time, then burst.
 
 The teacher, however, warns the disciple that this eye, ear, mind, can never perceive It; for It is that which illumines speech and mind, which enables eye and ear and all sense-faculties to perform their tasks. "It is distinct from the known and also It is beyond the unknown." He who thinks he knows It, knows It not; because It is never known by those who believe that It can be grasped by the intellect or by the senses; but It can be known by him who knows It as the basis of all consciousness.
 
 The knower of Truth says, "I know It not," because he realizes the unbounded, infinite nature of the Supreme.
 
 "Thouartthis (thevisible), ThouartThat (theinvisible), and Thou art all that is beyond," he declares. The ordinary idea of knowledge is that which is based on sense- 116 The Upanishads preceptions; but the knowledge of an illumined Sage is not confined to his senses.
