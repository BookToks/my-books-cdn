This Upanishad is called Kena because it starts with questions like: "Who makes the mind focus on something? Where does life come from? What helps people speak, hear, and see?" The teacher answers by explaining Brahman, which is the Source and foundation of everything.

The Upanishads always try to show that no matter what we see or feel in the world, it all comes from one single Source.

The main idea in all Vedic teachings is this: One huge Whole becomes the world, and then the world goes back into that Whole. They also try to explain that Source because if you understand it, you understand everything, and without it, no knowledge is complete. So, the teacher says: That which is the eye of the eye, the ear of the ear, is like an endless river of being that flows forever. The things we see are like bubbles that come up, live for a while, and then disappear.

But the teacher warns the student that this eye, ear, or mind can never really see or understand It. That’s because It is what makes speech and thought possible and helps the senses do their job. "It is different from what we know, and it is beyond what we don’t know." Anyone who thinks they fully understand It doesn’t really understand It, because It can’t be understood by just using the brain or the senses. Instead, It can only be known by someone who sees It as the source of all awareness.

The person who truly knows the Truth says, "I don’t know It," because they understand how big and endless the Supreme really is.

"They are this (what we can see), they are That (what we can’t see), and they are everything beyond," the teacher says. Normal knowledge comes from what we sense, but the knowledge of a wise person goes beyond just the senses.
