The student asked: “Teacher, please teach me the Upanishad.” The teacher replied: “I have already taught you. We have taught you about Brahman.”

The Upanishad is about tapas, which means controlling your body, mind, and senses. It also teaches dama, which is controlling your desires, and karma, which means doing the right actions. The Vedas are like its parts, and truth is what holds it all up.

Anyone who understands this wisdom, and cleans away all their mistakes, will reach the happy, forever home of Brahman, the highest place there is.

This is the end of the Upanishad.
