ii4 The Upanishads VII r I ^HE disciple asked: O Master, teach me A theUpanishad. (The teacherreplied:) The Upanishad has been taught thee. We have certainly taught thee the Upanishad about Brahman.
 
 VIII THE Upanishad is based on tapas (practice of the control of body, mind and senses), dama (subjugation of the senses), karma (right performance of prescribed actions). The Vedas are its limbs. Truth is its support.
 
 IX HE who knows this (wisdom of the Upanishad), having been cleansed of all sin, becomes established in the blissful, eternal and highest abode of Brahman, in the highest abode of Brahman.
 
 Here ends this Upanishad.
