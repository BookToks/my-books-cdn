The Atman, or the inner Self, is like air. Even though air is one thing, it changes depending on where it goes. In the same way, the Atman is one but takes different forms inside all living things. It also exists outside of them.

The teacher uses examples like fire and air to help Nachiketas understand the special nature of the great Self. This Self is one and without form, like air and fire, but it can take different shapes depending on where it lives. Because it is everywhere and unlimited, it cannot be trapped in any one form. That’s why we say it also exists outside all forms.

The sun is called the eye of the whole world because it lights up everything. Even if it shines on dirty things, it doesn’t get dirty itself. In the same way, the one inner Self in all living beings is not affected by the pain or problems of the world. It stays outside those troubles.

The Self inside us is not touched by the sickness or limits of our bodies. It is beyond all physical problems.
