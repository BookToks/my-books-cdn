Katha-Upanishad 91 XII HE cannot be attained by speech, by mind, or by the eye. How can That be realized except by him who says "He is"?
 
 XIII HE should be realized as "He is" and also as the reality of both (visible and invisible). He who knows Him as "He is," to him alone His real nature is revealed.

By mind, eye, or speech themanifestedattributesoftheDivinecanbeapprehended; but only one who has acquired the supersensuous sight candirectlyperceive God'sexistenceanddeclaredefinitely that "He is," that He alone exists in both the visible and the invisible world.

 XV WHEN all the ties of the heart are cut asunder here, then the mortal becomes immortal. Such is the teaching.
