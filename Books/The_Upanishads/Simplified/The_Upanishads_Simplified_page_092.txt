You can’t understand or find That by talking, thinking, or just looking. How can anyone realize it except the person who says, “He exists”?

You should understand Him as “He exists” and as the truth behind everything you can see and can’t see. Only the person who knows Him this way truly understands what He really is.

This special way of seeing can’t be reached by normal senses. You can recognize some signs of the Divine with your mind, eyes, or words, but only someone who has this special vision can truly see that God exists and say for sure, “He is,” meaning He is the only one in everything seen and unseen.

When all the wishes in your heart stop, a person who usually dies becomes immortal and reaches Brahman right here.

When all emotional attachments in your heart break away, the same thing happens—mortals become immortal. This is the teaching.
