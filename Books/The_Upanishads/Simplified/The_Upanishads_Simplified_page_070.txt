The mind has a part that makes decisions, and this part is controlled by the individual Self. Beyond this Self is a creative energy called Avyaklam, and above that is the Purusha, or Supreme Self.

There is nothing higher than this. It is the ultimate goal, a place of complete peace and happiness.

This Self, called Atman, is hidden inside all living things, but it doesn’t show itself clearly. Only people who are very aware and thoughtful can sense it.

Since it is inside everyone, why can't we see it?

Because most people’s minds are dull and distracted. Only those who keep thinking deeply about the Supreme and have purified their intellect can see it clearly.

This clear vision happens when all your energy is focused in one direction through regular practice of concentration and meditation.

A wise person should control their speech with their mind, control their mind with their intellect, control their intellect with the great Atman, and control that with the peaceful Supreme Self.
