Anyone who truly understands the highest Brahman becomes like Brahman itself. In their family, no one is born who doesnâ€™t know about Brahman. They get past sadness; they overcome doing wrong; and by freeing their heart from problems, they become immortal.

This is explained in the next text.

Only those who have done the sacrifices required by the Scriptures, who know the Vedas well, who are devoted to Brahman, who have done the fire sacrifice called Ekarshi with faith, and who have kept the vow of carrying fire on their head (Shirovrata) should be taught this knowledge of Brahman.

This means that only people who have purified themselves by sincerely doing the right rituals and promises from the Scriptures can understand or follow this higher knowledge. Teaching it to others will only confuse them and stop them from growing.
