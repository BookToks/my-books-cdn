Yama said: I know the fire that leads to heaven. I will tell you about it. Listen carefully, Nachiketas. This fire helps you reach endless worlds and their support. It is hidden in the heart of all living things.

Yama then explained how to do the fire-sacrifice, the start of all worlds, including what bricks to use, how many, and how to put them together for the altar.

Nachiketas repeated everything exactly as Yama told him.

Pleased with Nachiketas, Yama said: I will give you another gift. This fire-sacrifice will be named after you. Take this colorful garland as well.

Anyone who does the Nachiketa fire-sacrifice three times, connecting with their mother, father, and teacher, and who does three important duties (studying the Vedas, doing sacrifices, and giving to others) will go beyond birth and death.
