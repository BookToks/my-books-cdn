When the fire for a sacrifice is lit and the flames go up, a person should offer their gifts carefully and with respect between the flames.

If the fire sacrifice (called Agnihotra) is done on the wrong days, like the new moon or full moon, during autumn or harvest time, or if there are no guests, no offerings, no special Vaiswadeva sacrifice, or if it breaks the rules from the scriptures, it will harm the sacrificer’s seven worlds.

The right times and conditions for doing the sacrifice depend on the exact positions of stars and planets, the season, and other important details. These are seen as very lucky moments to perform the sacrifice. If these are not followed, the sacrifice won’t work, and the person won’t get any rewards in the seven worlds after.

The seven worlds stand for different levels of heavenly happiness, kind of like the idea of “seventh heaven” in Western culture.

The fire has seven flaming tongues called Kali (dark), Karali (terrible), Manojava (as fast as thought), Sulohita (very red), Sudhumravarna (deep purple), Sphulingini (sparkling), and Viswaruchi (universal light).
