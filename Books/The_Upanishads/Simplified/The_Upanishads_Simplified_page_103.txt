Part &econD i thou thinkest "I know It well," then it is certain that thou knowest but little of the Brahman (Absolute Truth), or in what form He (resideth) in the Devas (minor aspects of Deity). Therefore I think that what thou thinkest to be known is still to be sought after.
 
 TJTAVING given the definition of the real Self or Brahman, by whichmortalsare able to see, hear,feel and think, theteacherwasafraidthatthedisciple, aftermerely hearingabout It, might concludethatheknewIt. So he said to him: "You have heard about It, but that is not enough. You must experience It. Mere intellectual recognitionwillnotgiveyoutrueknowledgeofIt. Neither can It be taughtto you. The teachercan only show the way. You must find It for yourself." Knowledge means union between subject and object.
 
 To gain this union one must practise; theory cannot help us. The previous chapter has shown that the knowledge of Brahman is beyond sense-perception: "There the eye does not go, nor speech, nor mind." "That is distinct from known and also It isbeyond the unknown." Therefore itwas necessary forthe teachertoremind thedisciple that knowledge based on sense-perception or intellectual Kena-Upanishad 103 apprehensionshould notbeconfoundedwithsupersensuous knowledge.
