If you think, "I know it well," then you actually know very little about Brahman (the Absolute Truth) or how He exists in the Devas (smaller parts of the divine). So, what you believe you know still needs to be discovered.

After explaining what the real Self or Brahman is—the source that lets people see, hear, feel, and think—the teacher worried that the student might think he truly understood it just by hearing about it. So the teacher said, "You have heard about it, but that’s not enough. You have to experience it yourself. Just knowing it in your head won’t give you real knowledge. It can't be taught directly. The teacher can only show you the way. You have to find it on your own." True knowledge means joining the knower and the known.

To reach this union, you have to practice; just learning the ideas won’t help. The last chapter showed that knowing Brahman is beyond what the senses can understand: "There the eye does not go, nor speech, nor mind." It’s different from what we know and even beyond what we don’t know. So the teacher had to remind the student that knowledge based on senses or thinking should not be mixed up with this higher, beyond-the-senses knowledge.
