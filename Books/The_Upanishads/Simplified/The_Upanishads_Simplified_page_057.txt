56 The Upanishads X KNOW that (earthly) treasure is transiI tory, for the eternal can never beattained by things which are non-eternal. Hence the Nachiketa fire (sacrifice) has been performed by me with perishable things and yet I have attained the eternal.
 
 XI thou hastseen thefulONACHIKETAS, filment of all desires, the basis of the universe, the endless fruit of sacrificial rites, the other shore where there is no fear, that which is praiseworthy, the great and wide support; yet, being wise, thou hast rejected all with firm resolve.
 
 'T^HE teacher, saying that the imperishable cannot be * attained by the perishable, shows that no amount of observance of rituals and ceremonies can earn the imperishable and eternal. Although the Nachiketa firesacrifice may bring results which seem eternal to mortals because of their long duration, yet they too must come to an end; therefore this sacrifice cannot lead to the final goal. Yama praises Nachiketas because, when all heavenly and earthly pleasures, as well as knowledge of all realms and their enjoyments were offered him, yet he cast them asideand remained firm in hisdesireforTruth alone, Katha-Upanishad 57 XII THE wise, who by means of the highest meditation on the Self knows the Ancient One, difficult to perceive, seated in the innermost recess, hidden in the cave of theheart,dwellingin the depthofinnerbeing, (he who knows that One) as God, is liberated from the fetters of joy and sorrow.
