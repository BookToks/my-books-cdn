56 The Upanishads say that things like money and stuff on earth don’t last forever. You can’t reach something eternal by using things that don’t last. That’s why I did the Nachiketa fire ritual with things that will eventually disappear, but I still found something eternal.

XI You have seen all desires disappear, the base of everything, the endless reward from sacrifices, the safe place with no fear, something worthy of praise, and the big support for everything. But even though you are wise, you chose to reject all of these firmly.

The teacher explains that you can’t get something that never ends by doing things that do end. No matter how many rituals or ceremonies you do, they won’t get you the eternal truth. The Nachiketa fire might seem to last a long time, but it will end too, so it can’t give you the final goal. Yama praises Nachiketa because even when offered all kinds of fun and knowledge about heaven and earth, he refused them and stayed focused on wanting only the Truth, Katha-Upanishad 57.

XII Wise people who meditate deeply on the Self understand the Ancient One, who is hard to see but lives deep inside the heart. Knowing this One as God frees them from the ups and downs of happiness and sadness.
