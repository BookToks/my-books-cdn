From Him come many things like gods, special spirits called Sadhyas, people, animals, birds, breathing in and out, crops like corn and barley, self-control, faith, truth, and rules from holy books.

From Him also come the seven life forces, the seven lights that help us sense the world, the seven fuels we use, the seven actions we do with our senses, and the seven places where our senses move. All seven live in the heart of every living being.

From Him are born all the oceans, mountains, and many rivers. From Him come all the plants and juices that help our inner self live, along with the basic elements.

This one Being is everythingâ€”sacrifice, self-discipline, and all. Everything is Brahman, the Highest. These verses show us how the whole universe comes from Brahman, the Supreme.
