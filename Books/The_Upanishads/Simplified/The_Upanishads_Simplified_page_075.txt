74 The Upanishads 'TpHOSE who are devoid of discrimination and fail to * distinguish between real and unreal, the fleeting and the permanent, set their hearts on the changeable things of this world; hence they entangle themselves in the net of insatiable desire, which leads inevitably to disappointment and suffering. To such, death must seem a reality; because they identify themselves with that which is born and which dies. But the wise, who see deeper into the natureofthings,arenolongerdeludedbythecharmofthe phenomenal world and do not seek for permanent happiness among itspassing enjoyments.
 
 Ill THAT by which one knows form, taste, smell, sound, touch and sense enjoyments, by That also one knows whatever remains (to be known). This verily is That (which thou hast asked to know).
 
 IV THATby which a mortal perceives, both in dream and in waking, by knowing that great all-pervading Atman the wise man grieves no more.
 
 TN these verses the teacher tries to make plain that all knowledge, as well as all sense perception, in every state ofconsciousness sleeping,dreamingorwaking is possible only because the Self exists. There can be no Katba-Upanishad 75 knowledge or perception independent of the Self.
