People who can't tell the difference between what’s real and what’s not, or what lasts and what doesn’t, focus their hearts on things that keep changing in this world. Because of this, they get caught up in endless desires that never get satisfied, which always leads to disappointment and pain.

For these people, death feels real because they think of themselves as just something that is born and then dies. But wise people, who understand things better, are no longer fooled by the temporary things in the world. They don’t look for true happiness in things that only last for a little while.

Everything you know by seeing, tasting, smelling, hearing, touching, or feeling comes from one source. This source is also how you know anything else that can be known. This is what you have been asking about.

It is because of this same source that people can experience things whether they are dreaming or awake. When a wise person understands this great, all-around Self, they stop feeling sorrow.

In these verses, the teacher explains that all knowledge and all the things you sense, whether you are asleep, dreaming, or awake, happen only because the Self exists. There is no knowledge or perception separate from the Self.
