He knows everything that comes from what we see, hear, and feel, and also everything that comes from the Spirit.

The main goal of this Upanishad is to help us understand what is truly real so we don’t get tricked by our ego. The ego makes us think we are just our body, mind, and senses. People stay stuck in being mortal because they listen to their ego and rely only on their limited physical and mental abilities.

The story about the Devas and Brahman teaches us that there is no real power or doer except God. God is like the eye inside the eye, the ear inside the ear. Our eyes, ears, and all our abilities don’t have any power on their own without Him. When we understand that God is the true reality inside us, we go beyond death and become immortal.

OM! PEACE! PEACE! PEACE!
