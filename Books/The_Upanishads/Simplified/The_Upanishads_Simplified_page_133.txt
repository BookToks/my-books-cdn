People who only focus on life here on Earth think that once they achieve some success, they have everything they need. They get stuck in their own pride and selfishness. Even when great teachers come to help them see the truth, they still hold on to their own ideas. We see this with Jesus Christ. The scholars, who knew all the rules and thought they were smart, were the last to believe His message.

Whatever someone earns by their actions, no matter how good, cannot last forever. So, all the happiness in heaven will end, and the person must come back to face challenges and learning again.

But those wise people with calm hearts, who have faith and live simply in the forest, depending on othersâ€™ kindness, and free from all bad habits, follow the path of the sun to where the eternal, never-ending Being lives.

A Brahmana (someone who seeks God), after thinking about all this, reached the understanding in the Mundaka-Upanishad that by doing good deeds and sacrifices, and giving up all desires, they can become free. They realize that the eternal cannot be found through things that do not last.
