The first form is Fire (Agni), which gives us light and heat. Heat helps life grow; rain falls on the earth and makes plants grow, so we get food. From food comes the energy to create new life.

All living things like gods, spirits, people, and animals are connected to Fire. The holy books and all rituals come from Him. Everything starts with Him.

The seven senses mentioned are the two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, and the mouth. The seven lokas or places are the ways we sense the world. The inner self means the subtle body made of the mind, intellect, and ego. Someone who understands that the cause of everything is inside their own heart, the life inside them, can become enlightened even while still alive.

Someone who knows this eternal Being living in their heart, young friend, can break free from ignorance right now.
