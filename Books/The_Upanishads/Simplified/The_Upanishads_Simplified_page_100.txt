A regular person hears, sees, and thinks, but they are happy knowing only what their senses can tell them. They don’t try to understand what’s behind their ears, eyes, or mind. They think they are just their body and don’t look beyond that.

There is a big difference between what we see and the real thing behind what we see. When we understand that real thing, we won’t die when our body dies. People who only care about their senses and temporary things have to face many losses. But someone who understands the true source of seeing and hearing, and who separates from just their body, becomes immortal. Immortality happens when we go beyond our physical self and find the deep, endless spirit inside us.

That spirit is a place where eyes, words, and thoughts can’t reach. We don’t really know it or how to teach it.

It’s different from what we know and also beyond what we don’t know. We learned about it from old teachers.

Our normal eyes can’t see this subtle spirit. It can’t be fully explained in normal words or understood by normal thinking because it is infinite.
