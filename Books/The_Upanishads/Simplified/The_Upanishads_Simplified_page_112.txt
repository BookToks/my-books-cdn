jFourtft CHE (Uma) said, "It is Brahman. Because of Brahman, you have won." From her words, Indra understood that the mysterious form was Brahman.

TMA told Indra, "You won because of Brahman. You live and act because of His power. He controls everything, and you are just tools in His hands. So, thinking 'We won, this glory is ours' is wrong."

Indra realized their mistake. The Devas were full of pride and thought they won by themselves, but it was actually Brahman. Not even a blade of grass can move without His command.

Among these Devas, Agni, Vayu, and Indra are better than the others because they were closer to Brahman. They were the first to understand this spirit as Brahman.
