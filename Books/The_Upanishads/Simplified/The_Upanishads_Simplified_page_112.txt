part jFourtft CHE ^ (Uma) said: "It is Brahman. It is through the victory of Brahman that ye are victorious." Then from her words, he (Indra) knew that it (that mysterious form) was Brahman.
 
 TMA replied to Indra, " It is to Brahman that you owe your victory. It is through His power that you live andact. He istheagentandyou areallonlyinstruments in His hands. Therefore your idea that 'This victory is ours, this glory is ours,' is based on ignorance." At once Indra saw their mistake. The Devas, being purled up with vanity, had thought they themselves had achieved thevictory, whereasit was Brahman; fornotevenablade ofgrasscan move without Hiscommand.
 
 II these Devas, Agni, THEREFORE Vayu and Indra excel other Devas, because they came nearer to Brahman. It was they who first knew this spirit as Brahman.
