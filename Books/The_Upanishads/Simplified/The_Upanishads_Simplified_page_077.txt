T HIS verse is somewhat obscure and seems like an interpolated amplification of the preceding verse.
 
 VIII THE all-seeing fire which exists hidden in the two sticks, as the foetus is wellguarded in the womb by the mother, (that fire) is to be worshipped day after day by wakeful seekers (after wisdom) as well as by , sacrificers. This verily is That.
 
 is called all-seeing because its light makes everything visible. In Vedic sacrifices the altar fire was always kindled by rubbing together two sticks of a special kind of wood called Arani. Because fire was regarded as one of the most perfect symbols of Divine wisdom, it was to be worshipped by all seekers after Truth, whether they followed the pathof meditationor the path of rituals.
 
 IX whence the sun and whither FROM rises, it goes at setting, upon That all the Devas depend. No one goes beyond That.
 
 This verily is That.
