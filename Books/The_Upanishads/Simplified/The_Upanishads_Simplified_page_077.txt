This verse is a bit confusing and seems like an extra part added to the verse before it.

There is a hidden fire inside two sticks, just like a baby is safely kept inside its motherâ€™s womb. This fire should be worshipped every day by people who stay awake to seek wisdom, as well as by those who perform sacrifices. This fire is actually the same as the divine.

It is called all-seeing because its light helps us see everything. In Vedic sacrifices, the fire on the altar was always made by rubbing two special sticks of wood called Arani together. Fire was seen as a perfect symbol of divine wisdom, so everyone searching for the truth, whether through meditation or rituals, was supposed to worship it.

The sun rises from and sets into this divine source, and all the gods depend on it. No one can go beyond it.

This is truly the divine.
