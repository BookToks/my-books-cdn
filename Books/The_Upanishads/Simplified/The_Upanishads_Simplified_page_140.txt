Mundaka-Upanishad 139 III taken up the Upanishad, the HAVING great weapon, as the bow ; and having fixed in it the arrow, sharpened by steadfast devotion then having drawn it with the mind ; fixed on the Supreme, hit that mark the ImO perishable, gentle youth!
 
 IV Om THE sacred word is the bow, the Atman (Self) is the arrow, Brahman (the Supreme) is said to be the mark. That mark should be hit by one who is watchful and selfpossessed. Then as the arrow becomes one with the mark, so will he become one with the Supreme.
 
 WE have here a poetic and archaic picture of the process of realizing the Supreme. The study of the Upanishads is ahstract. They deal with the Infinite. But the sages who give the teaching contained in them try by similes to relate these abstract truths with our life here. The aim of all our striving is the Absolute and Eternal : careful study of the Scriptures, constant practice of meditation, and untiring devotion serve as the means by which we attain it.
 
 In the next verse the teacher makes it still more definite. Om, the Logos or Word that was in the beginning, is taken as the bow, the soul of man is the arrow and the Infinite is the mark. To hit the mark 140 The Upanishads the mind must be wholly collected.
