Having a great weapon like a bow, and fixing an arrow sharpened by strong devotion, then drawing it with the mind focused on the Supreme, you can hit the target, gentle and immortal youth!

Om, the sacred word, is like the bow. The Atman, or Self, is the arrow. Brahman, the Supreme, is the target. Someone who is careful and in control of themselves should aim at this target. Just like the arrow becomes one with the target, that person will become one with the Supreme.

This is a poetic and old way of showing how to realize the Supreme. The Upanishads talk about very deep and endless ideas. The wise teachers use comparisons to connect these big ideas to our everyday life. Our goal is the Absolute and Eternal. Studying the scriptures carefully, practicing meditation often, and being devoted without giving up help us reach this goal.

In the next verse, the teacher explains more clearly. Om, the Word that existed at the beginning, is like the bow. The soul of a person is the arrow, and the Infinite is the target. To hit the target, the mind must be completely focused.
