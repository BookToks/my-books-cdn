The idea to translate the Upanishads into simple English started during a visit to a friend in Boston in 1909.

This friend was very sick and took a book of the Upanishads from his shelf. When he opened it, he was sad because the hard and strange language kept him from understanding the deep and important lessons inside.

Wanting to help people understand these old teachings, the translator began teaching classes about the Upanishads at The Vedanta Centre of Boston, which was then on St. Botolph Street.

The lessons and explanations from these classes were written down and, after careful editing, were published in the Centreâ€™s monthly magazine called "The Message of the East" in 1913 and 1914. More changes were made later to create the version we have now.
