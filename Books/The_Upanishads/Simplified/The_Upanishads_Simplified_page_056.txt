The Atman, or true Self, cannot be fully understood if it is taught by someone who doesn’t really get it. Even if you think about it a lot, you won’t truly know it unless a wise teacher explains it to you because it is very subtle and beyond regular thinking.

Hey, this Atman can’t be reached just by arguing or debating. You only understand it when a wise person teaches you. Nachiketas, you have understood it. You are steady in the truth. I hope we always find people like you who ask deep questions.

You can’t learn about the Atman from people who don’t truly understand it themselves. They often disagree with each other because they are not sure. Only someone who has experienced the Self directly, by growing spiritually, can explain what it really is. Their words matter and help others see clearly. The Atman is too subtle to be known by just thinking or arguing. This secret about life after death can only be known when your mind goes beyond normal reasoning.
