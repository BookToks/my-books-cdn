Ignorance and wisdom are very different and pull people in opposite directions. I think Nachiketas really wants to be wise because many tempting things did not distract him.

The ruler of Death begins teaching about what happens after life. There are two paths: one leads to God and the other to worldly fun. If someone follows one path, they move away from the other, like light and dark. One path leads to something spiritual and lasting; the other leads to things that don’t last. We face these choices every day. A smart person sees the difference and picks what is real and forever. Only that person reaches the highest goal. But a person who doesn’t understand chooses things that give quick happiness and misses the true meaning of life.

Even though Yama offered Nachiketas lots of tempting things to test him, Nachiketas saw their true value and said, “I came from the mortal world; I won’t ask for mortal things. I want what lasts forever.” Then Death said, “I see you really want the Truth. I offered you wealth, long life, and pleasure, but you showed you are worthy by turning them all down.”

People who live in ignorance but think they are smart just go around in circles, like blind people leading other blind people.
