A selfish person who only cares about their body and small, limited things can never reach a bigger, better life, no matter how much they want it. Someone might want to cross to the other side, but if they don’t lift the anchor, their boat won’t move.

The true Self cannot be found just by reading holy books, thinking hard, or listening to teachings a lot. Only the Self can choose who finds it. It shows its real nature only to that person.

This idea is also in the Katha-Upanishad and explained in detail there. Only someone with a pure and ready heart can understand the truth. So, we have to give ourselves fully before we can see higher truths.

The Self can’t be reached by someone who is weak, careless, or who tries without giving up selfish desires. But if a wise person works hard in the right way, their Self joins with the highest reality, Brahman.

The Upanishads often say that weak people can’t find the Truth. But this doesn’t just mean being physically weak.
