No matter why this name was picked, it was definitely chosen to show people who want to learn "approaching" a wise teacher living alone in a Himalayan forest. They wanted to learn from him the deepest truths about the universe and God.

These teachings usually happened in quiet, remote places where the noise of the world couldn’t disturb the peaceful life of thinking and learning. Because of this, they are also called Aranyakas, or Forest Books. Another reason for the name is that these lessons were meant especially for the Vdnaprasthas—people who finished all their duties in the world and moved to the forest to focus on spiritual study.

The teaching was usually done as a conversation, a way of talking later used by Plato and other Greek thinkers. Since nothing was written down and everything was passed on by word of mouth, the Upanishads are called Srutis, which means "what is heard."
