This is the truth. Just like many sparks fly out from a big fire, all living things come from the never-ending source and go back to it again.

Everything starts from the Supreme Being, and the goal of all life and effort is to be reunited with that Source. It might seem like life blocks us from seeing the connection between humans and the Divine, but sooner or later, every soul will remember it.

That glowing Being has no shape. He is everywhere and inside everything. He was never born, doesn’t breathe, and doesn’t have a mind. He is pure and higher than anything you can imagine.

This is how the Absolute, also called Nirgitna-Brahman in Vedic words, is described. The Absolute can’t be made or created, so He has no form. He is infinite and exists everywhere, so He is both inside and outside everything. Because of this, He doesn’t breathe or need a mind to think.
