SECOND MUNDAKA Part Jtrut i THIS is the truth. As from the blazing fire burst forth thousands of sparks like unto fire, so also, gentle youth, do the various beings spring forth from the Imperishable and return thither again.
 
 ALL things have their origin in the Supreme, and the ultimate aim of all life and effort is to be reunited with the Source. The play of manifestation may seem to block the consciousness of the underlying link between'the human and the Divine, but sooner or later all souls must regain that consciousness.
 
 II THAT effulgent Being is without form ; He exists both without and within He is un; born ; without breath and without mind ; pure, higher than the High Imperishable.
 
 HERE is given the definition of the Absolute, the Unconditioned, known in the Vedic terminology as Nirgitna-Brahinan. The Absolute cannot be created, therefore He must be without form because He ; is infinite, all-pervading, therefore He must be within and without all things. For the same reason He does Mundaka-Upanishad 135 not breathe, nor has He need of the instrument of mind for thought.
