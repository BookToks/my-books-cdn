The word "Sruti" also means something that was revealed. The Upanishads are seen as direct messages from God. The Smritis, which are smaller scriptures, were made by people and passed down by memory. It's important to know that the Upanishads never mention who wrote or recorded them.

We can’t say exactly when the Upanishads first came about because the written versions don’t show how old they really are. The word Sruti helps us understand this. The teachings probably existed long before they were ever written down. The texts even show this because sometimes, in talks between a teacher and a student, the teacher quotes from older scriptures that we don’t have anymore. 

As Professor Max Müller said in his talks about Vedanta Philosophy: "It feels like behind all these sudden ideas about religion and philosophy, there is a very old past we will never fully understand." Some experts think the Vedic period started as far back as 4000 or 5000 B.C.
