KATHA-UPANISHAD PEACE CHANT  
May the Supreme Being protect both the teacher and the student.  
May He be happy with us.  
May we become strong.  
May our learning bring us light and understanding.  
May there be no fighting between us.  

OM! PEACE! PEACE! PEACE!  

Once, a man named JFit0t wanted to get rewards in heaven by doing a special sacrifice called Viswajit.  
He gave away everything he had.  
He had a son named Nachiketas.  

When the gifts were being shared, faith came into Nachiketasâ€™s heart.  
Even though he was young, he thought carefully.  

The cows used in the sacrifice had drunk water, eaten grass, and given milk for the last time.  
Their senses were tired and weak now.
