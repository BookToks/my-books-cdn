The High Imperishable means the Creative Energy, also called Saguna Brahman, which is Brahman with qualities, or the personal God. Nirguna Brahman means Brahman without any qualities.

From Him come the life force, the mind, all the sense organs, and the elements: ether, air, fire, water, and the earth that supports everything.

His head is the sky, the sun and moon are His fiery eyes, the four directions are His ears, the Vedas are His words, His breath is the air, His heart is the universe, and the earth came from His feet. He is the inner Self of all living things.

From Him comes fire, which gets its fuel from the sun; clouds come from the moon and bring rain; all plants grow from the earth. The male puts seed into the female, and many beings are born from the Purusha, the Great Being.

From Him come the Rik, Saman, and Yajur Vedas, the initiation rites, all kinds of sacrifices, special ceremonies, gifts for priests, the right times for sacrifices, the sacrificer, and all the worlds that the moon blesses and the sun lights up.
