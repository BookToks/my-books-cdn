68 A DRIVER first needs to know the road really well. Then, he must learn how to control the reins and guide his horses. Only after this can he drive safely to where he wants to go.  

In the same way, in life, our mind and senses must be fully controlled by our higher thinking ability. Only when everything works together can we reach our goal—the place of Absolute Truth.  

The senses focus on things outside us. Beyond those things is the mind. Beyond the mind is the intellect, and beyond the intellect is the great Atman (the true self).  

The great Atman is the Unmanifested. Beyond the Unmanifested is the Purusha (the Cosmic Soul). Beyond the Purusha, there is nothing else. That is the final goal, the end.  

In these two verses, the Teacher explains how to use discrimination to understand the subtle Self. He starts with the senses and moves step by step to what is less obvious, until reaching the most subtle thing—the true Self of a person.  

The senses depend on things outside because without those things, the senses would have no purpose. Above the sense-objects is the mind, because those objects can only affect the senses if they first reach the mind.
