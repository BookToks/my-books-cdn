They were wholly independent. They did not seek pupils. On the contrary, they were very careful whom they taught. The pupil was obliged to prove his worthiness by humility, earnestness and patient service.
 
 IV THE Sage said to him : There are two kinds of knowledge to be known, so are we told by the knowers of Brahman, higher knowledge and lower knowledge.
 
 V LOWER knowledge consists of the RigVeda, Yajur-Veda, Sama-Veda, AtharvaVeda, phonetics, ceremonial, grammar, etymology, metre, astronomy. Higher knowledge is that by which the Imperishable is known.
 
 THE Upanishads make a clear distinction between secular knowledge (Afara) and knowledge born of direct vision (Para). Secular or lower knowledge not only includes astronomy, ceremonial, rhetoric and all branches of intellectual study, but even study of the Sacred Scriptures. Any knowledge which is acquired through study is classed as lower knowledge, because merely reading or hearing about Truth is not knowing Truth. The Aryan sages did not discredit the study of books, but they recognized that theoretical knowledge must always be inferior to knowledge based on direct experience.
