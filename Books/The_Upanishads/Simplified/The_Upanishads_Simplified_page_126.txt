They were completely independent. They didn’t try to find students. Instead, they were very careful about who they decided to teach. The student had to prove they were worthy by being humble, serious, and patient.

The Sage told him: There are two kinds of knowledge, as the people who understand Brahman say—higher knowledge and lower knowledge.

Lower knowledge includes things like the RigVeda, Yajur-Veda, Sama-Veda, AtharvaVeda, sounds, ceremonies, grammar, word origins, poetry, and astronomy. Higher knowledge is the kind that helps you understand something that never dies.

The Upanishads clearly separate everyday knowledge (called Apara) from knowledge gained by direct experience (called Para). Everyday or lower knowledge includes astronomy, ceremonies, speaking skills, and all kinds of intellectual studies—even the study of sacred books. Any knowledge you get just by reading or hearing is lower knowledge because just learning about Truth isn’t the same as truly knowing it. The Aryan sages didn’t think studying books was useless, but they believed that real knowledge comes from direct experience, which is always better than just theory.
