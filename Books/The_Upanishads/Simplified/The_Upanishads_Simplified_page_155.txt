154 The Upanishads XI  

A wise man named Angiras taught this truth a long time ago to Saunaka.  

You shouldn’t study this if you haven’t promised to give yourself fully and help others.  

Respect to the great teachers! Respect to the great teachers!  

Here ends the Mundaka-Upanishad.  

OM! PEACE! PEACE! PEACE!
