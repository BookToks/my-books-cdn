Here’s an example from the Mahabharata. Arjuna and his family were asked to join an archery contest. The target was the eye of a fish placed high on a pole.

Their teacher asked each person, "What do you see?" Everyone talked about the whole fish. But when Arjuna was asked, he said, "I see only the eye of the fish," and he was the only one who hit it.

If our mind is distracted or all over the place, we can’t focus or meditate. Without meditation, we can’t truly understand the eternal truth. When we do understand it, we become one with the highest power.

The person who knows God shares in His nature.

God holds the sky, the earth, the mind, and all the senses. Know that He is the true self in everyone, and stop wasting time on empty words. He is the way to live forever.

No life can exist without Him. When we realize this and see Him as the core of who we are, we stop caring so much about temporary things and don’t get caught up in useless knowledge. "Empty words" mean ideas or knowledge that make us proud but don’t help us find the ultimate truth. Knowing God helps us move from a temporary life to an eternal one.
