An illustration of this is given in the MahSbhSrata. Arjuna and hiskinsmen, it is told, were called to a contest in archery. The target was the eye of a fish raised on a high pole.
 
 Their teacher asked each one in turn, "What do you see?" They all described the whole fish. But when Arjuna was asked, he replied: "I see only the eye of the fish"; and he alone hit it. If our mind is divided or scattered we cannot meditate and without the ; power of meditation we cannot gain direct perception of the Imperishable. When we do gain this perception what happens? We become one with the Supreme.
 
 The knower of God partakes of His nature.
 
 V Him are fixed the heaven, the earth, the IN sky and the mind with all the senses. Know Him to be the Self of all, and abandon all vain words. He is the bridge to immortality.
 
 THERE can be no form of manifested life apart from Him. When we understand this and realize Him as the essence of our being, we lose attachment for mortal things and cease to lay so much stress on lower knowledge. "Vain words" here signifies theoretical speculation, book knowledge, everything in fact which fosters our egotism or pride and does not lead to ultimate Truth. Thus knowledge of God serves as the bridge over which we cross from the mortal tothe immortal.
