The next teaching is about the mind and the soul.

The mind is what helps a person get closer to Brahman (the ultimate reality). The seeker keeps remembering and thinking about Brahman again and again with their mind.

Only the mind can help someone find Brahman, who is very powerful and fast, like a flash of lightning. The mind can imagine Brahman even though He is hard to describe. Because the mind is quick, it can follow Brahman. With the mind’s help, we can think and meditate on Brahman. When the mind thinks about Him all the time, it becomes pure, like a clean mirror that can show His Divine Glory.

Brahman is called Tadvanam, which means the object of worship. He should be worshipped using this name. Anyone who truly knows Brahman is loved by everyone.

Brahman is what everyone wants and should be worshipped and thought about as Tadvanam. Those who understand Him become one with Him and become clear channels through which Brahman’s blessings flow to others. People who know God share His good qualities and are loved by all true followers.
