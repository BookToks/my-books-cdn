The person who can’t tell what’s right or wrong, or what’s real or fake, gets carried away by their wants and feelings. It’s like a driver losing control of wild horses.

But the person who knows what is truly good and doesn’t just chase quick fun can control their feelings. Their senses listen to them, just like good horses listen to their driver.

Someone without this kind of control and clear thinking has a messy mind and won’t reach their true goal. Instead, they keep going through the cycle of life and death.

But a person who has the right understanding and keeps their mind pure and controlled will reach that goal. Then, they won’t be born again.

A person with clear thinking and control over their mind finishes the journey and reaches the highest place with Vishnu, who is everywhere and never changes.
