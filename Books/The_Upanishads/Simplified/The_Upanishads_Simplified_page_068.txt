Katha-Upanishad 67 'T^HE man whose intellect is not discriminative and * who fails to distinguish right from wrong, the real from the unreal, is carried away by his sense passions and desires, just as a driver is carried away by vicious horses over which he has lost control. But he who clearly distinguishes what isgood from what ismerelypleasant, and controlsallhisout-goingforcesfromrunningafterapparent momentary- pleasures, his senses obey and serve him as good horses obey theirdriver.
 
 VII HE who does not possess discrimination, whose mind is uncontrolled and alwaysimpure, he does not reach thatgoal, but falls again into Samsdra (realm of birth and death).
 
 VIII BUT he who possesses right discrimination, whose mind is under control and always pure, he reaches that goal, from which he is not born again.
 
 IX THE man who has a discriminative intellect for the driver, and a controlled mind for the reins, reaches the end of the journey, the highest place of Vishnu (the All-pervading and Unchangeable One).
