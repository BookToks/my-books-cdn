FOREWORD A S the present edition of the Upanishads goes out to meet the need of aspiring students and thinkers in the field of philosophy, we offer a word of explanation. The first and second editions of this book contained the translation of three Upanishads namely, Isa, Katha and Kena to which we now add a fourth called Mundaka.
 
 The translator, Swami Paramananda, endowed with a rare gift of penetration, interpreted the Sanskrit text in clear, simple language. Admirers of his first volume requested him to translate other Upanishads in his characteristic manner, true to the original in spiritas well as in poetic form. The Swtmi was able to fulfill this wish in part. In 1920, he translated the Mundaka-Upanishad which was published in the Veda"nta Monthly, "Message of the East." Multiple activities prevented the continuance of the task.
 
 The Swami wrote a short introduction for the Isa, Katha and Kena Upanishads but Mundaka was published without his usual foreword.
 
 Knowing full well that an explanatory corn- mentary is necessary to answer some of the questions which invariably rise in the reader's mind, I have taken the liberty of writing one.
