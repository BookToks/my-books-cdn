FOREWORD

This new edition of the Upanishads is made for students and thinkers who want to learn about philosophy. The first two editions had translations of three Upanishads: Isa, Katha, and Kena. Now, we have added a fourth one called Mundaka.

Swami Paramananda, the translator, had a special talent for understanding difficult texts. He translated the Sanskrit into clear and simple English. People who liked his first book asked him to translate more Upanishads in the same way, keeping the original meaning and poetic style. The Swami was able to do this partly. In 1920, he translated the Mundaka Upanishad, which was published in a magazine called "Vedanta Monthly, Message of the East." But because he was very busy, he couldnâ€™t continue the work.

Swami Paramananda wrote a short introduction for the Isa, Katha, and Kena Upanishads, but the Mundaka Upanishad was published without his usual introduction.

I know that readers often have questions, so I have taken the freedom to write an explanation to help answer them.
