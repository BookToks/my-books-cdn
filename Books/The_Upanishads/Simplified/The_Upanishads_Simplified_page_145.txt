Two golden birds sit together on the same tree. One bird eats the tasty fruit, while the other just watches and doesn’t eat.

On this same tree, a person sits feeling sad and helpless. But when the person sees the other bird, which is proud and full of power, the sadness goes away.

The two birds stand for two parts of ourselves: the higher self and the lower self. The lower self focuses on enjoying or suffering from life’s ups and downs and thinks it can’t escape the results of its actions. But when it looks up to the higher self and sees how similar they are, it understands its true nature. The individual soul is just a reflection of the Supreme Soul. The person we seem to be comes from the real, deeper self. Once we realize this, these two parts become one. It’s our ego that makes us feel separate and causes us to feel empty. But when we find our connection to the endless Source, our selfish desires stop chasing after things, and we have no more reason to be sad.
