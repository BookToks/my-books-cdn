"Find out what this mystery is," he said. "Yes," he answered.

He ran towards it, and the Brahman asked him, "Who are you?" "I am Vayu, I am Matarisva, the traveler of Heaven," Vayu said.

Then the Brahman asked, "What power do you have?" Vayu replied, "I can blow away everything on earth." The Brahman put a straw in front of him and said, "Blow this away." Vayu rushed at it with all his speed but couldn’t blow it away. So he went back and told the Devas, "I couldn’t figure out what this great mystery is."

Then they said to Indra, "O Maghavan, Worshipful One!"
