People who follow only selfishness and pleasure without understanding anything deeper end up lost in darkness. But those who are proud of their knowledge and think they know it all fall into even deeper darkness because they waste a bigger chance.

Later, the ideas of knowledge and ignorance are used like "faith" and "actions" in the Christian Bible. Neither alone can lead to the ultimate goal, but when combined, they can take you to the highest point.

Doing work with a good and unselfish purpose cleans the mind and helps a person see their true, eternal self. From this, they naturally learn about God, because the Soul and God are one and can't be separated. When someone realizes they are part of the Supreme, unbreakable whole, they understand they are immortal.

People who worship the unseen, unknown God fall into darkness, and those who worship only what they can see fall into even deeper darkness.

Worshipping the unseen God leads to one kind of result, and worshipping the seen God leads to another. This is what wise people have taught us.
