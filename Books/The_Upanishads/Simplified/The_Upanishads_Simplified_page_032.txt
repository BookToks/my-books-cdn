Isa-Upanishad 31 ' I''HOSEwhofollowor"worship" thepathofselfishness and pleasure (Avidyd), without knowing anything higher, necessarily fall into darkness; but those who worship orcherish Vidyd (knowledge) formere intellectual pride and satisfaction, fall into greaterdarkness, because the opportunity which they misuse is greater.
 
 In the subsequent verses Vidyd and Avidyd are used in something the same sense as "faith" and "works" in the Christian Bible; neither alone can lead to the ultimate goal,butwhentakentogethertheycarryonetotheHighest.
 
 Work done with unselfish motive purifies the mind and enables man to perceive his undying nature. From this he gains inevitably a knowledge of God, because the Soul and God are one and inseparable; and when he knows himself to be one with the Supreme and Indestructible Whole, herealizeshisimmortality.
 
 XII THEY fall into blind darkness who worship the Unmanifested and they fall into greater darkness who worship the manifested.
 
 XIII BY the worship of the Unmanifested one end is attained; by the worship of the manifested, another. Thus we have heard from the wise men who taught us this.
