The face of Truth is hidden behind a golden disk. O Pushan (Bright Being)!

Please show Your face so I, who worship Truth, can see You.

O PUSHAN! O Sun, the only traveler in the sky, the ruler of everything, son of Prajapati, please pull back Your rays and gather Your bright light. Because of Your kindness, I can now see Your blessed and glorious form.

The bright Being who lives inside You, I am that Being.

Here, the sun, which gives all light, stands for the Infinite, the giver of all wisdom. The person seeking Truth asks the Bright One to control His shining rays, so their eyes wonâ€™t be blinded and they can see the Truth. After seeing it, they say: "Now I understand that the Bright Being and I are the same, and my confusion is gone." With the light of Truth, they can tell what is real and what is not. This knowledge shows them that they are one with the Supreme; there is no difference between themselves and the Supreme Truth. Like Christ said, "I and my Father are one."

MAY my life-breath join the all-around and eternal Prana, and let this body burn to ashes.
