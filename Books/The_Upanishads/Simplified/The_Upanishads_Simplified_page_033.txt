The person who understands both the Unmanifested (the cause of everything) and the visible, temporary world at the same time goes beyond death. They gain immortality by knowing the First Cause (Unmanifested) and understand the temporary world through knowledge of what can be destroyed.

This Upanishad mainly talks about the Invisible Cause and the visible world. It teaches that they are actually the same, with one coming from the other. So, you can’t have perfect knowledge without understanding both together.

Wise people say that if you only focus on the visible or only on the invisible, you won’t reach the highest goal. Only someone who understands both the visible and invisible, matter and spirit, and action and what’s behind action can beat Nature and overcome death.

By working hard, keeping the mind steady, and following the rules in the Scriptures, a person gains wisdom. With this wisdom, they can see the Invisible Cause in everything that can be seen.

So, a wise person sees God in every form. Those who truly understand God are never apart from Him. They live in God, and God lives in them.
