Because his mind and will are completely connected with the universe’s mind and will, he follows the law naturally and never messes up his duty.

This pure and shining Self lives inside the body and can be reached by people who are free from sin and fully dedicated to spirituality. They get there through being honest, controlling themselves, having true knowledge, and sticking to purity.

Only truth wins, not lies. Truth makes the spiritual path wider, and this is the path that wise people without desires take to reach the highest place of Truth.

That Self shines bright, is divine, and hard to imagine. It is even subtler than the tiniest thing and farther than anything far, yet it is right here inside the body. It lives deep in the heart, and true wise people can see it.

You can’t see it with your eyes or hear it with your ears, or find it through doing hard practices or good deeds. Only when the mind is pure and calm, with clear knowledge, can a wise person see the one unbreakable Brahman through meditation.
