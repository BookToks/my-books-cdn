126 The Upanishads VI THAT which cannot be seen, which cannot be seized, which has no origin and no attributes, no eyes nor ears, no hands nor feet ; That which is eternal, diversely manifesting, all-pervading, extremely subtle that Imperish; able One the wise regard as the Source of all created things.
 
 or higher knowledge is that which PARA-VIDYA cannot be perceived by the senses or by our ordinary faculties. It dawns in the soul only when senses, mind and intellect have become pacified and full of serenity. We do not gain ultimate realization until we have subdued the turbulence and unrest of our mind. At present the greater part of our effort at knowledge is physical. We wish to see with our eyes, grasp with our hands but through these channels we ; can gain only objective knowledge; while knowledge of God is subjective. This is evident from the definition of the Supreme given here. He is unconditioned and beyond the reach of our physical senses, our mind and intellect. To perceive Him we must cultivate another state of consciousness, which is done through the practice of meditation.
 
 VII AS the spider brings forth and draws in (its thread), as herbs spring from the earth, as hair grows on the living body, like- Mundaka-Upanishad 127 wise does the universe come forth from the Imperishable.
