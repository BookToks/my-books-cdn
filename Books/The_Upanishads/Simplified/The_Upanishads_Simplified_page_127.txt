126 The Upanishads VI  

That which you cannot see or catch, that has no beginning and no special features, no eyes or ears, no hands or feet;  

That which lasts forever, appears in many forms, is everywhere, and is very subtle and never dies; wise people think of this as the source of everything that exists.  

Higher knowledge, called PARA-VIDYA, cannot be understood by our senses or normal thinking. It only appears in the soul when our senses, mind, and thoughts become calm and peaceful.  

We cannot truly realize this knowledge until our mind stops being restless and chaotic. Right now, most of what we learn comes through physical means. We want to see things with our eyes or touch them with our hands, but this only gives us knowledge about things outside ourselves.  

Knowing God is differentâ€”it is personal and inside us. The Supreme Being is beyond all our senses, mind, and thinking. To understand Him, we need to reach a different state of mind, which we can do by practicing meditation.  

VII  

Just like a spider makes and pulls back its thread, like plants grow from the earth, and like hair grows on a living body, the universe comes out from the Imperishable.
