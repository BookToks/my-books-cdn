According to old Vedic beliefs, a guest is like a messenger from God and should be treated with respect and kindness. This is especially true for a Brahmana or Sannyasin, who dedicate their whole life to God. If someone doesn’t take good care of a holy guest, bad things can happen to them and their family.

When Yama came back, someone in his house told him nervously that Nachiketas was there and asked him to bring water to wash Nachiketas’ feet because this is the first thing you do for a guest.

Yama said, “O Brahmana! Honored guest! I greet you. Since you have stayed in my house for three nights without eating, you can choose three wishes, O Brahmana.”

Nachiketas said, “May my father, Gautama, not worry about me. May he stop being angry and feel peaceful. May he recognize and welcome me when you send me back. This is the first wish I choose, Death.”
