This text is called the Mantra-Upanishad because it is made up of verses that are like prayer-chants. People who study it say these Mantras are not meant for regular worship like the ones in the sacrificial parts of the Vedas.

This Upanishad focuses on how to gain Brahma-Vidya, which means knowledge of the Absolute or the ultimate truth. It asks, "What is the thing, Sir, that if you know it, you know everything else?" The wise person answers that to get the highest wisdom, you have to go beyond shallow knowledge. You canâ€™t reach this wisdom just by reading scriptures a little bit, doing religious rituals, or doing good deeds. Only someone who meditates and has purified themselves through careful thinking and giving up attachments can truly understand it.

The meaning of the title "Mundaka" is hard to figure out. The word literally means "shaven head." This might mean the author was a sage who shaved his head, or it might mean the Upanishad is stripped of all extra things, like a mind made clear by true knowledge.
