Yama now tells Nachiketas that by doing a special kind of sacrifice with three kinds of knowledge, he can overcome sadness and death and reach heaven. The three kinds of knowledge are about how to prepare the altar and the fire. 

Nachiketas was very eager to learn. He listened carefully and was able to repeat everything Yama told him. This made Yama very happy, so he gave Nachiketas an extra gift: the right to name the fire-sacrifice after himself and a garland decorated with precious stones.

Verses 16 to 18 are thought by many to be added later because they seem unclear and repeat some ideas.

Nachiketas said: I have a question about what happens to a person after death. Some say the person exists after death, others say they do not. I want to learn this from you. This is my third wish.

Yama replied: Even the gods of old were unsure about this. It is not easy to understand; this is a very deep topic. Nachiketas, please choose a different wish. Donâ€™t ask me this one.
