Part THE city of the Unborn, whose knowledge is unchanging, has eleven gates.
 
 Thinking on Him, man grieves no more; and being freed (from ignorance), he attains liberation. This verily is That.
 
 ' I AHIS human body is called a city with eleven gates, where the eternal unborn Spirit dwells. These gates are the two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth, the navel, the two lower apertures, and the imperceptible opening at the top of the head. The Self orAtman holds the position of ruler in this city; and being above the modificationsof birth, death and all human imperfections, It is not affected by the changes of the physical organism.
 
 As the intelligent man through constant thought and meditation realizes the splendor of this Supreme Spirit, hebecomes free from that part ofhisnature which grieves and suffers, and thus he attains liberation.
 
 II HE is the sun dwelling in the bright heaven; He is the air dwelling in space; He is the fire burning on the altar; He is the guest dwelling in the. house. He dwells in man. He dwells in those greater Katha-Upanishad 81 than man.
