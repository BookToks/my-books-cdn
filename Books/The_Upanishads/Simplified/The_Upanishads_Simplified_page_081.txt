The city of the Unborn, which has unchanging knowledge, has eleven gates.

When a person thinks about Him, they stop feeling sad; and by being free from not knowing, they reach freedom. This is really That.

This human body is called a city with eleven gates, where the eternal Spirit lives. These gates are the two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth, the navel, the two lower openings, and a tiny opening on top of the head. The Self or Atman is like the ruler of this city; it is above birth, death, and all human flaws, so it doesnâ€™t change when the body changes.

When a wise person keeps thinking and meditating on this great Spirit, they become free from the part of themselves that feels pain and sadness, and so they reach freedom.

He is like the sun in the bright sky; He is the air in space; He is the fire burning on the altar; He is the guest living in a house. He lives in people and also in things greater than people.
