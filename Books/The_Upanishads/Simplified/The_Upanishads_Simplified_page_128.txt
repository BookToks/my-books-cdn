VIII Tapas Brahman grows and spreads out; from this, food is made. From food come life energy, the mind, the elements, the worlds, good actions, and their endless results.

IX From the one who sees and knows everything, whose Tapas is wisdom, come Brahma (the Creator), names, shapes, and food.

Tapas means spiritual practice, like penance or self-discipline. The word Tapas literally means heat, because spiritual practice is like fire that burns away impurities. But here, this idea doesn’t really fit, since Brahman, the Supreme Lord, doesn’t need to be purified. Instead, it means the fire of wisdom, which spreads like a real fire. From this fire of wisdom in Brahman’s mind, first comes the power to create, and then everything in the material world appears.
