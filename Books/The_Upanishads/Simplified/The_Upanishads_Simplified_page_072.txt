The Ruler of Death shows us the deepest part of who we really are. Because it is very subtle, we can’t hear it, feel it, smell it, or taste it like normal things. It never dies and has no beginning or end.

It never changes. When someone understands this highest truth, they don’t have to fear death and can live forever. The Teacher slowly helped Nachiketas reach a point where he could learn the secret of death. The boy thought there was a place where he could live forever. But Yama explains that being immortal is a way of thinking, not about holding on to names, shapes, or things that can break.

What dies? The body. So the body dies, but not the part inside us. Even though it’s very hard to understand, wise people have tried to explain this inner Self or God inside us using stories and comparisons. They say it is beyond what the mind or words can explain; too subtle for normal senses, but can be seen by a pure mind.

The smart person who learns and tells the old story of Nachiketas, told by the Ruler of Death, is honored in the world of Brahman.
