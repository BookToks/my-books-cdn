V a man performs his sacrifice in the proper IF season and pours out his oblations on the shining flames, these oblations like the rays of the sun lead him to where the Supreme Lord of sacrifice dwells.
 
 VI COME hither! Come hither! the bright oblations say to the sacrificer and carry him by the rays of the sun while with pleasing ; words they praise him, saying: This is the heavenly Brahma-world (Svarga) which thou hast earned by thy good deeds.
 
 VII BUT all these sacrifices (performed by) eighteen are inferior and ephemeral. The ignorant who regard them as the highest good and delight in them, again and again come under the dominion of old age and death.
 
 IN the sacrifices sixteen priests were supposed to take part, together with the sacrificer and his wife, making up the eighteen mentioned in the verse. According to Vedic injunctions no householder's sacri- Mundaka-Upanishad 131 fice was fruitful unless his wife took part in it with him.
