If a man does his sacrifice at the right time and pours his offerings into the bright flames, these offerings, like sun rays, help him reach the place where the Supreme Lord of sacrifice lives.

The bright offerings call out, "Come here! Come here!" and carry the sacrificer on the sun’s rays. They praise him with nice words, saying, "This is the heavenly Brahma-world (Svarga) that you earned by doing good deeds."

But all these sacrifices done by eighteen people are not the best and only last for a short time. People who don’t understand this and think these sacrifices are the greatest good keep getting trapped by old age and death again and again.

In these sacrifices, sixteen priests took part, along with the man doing the sacrifice and his wife, making eighteen people total. According to Vedic rules, a householder’s sacrifice wasn’t successful unless his wife joined him in it.
