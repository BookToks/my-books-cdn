If a person keeps wanting to live a long time and hold on to things, they can’t follow the path of knowing their true self, as taught in the first lesson. Instead, they can follow the path of doing the right things. Here, doing the right things means acting without being selfish, just for God.

When someone does things only to satisfy their own wants, those actions trap them in a cycle of confusion and rebirth. But if they do the same actions while giving themselves to God, those actions help clean their soul and set them free.

After death, people who have ignored their true self go to dark places full of ignorance, called the worlds of the Asuras.

Many religions believe that good people go to bright places and bad people go to dark places after death.

But Vedanta says these places are only temporary because our actions can only cause temporary results.

What does it mean to “kill the Self?” The soul can’t be destroyed because it never dies. It can only be hidden. People who live in ignorance, only caring about their body and ignoring their true soul, can’t see the bright, eternal nature of their soul. That’s why they end up where the soul’s light doesn’t shine.

This Upanishad teaches that the real hell is not knowing. As long as someone is trapped in ignorance, they are controlled by nature and must face the results of their thoughts and actions.
