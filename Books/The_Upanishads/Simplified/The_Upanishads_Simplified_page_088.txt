From fear of Him, the fire burns. From fear of Him, the sun shines. Because of fear of Him, Indra, Vayu, and Death all move quickly.

Just like the body can’t live or do anything without the Soul, nothing in the world can exist without Brahman, who is the source of everything.

He is like a king that everyone must obey. That’s why the gods of the sun, moon, wind, and rain follow His orders. He is like a raised thunderbolt because His rules are fair and must be followed by all powers, big or small.

A person can’t truly know Him before their body dies. Then, the person is born again in the world.

As soon as someone understands the Supreme, they are free. But if they don’t learn this before their soul leaves the body, they have to live many lives, coming back again and again. Through these experiences, they finally understand the Supreme and their connection to Him.
