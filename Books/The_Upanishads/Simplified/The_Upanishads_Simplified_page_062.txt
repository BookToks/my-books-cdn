Even when it’s sitting still, it can travel far; even when it’s lying down, it can go everywhere. The only one who truly understands God is the one who knows that God is both full of joy and without joy.

The Self is everywhere, so it is the one who sits still and the one who moves, the one who does things and the one who does nothing. It is both still and moving, and it is the reason everything exists. So, everything in the universe—whether happy or sad, pain or pleasure—comes from the Self. Who can know God better than me, since God lives in my heart and is the core of who I am? This is how someone seeking the truth should think.

Wise people who understand the Self know that the Soul has no body but lives inside bodies that don’t last. The Soul is great and everywhere, so they don’t feel sad.

When a wise person clearly sees the difference between the body and the Soul, they know their true Self isn’t the body, even though it lives in the body. Realizing that the true Self is forever and everywhere, they overcome fear of death or losing anything, and even the biggest sadness doesn’t affect them.
