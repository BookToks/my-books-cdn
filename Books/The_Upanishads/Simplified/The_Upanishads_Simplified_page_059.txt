Tachiketas said: Tell me about the thing you see that is not good or bad, not a cause or effect, not in the past or future, but beyond all these.

Yama replied: That goal is what all the Vedas praise and what all hard practices aim for. People who want it live a pure and disciplined life. That goal is called Aum.

But how can someone name God? The infinite can’t be limited by any word. Language can only explain things that are limited because language itself is limited.

Still, it’s hard for people to think or talk about something without giving it a name. Knowing this, the wise gave the Supreme the name A-U-M, which is the root of all language. The first letter "A" is the natural sound everyone makes when opening their throat. The last letter "M" is made by closing the lips, ending the sound. Between these two, the sound "U" is made as the breath moves from the throat to the lips. 

These three sounds cover all possible spoken sounds. Together, they form Akshara, the unchanging word, the Sound-Brahman or Word-God. It’s the most universal name for the Supreme.
