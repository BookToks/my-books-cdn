The student had listened to the teacher carefully and believed what he said, but now he needed to find out for himself if it was true.

With the teacher’s help, he looked inside himself through meditation to understand what Brahman really means. After seeing things in a new way, he went back to the teacher.

The student said: I’m not sure if I really know it or if I don’t know it. Someone who truly knows understands both what it means to say "I know" and "I don’t know." This sounds confusing, but it’s not. In the last chapter, we learned that Brahman is beyond what we can know or not know. The student realized this and said: "From a normal point of view, I don’t think I know it because it’s beyond what our mind and words can explain. But from a higher point of view, I can’t say I don’t know it either, because the fact that I exist and can search for it means I do know it. It’s the source of my being. Still, I don’t know it like knowing the whole endless ocean of existence." 

Usually, the word knowledge means knowing just things we can see or experience. But people need to go beyond this kind of knowledge to really understand God. To become aware of your true self, you must rise above the physical world.
