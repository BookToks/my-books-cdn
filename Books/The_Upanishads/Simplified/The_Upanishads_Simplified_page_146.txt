When the sun sees the Being full of golden light, the Creator, the Lord, and the Source of all creative power, the person who understands this, after giving up all sin and good deeds, and becoming pure, reaches the highest unity with the Supreme.

In the Indo-Aryan idea, sin is like an iron chain, and good deeds are like a golden chain. Both chains can trap us because of pride and wanting fame. To reach the ultimate union, a person must go beyond thinking about sin and good deeds.

He is the life force that moves all living things. The one who knows this is truly wise and not just someone who talks a lot. He enjoys his inner self, finds his greatest happiness there, and truly does his duties. He is truly the greatest knower of the Supreme.

When a person sees God, he gains real wisdom and stops caring about useless arguments and questions. His happiness and peace are found in the Infinite.
