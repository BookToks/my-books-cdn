Some parts of the Upanishads come from between 2000 and 1400 B.C. But even the most careful experts agree that they are much older than the Buddhist teachings, which started in the sixth century B.C.

The Upanishads are important not because they are old, but because they have a powerful message for everyone, no matter when or where they live. Their lessons are not just for one group of people or place. The ideas in these scriptures are just as useful today as they were for the early Indo-Aryans long ago. Their teachings can be summed up in two big sayings: "Tat twam asi" (That thou art) and "Aham Brahmasmi" (I am Brahman).

The idea that the Soul and God are one is the main point of all Vedic thinking. This idea of the unity of all life and the oneness of Truth makes studying the Upanishads really helpful right now.

A famous European expert said: "If we focus on this basic idea from the Vedanta system—that God and the Soul, Brahman and Atman, are the same—it has a meaning that goes way beyond the Upanishads, their time, and their place. We believe it is extremely valuable for all people everywhere."
