More than ten years ago, I was lucky to study the Upanishads in the original Sanskrit with Swami Paramananda. He, like a true wise teacher, taught me the main ideas of these deep teachings in a way known to those from the land where the Forest-books began. The experience was more than just learning the words or their meaning. It was like feeling the light that flows from the teacher’s mind to a student who wants to learn.

This was the start of a new chapter in my life because soon after, I was officially given permission to teach Vedanta from the Swami’s platform. The first classes about the Upanishads were held outside under the open sky at Ananda Ashrama, California. My first talk was called "Exaltation of the Upanishads." 

By spending a lot of time with someone truly wise, whose knowledge was only a cover for his deep understanding, and who made the words of the Scriptures come alive by his example, I now hope that one day I can finish the work he started. As his student and follower, I humbly pray for this chance.
