Even though the ideas had to pass through two very different languages, their meaning was still very clear and powerful. Schopenhauer said strong words about the Upanishads, calling them full of the holy spirit of the Vedas. He said that anyone who studies this amazing book carefully will feel its deep spirit in their soul. Every sentence has deep, original, and important thoughts, and the whole book is filled with a serious and sacred feeling.

He also said that being able to understand the Vedas through the Upanishads is the greatest gift this young century (1818) has compared to all the earlier centuries. 

An American thinker named Thoreau agreed with this. He said that what he read from the Vedas felt like a bright and pure light, showing a higher and clearer way of thinking that is simple and universal.

The first English translation of the Upanishads was done by a smart Hindu named Raja Ram Mohun Roy, who lived from 1775 to 1833.
