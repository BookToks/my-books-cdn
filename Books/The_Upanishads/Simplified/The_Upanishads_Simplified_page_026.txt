OM! That (the Invisible-Absolute) is complete; this (the visible world) is complete; the visible world comes from the Invisible Whole. Even though the visible world comes from the Invisible Whole, the Whole stays the same.

OM! PEACE! PEACE! PEACE!

The word "That" is used in the Upanishads to mean the Invisible-Absolute because no word or name can fully explain It. Things like tables or trees can be described, but God, who has no limits, cannot be described by normal words. So, the wise people called Rishis used the word "That" to talk about the Absolute without limiting It.

When you truly understand, the visible world and the Absolute cannot be separated. Everything that exists is part of the Absolute, and whatever exists must be inside It. So, all the things we see are just different forms of the One Supreme Whole, and they donâ€™t add to or take away from It. The Whole always stays the same.
