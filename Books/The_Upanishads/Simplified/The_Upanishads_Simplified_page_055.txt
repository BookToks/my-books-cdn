When a person realizes that their true self never dies and is connected to God, they can overcome death.

There is someone about whom many people have never even heard, and many don’t understand him even after hearing about him. He is an amazing teacher, and those who learn from a good teacher are lucky.

In the Vedic Scriptures, it says that no one can teach spiritual knowledge unless they truly realize it themselves. What does realization mean? It means knowing something by seeing or experiencing it directly. In India, many of the best teachers don’t have formal education, but their good character helps others learn just by being around them.

One story tells about a young teacher sitting under a banyan tree with his student who had many questions and doubts. The teacher stayed silent, but slowly the student’s doubts disappeared. This shows that teaching spiritual truth isn’t just about words. It’s about the teacher’s life and wisdom shining through.

These God-enlightened teachers are rare, and even with a great teacher, a student can only learn if their heart is open and ready to accept the truth.

That’s why Yama says both the teacher and the student must be special.
