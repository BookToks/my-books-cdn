When a man can identify himself with his undying nature, which is one with God, then he overcomes death.
 
 VII HE about whom many are not even able to hear, whom many cannot comprehend even after hearing: wonderful is the teacher, wonderful is he who can receive when taught by an able teacher.
 
 '-pHROUGHOUT the Vedic Scriptures it is declared * that no one can impart spiritual knowledge unless he has realization. What is meant by realization? It means knowledge based on direct perception. In India oftenthebestteachershavenolearning,buttheircharacter is so shining that every one learns merely by coming in contact with them. In one of the Scriptures we read: Under a banyan tree sat a youthful teacher and beside himanaged disciple. The mind of the disciplewasfullof doubts and questions, but although the teacher continued silent, gradually every doubt vanished from the disciple's mind. This signifies that theconveyingof spiritual teaching does not depend upon words only. It is the life, the illumination, which counts. Such God-enlightened men, however, cannot easily be found; but even with such a teacher, theknowledgeof the Self cannot begained unless the heart of the disciple is open and ready for the Truth.
 
 Hence Yama says both teacher and taught must be wonderful.
