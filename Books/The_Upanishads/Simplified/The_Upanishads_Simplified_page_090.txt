In the Katha-Upanishad, it says that the mind is higher than the senses. Higher than the mind is the intellect. Above the intellect is the great Atman (the inner self). Higher than the Atman is the Unmanifested.

The Unmanifested is the all-pervading and invisible Being called Purusha. When someone understands Him, they become free and live forever.

This idea divides a person into senses, mind, intellect, self-awareness, creative energy, and the Absolute Self, and it is explained more in another part.

His form cannot be seen. No one can see Him with their eyes. He is understood by the heart, intellect, and mind. People who know this become immortal.

Because the Supreme is formless, it can’t be known through the senses. So, knowing Him comes from using the deeper parts of ourselves—heart, intellect, and mind—which grow stronger through meditation and self-purification.
