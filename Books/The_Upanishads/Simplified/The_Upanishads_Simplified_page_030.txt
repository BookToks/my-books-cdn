The Isa-Upanishad 29 TT is easy to understand for those who have the ability to get it because it lives in everyone's heart. But it seems far away to people whose minds are covered by desires and confusion. It is inside us because it is the deepest soul in all creatures, and it is also outside as the spirit that fills the whole universe like air.

 

He who sees all living things in himself and himself in all living things never turns away from this Self.

 

He who sees all beings as the Self canâ€™t be confused or sad because he understands that everything is connected.

 

A person who sees the Self everywhere never fears anything because he feels connected to all life. When someone sees God in all living things, and all living things in God, and also God inside their own soul, how can they hate anyone? Sadness and confusion come from thinking everything is separate, which causes fights and selfishness. When we realize everything is one, feelings of separation go away and so does the cause of pain.
