Isa-Upanishad 29 TT isnear to those whohave thepower tounderstand It, for It dwells in the heart of every one; but It seems fartothosewhosemindiscoveredbythecloudsofsensualityand self-delusion.

 VI HE who sees all beings in the Self and the Self in all beings, he never turns away from It (the Self).
 
 VII HE who perceives all beings as the Self, for him how can there be delusion or grief, when he sees this oneness (everywhere)?
 
 1LJE who perceives the Self everywhere never shrinks fromanything, because through hishigherconsciousness he feels united with all life. Whena man sees God in all beings and all beings in God, and also God dwelling in his own Soul, how can he hate any living thing? Grief anddelusion rest upon a beliefindiversity, which leads to competitionandall formsofselfishness. Withtherealization of oneness, the sense of diversity vanishes and the cause ofmiseryisremoved.
