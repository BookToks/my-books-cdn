What you see here in the world is the same as what is invisible. If someone thinks they are different, they keep going through suffering again and again.

You can understand this only with your mind.

There is no real difference between what you can see and what you cannot. If you think they are different, you keep facing problems over and over.

True wisdom shows that the creator and what is created are not separate. Even science says cause and effect are just two sides of the same thing. If you only focus on what you see, you keep getting hurt because you hold on to things that don’t last. Only the inner part of you is forever.

This understanding can’t come from just using your senses. You need a clear and pure mind to realize it.

The Self, which is as small as your thumb, lives in the middle of your body and controls your past and future. If you know this, you don’t have to be afraid anymore.
