So, this Word has been around "from the very beginning" and matches the idea of the Logos in Christian beliefs. Because this name is super important, it’s used a lot in the Vedic Scriptures to talk about the Absolute.

This Word is actually Brahman. This Word is the highest power. Anyone who understands this Word can get whatever they want.

This is the best support, the highest support; anyone who knows this support is honored in the world of Brahman.

This sacred Word is the top symbol of the Absolute. If someone thinks deeply about it and truly understands it, they see God’s glory and get all their wishes fulfilled because God is the answer to every desire.

This Self was never born and will never die.

It didn’t come from anything, and nothing came from it. This Ancient One is unborn, eternal, and forever. Even if the body dies, it can’t be killed.
