There are two parts inside us that enjoy the results of our good actions. They live deep in our hearts, sitting at the highest place. People who understand Brahman call these two parts shadow and light. People who do special fire rituals also call them by these names.

These two parts mean the Higher Self and the lower self. Both live deep inside our hearts.

Truth seekers and people who do rituals to get rewards say that the Higher Self is like light and the lower self is like a shadow.

When the truth becomes clear inside someoneâ€™s heart, they realize that their two natures are really one. They understand that everything outside is just a reflection of that One.

May we learn the Nachiketa fire-sacrifice, which helps those who perform it. May we also know the One, the highest and unchanging Brahman, who helps us cross to the other side beyond fear.
