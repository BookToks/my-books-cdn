Nachiketas, don’t ask about death.

The third wish Nachiketas asked about was something only people who have no selfish desires and limits can understand. So, Yama tested Nachiketas to see if he was ready. "Don’t push me for this secret," Yama said. "Even smart people don’t get it, and you’re just a kid. Instead, take a long life, money, or anything that makes you happy now." But Nachiketas showed he was strong and ready by staying determined to learn the big secret about life and death.

Nachiketas said: Death and life are short and make our senses weak. Even the longest life is still short. Keep your chariots, dancing, and music.

People can’t be happy just with money.

Why want money if we all have to face death? Can we live forever while death is in charge? So, I want only that truth as my wish.
