XII There is one ruler, the Self inside all living things, who makes one form into many. The smart people who understand that this Self is inside them find true happiness forever. Others do not.

XIII This Self is always aware and never changes. Even though it is one, it can fulfill many different wishes. The wise who see this Self inside themselves find true peace that lasts forever. Others do not.

XIV The wise feel the highest kind of happiness and say, "This is it." They wonder, "How can I really know it? Does it shine by itself, or does it shine because of something else?"
