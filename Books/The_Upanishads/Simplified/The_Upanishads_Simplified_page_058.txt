A mortal, after hearing and fully understanding this, and realizing the deep Self by careful thinking, feels happy because he has found the source of all joy. I believe the place of Truth is open to Nachiketas.

The Scriptures say there are three steps in all spiritual progress. First, a person must hear about the Truth from a wise teacher. Next, they must think deeply about what they have heard. Then, by practicing careful thinking and meditation often, they realize the Truth.

When this happens, all their wishes come true because they connect with the source of everything. After seeing this, a person understands that all pleasures from the senses are just small copies of the greatest joy, which is found only in the true Self.

Yama tells Nachiketas that there is no doubt he will realize the Truth because he has shown the best understanding and strong determination.
