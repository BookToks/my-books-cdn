The Upanishads say that you can see God inside yourself, just like you see your face in a mirror. You can also find God in dreams, in the world of spirits, and in the angelic realm, like seeing reflections in water. Just like light and shadow, God is also present in the world of the Creator, Brahma.

By having a clear and pure mind, you can see God inside you clearly, like looking into a clean mirror. But you can’t fully understand God by just going to different heavenly places where good deeds are rewarded. True understanding of God comes from raising your highest awareness while you’re alive.

The senses are separate from your true self, called the Atman, and they come and go. A wise person knows this and doesn’t get upset.

A wise person never mixes up the Atman, which has no beginning or end, with things that are born and die. So, when they see their body and senses changing, they understand that their real self inside stays the same and doesn’t get affected, so they stay calm.
