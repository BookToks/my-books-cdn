There are 101 nerves connected to the heart. One of these goes up to the center of the head. If you follow this one nerve upward, you can reach immortality. The other 100 nerves lead to different worlds when you leave your body.

The body's nervous system is like a path for the mind to travel. Where the mind goes depends on what it wants and likes.

If the mind becomes pure and has no desires, it moves upward and leaves the body through a tiny opening at the top of the head. But if the mind is still full of desires, it moves downward to places where those desires can be fulfilled.

The Purusha, which is the inner Self, is as small as a thumb and sits in the heart of every living being. People should try to bring it out from their body with steady effort, like pulling the inner part out of a blade of grass.

You should understand the inner Self as pure and never dying.

As explained before, the inner Self is unlimited but is called "the size of a thumb" because it stays in the heart. The heart is often compared to a lotus bud, which is about the same size and shape as a thumb.
