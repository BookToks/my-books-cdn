Sometimes, the best way to explain an idea is by comparing it to something else. That’s why great teachers often use stories or examples to help us understand.

Here, the Ruler of Death stands for the Self, which is like the boss of your body. Your intellect, or thinking part, is the driver who controls the wild horses, which are your senses, by holding the reins of your mind. The roads these horses travel on are all the things outside that attract or push away your senses. For example, your sense of smell follows sweet smells, and your sense of sight follows beautiful things.

Each sense, if not controlled by the thinking part, tries to go after its favorite things. When the Self is combined with the body, mind, and senses, it becomes the smart person who wants, feels, notices, and does everything.

If someone can’t think clearly and their mind is wild, their senses are like bad horses that can’t be controlled.

But if someone thinks clearly and controls their mind, their senses are like good horses that listen and behave.
