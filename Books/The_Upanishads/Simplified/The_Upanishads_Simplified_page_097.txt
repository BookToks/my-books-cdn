It is also called the Talavakdra-Upanishad because it is a chapter in the Talavakdra-Brdhmana of the Sdma-Veda.

Among the Upanishads, it is one of the most deep and thoughtful. Its goal is to help the mind move from what is obvious to what is hidden, from effects to causes.

Through a series of important questions and answers, it tries to find the source of a person's existence. It also helps a person grow their self-awareness until it becomes the same as Godâ€™s awareness.
