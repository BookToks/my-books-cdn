You can't find the Self just by reading books, thinking hard, or listening a lot. The Self chooses the person, and only then can it be reached. When that happens, the Self shows its true self.

We might think that studying a lot can help us find God, but just hearing about something or understanding it with your mind doesn’t mean you truly know it. Real knowledge comes from seeing or feeling it directly, and only people who are pure and spiritually awake can do this. God is the same for everyone and kind to all, but people who are not pure or who only care about the world don’t get this blessing because they don’t know how to open their hearts. God chooses those who really want Him and only shows His true self to them.

A person who still does bad things, can’t control their senses, isn’t calm, and whose mind is always restless can never reach the Self, even if they learn a lot.
