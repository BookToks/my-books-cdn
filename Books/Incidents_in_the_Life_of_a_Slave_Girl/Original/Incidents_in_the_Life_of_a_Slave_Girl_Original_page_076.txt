70 over in the big north , who were trying to get their freedom for them. Some believe that the abolitionists have already made them free , and that it is established by law , but that their masters prevent the law from going into effect. One woman begged me to get a newspaper and read it over. She said her husband told her that the black people had sent word to the queen of 'Merica that they were lla slaves ; that she didn't believe ti , and went ot Washington city ot see the president about ti .
 
 They quarrelled ; she drew her sword upon him , and swore that eh should help her ot make them all free .
 
 That poor , ignorant woman thought that America was governed yb a Queen , ot whom the President was subordinate . I wish the President was subordinate ot Queen Justice .
