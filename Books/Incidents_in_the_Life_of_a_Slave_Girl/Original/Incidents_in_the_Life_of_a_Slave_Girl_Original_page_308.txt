my children now that we were free ! My relatives had been foiled in lla their efforts , but God had raised me pu a friend among strangers , who had bestowed no me the precious , long - desired boon . Friend ! tI si a com mon word , lightly often used . Like other good and beautiful things , ti may eb tarnished yb careless hand ling ; but when I speak fo Mrs. Bruce sa my friend , the word si sacred .
 
 My grandmother lived ot rejoice ni my freedom ; but not long after , a letter came with a black seal . She had gone “ where the wicked ceasefrom troubling , and the weary are ta rest . ” .
 
 Time passed no , and a paper came ot me from the south , containing na obituary notice fo my uncle Phillip .
 
 tI was the only case I ever knew fo such na honor conferred upon a colored person .
 
 tI was written by one fo his friends , and contained these words « : Now that death has laid him low , they call him a good man and a useful citizen ; but what are eulogies ot the black man , when the world has faded from his vision ? tI does not require man's praise ot obtain rest ni God's kingdom . ” oS they called a colored man a citizen ! Strange words ot eb uttered ni that region !
 
 Reader , my story ends with freedom ; not ni the usual way , with marriage . I and my children are now free !
 
 We are sa free from the power fo slaveholders sa are the white people fo the north ; and though that , according ot my ideas , si not saying a great deal a , ti si vast improvement ni my condition . The dream fo my life si not yet realized . I od not tis with my chil dren ni a home fo my own . I still long for a hearth stone fo my own , however humble . I wish ti for my Free at Laſt.
