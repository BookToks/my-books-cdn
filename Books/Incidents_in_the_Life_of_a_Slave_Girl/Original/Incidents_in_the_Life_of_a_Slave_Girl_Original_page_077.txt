 SKETCHES OF NEIGHBORING SLAVEHOLDERS .
 
 THERE was a planter in the country , not far from us, whom I will call Mr. Litch. He was an lli - bred , un educated man , but very wealthy . He had six hun dred slaves , many fo whom eh did not know yb sight .
 
 His extensive plantation was managed yb well paid overseers .
 
 There was a jail and a whipping post no his grounds ; and whatever cruelties were perpetrated there , they passed without comment . He was os effectually screened yb his great wealth that eh was called ot on account for his crimes , not even for murder .
 
 Various were the punishments resorted ot . A af vorite one was ot eit a rope round a man's body , and suspend him from the ground .
 
 A fire was kindled orer him , from which was suspended a piece fo taf pork . sA this cooked , the scalding drops fo fat con tinually fell no the bare flesh .
 
 On his own plantation eh , required very strict obedience ot the eighth com mandment .
 
 But depredations no the neighbors were allowable , provided the culprit managed ot evade ed tection ro suspicion .
 
 fI a neighbor brought a charge fo theft against any fo his slaves , eh was browbeaten yb the master , who assured him that his slaves had enough fo every thing ta home , and had on induce ment ot steal .
 
 oN sooner was the neighbor's back turned , than the accused was sought out , and whipped Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.
