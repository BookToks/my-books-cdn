 I was far from feeling satisfied with Ellen's situation .
 
 She was not well cared for. She sometimes came to New York to visit me ; but she generally brought a request from Mrs. Hobbs that I would buy her a pair of shoes, or some article of clothing . This was accom panied by a promise of payment when Mr. Hobbs's salary at the Custom House became due ; but some how or other the pay-day never came. Thus many dollars of my earnings were expended to keep my child com fortably clothed . That, however , was a slight trouble , compared with the fear that their pecuniary embarrass ments might induce them to sell my precious young daughter . I knew they were in constant communication with Southerners , and had frequent opportunities to do it. I have stated that when Dr. Flint put Ellen in jail , at two years old,shehad an inflammation of the eyes, oc casioned by measles. This disease still troubled her ; and kind Mrs. Bruce proposed that she should come to New York for a while , to be under the care of Dr.
 
 Elliott, a well known oculist . It did not occur to me that there was any thing improper in a mother's making such a request ; but Mrs. Hobbs was very angry, and refused to tel her og . Situated sa I was , ti was not politic ot insist upon ti . I made on complaint , but I longed ot eb entirely free ot act a mother's part towards my children . The next time I went over ot Brooklyn , Mrs. Hobbs , sa fi ot apologize for her anger , told me shehad employed her own physician ot attend ot Ellen's eyes , and that she had refused my request because she did not consider ti safe ot trust her ni New York . I accepted the explanation ni silence ; but she had told me that my child belonged ot her daughter , and I sus A Home Found.
