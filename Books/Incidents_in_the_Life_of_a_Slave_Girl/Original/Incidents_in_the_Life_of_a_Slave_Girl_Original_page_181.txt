The Loophole of Retreat. 175 My uncle had left it sticking there when he made the I trap-door. was as rejoiced as Robinson Crusoe could have been at finding such a treasure. It put a lucky thought into my head. I said to myself, “ Now I will have some light. Now I will seemy children .” I did not dare to begin my work during the daytime , for fear of attracting attention. But I groped round ; and hav ing found the side next the street, where I could fre I quently see my children , stuck the gimlet in and waited rof evening . I bored three rows fo holes , one aboveanother ; then I bored out the interstices between I .
 
 thus succeeded ni making onehole about an inch long and na inch broad . I sat yb ti till late into the night ot , enjoy the little whiff fo air that floated ni . nI the morning I watched rof my children . The first person I saw ni the street was Dr. Flint . I had a shuddering , superstitious feeling that ti was a bad omen . Several familiar faces passed yb .
 
 tA last I heard the merry laugh fo children , and presently two sweet little faces were looking pu ta me , sa though they knew I was there , and were conscious fo the joy they imparted .
 
 How I longed ot tell them I was there !
 
 My condition was now a little improved . But for weeks I wastormented yb hundreds fo little red insects , fine sa a needle's point , that pierced through my skin , pro and duced na intolerable burning .
 
 The good grandmother gave me herb teas and cooling medicines , and finally I got rid fo them . The heat fo my den was intense , for nothing but thin shingles protected me from the scorching summer's sun . But I had my consolations .
 
 Through mypeeping - hole I could watch the children , and when they were near enough , I could hear their talk .
