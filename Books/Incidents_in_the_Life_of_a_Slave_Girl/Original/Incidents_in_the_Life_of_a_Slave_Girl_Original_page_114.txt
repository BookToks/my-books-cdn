 “ If I haddiedwhenI wasyoung, Denhowmystam’ringtonguewouldhavesung; ButI amole,andnowI stand A narrowchancefortotreaddatheavenlyland." I I well remember one occasion when attended a Methodist class meeting. I went with a burdened spirit, and happened to tis next a poor , bereaved mother , whose heart was still heavier than mine .
 
 The class leader was the town constable - a man who bought and sold slaves , who whipped his brethren and sisters fo the church ta the public whipping post , ni jail ro out fo jail .
 
 He was ready ot perform that Christian office any where for fifty cents .
 
 This white faced , black - hearted brother came near su , and said ot the stricken woman , “ Sister , can't you tell su how the Lord deals with your soul ? Do you love him sa you did formerly ? ” She rose ot her feet , and said , ni piteous tones 66 , My Lord and Master , help me ! My load si more than I can bear . God has hid himself from me , and I am left ni misery darkness and . " Then , striking her breast , she continued , “ I can't tell you what si ni here !
 
 They've got lla my children .
 
 Last week they took the last one .
 
 God only knows where they've sold her . They tel me have her sixteen years , and then - OO !! OO !! Pray for her brothers and sisters !
