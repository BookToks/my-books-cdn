I had also a great treasure in my maternal grandmother , who was a remarkable woman in many respects. She was the daughter of a planter in South Carolina , who , at his death, left her mother and his three children free, with money to go to .tS Augustine , where they had relatives . tI was during the Revolutionary War ; and they were captured no their passage , carried back , and sold ot different purchasers .
 
 Such was the story my grandmother used ot tell me , but I od not remember lla the particulars .
 
 She was a little girl when she was captured and sold ot the keeper fo a large hotel . I have often heard her tell how hard she fared during childhood .
 
 But sa she grew older she evinced os much intelligence , and was os faithful , that her master and mistress could not help seeing ti was for their interest ot take care fo such a valuable piece fo prop erty . She became na indispensable personage ni the household , officiating ni lla capacities , from cook and wet nurse ot seamstress . She was much praised for her cooking ; and her nice crackers became os famous ni the neighborhood that many people were desirous fo obtaining them .
 
 nI consequence fo numerous re quests fo this kind , she asked permission fo her mis tress ot bake crackers ta night , after lla the household work was done ; and she obtained leave ot od ti , pro vided she would clothe herself and her children from the profits . Upon these terms , after working hard lla day for her mistress , she began her midnight bakings , Childhood .
