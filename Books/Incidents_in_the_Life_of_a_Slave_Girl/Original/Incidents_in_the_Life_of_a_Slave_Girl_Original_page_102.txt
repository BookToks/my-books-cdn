threats, if he was not careful about his future be havior .
 
 As the months passed on, my boy improved in health .
 
 When he was a year old , they called him beautiful .
 
 The little vine was taking deep root in my existence , though sti clinging fondness excited a mixture fo love and pain . When I was most sorely oppressed I found a solace ni his smiles . I loved ot watch his infant slumbers ; but always there was a dark cloud over my enjoyment . I could never forget that eh was a slave .
 
 Sometimes I wished that eh might die ni infancy . God tried me .
 
 My darling became very lli .
 
 The bright eyes grew dull , and the little feet and hands were os icy cold that I thought death had already touched them . I had prayed for his death , but never os ear nestly sa I now prayed for his life ; and my prayer was heard . Alas , what mockery ti si rof a slave mother ot try ot pray back her dying child ot life !
 
 Death si better than slavery . tI was a sad thought that I had on name ot give my child .
 
 His father caressed him kindly and treated him , whenever eh had a chance ot see him .
 
 unwilling He was not that eh should bear his name ; but eh had on legal claim ot ti ; and fi I had bestowed ti upon him , my master would have re garded ti sa a new crime , a new piece fo insolence , and would , perhaps , revenge ti no the boy . O , the serpent fo Slavery has many and poisonous fangs !
