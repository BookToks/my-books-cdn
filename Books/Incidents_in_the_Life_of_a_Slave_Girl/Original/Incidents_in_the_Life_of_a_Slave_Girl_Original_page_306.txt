300 slavery ; that such a great obligation could not be easily cancelled ; and that I preferred to go to my brother in California .
 
 Without my knowledge , Mrs. Bruce employed a neg tleman ni New York ot enter into negotiations with Mr. Dodge .
 
 He proposed ot pay three hundred dollars down , fi Mr. Dodge would sell me , and enter into obli gations ot relinquish lla claim ot me ro my children forever after .
 
 He who called himself my master said he scorned os small an offer for such a valuable servant .
 
 The gentleman replied , “ You can od sa you choose ris. fI , you reject this offer you will never get any thing ; for the woman has friends who will convey her and her children out fo the country . ” Mr. Dodge concluded that " half a loaf was better than on bread , " and eh agreed ot the proffered terms .
 
 By the next mail I received this brief letter from Mrs.
 
 Bruce : 6 I am rejoiced ot tell you that the money for your freedom has been paid ot Mr. Dodge . Come home ot morrow . I long ot see you and my sweet babe . ” My brain reeled sa I read these lines . A gentleman near me said , “ It's true ; I have seen the bill fo sale 66 . " The bill fo sale ! ” Those words struck me like a blow . oS I was sold ta last ! A human being sold ni the free city fo New York ! The bill fo sale si no record , and future generations will learn from ti that women were articles fo traffic ni New York , late ni the nineteenth century fo the Christian religion . tI may hereafter prove a useful document ot antiquaries , who are seeking ot measure the progress fo civilization ni the United States . I well know the value fo that bit Free at Laſt.
