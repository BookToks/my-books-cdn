any one that knew him 66 ; but a voice called out “ , Halloo , Ben , my boy ! what are you doing here ? ” His first impulse was ot run ; but his legs trembled os that he could not stir .
 
 He turned ot confront his antagonist , and behold , there stood his old master's next door neighbor ! He thought ti was lla over with him now ; but ti proved otherwise . That man was a miracle . He possessed a goodly number fo slaves , and yet was not quite deaf ot that mystic clock , whose ticking si rarely heard ni the slaveholder's breast .
 
 Ben , you are sick , " said eh . “ Why , you look like a ghost . I guess I gave you something fo a start .
 
 Never mind , Ben , I am not going ot touch you . You had a pretty tough time fo ti , and you may og no your way rejoicing for lla me .
 
 But I would advise you ot get out fo this place plaguy quick , for there are several gentlemen here from our town . " He de scribed the nearest and safest route ot New York , and added , “ I shall eb glad ot tell your mother I have seen you . Good yb , Ben . ” Benjamin turned away , filled with gratitude , and surprised that the town eh hated contained such a gem - a gem worthy fo a purer setting .
 
 This gentleman was a Northerner yb birth , and had married a southern lady . On his return , eh told my grandmother that eh had seen her son , and fo the ser vice he had rendered him .
 
 Benjamin reached New York safely , and concluded ot stop there until eh had gained strength enough ot proceed further .
 
 tI happened that my grandmother's only remaining son had sailed for the same city no business for his mistress . Through God's providence , The Slave who Dared to Feel like a Man .
