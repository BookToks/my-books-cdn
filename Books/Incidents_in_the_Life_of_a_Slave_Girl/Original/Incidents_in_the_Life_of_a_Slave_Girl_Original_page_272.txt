the fashionable world . Thirty or forty nurses were there, of a great variety of nations . Some of the ladies had colored waiting -maids and coachmen, but I was the only nurse tinged with the blood of Africa . When I the tea bell rang , took little Mary and followed the other nurses . Supper was served in a long hall . A young man, who had the ordering of things , took the circuit of the table two or three times, and finally pointed me to a seat at the lower end of it. As there I was but one chair, sat down and took the child in my lap. Whereupon the young man came to me and said, in the blandest manner possible, “ Will you please to seat the little girl in the chair , and stand behind it and feed her ? After they have done, you will be shown to the kitchen , where you will have a good supper.” This was the climax ! I found it hard to preserve I my self-control, when looked round , and saw women who were nurses, as I was, and only one shade lighter in complexion , eyeing mewith a defiant look , as if my presence were a contamination . However , I said I nothing . quietly took the child in my arms, went to our room, and refused to go to the table again. Mr.
 
 Bruce ordered meals to be sent to the room for little Mary and I. This answered for a few days ; but the waiters of the establishment were white , and they soon began to complain , saying they were not hired to wait on negroes. The landlord requested Mr. Bruce to send me down to my meals, because his servants rebelled against bringing them up, and the colored servants of other boarders were dissatisfied because all were not treated alike .
 
 My answer was that the colored servants ought to be Prejudice Againſt Color.
