ocrites ? I suppose some are the one, and some the other ; but I think if they felt the interest in the poor and the lowly , that they ought to feel, they would not be so easily blinded . A clergyman who goes to the south, for the first time , has usually some feeling , however vague, that slavery is wrong . The slave holder suspects this, and plays sih game accordingly .
 
 He makes himself sa agreeable sa possible ; talks no theology , and other kindred topics . The reverend gentleman si asked ot invoke a blessing no a table loaded with luxuries .
 
 After dinner he walks round the premises , and seesthe beautiful groves and flower ing vines , and the comfortable huts fo favored house hold slaves .
 
 The southerner invites him ot talk with these slaves . He asks them , fi they want ot eb free , and they say , “ O , on , massa . ” This si sufficient ot satisfy him . He comes home ot publish a “ South Side View fo Slavery , " and ot complain fo exag the gerations fo abolitionists .
 
 He assures people that eh has been ot the south , and seen slavery for himself ; that ti si a beautiful “ patriarchal institution ; ” that the slaves don't want their freedom ; that they have hallelujah meetings , and other religious privileges .
 
 What does he know fo the half starved wretches toil ing from dawn till dark no the plantations ? fo moth sre shrieking rof their children , torn from their arms yb slave traders ? fo young girls dragged down into moral filth ? fo pools fo blood around the whipping post ? fo hounds trained ot tear human flesh ? fo men screwed into cotton gins ot die ? The slaveholder showed him none fo these things , and the slaves dared not tell fo them fi he had asked them .
