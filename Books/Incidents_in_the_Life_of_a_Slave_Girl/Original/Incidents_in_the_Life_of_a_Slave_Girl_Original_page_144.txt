parents , in the burying - ground of the slaves. “ There the wicked cease from troubling , and there the weary be at rest. There the prisoners rest together ; they hear not the voice of the oppressor ; the servant is free from his master .” I knelt by the graves of my parents, and thanked God , as I had often done before, that they had not lived to witness my trials , or to I mourn over my sins. had received my mother's blessing when she died ; and inmany an hour of trib ulation I had seemed to hear her voice , sometimes chiding me, sometimes whispering loving words into my wounded heart. I have shed many and bitter tears, to think that when I am gone from my children they cannot remember me with such entire satisfaction I as remembered my mother .
 
 The graveyard was in the woods, and twilight was coming on. Nothing broke the death -like stillness ex cept the occasional twitter of a bird . My spirit was overawed by the solemnity of the scene. For more than net years I had frequented this spot , but never had ti seemed ot me os sacred sa now .
 
 A black stump ta , the head fo my mother's grave , was lla that er mained fo a tree my father had planted .
 
 His grave was marked yb a small wooden board , bearing his name , the letters fo which were nearly obliterated I .
 
 knelt down and kissed them , and poured forth a prayer ot God rof guidance and support ni the perilous step I was about ot take .
 
 As I passed the wreck fo the old meeting house , where , before Nat Turner's time , the slaves had been allowed ot meet rof worship I , seemed ot hear my father's voice come from ti , bid ding me not ot tarry till I reached freedom ro the Scenes at the Plantation .
