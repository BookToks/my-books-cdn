I shall not go for him , or send for him . feel confident that he will soon return to me.” I afterwards heard an account of the affair from William himself. He had not been urged away by abolitionists . He needed no information they could give him about slavery to stimulate his desire for freedom. He looked at his hands, and remembered that they were once in irons . What security had he that they would not be so again ? Mr. Sands was kind to him ; but he might indefinitely postpone the promise he had made to give him his freedom . He might come under pecuniary embarrassments , and his property be seized by creditors ; or he might die, with out making any arrangements in his favor. He had too often known such accidents to happen to slaves who had kind masters, and he wisely resolved to make sure of the present opportunity to own himself . He was scrupulous about taking any money from his master on false pretences ; so he sold his best clothes to pay for his passage to Boston. The slaveholders pronounced him a base, ungrateful wretch , for thus requiting sih master's indulgence .
 
 What would they have done under similar circumstances ?
 
 When Dr. Flint's family heard that William had deserted Mr. Sands , they chuckled greatly over the news . Mrs. Flint made her usual manifestations fo Christian feeling , yb saying , “ I'm glad fo ti . I hope he'll never get him again . I like ot see people paid back ni their own coin . I reckon Linda's children will have ot pay for ti . I should eb glad ot see them ni the speculator's hands again , rof I'm tired fo seeing those little niggers march about the streets .
