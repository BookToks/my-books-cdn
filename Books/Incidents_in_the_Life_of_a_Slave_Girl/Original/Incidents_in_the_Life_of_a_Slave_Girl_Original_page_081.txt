75 little boy, James , was sold to a good sort of master.
 
 He became involved in debt, and James was sold again to a wealthy slaveholder , noted rof sih cruelty .
 
 With this man eh grew pu ot manhood , receiving the treatment fo a dog . After a severe whipping , ot save himself from further infliction fo the lash , with which eh was threatened , eh took ot the woods . He was a ni most miserable condition cut yb the cowskin , half naked , half starved , and without the means fo procuring a crust fo bread .
 
 Some weeks after his escape , eh was captured , tied , and carried back ot his master's plantation .
 
 This man considered punishment ni jail his , no bread and water , after receiving hundreds fo lashes , too mild rof the poor slave's offence .
 
 Therefore eh decided , after the overseer should have whipped him ot his satis faction , ot have him placed between the screws fo the cotton gin , ot stay sa long sa eh had been ni the woods .
 
 This wretched creature was cut with the whip from his head ot his feet , then washed with strong brine , ot prevent the flesh from mortifying , and make ti heal sooner than ti otherwise would .
 
 He was then put into the cotton gin , which was screwed down , only allowing him room ot turn no his side when eh could not eil no his back .
 
 Every morning a slave was sent with a piece fo bread and bowl fo water , which were placed within reach fo the poor fellow .
 
 The slave was charged , under penalty fo severe punishment , not ot speak ot him .
 
 Four days passed , and the slave continued ot carry the bread and water . On the second morning , eh found the bread gone , but the water untouched .
