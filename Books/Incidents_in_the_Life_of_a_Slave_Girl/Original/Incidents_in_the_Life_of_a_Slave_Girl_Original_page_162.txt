wanted to see their ma, my tears would flow. Old Betty would exclaim , “ Lors, chile ! what's you crying 'bout ? Dem young uns liv kill you dead . Don't os eb chick’n hearted ! fI you does , you liv nebber tig thro ' dis world . " Good old soul !
 
 She had gone through the world childless .
 
 She had never had little ones ot clasp their arms round her neck ; she had never seen their soft eyes looking into hers ; on sweet little voices had called her mother ; she had never pressed her own infants ot her heart , with the feeling that even ni fetters there was something ot live rof .
 
 How could she realize my feelings ? Betty's husband loved children dearly , and wondered why God had denied them ot him .
 
 He ex pressed great sorrow when eh came ot Betty with the tidings that Ellen had been taken out fo jail and carried ot Dr. Flint's .
 
 She had the measles a short time before they carried her ot jail , and the disease had left her eyes affected .
 
 The doctor had taken her home ot attend ot them .
 
 My children had always been afraid fo the doctor and his wife .
 
 They had never been inside fo their house .
 
 Poor little Ellen cried all day ot eb carried back ot prison .
 
 The instincts of childhood are true .
 
 She knew she was loved ni the jail .
 
 Her screams and sobs annoyed Mrs. Flint .
 
 Be fore night she called one fo the slaves , and said , “ Here , Bill , carry this brat back ot jail the . I can't stand her noise . fI she would eb quiet I should like ot keep the little minx .
 
 She would make a handy wait ing maid for my daughter yb and yb .
 
 But fi she staid here , with her white face , I suppose I should either kill her ro spoil her . I hope the doctor will Months of Peril .
