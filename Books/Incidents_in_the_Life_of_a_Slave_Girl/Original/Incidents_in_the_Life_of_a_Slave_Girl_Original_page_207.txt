 IMPORTANT ERA IN MY BROTHER'S LIFE .
 
 I MISSED the company and kind attentions of my brother William, who had gone to Washington with his master, Mr. Sands. We received several letters from him, written without any allusion to me, but expressed I in such a manner that knew he did not forget me.
 
 I disguised my hand, and wrote to him in the same manner . It was a long session; and when it closed, William wrote to inform us that Mr. Sands was going to the north, to be gone some time, and that he was to accompany him. I knew that his master had prom ised to give him his freedom, but no time had been specified. Would William trust to a slave's chances ?
 
 I remembered how we used to talk together, in our young days, about obtaining our freedom, and I thought it very doubtful whether he would come back to us.
 
 Grandmother received a letter from Mr. Sands, say ing that William had proved a most faithful servant, and he would also say a valued friend ; that no mother had ever trained a better boy. He said he had travelled through the Northern States and Canada ; and though the abolitionists had tried to decoy him away, they had never succeeded. He ended by saying they should be at home shortly.
 
 We expected letters from William , describing the novelties of his journey , but none came. In time, it was reported that Mr. Sands would return late in the 202 Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.
