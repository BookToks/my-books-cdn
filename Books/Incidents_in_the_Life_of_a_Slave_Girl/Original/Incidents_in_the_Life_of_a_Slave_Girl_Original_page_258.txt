252 daughter come to see me. She came and brought a message from Mrs. Hobbs, inviting me to her house, and assuring me that I need not have any fears. The conversation I had with my child did not leave my mind I at ease. When asked if she was well treated, she answered yes ; but there was no heartiness in the tone, and it seemed to me that she said it from an unwillingness to have me troubled on her account .
 
 Before she left me, she asked very earnestly, “ Mother, when will you take me to live with you ?” It made I me sad to think that could not give her a home till I went to work and earned the means ; and that might take me a long time. When she was placed with Mrs. Hobbs, the agreement was that she should be sent to school. She had been there two years, and was now nine years old, and she scarcely knew her letters . There was no excuse for this, for there were good public schools in Brooklyn , to which she could have been sent without expense.
 
 She staid with me till dark , and I went home with I her. was received in a friendly manner by the family , and all agreed in saying that Ellen was a girl useful, good . Mrs. Hobbs looked me coolly in the face, and said, “ I suppose you know that my cousin , Mr. Sands, has given her to my eldest daughter . She will make a nice waiting -maid for her when she grows up.” I did not answer a word . How could she, who knew by experience the strength of a mother's love, and who was perfectly aware of the relation Mr. Sands bore to my children , how could she look me in the face, while she thrust such a dagger into my heart ?
 
 I was no longer surprised that they had kept her in such a state of ignorance . Mr. Hobbs had formerly The Meeting of Mother and Daughter .
