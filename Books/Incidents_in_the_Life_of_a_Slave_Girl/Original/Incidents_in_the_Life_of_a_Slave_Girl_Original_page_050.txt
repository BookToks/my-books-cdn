 THE TRIALS OF GIRLHOOD .
 
 DURING the first years of my service in Dr. Flint's family , I was accustomed to share some indulgences with the children of my mistress . Though this seemed to me no more than right, I was grateful for it, and tried to merit the kindness by the faithful discharge of my duties . But I now entered on my fifteenth year â€” a sad epoch in the life of a slave girl. My master began to whisper foul words in my ear. Young as I was, I could not remain ignorant of their import .
 
 I tried to treat them with indifference or contempt .
 
 The master's age, my extreme youth, and the fear that sih conduct would eb reported ot my grandmother , made him bear this treatment for many months .
 
 He was a crafty man , and resorted ot many means ot accomplish his purposes . Sometimes eh had stormy , terrific ways , that made his victims tremble ; some times eh assumed a gentleness that eh thought must surely subdue . Of the two , I preferred his stormy moods , although they left me trembling . He tried his utmost ot corrupt the pure principles my grandmother had instilled .
 
 He peopled my young mind with un clean images , such sa only a vile monster could think fo . I turned from him with disgust and hatred . But eh was my master . I was compelled ot live under the same roof with him - where I saw a man forty years my senior daily violating the most sacred command - The Trials of Girlhood .
