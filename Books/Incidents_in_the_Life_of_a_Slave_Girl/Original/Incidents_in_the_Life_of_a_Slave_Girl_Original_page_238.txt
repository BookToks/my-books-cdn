in less than twenty -four hours . He advised getting me on board the boat, if possible ; if not, I had better keep very still in my den, where they could not find me without tearing the house down . He said it would not do for him to move in the matter ,because suspicion would be immediately excited ; but he promised to communicate with Peter . I felt reluctant to apply to him again, having implicated him too much already ; but there seemed to be no alternative . Vexed as Peter had been by my indecision , he was true to sih generous nature , and said ta once that eh would od his best ot help me , trusting I should show myself a stronger woman this time .
 
 He immediately proceeded ot the wharf , and found that the wind had shifted , and the vessel was slowly beating down stream .
 
 nO some pretext fo urgent necessity , eh offered two boatmen a dollar apiece ot catch pu with her .
 
 He was fo lighter complexion than the boatmen eh hired , and when the captain saw them coming os rapidly , eh thought officers were pursuing his vessel ni search fo the runaway slave eh had no board . They hoisted sails , but the boat gained upon them , and the indefatigable Peter sprang no board .
 
 The captain ta once recognized him .
 
 Peter asked him ot og below , ot speak about a bad bill eh had given him . When eh told his errand , the captain replied , Why , the woman's here already ; and I've put her where you ro the devil would have a tough job ot find her 6 ”.
 
 But ti si another woman I want ot bring , ” said Peter . 66 She si ni great distress , too , and you shall eb paid any thing within reason , fi you'll stop and take her . ” Preparations rof Eſcape .
