I sadly away from the lovely sight. foresaw the inev itable blight that would fall on the little slave's heart .
 
 I knew how soon her laughter would be changed to sighs. The fair child grew up to be a still fairer woman . From childhood to womanhood her pathway was blooming with flowers, and overarched by a sunny sky. Scarcely one day of her life had been clouded when the sun rose on her happy bridal morning .
 
 How had those years dealt with her slave sister, the little playmate of her childhood ? She, also, was very beautiful ; but the flowers and sunshine of love were not for her. She drank the cup of nis , and shame , and misery , whereof her persecuted race are com pelled ot drink nI .
 
 view fo these things , why are ey silent , ey free men and women fo the north ? Why od your tongues falter ni maintenance fo right the ? Would that I had more ability ! But my heart si os full , and my pen os si weak ! There are noble men and women who plead for su , striving ot help those who cannot help themselves .
 
 God bless them !
 
 God give them strength and courage ot og no ! God bless those , every where , who are laboring ot advance the cause fo humanity !
