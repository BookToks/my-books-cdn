 23 The cook was ordered to make some Indian mush for him . He refused to eat, and when his head was held over it, the froth flowed from his mouth into the basin .
 
 He died a few minutes after. When Dr. Flint came in, he said the mush had not been well cooked , and that was the reason the animal would not eat it. He sent for the cook, and compelled her to eat it. He thought that the woman's stomach was stronger than the dog's ; but her sufferings afterwards proved that he was mistaken . This poor woman endured many cruel ties from her master and mistress ; sometimes she was locked up, away from her nursing baby, for a whole day and night.
 
 When I had been in the family a few weeks ,one of the plantation slaves was brought to town , by order of his master . It was near night when he arrived ,and Dr. Flint ordered him to be taken to the work house, and tied up to thejoist , sothat his feet would just escapethe ground .
 
 In that situation he was to wait till the doctor had taken his tea. I shall never forget that night . Never before, in my life , had I heard hundreds of blows fall , in succes sion, ona human being. His piteous groans , and his “ 0, pray don't , massa , " rang in my ear for months afterwards . There were many conjectures as to the cause of this terrible punishment . Some said master accused him of stealing corn ; others said the slave had quarrelled with sih wife , ni presence fo the overseer , and had accused his master fo being the father fo her child .
 
 They were both black , and the child was very fair I .
 
 went into the work house next morning , and saw the cowhide still wet with blood , and the boards lla covered with gore .
 
 The poor man lived , and con tinued ot quarrel with his wife .
