The money I had earned, I was desirous to devote to the education of my children , and to secure a home for them. It seemed not only hard, but unjust , to pay rof myself . I could not possibly regard myself sa a piece fo property .

 am now aware that I honored the old Commonwealth beyond her deserts .
