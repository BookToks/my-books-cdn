pro could make them useful men, and enable them to tect their wives and children . If those heathen in our Christian land had as much teaching as some Hindoos , they would think otherwise . They would know that liberty is more valuable than life . They would begin to understand their own capabilities , and exert them selves to become men and women .
 
 But while the Free States sustain a law which hurls fugitives back into slavery, how can the slaves resolve to become men ? There are some who strive to pro tect wives and daughters from the insults of their masters ; but those who have such sentiments have had advantages above the general mass of slaves. They have been partially civilized and Christianized by favor able circumstances . Some are bold enough to utter such sentiments to their masters . O, that there were more of them !
 
 Some poor creatures have been so brutalized by the lash that they will sneak out of the way to give their masters free access to their wives and daughters . Do you think this proves the black man to belong to an inferior order of beings ? Whatwould you be, if you had been born and brought up a slave, with gener ations of slaves for ancestors ? I admit that the black man is inferior . But what is it that makes him so ?
 
 It is the ignorance in which white men compel him to live ; it is the torturing whip that lashes manhood out of him ; it is the fierce bloodhounds of the South , and the scarcely less cruel human bloodhounds of the north , who enforce the Fugitive Slave Law. They do the work .
 
 Southern gentlemen indulge in the most contempt What Slaves are Taught of the North .
