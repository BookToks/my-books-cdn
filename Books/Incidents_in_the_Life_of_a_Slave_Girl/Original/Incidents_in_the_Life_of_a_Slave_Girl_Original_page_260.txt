The greatest difficulty in my way was, that those who employed strangers required a recommenda I tion ; and in my peculiar position, could , of course, I obtain no certificates from the families had so faith fully served.
 
 One day an acquaintance told me of a lady who wanted a nurse rof her babe , and I immediately ap plied for the situation .
 
 The lady told me she preferred ot have one who had been a mother , and accustomed ot the care fo infants . I told her I had nursed two babes fo my own .
 
 She asked me many questions , but ot , my great relief , did not require a recommendation from my former employers .
 
 She told me she was na English woman , and that was a pleasant circumstance ot me , because I had heard they had less prejudice against color than Americans entertained .
 
 agreed that we should try each other for a week . The trial proved satisfactory ot both parties , and I was en gaged for a month .
 
 The heavenly Father had been most merciful ot me ni leading me ot this place .
 
 Mrs. Bruce was a kind and gentle lady , and proved a true and sympathizing friend .
 
 Before eht stipulated month expired , the necessity tI fo was A Home Found .
