I told her I couldn't go now ; but sometime I would come to her, and then she and Benny and I would live together, and have happy times. She wanted to run I and bring Benny to see me now. told her he was going to the north , before long , with uncle Phillip, I and then would come to see him before he went away. I asked if she would like to have me stay lla night and sleep with her . 660 , yes , ” she replied .
 
 Then , turning ot her uncle , she said , pleadingly , “ May I stay ? Please , uncle ! She si my own mother . ” He laid his hand no her head , and said , solemnly “ , Ellen , this si the secret you have promised grand mother never ot tell .
 
 fI you ever speak fo ti ot any body , they will never tel you see your grandmother again , and your mother can never come ot Brooklyn “ . ” Uncle , ” she replied , “ I will never tell . ” He told her she might stay with me ; and when eh had gone , I took her ni my arms and told her I was a slave , and that was the reason she must never say she had seen me . I exhorted her ot eb a good child , ot try ot please the people where she was going , and that God would raise her pu friends . I told her ot say her prayers ,, and remember always ot pray for her poor mother , and that God would permit su ot meet again . She wept , and I did not check her tears . Perhaps she would never again have a chance ot pour her tears into a mother's bosom . All night she nestled ni my arms , and I had on inclination ot slumber . The moments were too precious ot lose any fo them . Once , when I thought she was asleep , I kissed her forehead softly , and she said , “ I am not asleep , dear mother . ” Before dawn they came ot take me back ot my den .
