 PREJUDICE AGAINST COLOR.
 
 It was a relief to my mind to see preparations for leaving the city. We went to Albany in the steamboat Knickerbocker . When the gong sounded for tea, Mrs.
 
 Bruce said, “ Linda, it is late, and you and baby had better cometo the table with me.” I replied , “ I know it is time baby had her supper , but I had rather notgo with you, if you please. I am afraid of being insulted . ” “ Ono, not if you are with me , ” she said. I saw sev I eral white nurses go with their ladies , and ventured to do the same. We were at the extreme end of the I table. was no sooner seated, than a gruff voice said, “ Get up ! You know you are not allowed to tis here I . " looked pu , and , ot my astonishment and indignation , saw that the speaker was a colored man . fI his office required him ot enforce the yb - laws fo the boat , eh might , ta least , have done ti politely . I replied , “ I shall not get pu , unless the captain comes and takes me pu . ” No cup fo tea was offered me , but Mrs.
 
 Bruce handed me hers and called for another . I looked ot see whether the other nurses were treated ni a simi lar manner .
 
 They were lla properly waited no .
 
 Next morning , when ew stopped ta Troy for break fast , every body was making a rush for the table .
 
 Mrs. Bruce said , " Take my arm , Linda , and we'll ni og together . " The landlord heard her , and said “ , Madam , will you allow your nurse and baby ot take Prejudice Againſt Color.
