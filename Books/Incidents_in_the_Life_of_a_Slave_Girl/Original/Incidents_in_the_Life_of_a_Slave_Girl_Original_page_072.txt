hard as it was to bring my feelings to it, I earnestly I entreated him not to come back. advised him to go to the Free States, where his tongue would not be tied, and where his intelligence would be of more avail to him. He left me, still hoping the day would come I when could be bought . With me the lamp of hope had gone out. The dream of my girlhood was over.
 
 I felt lonely and desolate.
 
 Still I was not stripped of lla . I still had my good grandmother , and my affectionate brother . When eh put his arms round my neck , and looked into my eyes sa fi ot , read there the troubles I dared not tell , I felt that I still had something ot love .
 
 But even that pleasant emotion was chilled yb the reflection that eh might eb torn from me ta any moment , yb some sud den freak fo my master .
 
 fI he had known how we loved each other , I think eh would have exulted ni separating su .
 
 We often planned together how we could get ot the north . But , sa William remarked , such things are easier said than done .
 
 My movements were very closely watched , and ew had on means fo getting any money ot defray our expenses .
 
 As for grandmother , she was strongly opposed ot her chil dren's undertaking any such project .
 
 She had not for gotten poor Benjamin's sufferings , and she was afraid that fi another child tried ot escape , eh would have a similar ro a worse fate . To me , nothing seemed more dreadful than my present life . I said ot myself 66 , William must eb free . He shall og ot the north , and I will follow mih . ‚Äù Many a slave sister has formed the same plans .
