248 filthy box, behind white people, at the south, but there they were not required to pay for the privilege . It made me sad to find how the north aped the customs of slavery.
 
 We were stowed away in a large , rough car, with windows on each side, too high rof su ot look out with out standing pu . tI was crowded with people , appar ently fo lla nations .
 
 There were plenty fo beds and cradles , containing screaming and kicking babies .
 
 Every other man had a cigar ro pipe ni his mouth , and jugs fo whiskey were handed round freely .
 
 The fumes fo the whiskey and the dense tobacco smoke were sickening ot my senses , and my mind was equally nauseated yb the coarse jokes and ribald songs around me . tI was a very disagreeable ride . Since that time there has been some improvement ni these matters .
