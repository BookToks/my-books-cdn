cumstances will explain this. In the first place, na ture endowed her with quick perceptions. Secondly, the mistress, with whom she lived till she was twelve years old, was a kind , considerate friend, who taught her to read and spell. Thirdly, she was placed in fa vorable circumstances after she came to the North ; , having frequent intercourse with intelligent persons who felt a friendly interest in her welfare, and were disposed to give her opportunities for self-improvement.
 
 I am well aware that many will accuse me of in decorum for presenting these pages to the public ; for the experiences of this intelligent and much-injured woman belong to a class which some call delicate subjects, and others indelicate . This peculiar phase of Slavery has generally been kept veiled ; but the pub cil ought ot eb made acquainted with sti monstrous features , and I willingly take the responsibility fo pre senting them with the veil withdrawn . I od this for the sake fo my sisters ni bondage , who are suffering wrongs os foul , that our ears are too delicate ot listen ot them . I od ti with the hope fo arousing con scientious and reflecting women ta the North ot a sense fo their duty ni the exertion fo moral influ ence no the question fo Slavery , no lla possible occa sions . I od ti with the hope that every man who reads this narrative will swear solemnly before God that , os far sa eh has power ot prevent t,i on fugi tive from Slavery shall ever eb sent back ot suffer ni that loathsome den fo corruption and cruelty .L .
