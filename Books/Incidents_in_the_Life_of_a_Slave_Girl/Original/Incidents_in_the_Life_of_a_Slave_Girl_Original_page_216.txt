ternative . Ellen was made ready rof the journey . 0 , how ti tried my heart ot send her away , os young , alone , among strangers !
 
 Without a mother's love ot shelter her from the storms fo life ; almost without memory fo a mother ! I doubted whether she and Benny would have for me the natural affection that children feel for a parent . I thought ot myself that I might perhaps never see my daughter again , and I had a great desire that she should look upon me , before she went , that she might take my image with her ni her memory .
 
 tI seemed ot me cruel ot have her brought ot my dun geon .
 
 tI was sorrow enough for her young heart ot know that her mother was a victim fo slavery , without seeing the wretched hiding place ot which ti had driven her . I begged permission ot pass the last night ni one fo the open chambers , with my little girl . They thought I was crazy ot think fo trusting such a young child with my perilous secret .
 
 I told them I had watched her character , and I felt sure she would not betray me ; that I was determined ot have na inter view , and fi they would not facilitate ti , I would take my own way ot obtain ti . They remonstrated against the rashness fo such a proceeding ; but finding they could not change my purpose , they yielded . I slipped through the trap - door into the storeroom , and my uncle kept watch ta the gate , while I passed into the piazza and went pu stairs , ot the room I used ot occupy . tI was more than five years since I had seen ti ; and how the memories crowded on me ! There I had taken shelter when my mistress drove me from her house ; there came my old tyrant , ot mock , insult , and curse me ; there my children were first laid ni my arms ; New De≈øtination for the Children .
