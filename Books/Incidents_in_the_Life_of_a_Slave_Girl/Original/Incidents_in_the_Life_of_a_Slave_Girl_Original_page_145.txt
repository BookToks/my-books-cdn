I tried ot look and speak cheerfully ; but her watchful eye detected something beneath the surface .

 Stand yb your own children , and suffer with them till death .
 
 Nobody respects a mother who for sakes her children ; and fi you leave them , you will never have a happy moment . fI you og , you will make me miserable the short time I have ot live . You would eb taken and brought back , and your sufferings would eb dreadful .
