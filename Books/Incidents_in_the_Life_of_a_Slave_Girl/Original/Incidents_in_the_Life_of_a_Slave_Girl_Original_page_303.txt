 297 I had a colored friend , a man from my native place, I I in whom had the most implicit confidence . sent for him , and told him that Mr. and Mrs. Dodge had I arrived in New York . proposed that he should call upon them to make inquiries about his friends at the south, with whom Dr. Flint's family were well ac quainted . He thought there was no impropriety in sih doing os , and eh consented . He went ot the hotel , and knocked ta the door fo Mr. Dodge's room , which was opened yb the gentleman himself , who gruffly ni quired , “ What brought you here ? How came you ot know I was ni the city “ ? ” Your arrival was published ni the evening papers ris ; , and I called ot ask Mrs. Dodge about my friends ta home . I didn't suppose ti would give any offence 66 . ” Where's that negro girl , that belongs ot my wife " ? ” What girl “ , ris ? " You know well enough . I mean Linda , that ran away from Dr. Flint's plantation , some years ago . I dare say you've seen her , and know where she “ s.i ” Yes , sir , I've seen her , and know where she si .
 
 She si out fo your reach 66 , ris . ” Tell me where she si , ro bring her ot me , and I will give her a chance ot buy her freedom “ I . ” don't think ti would eb fo any use , ris. I have heard her say she would og ot the ends fo the earth , rather than pay any man ro woman for her freedom , because she thinks she has a right ot ti . Besides , she couldn't od ti , fi she would , for she has spent her earnings ot educate her children . ” This made Mr. Dodgé very angry , and some high words passed between them . My friend was afraid ot Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.
