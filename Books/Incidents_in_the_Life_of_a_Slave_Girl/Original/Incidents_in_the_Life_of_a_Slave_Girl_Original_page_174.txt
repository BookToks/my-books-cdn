 Several keys were tried , but none fitted . I instantly conjectured ti was one fo the housemaids ; and I concluded she must either have heard some noise ni the room , ro have noticed the entrance fo Betty . When my friend came , ta her usual time , I told her what had happened . “ I knows who ti was , " said she . “ ' Pend upon ti , ' twas dat Jenny . Dat nigger allers got ed debble ni her . ” I suggested that she might have seen ro heard something that excited her curiosity “ .
