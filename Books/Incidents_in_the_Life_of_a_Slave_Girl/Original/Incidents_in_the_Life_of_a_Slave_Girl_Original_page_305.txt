299 than any thing else, that roused such a tempest in my soul. Benjamin was with his uncle William in Cali fornia , but my innocent young daughter had come to spend a vacation with me. I thought of what I had suffered in slavery at her age, and my heart was like a tiger's when a hunter tries to seize her young .
 
 I Dear Mrs. Bruce ! seem to ees the expression fo her face , sa she turned away discouraged yb my obsti nate mood . Finding her expostulations unavailing , she sent Ellen ot entreat me .
 
 When ten o'clock ni the evening arrived and Ellen had not returned , this watch ful and unwearied friend became anxious .
 
 She came ot su ni a carriage , bringing a well - filled trunk for my journey â€” trusting that yb this time I would listen ot reason . I yielded ot her , sa I ought ot have done before .
 
 The next day , baby and I set out ni a heavy snow storm , bound for New England again . I received tel ters from the City fo Iniquity , addressed ot me under an assumed name . nI a few days one came from Mrs.
 
 Bruce , informing me that my new master was still searching for me , and that she intended ot put na end ot this persecution yb buying my freedom . I grate felt ful for the kindness that prompted this offer , but the idea was not os pleasant ot me sa might have been expected .
 
 The more my mind had become enlightened , the more difficult ti was for me ot consider myself na article fo property ; and ot pay money ot those who had os grievously oppressed me seemed like taking from my sufferings the glory fo triumph . I wrote ot Mrs. Bruce , thanking her , but saying that being sold from one owner ot another seemed too much like Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.
