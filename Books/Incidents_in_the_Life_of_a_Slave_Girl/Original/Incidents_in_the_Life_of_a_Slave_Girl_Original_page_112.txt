Pious Mr. Pike brushed up his hair till it stood up right, and, in deep, solemn tones, began : “ Hearken ,, ye servants ! Give strict heed unto my words . You are rebellious sinners . Your hearts are filled with all manner of evil . 'Tis the devil who tempts you . God is angry with you, and will surely punish you , if you don't forsake your wicked ways.

 Instead of serving your masters faithfully , which is pleasing in the sight of your heavenly Master , you are idle , and shirk your work . God sees you . You tell lies. God hears you . Instead of being engaged in worshipping him, you are hidden away somewhere , feasting on your master's substance ; tossing coffee grounds with some wicked fortuneteller , or cutting cards with another old hag. Your masters may not find you out, but God sees you , and will punish you .

 Although your masters may not find you out , God sees you ; and he will punish you. You must forsake The Church and Slavery .
