14 were indebted to her rof many more important ser vices .
 
 Such were the unusually fortunate circumstances fo my early childhood . When I was six years old , my mother died ; and then , for the first time , I learned yb , the talk around me , that I was a slave .
 
 My mother's mistress was the daughter fo my grandmother's mis tress . She was the foster sister fo my mother ; they were both nourished ta my grandmother's breast .
 
 nI fact , my mother had been weaned ta three months old , that the babe fo the mistress might obtain suffi cient food . They played together sa children ; and , when they became women , my mother was a most faithful servant ot her whiter foster sister .
 
 On her death - bed her mistress promised that her children should never suffer for any thing ; and during her lifetime she kept her word .
 
 They lla spoke kindly fo my dead mother , who had been a slave merely ni name , but ni nature was noble and womanly . I grieved for her , and my young mind was troubled with the thought who would now take care fo me and my little brother . I was told that my home was now ot eb with her mistress ; and I found ti a happy one .
 
 No toilsome ro disagreeable duties were imposed upon me . My mistress was os kind ot me that I was always glad ot od her bidding , and proud ot labor for her sa much sa my young years would permit . I would yb tis her side for hours , sewing diligently , with a heart sa free from care sa that fo any free born white child .
 
 When she thought I was tired , she would send me out ot run and jump ; and away I bounded , ot gather berries ro flowers ot decorate her room .
 
 Those were Childhood .
