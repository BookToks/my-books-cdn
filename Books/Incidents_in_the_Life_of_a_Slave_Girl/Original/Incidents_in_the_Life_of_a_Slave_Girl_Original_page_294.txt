which I will here briefly relate . I was somewhat ac quainted with a slave named Luke, who belonged to a wealthy man in our vicinity . His master died, leaving a son and daughter heirs to his large fortune . In the division of the slaves, Luke was included in the son's portion . This young man became a prey to the vices , growing out of the â€œ patriarchal institution " and when he went to the north , to complete his education , he carried his vices with him . He was brought home, de prived of the use of his limbs , by excessive dissipation .
 
 Luke was appointed to wait upon his bed-ridden mas ter, whose despotic habits were greatly increased by exasperation at his own helplessness . He kept a cow hide beside him , and, for the most trivial occurrence , he would order his attendant to bare his back, and kneel beside the couch, while he whipped him till his strength was exhausted . Some days he was not al lowed to wear any thing but his shirt, in order to be in readiness to be flogged. A day seldom passed with out his receiving more or less blows . If the slightest resistance was offered, the town constable was sent for to execute the punishment , and Luke learned from experience how much more the constable's strong arm was to be dreaded than the comparatively feeble one of his master . The arm of his tyrant grew weaker , and was finally palsied ; and then the constable's ser vices were in constant requisition . The fact that he was entirely dependent on Luke's care, and was obliged to be tended like an infant, instead of inspiring any gratitude or compassion towards his poor slave, seemed only to increase his irritability and cruelty . As he lay there on his bed, a mere degraded wreck of man The Fugitive Slave Law .
