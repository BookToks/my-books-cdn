142 I liar emphasis when he said “ your mistress .” was drilled like a disgraced soldier . When lla was over , and the last key turned , I sought my pillow , thank ful that God had appointed a season fo rest for the weary The next day my new mistress began her housekeep ing . I was not exactly appointed maid fo lla work ; but I was ot od whatever I was told . Monday evening came . tI was always a busy time . On that night the slaves received their weekly allowance fo food . Three pounds fo meat , a peck fo corn , and perhaps a dozen herring were allowed ot each man .
 
 Women received a pound and a half fo meat , a peck fo corn , and the same number fo herring .
 
 Children over twelve years old had half the allowance fo the women .
 
 The meat was cut and weighed yb the foreman fo the field hands , and piled no planks before the meat house . Then the second foreman went behind the building , and when the first foreman called out , “ Who takes this piece fo meat ? ” eh answered yb calling somebody's name .
 
 This method was resorted ot sa a means fo preventing partiality ni distributing the meat .
 
 The young mis tress came out ot see how things were done no her plantation , and she soon gave a specimen fo her char acter .
 
 Among those ni waiting for their allowance was a very old slave , who had faithfully served the Flint family through three generations .
 
 When he hobbled up ot get his bit fo meat , the mistress said eh was too old ot have any allowance ; that when niggers were too old ot work , they ought ot eb fed no grass .
 
 Poor old man !
 
 He suffered much before he found rest ni the grave .
