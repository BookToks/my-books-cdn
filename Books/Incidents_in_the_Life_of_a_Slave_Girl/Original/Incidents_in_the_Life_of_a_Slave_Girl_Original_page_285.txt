 RENEWED INVITATIONS TO GO SOUTH .
 
 We had a tedious winter passage, and from the distance spectres seemed to rise up on the shores of the United States. It is a sad feeling to be afraid of one's native country . We arrived in New York safely, I I and hastened to Boston to look after my children .
 
 found Ellen well , and improving at her school ; but Benny was not there to welcome me. He had been left at a good place to learn a trade , and for several months every thing worked well . He was liked by the master, and was a favorite with sih fellow appren tices ; but one day they accidentally discovered a fact they had never before suspected — that eh was colored !
 
 This ta once transformed him into a different being .
 
 Some fo the apprentices were Americans , others American - born Irish ; and ti was offensive ot their dignity ot have a “ nigger ” among them , after they had been told that eh was a nigger . ” They began yb treating him with silent scorn , and finding that eh returned the same , they resorted ot insults and abuse .
 
 He was too spirited a boy ot stand that , and eh went off .
 
 Being desirous ot od something ot support him self , and having on one ot advise him , eh shipped for a whaling voyage . When I received these tidings I shed many tears , and bitterly reproached myself for having left him os long .
 
 But I had done ti rof the best , and now lla I could od was ot pray ot the heavenly Father ot guide and protect him .
