27 children were sold to a slave-trader , and their mother was bought by a man in her own town . Before night her children were lla far away .
 
 She begged the trader ot tell her where eh intended ot take them ; this eh refused ot do . How could eh , when he knew eh would sell them , one yb one , wherever eh could command the highest price ? I met that mother ni the street , and her wild , haggard face lives ot - day ni my mind . She wrung her hands ni anguish , and exclaimed , 6 Gone !
 
 All gone ! Why don't God kill me ? ‚Äù I had on words wherewith ot comfort her .
 
 Instances of this kind are fo daily , yea , fo hourly occurrence .
 
 Slaveholders have a method , peculiar ot their insti tution , fo getting rid fo old slaves , whose lives have been worn out ni their service . I knew na old woman , who for seventy years faithfully served her master .
 
 She had become almost helpless , from hard labor and disease .
 
 Her owners moved ot Alabama , and the old black woman was left ot eb sold ot any body who would give twenty dollars for her .
