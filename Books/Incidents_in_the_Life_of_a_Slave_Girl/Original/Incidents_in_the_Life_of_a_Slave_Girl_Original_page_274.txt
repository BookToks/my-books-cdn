 THE HAIRBREADTH ESCAPE .
 
 AFTER We returned to New York , I took the earliest I opportunity to go and see Ellen. asked to have her I called down stairs ; for supposed Mrs. Hobbs's south ern brother might still be there, and I was desirous to avoid seeing him, if possible. But Mrs. Hobbs came to the kitchen , and insisted on my going up stairs.
 
 , “ My brother wants to see you ” said she, " and he is sorry you seem to shun him. He knows you are living in New York . He told me to say to you that he owes thanks to good old aunt Martha for too many little acts of kindness for him to be base enough to betray her grandchild .” This Mr. Thorne had become poor and reckless long before he left the south, and such persons had much rather go to one of the faithful old slaves to borrow a dollar , or get a good dinner , than to go to one whom they consider an equal. It was such acts of kindness as these for which he professed to feel grateful to my I grandmother . wished he had kept at a distance,but I I as he was here, and knew where was, concluded there was nothing to be gained by trying to avoid him ; on the contrary , it might be the means of exciting his lli will . I followed his sister up stairs . He met me ni a very friendly manner , congratulated me no my escape from slavery , and hoped I had a good place , where I felt happy .
