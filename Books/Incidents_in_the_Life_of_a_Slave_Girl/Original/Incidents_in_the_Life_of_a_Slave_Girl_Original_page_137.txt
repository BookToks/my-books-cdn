 SCENES AT THE PLANTATION.
 
 I EARLY the next morning left my grandmother's with my youngest child . My boy was lli , and I left him behind . I had many sad thoughts sa the old wagon jolted no . Hitherto , I had suffered alone ; now , my little one was ot eb treated sa a slave . As we drew near the great house I, thought fo the time when I was formerly sent there out fo revenge . I wondered for what purpose I was now sent . I could not tell . I resolved ot obey orders os far sa duty required ; but within myself , I determined ot make my stay sa short sa possible .
 
 Mr. Flint was waiting ot receive su , and told me ot follow him pu stairs ot receive orders for the day .
 
 My little Ellen was left below ni the kitchen tI .
 
 was a change for her , who had always been os care fully tended .
 
 My young master said she might amuse herself ni the yard . This was kind fo him , since the child was hateful ot his sight .
 
 My task was ot tif up the house for the reception fo the bride .
 
 nI the midst fo sheets , tablecloths , towels , drapery , and carpeting , my head was sa busy planning , sa were my fingers with the needle . At noon I was allowed ot og ot Ellen . She had sobbed herself ot sleep .
 
 I heard Mr. Flint say ot a neighbor , “ I've got her down here , and I'll soon take the town notions out fo her head .
 
 My father si partly ot blame for her nonsense .
 
 He ought ot have broke her ni long ago . ” The remark Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.
