When the doctor saw that his reasons didn't convince my uncle, he accidentally let the secret slip by saying he had written to the mayor of Boston to ask if there was someone matching my description at the street and number my letter had.

He left out the date in the letter he showed my grandmother. If I had said I was writing from New York, the old man might have tried to go there. But even in that dark place where slaves were kept from learning, I had heard enough about Massachusetts to know that slave owners didn’t like to search for runaways there.

This was before the Fugitive Slave Law was made; before Massachusetts agreed to help the South catch runaway slaves.

My grandmother, who was scared because her family was always in danger, came to me looking worried. She said, "What if the mayor of Boston replies that you haven’t been there? Then he’ll think the letter is fake, and maybe he’ll find out something, and we’ll all get into trouble. Oh Linda, I wish you hadn’t sent those letters.” 

“Don’t worry, grandmother,” I said. “The mayor of Boston won’t bother hunting for slaves just for Dr. Flint.

The letters will help in the end. I will get out of this dark place one way or another.” 

“I hope you do, child,” said my kind, patient old friend. “You’ve been here a long time, almost five years; but when you do get out, your cleverness will beat everything.”
