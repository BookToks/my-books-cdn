I think those few coals actually made me cry. I believe the medicines helped me a little, but I got better very slowly. Dark thoughts went through my mind as I lay there day after day. I tried to be thankful for my small cell, even though it was gloomy, and even to love it, because it was part of the price I paid to save my children. Sometimes I thought God was a kind Father, who would forgive my sins because of my suffering. Other times, it felt like there was no fairness or kindness from God. I asked why slavery was allowed to exist, and why I had been treated so badly from when I was young. These questions felt like a mystery that I still don’t fully understand, but I hope I will someday.

While I was sick, my grandmother broke down from all the worry and hard work. Losing her, who had always been my best friend and a mother to my children, was the hardest thing I had faced so far. Oh, how much I prayed for her to get better! It was so hard not being able to take care of her, since she had taken such good care of me for so long!

One day, the screams of a child gave me enough strength to crawl to my little hole and look out. I saw my son covered in blood. A fierce dog, usually kept chained, had bitten him. A doctor was called, and I heard my child’s groans and screams while his wounds were being sewn up. Oh, it was such pain for a mother’s heart to hear this and not be able to go to him!

But childhood is like a day in spring, changing all the time, even in prison.
