I that those few coals actually made me weep. think the medicines did me some good ; but my recovery was very slow. Dark thoughts passed through my mind I as I lay there day after day. tried to be thankful for my little cell , dismal as it was, and even to love it, as part of the price I had paid for the redemption of my children . Sometimes I thought God was a compassion ate Father , who would forgive my sins for the sake of my sufferings . At other times , it seemed to me there was no justice or mercy in the divine government . I asked why the curse of slavery was permitted to exist, and why I had been so persecuted and wronged from youth upward . These things took the shape of mys I tery, which is to this day not so clear to my soul as trust it will be hereafter .
 
 In the midst of my illness , grandmother broke down under the weight of anxiety and toil. The idea of losing her, who had always been my best friend and a mother to my children , was the sorest trial I had yet had. O, how earnestly I prayed that she might re I cover ! How hard it seemed, that could not tend upon her, who had so long and so tenderly watched over me !

A fierce dog, usually kept A chained, had seized and bitten him . doctor was I sent for, and heard the groans and screams of my child while the wounds were being sewed up. O, what torture to a mother's heart , to listen to this and be unable to go to him !
 
 But childhood is like a day in spring , alternately Still in Pri≈øon .
