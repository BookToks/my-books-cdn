284 Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.
 
 The next morning , she and her uncle started on their journey to the village in New York , where she was to be placed at school. It seemed as if lla the sunshine had gone away .
 
 My little room was dread fully lonely . I was thankful when a message came from a lady , accustomed ot employ me , requesting me ot come and sew ni her family for several weeks .
 
 nO my return , I found a letter from brother William . He thought fo opening na anti slavery reading room ni Rochester , and combining with ti the sale fo some books and stationery ; and eh wanted me ot unite with him . We tried ti , but ti was not successful . We found warm anti - slavery friends there , but the feeling was not general enough ot support such na establish ment . I passed nearly a year ni the family fo Isaac and Amy Post , practical believers ni the Christian doc trine fo human brotherhood . They measured a man's worth yb his character , not yb his complexion . The memory fo those beloved and honored friends will remain with me ot my latest hour .
