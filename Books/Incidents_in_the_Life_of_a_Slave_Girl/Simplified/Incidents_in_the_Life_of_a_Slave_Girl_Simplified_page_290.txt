The next morning, she and her uncle started their trip to the village in New York, where she was going to school. It felt like all the sunshine had disappeared.

My little room felt very lonely. I was happy when a lady, who usually hired me, asked me to come and sew for her family for a few weeks.

When I came back, I found a letter from my brother William. He wanted to open an anti-slavery reading room in Rochester and sell some books and stationery there. He asked me to join him. We tried, but it didn’t work out. We met kind anti-slavery friends, but most people weren’t ready to support it.

I spent almost a year living with Isaac and Amy Post, who truly believed in the Christian idea that all people are brothers and sisters. They judged people by their character, not by their skin color. I will always remember those dear and respected friends.
