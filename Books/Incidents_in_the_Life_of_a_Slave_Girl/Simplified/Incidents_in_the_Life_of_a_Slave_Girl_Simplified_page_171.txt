“Everybody will hear you.” I tried to listen to her. She lay down and quickly fell asleep, but I couldn’t fall asleep no matter what.

At dawn, Betty got up and went to the kitchen. Hours passed, and I kept thinking about the vision from the night. After a while, I heard two women talking near the door. One was the housemaid. The other said, “Did you know Linda Brent’s children were sold to the speculator yesterday? They say old master Flint was really happy to see them driven out of town, but now they say the kids have come back.

I guess it’s all their daddy’s doing.

They say he bought William too.

Wow!

How will old master Flint react?

I’m going over to Aunt Marthy’s to find out what’s going on.” 

I bit my lip hard to stop myself from crying out. Were my children with their grandmother now, or had the speculator taken them away? The waiting was so hard. Would Betty come and finally tell me the truth?

At last, she came, and I quickly told her what I had heard.

She smiled big and said, “Oh, you silly thing! I’m going to tell you everything.

The girls are eating breakfast, and Missus told me to tell you. But, poor thing, it’s not right to keep you waiting, so I’m going to tell you now. Brother and the children were all bought by your daddy! I laugh a lot just thinking about old master Flint. Oh, how he’s going to swear! He’s caught this time for sure. But I better get out of here before those girls come and catch me.” 

Betty left laughing, and I thought to myself, “Can it really be true that my children are free? I have not suffered for nothing.

Thank God!”
