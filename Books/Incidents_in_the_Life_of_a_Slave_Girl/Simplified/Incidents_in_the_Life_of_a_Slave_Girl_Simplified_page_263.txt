I thought her real reason was that she was scared I might take her property away from her. Maybe I was wrong to think that, but knowing Southerners, it was hard for me to believe anything else.

My life had both good and bad moments, and I was glad it wasn’t all bad anymore.

I loved Mrs. Bruce’s baby. When it laughed and made happy sounds in my face, and wrapped its little arms around my neck, it reminded me of when Benny and Ellen were babies, and it made my hurt heart feel better.

One bright morning, as I stood by the window holding the baby, I noticed a young man in a sailor’s uniform looking closely at every house as he walked by. I looked at him carefully. Could it be my brother William?

It had to be him — but he looked so different! I put the baby down safely, ran downstairs, opened the front door, called the sailor over, and in less than a minute I was hugging my brother.

We had so much to tell each other! We laughed and cried while sharing stories about what had happened to us. I took him to Brooklyn, and he saw Ellen again, the sweet child he had loved and cared for while I was stuck in my sad room. He stayed in New York for a week.

His old feelings of love for me and Ellen were still strong. There are some bonds that are as strong as the ones formed by going through hard times together.
