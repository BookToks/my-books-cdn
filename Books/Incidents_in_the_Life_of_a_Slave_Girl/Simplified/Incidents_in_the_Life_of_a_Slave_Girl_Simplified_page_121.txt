The Church and Slavery. There is a big difference between Christianity and religion in the South. If a man goes to communion and pays money to the church, even if it comes from something bad, people call him religious. If a pastor has children with a woman who is not his wife, the church will kick him out if she is white. But if she is a Black woman, he can still stay as their leader.

When I heard that Dr. Flint joined the Episcopal church, I was really surprised. I thought religion would make people better. But the worst bad things he did happened after he joined the church. The day after he was confirmed, he talked like he hadn’t changed at all.

I reminded him that he just joined the church. He said, “Yes, Linda, it was the right thing to do. I’m getting older, and my place in society needs it. It also stops all the bad language.”

He told me, “You should join the church too, Linda.” I said, “There are already too many sinners.” He replied, “If I could live like a Christian, I would be glad.” Then he said, “You can do what I say, and if you are loyal to me, you will be as good as my wife.”

I said the Bible didn’t say that. He got very angry and shouted, “How dare you preach to me about your stupid Bible!”
