74 got a hundred more lashes. When his own work was taken from him, he stole food because he was hungry. That was his crime.

Another neighbor was Mrs. Wade. There was never a break from the whipping at her house. Her work started at dawn and didn’t stop until long after dark. The barn was the worst place. There, she whipped one of her old slaves with the strength of a man.

The old slave once told me, “It’s hell in missis’s house. Seems like I can never get out. Day and night I pray to die.” The mistress died before the old woman, and before she died, she asked her husband not to let any slaves see her after she was dead. But a slave who had cared for her children, and still had a child to look after, sneaked with the child into the room where the dead mistress lay. She looked at her for a while, then hit her twice in the face and said, “The devil has got you now!” She forgot the child was watching. The child had just started talking and said to her father, “I saw ma, and mammy did strike ma,” while hitting her own face with her little hand.

The master was shocked. He didn’t know how the nurse got into the locked room with the dead body. He asked her about it. She admitted the child was right and told how she got the key. Because of this, she was sold to Georgia.

When I was a kid, I knew a special slave named Charity, and everyone loved her.

Her young mistress got married and took Charity to Louisiana. Her Sketches of Neighboring Slaveholders.
