She accused me of something I didn’t do, but I could tell from the way she looked at me that she didn’t believe me.

I wondered why God was putting me through such hard times and if even worse days were coming.

While I was thinking about this, the door quietly opened and William came in.

“Well, brother,” I asked, “what’s wrong this time?”

“Oh, Linda, Ben and his master had a terrible fight!” he said.

At first, I thought maybe Benjamin was hurt badly.

“Don’t be scared, Linda,” William said. “I’ll tell you everything.” It turned out that Benjamin’s master had called for him, but Benjamin didn’t come right away.

When he finally did, his master got mad and started to whip him.

Benjamin fought back. They struggled, and in the end, Benjamin threw his master down.

Benjamin was scared because he had just knocked down one of the richest men in town. I waited nervously to see what would happen next.

That night, I snuck out of my grandmother’s house, and Benjamin also sneaked away from his master’s place to come there.

My grandmother had gone to visit an old friend in the country for a day or two. 

“I came to say goodbye,” Benjamin said. “I’m leaving.”

I asked, “Where are you going?”

“To the north,” he answered.

I looked at him to see if he was serious. I saw the determination in his eyes. I begged him not to go.
