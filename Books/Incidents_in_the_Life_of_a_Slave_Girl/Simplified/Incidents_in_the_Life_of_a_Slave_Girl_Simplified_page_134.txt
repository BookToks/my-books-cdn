Your stubbornness made me do this. You expect me to obey like I do my own kids, but I still see you as a child." He stopped, waiting for me to say something, but I stayed quiet.

"Why don’t you say anything?" he asked. "What are you waiting for?" "Nothing," I said.

"Then you accept my offer?" "No," I replied. He was about to lose his temper but held it back and said, "You answered without thinking. You should know there are two parts to my offer; if you refuse the good one, you have to take the bad one.

You either accept my offer, or you and your kids will be sent to your young master’s plantation, where you’ll stay until your young mistress gets married. Your children will be treated like all the other enslaved kids there.

I’ll give you a week to think about it." He was clever, but I knew I couldn’t trust him.

I told him I was ready to answer right then.

"I won’t take it now," he said. "You decide too quickly without thinking.

Remember, you and your children can be free for a week from today if you want." The future of my children depended on this terrible choice! I knew my master’s offer was a trap, and if I took it, I’d never escape.

As for his promise, I knew him well enough to be sure that if he gave me freedom papers, they’d be fake and worthless.

The choice was forced. I decided to go to the plantation.

But then I thought about how much more he would keep tormenting me.
