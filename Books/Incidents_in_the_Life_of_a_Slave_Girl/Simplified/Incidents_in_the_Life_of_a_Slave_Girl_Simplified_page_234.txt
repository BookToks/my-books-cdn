Not just for your sake, but for hers too. You can’t ignore that she is struggling under her heavy burdens. I wasn’t blind to it. I knew that hiding the truth made her very anxious, and the older she got, the more scared she was of being found out. My uncle talked with her and finally convinced her that I absolutely had to take the chance that came up unexpectedly.

The thought of being free was almost too much for my weak body. I felt excited but also confused at the same time.

I got busy getting ready for my trip, and planned for my son to come with me. I decided to talk with him before I left, so I could give him advice and tell him how much I would be waiting for him up north.

Grandmother sneaked away from me as often as she could to whisper advice. She insisted I write to Dr. Flint as soon as I got to the Free States, asking him to sell me from her.

She said she would give up her house and everything she owned just to have me safe with my children anywhere in the world. If she could only live to know that, she could die in peace.

I promised the dear old loyal friend that I would write to her as soon as I arrived and send the letter in a safe way to reach her. But in my heart, I decided not to spend another cent of her hard-earned money to pay greedy slaveholders for what they called their property.

Even if I hadn’t been unwilling to buy what I already had a right to own, common decency would have stopped me. Preparing to Escape.
