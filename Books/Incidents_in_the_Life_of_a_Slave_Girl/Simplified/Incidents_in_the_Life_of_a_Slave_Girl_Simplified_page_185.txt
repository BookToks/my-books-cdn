Christmas was coming soon. Grandmother gave me supplies, and I spent time making new clothes and little toys for my children. If it weren’t for hiring day coming up, when many families might be split apart, Christmas could be a happy time for the poor slaves. Even slave mothers try to make their kids happy on Christmas.

Benny and Ellen had their Christmas stockings filled.

Their mother, who was locked up, couldn’t see how surprised and happy they were. But I got to watch them go outside wearing their new clothes. I heard Benny ask a friend if Santa Claus brought him anything. The friend said, “Yes, but Santa Claus isn’t a real man. It’s the kids’ moms who put things in the stockings.” Benny said, “No, that can’t be, because Santa Claus brought Ellen and me these clothes, and my mom has been gone for a long time.” I wanted to tell him that his mother made those clothes and cried while she worked on them!

Every child wakes up early on Christmas morning to see the Johnkannaus. Without them, Christmas wouldn’t be the same.
