The letter confused and upset me.  

Had my child’s father just left her there because she was old enough to take care of herself? Or had he given her to his cousin like a piece of property? If that was true, his cousin might come back from the South anytime and treat Ellen like a slave.  

I tried not to think about the horrible idea that such a terrible thing could happen to her. I told myself, “Surely people are fair.” Then I remembered sadly how slavery changes the way people feel and act.  

I looked at my cheerful boy. He thought he was free, but if he was made a slave, it would be too much for me to handle. I wished so badly to keep him safe and far away from that cruel power!
