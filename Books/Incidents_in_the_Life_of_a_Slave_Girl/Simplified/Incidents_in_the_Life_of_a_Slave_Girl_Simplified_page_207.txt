Important Time in My Brother's Life

I missed my brother William a lot. He had gone to Washington with his boss, Mr. Sands. We got some letters from William, but he didn’t mention me. Still, I could tell he hadn’t forgotten me.

I pretended to be someone else and wrote back to him the same way. The meeting in Washington lasted a long time. When it ended, William wrote to say that Mr. Sands was going north for a while and that William would go with him. I knew Mr. Sands promised to free William someday, but didn’t say when. Would William really trust that hope?

I remembered how we used to talk when we were kids about getting our freedom. I wasn’t sure if William would ever come back.

Grandma got a letter from Mr. Sands. He said William was a loyal servant and a good friend. He also said no mother could have raised a better boy. Mr. Sands said they traveled through the North and Canada. Some people who wanted to end slavery tried to convince William to leave, but he didn’t. Mr. Sands said they would be home soon.

We waited for letters from William about his trip, but none came. After a while, people said Mr. Sands would come back late.
