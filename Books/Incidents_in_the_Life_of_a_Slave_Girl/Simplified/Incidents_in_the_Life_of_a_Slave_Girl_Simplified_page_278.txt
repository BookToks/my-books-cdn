If the case went to trial, Mrs. Bruce took me in a carriage to a friend’s house. She promised I would be safe there until my brother arrived in a few days. During that time, I kept thinking a lot about Ellen. She was my family by birth and by Southern law because my grandmother had the papers that made her mine. I didn’t feel she was safe unless she was with me.

Mrs. Hobbs felt bad about her brother’s betrayal and agreed to help me, but only if she could come back in ten days. I didn’t promise anything. When she came, Ellen was wearing thin, old clothes that didn’t fit and carrying a school bag with a few things inside. It was late October, and I knew the child must be cold. I didn’t dare go out to buy anything, so I took off my own warm skirt and made it into one for her.

Kind Mrs. Bruce came to say goodbye, and when she saw I had given my clothes to my child, tears came to her eyes. She said, “Wait for me, Linda,” and left. She soon came back with a warm shawl and hood for Ellen.

People like her truly deserve to be in heaven.

My brother got to New York on Wednesday.

Lawyer Hopper told us to go to Boston by a route through Stonington because fewer Southerners traveled that way. Mrs. Bruce told her servants to say I used to live there but had left the city.

We safely reached the steamboat Rhode Island.

The boat hired Black workers, but I knew Black passengers were not allowed in the cabin.
