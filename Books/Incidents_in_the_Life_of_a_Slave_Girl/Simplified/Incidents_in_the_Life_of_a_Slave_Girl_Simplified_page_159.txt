I didn’t know who I was going to meet or where I was going. I didn’t like moving around like that, not knowing anything, but I had no choice.

I knew I couldn’t stay where I was. So, I changed my clothes, got up the courage to face whatever was coming, and went to the place I was told.

My friend Betty was there; she was the last person I expected to see. We walked quickly without saying a word.

The pain in my leg was so bad it felt like I might fall, but fear gave me the strength to keep going.

We got to the house and went inside without anyone noticing. Her first words were, “Honey, now you’re safe.

Those bad guys aren’t coming to look for you here.

When I get you to missis’ safe place, I’ll bring you some hot food. I guess you need it after all this scary stuff.” Betty always thought eating was the most important thing.

She didn’t realize my heart was too full for me to care much about food.

The lady of the house came to meet us and took me upstairs to a small room above her bedroom.

“You’ll be safe here, Linda,” she said. “I use this room to store things we don’t need.

The girls don’t usually get sent here, and they won’t suspect anything unless they hear noise. I always keep it locked, and Betty will hold the key. But you must be very careful, for my sake and your own; and you must never tell anyone my secret because it would ruin me and my family. I’ll keep the girls busy in the morning so Betty can bring you breakfast, but she won’t come to you again until night. I’ll visit you sometimes. Stay strong. I hope this won’t last too long.”
