I didn’t accept the kind offer because it would have meant kicking out my old relative, who was very sick and close to dying.  

I wasn’t ready to escape on a boat, but I won’t go into more details. The boat was delayed for several days anyway.  

Meanwhile, news came to town about a terrible murder of a runaway slave named James. Charity, his mother, was someone we had known for a long time.  

I told some nearby slave owners about the shocking details of his death. My grandmother, who was always very nervous about runaways, got really scared.  

She believed the same thing would happen to me if I didn’t stop trying to escape. She cried, begged me not to go, and was very upset. Her fear affected me, and I felt sad too. I was very disappointed but promised to give up my plan.  

When my friend Peter heard this, he was both upset and annoyed.  

He said that, based on what we’d been through before, it might be a long time before I had a chance like that again. I told him the chance wouldn’t be wasted because I had a friend nearby who would gladly take the place that was meant for me. I told him about poor Fanny and a kind, brave man who never ignored anyone in trouble, whether they were white or black, and who was ready to help her.  

Aggie was very surprised when she found out we knew her secret.  

She was happy to hear about the chance for Fanny.
