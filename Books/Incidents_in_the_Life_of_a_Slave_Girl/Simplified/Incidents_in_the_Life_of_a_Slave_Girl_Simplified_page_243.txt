I never knew how we got to the wharf. My head was spinning, and my legs felt weak. At the meeting spot, we found my uncle Phillip, who had left earlier on a different path so he could get to the wharf first and warn us if there was any danger. A rowboat was ready. Just as I was about to step in, I felt a gentle tug. I turned and saw Benny looking pale and worried.

He whispered in my ear, "I've been watching the doctor's window, and he's at home. Goodbye, mother. Don't cry; I'll come." Then he hurried away. I held tight to my good uncle’s hand, the man I owed so much to, and to Peter, the brave and kind friend who risked everything to keep me safe.

I still remember how happy his face looked when he told me he had found a safe way for me to escape. But even though Peter was smart, brave, and kind, the law treated him like property—a thing to be bought and sold like horses or pigs! We said nothing as we parted.

Our hearts were too full for words.

The boat moved quickly over the water.

After a while, one of the sailors said, “Don’t be scared, madam. We will take you safely to your husband.” At first, I didn’t understand what he meant.
