The Fugitive Slave Law caused a lot of pain. But did the lawmakers care about the suffering they were causing to innocent people?

When my brother William spent his last night with me before he left for California, we talked almost nonstop about how this unfair law was hurting our people. I had never seen him so angry and upset with those who were hurting us.

William was not affected by the law because he was brought to the Free States by his master and didn’t run away from a Slave State. But I was affected by it, and so were many smart and hardworking people around me.

I hardly ever went outside. When I had to run errands for Mrs. Bruce or her family, I tried to use back streets and quiet paths as much as possible.

It’s shameful for a city that calls itself free to let innocent people live in constant fear without any protection.

Because of this, many groups formed to watch out for each other. Every Black person and their supporters stayed alert. Every night, I read the newspapers carefully to see if Southerners were staying at local hotels. I did this for my own safety, hoping my young mistress and her husband were safe. I also wanted to help others by sharing information, because many were escaping and needed to know what was going on. This is one of my memories from the South.
