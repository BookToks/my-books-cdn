The Loophole of Retreat. 175

My uncle had left a hole open when he made the trap-door. I was as happy as Robinson Crusoe finding a treasure. It gave me a lucky idea. I thought, “Now I will have some light. Now I can see my children.”

I didn’t dare start my work during the day because I was afraid someone would notice me. But I felt around and found the side facing the street, where I could often see my children. I stuck the gimlet in and waited for evening. I drilled three rows of holes, one above the other, then I drilled out the spaces between them.

This way, I made one hole about an inch long and half an inch wide. I sat by it late into the night, enjoying the little bit of air that came in. In the morning, I watched for my children. The first person I saw on the street was Dr. Flint. I felt a strange, bad feeling that it was a sign of something wrong. Several familiar faces passed by.

At last, I heard the happy laughter of children, and soon two sweet little faces looked up at me, as if they knew I was there and were happy to see me.

How I wished I could tell them I was there!

My situation was a little better now. But for weeks, I was tormented by hundreds of tiny red bugs, as small as a needle’s point, that bit through my skin and caused a burning pain.

The kind grandmother gave me herb teas and cooling medicine, and finally, I got rid of the bugs. The heat in my small room was very strong because only thin shingles kept out the hot summer sun. But I had some comfort.

Through my little hole, I could watch the children, and when they were close enough, I could hear what they said.
