If he wasn’t careful about how he acted in the future, he could be in trouble.

As the months went by, my boy got healthier.

When he turned one year old, people said he was beautiful.

The little child was becoming a big part of my life, but loving him also made me feel pain. When I was very sad, his smiles made me feel better. I loved watching him sleep, but I was always worried. I could never forget that he was a slave.

Sometimes, I even wished he would die as a baby. God was testing me.

My darling got very sick.

His bright eyes became dull, and his little hands and feet were so cold that I thought he was already dead. I had asked God to take him away before, but now I begged very hard for him to live. And my prayer was answered. But it felt cruel for a slave mother to try to save her dying child.

Death is better than slavery. It was sad that I didn’t have a name to give my child.

His father was kind to him and took care of him whenever he could.

The father didn’t want the child to have his name, but he had no legal right to give it. If I had given the boy his name, my master would have seen it as a crime, a kind of disrespect, and might have punished the boy. Oh, slavery is like a poisonous snake with many sharp fangs!
