I was 192 steps down on the floor. My grandmother got scared because I was in danger, so she came into the storeroom in the dark and locked the door behind her. “Linda,” she whispered, “where are you?” “I am here by the window,” I answered. “I couldn’t let him leave without making sure the children were taken care of.”

“Who knows what might happen?” I said. “Come, come, child,” she said, “you can’t stay here another minute. You made a mistake, but I don’t blame you, poor thing!”

I told her I couldn’t go back without help, and she had to call my Uncle Phillip. Uncle came, and because he felt sorry for me, he didn’t get mad. He carried me back to my room, gently laid me on the bed, gave me some medicine, and asked if I needed anything else. Then he left, and I was alone with my thoughts, as dark as the night without stars.

My friends were afraid I would be hurt for life. I was so tired of being trapped for so long that, if it weren’t for hoping to take care of my children, I might have been ready to give up. But for their sake, I was willing to keep going.
