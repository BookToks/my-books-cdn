Mr. Durham insisted I have dinner with him first, then he would help me find my friends. The sailors came to say goodbye. I shook their strong hands with tears in my eyes. They had been kind to us and done more for us than they probably knew.  

I had never seen such a big city or met so many people on the streets. It seemed like everyone who passed looked at me with curiosity.
