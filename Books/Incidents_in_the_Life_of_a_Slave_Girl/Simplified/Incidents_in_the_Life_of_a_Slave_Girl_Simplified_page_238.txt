In less than twenty-four hours, he told me to get on the boat if I could. If not, I should stay very still in my hiding place, where they wouldn’t be able to find me without tearing the house apart. He said he couldn’t get involved because it would make people suspicious, but he promised to talk to Peter.  

I didn’t want to ask him again since I had already involved him a lot, but I had no other choice. Even though Peter was annoyed with me for being unsure, he was kind and said he would do his best to help, hoping I would be stronger this time.  

Peter went straight to the wharf and saw that the wind had changed. The boat was slowly moving down the river.  

Using some excuse, he offered two boatmen a dollar each to help him catch up with the boat.  

Peter looked lighter-skinned than the men he hired, and when the captain saw them coming so fast, he thought the police were chasing his boat because of the runaway slave on board. They raised the sails, but Peter’s boat caught up, and Peter jumped on board.  

The captain recognized him right away.  

Peter asked the captain to go below deck to talk about a bad bill he had given him. When he explained why he was there, the captain said, “The woman is already here, and I hid her where you’d have a very hard time finding her.”  

“But there’s another woman I want to bring,” said Peter. “She’s in big trouble too, and we’ll pay you anything fair if you stop and take her.”
