My mother was asking about me. She told him she hadn’t seen me and thought I was at the plantation. He looked at her closely and asked, “Don’t you know anything about her running away?” She said no. Then he said, “Last night she ran off for no reason.

We treated her very kindly. My wife liked her. She will be found and brought back soon.

Are her children with you?” When he was told they were, he said, “I’m glad to hear that. If they are here, she can’t be far. If I find out any of my slaves helped her, I’ll give them five hundred lashes.” As he was leaving his father’s place, he turned around and added, “Let her be brought back, and she can have her children live with her.” The news made the old doctor very angry.

It was a busy day for them.

My grandmother’s house was searched completely.

My trunk was empty, so they thought I took my clothes with me. Before ten o’clock, every ship going north was checked, and the law against hiding runaway slaves was read to everyone on board. At night, the town was guarded.

I knew my grandmother would be upset, and I wanted to send her a message, but I couldn’t.

Everyone going to or from her house was watched closely.

The doctor said he would take my children unless she promised to take care of them, which she agreed to.

The next day was spent searching. The night before, this ad was posted everywhere in town and nearby: Flight.
