“What's her name?” asked the captain.

“Linda,” he replied.

“That’s the name of the woman already here,” said the captain. “By George! I think you’re trying to trick me.” 

“Oh!” said Peter. “God knows I wouldn't hurt you at all. I’m too thankful to you. But there really is another woman in great danger. Please have some kindness and stop to take her!”

After a while, they came to an agreement. Fanny, who didn’t know I was nearby, had used my name, though she called herself Johnson. “Linda is a common name,” said Peter, “and the woman I want to bring is Linda Brent.” The captain agreed to wait at a certain place until evening, after being paid well for his time.

Of course, the day was a stressful one for me.

But we figured that if Jenny had seen me, she wouldn’t be dumb enough to tell her mistress. She probably wouldn’t get to see Dr. Flint’s family until evening, because I knew the rules in that house. Later, I believed she never saw me at all; she was the kind of awful person who would easily betray someone suffering for just thirty pieces of silver.

I planned to get on board as soon as it was dark. I decided to spend the time before that with my son. I hadn’t spoken to him for seven years, even though I had been under the same roof and saw him every day when I was well enough to look through a small opening. I didn’t dare go beyond that.
