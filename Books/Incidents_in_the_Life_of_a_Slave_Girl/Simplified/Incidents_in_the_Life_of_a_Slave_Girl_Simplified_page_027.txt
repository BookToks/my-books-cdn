I know it. For a long time, she had been giving many families crackers and preserves. Because of this, everyone called her “Aunt Marthy,” and everyone who knew her respected how smart and good she was. People also knew she had worked for the family for a long time, and her mistress planned to free her.

When the day of the sale came, she was put up for auction like property, and she walked up onto the auction block. Many people shouted, “Shame! Shame! Who is going to sell you, Aunt Marthy? Don’t stand there! That’s not the place for you.” She didn’t say anything and waited quietly to see what would happen. No one wanted to buy her. 

Finally, a weak voice said, “Fifty dollars.” It was from an old lady who was seventy years old, the sister of my grandmother’s old mistress. She had lived with my grandmother for forty years and knew how well Aunt Marthy had worked and how unfairly she had been treated. She decided to help her. The auctioneer waited for someone to offer more money, but no one did. Aunt Marthy couldn’t read or write, so she signed the bill of sale with an X.

But that didn’t matter because the old lady had a big heart full of kindness. She gave Aunt Marthy her freedom.

At that time, my grandmother was just fifty years old. Many hard years had passed since then. Now, my brother and I were slaves to the man who had cheated my grandmother out of her money and tried to cheat her out of her freedom. One of my mother’s sisters, called Aunt Nancy, was also a slave in his family.

She was a kind and good aunt to me and helped me.
