Mother was kneeling next to her. His eyes got watery for a moment as he said she had always been a loyal worker, and no one could ever replace her. Mrs. Flint went to bed, feeling very shocked. While my grandmother was alone with the dead, the doctor arrived, bringing his youngest son, who Aunt Nancy really loved and cared for.

“Martha,” she said, “Aunt Nancy loved this boy, and when she goes where you are, I hope you will be kind to him because of her.” She answered, “Your wife was like a daughter to me, Dr. Flint, the foster sister of my poor Nancy, and if you think I can feel anything but kindness for her children, you don’t know me.”

“I wish we could forget the past and never think about it,” he said. “And I hope Linda would come to take her aunt’s place. She would be worth more to us than all the money in the world. I wish this for your sake too, Martha. Now that Nancy is gone from you, Linda would be a great comfort in your old age.”

He knew he was touching a sensitive spot. Almost choking with sadness, my grandmother said, “I was not the one who made Linda leave. My grandchildren are gone; and out of my nine children, only one is left. God help me!”

To me, the death of this kind relative was a deep sadness. I knew she had been slowly worn down, and I felt my troubles helped finish the job. After I heard she was sick, I kept listening for news from the big house, hoping I could still see Aunt Nancy.
