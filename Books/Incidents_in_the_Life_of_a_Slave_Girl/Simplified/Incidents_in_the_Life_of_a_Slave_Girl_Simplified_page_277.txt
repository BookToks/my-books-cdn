There was no time to explain. He was nowhere to be found.

The servants said they saw him leave with a letter, and they thought he went to the post office. It seemed like he had sent a copy of those papers to Dr. Flint. When he came back, his sister accused him, and he didn’t deny it. He went straight to his room, and the next morning, he was gone. He had left for New York before anyone else was awake.

I knew I had to act fast, so I hurried back to the city feeling very sad. Again, I was being taken away from a safe home, and all my plans to help my children were ruined by slavery! I wished I had told Mrs. Bruce my story before. I didn’t want to tell her because I was afraid she would worry since I was running away. I cared about what she thought and didn’t want to lose her respect. But now, I felt she needed to know my situation. I had left her suddenly before without explaining, and I didn’t want to do that again. I decided to tell her everything the next morning.

But she noticed I looked upset, and before bedtime, I told her everything. She listened with real kindness and said she wished she could protect me.

I felt so grateful to her!

Early the next morning, Judge Vanderpool and Lawyer Hopper were asked for advice. They said I should leave the city right away because the danger was too great.
