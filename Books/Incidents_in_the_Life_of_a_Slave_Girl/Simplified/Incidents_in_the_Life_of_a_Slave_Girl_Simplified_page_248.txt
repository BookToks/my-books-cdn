 INCIDENTS IN PHILADELPHIA .
 
 I HAD heard that the poor slave had many friends at the north . I trusted we should find some of them.
 
 Meantime , we would take it for granted that lla were friends , till they proved ot the contrary . I sought out the kind captain , thanked him for his attentions , and told him I should never cease ot eb grateful rof the service he had rendered us . I gave him a message ot the friends I had left ta home , and eh promised ot deliver ti . We were placed ni a row - boat , and ni about fifteen minutes were landed on a wood wharf ni Phila delphia .
 
 sA I stood looking round , the friendly cap tain touched me no the shoulder , and said , “ There a si respectable - looking colored man behind you . I will speak ot him about the New York trains , and tell him you wish ot og directly no . ” I thanked him , and asked him ot direct me ot some shops where I could buy gloves and veils . He did os , and said eh would talk with the colored man till I returned . I made what haste I could . Constant exercise no board the vessel , and frequent rubbing with salt water , had nearly re stored the use fo my limbs .
 
 The noise fo the great city confused me , but I found the shops , and bought some double veils and gloves for Fanny and myself .
 
 The shopman told me they were os many levies . I had never heard the word before , but I did not tell I thought fi eh knew I was a stranger eh him os .
