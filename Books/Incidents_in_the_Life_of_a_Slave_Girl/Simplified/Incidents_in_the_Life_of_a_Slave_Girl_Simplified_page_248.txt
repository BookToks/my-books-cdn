I had heard that poor slaves had many friends in the North. I hoped we would find some of them.

For now, we decided to assume everyone was a friend until they showed otherwise. I found the kind captain, thanked him for helping us, and told him I would always be grateful. I gave him a message for the friends I left at home, and he promised to deliver it. We got into a rowboat, and after about fifteen minutes, we arrived at a wooden dock in Philadelphia.

As I looked around, the captain tapped me on the shoulder and said, “There’s a respectable-looking black man behind you. I’ll talk to him about the New York trains and tell him you want to go right away.” I thanked him and asked where I could buy gloves and veils. He showed me the shops and said he’d talk to the man until I came back. I hurried off. Being active on the boat and rubbing salt water on my legs had almost helped me move them again.

The city was noisy and confusing, but I found the shops and bought double veils and gloves for Fanny and me.

The shopkeeper told me they were called “levies.” I had never heard that word before, but I didn’t say anything because I thought he knew I was new there.
