The New Tie to Life.

“You are my slave, and you will always be my slave. I will never sell you, you can count on that.” Hope left my heart when he shut the door behind him. I thought that in his anger he might sell me to a slave trader. I also knew that the father of my child was watching, ready to buy me.

Around this time, my uncle Phillip was coming back from a trip. The day before he left, I had been a bridesmaid for a young friend. My heart felt calm then, but my smile didn’t show the truth. Only one year had passed, but so many terrible things had happened.

My heart had grown heavy with sadness. Some lives are full of happiness, and others are full of tears. Our lives are shaped by what happens to us. No one knows what a year can bring.

I was happy when I heard my uncle had come.

He wanted to see me, even though he knew what had happened. At first, I didn’t want to, but finally I let him come to my room.

He treated me like he always had. Oh, how my heart hurt when I felt his tears on my hot cheeks! I remembered my grandmother’s words: “Maybe your parents were taken away to protect them from bad times.” My sad heart could now thank God for that. But I wondered, why did my family still hope for me? What could save me from the usual fate of slave girls?

Many who were prettier and smarter than me had suffered the same or even worse.

How could they think I would be different?

My uncle didn’t stay long, and I wasn’t sorry when he left.
