There was some crying. I went to check on my children and thanked God for their peaceful sleep.

Tears fell as I leaned over them. As I was about to leave, Benny moved. I turned back and whispered, “Mother is here.” After rubbing his eyes with his tiny fist, he opened them and sat up in bed, looking at me with curiosity.

Once he was sure it was me, he said, “Oh mother! You’re not dead, are you? They didn’t cut off your head and take you to the plantation, did they?” I didn’t have much time, and my guide was waiting. I laid Benny back in bed and wiped his tears with a promise to come back soon. We quickly walked back toward the plantation.

About halfway there, we saw four patrols coming. Luckily, we heard their horses before they saw us, so we hid behind a big tree.

They rode past, shouting loudly like they had just been partying. We were so glad they didn’t bring their dogs! We hurried to the plantation and heard the sound of the hand mill.

The slaves were grinding their corn.

We got safely into the house before the horn called them to work. I shared my little bit of food with my guide, knowing he missed grinding his corn and would have to work all day in the fields.

Mr. Flint often checked the house to make sure no one was lazy.

He trusted me to manage all the work because he didn’t know anything about it. Instead of hiring someone else, he was happy with how I handled things.

He had his eyes on the plantation.
