If he happens to change his mind, thinking it's okay to break a forced promise, bad luck for him if he gets caught!

The whip is used until blood flows down to his feet; his stiff limbs are chained, or he is dragged in the field for days and days.

Sometimes, maybe the same man will hire him again next year, without even giving him a chance to go to the hiring ground. After those for hire are gone, the ones for sale are called up.

You happy free women, compare your New Year's Day with that of the poor slave woman! For you, it is a happy time, full of light and blessings. Friendly wishes meet you everywhere, and gifts are given to you.

Even people who don’t usually care about you feel softer at this time, and lips that are usually quiet say, “I wish you a happy New Year.” Children bring little presents and ask for hugs.

They are yours, and nothing but death can take them away.

But for the slave mother, New Year's Day brings special sadness.

She sits on her cold cabin floor, watching the children who might be taken from her the next morning. Often, she wishes she and her children could die before the day begins.

She may not be educated, hurt by the system that has made her hard since childhood; but she has a mother's feelings and can feel a mother’s pain.

One of these sale days, I saw a mother lead seven children to the auction.

She knew some would be taken from her; but they took all of them. This is the slave’s New Year's Day.
