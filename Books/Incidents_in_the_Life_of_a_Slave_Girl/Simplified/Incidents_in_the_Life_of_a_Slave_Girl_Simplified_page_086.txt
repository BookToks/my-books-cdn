A mother, grandmother, or a kind woman might care about a slave girl. She might have someone she loves whose opinion and peace matter a lot to her. But the cruel men who control her are very hated by her. Still, she can’t fight back.

The slave owner’s sons grow up spoiled and bad because of the bad things around them. The owner’s daughters don’t always avoid trouble either. Sometimes, the owner gets punished for the wrong things he does to the slave girls.

The white daughters often hear their parents arguing about a female slave. They get curious and soon find out why. The slave girls who work for them talk about things kids shouldn’t hear. They know that the slave women must obey their father in everything, and sometimes the slave women have power over the slave men too. I have seen a slave owner who was ashamed because everyone knew his daughter had a child with one of the lowest slaves on the plantation.

She didn’t try to be with boys her age or even the smarter servants. She chose the worst slave, someone she could control easily and who wouldn’t cause problems. Her father was very angry and tried to get revenge on the slave man himself.
