A woman with light skin plays with her own fair-skinned children, and she knows well that they were born to her husband’s household. Jealousy and hatred come into the happy home, and it loses its beauty.

Southern women often marry men who are the fathers of many little slaves. They don’t worry about this.

They see these children as property, like the pigs on the farm, and they usually make sure the kids are sold to slave traders as soon as possible so they don’t have to see them. I’m glad to say there are some honorable exceptions.

I have known two southern wives who asked their husbands to free the slaves they cared for like their own children, and the husbands agreed. The husbands felt ashamed because their wives showed so much kindness. Even though the wives only asked for what was right, their husbands respected them and behaved better.

Secrets ended, and trust replaced doubt.

Even though slavery hurts the morals of white women a lot, it is not completely gone. I have heard southern ladies say about a man, “He not only thinks it’s shameful to be the father of those little slaves, but he’s not embarrassed to call himself their master.

I swear, things like this should not be allowed in any decent society!”
