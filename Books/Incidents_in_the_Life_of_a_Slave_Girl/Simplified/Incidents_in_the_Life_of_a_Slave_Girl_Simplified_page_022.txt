“Love your neighbor as yourself.” “Treat others the way you want to be treated.” But I was her slave, and I guess she didn’t see me as her neighbor. I wish I could erase that one big wrong from my memory.

As a child, I loved my mistress; and when I think back on the happy times I had with her, I try not to feel too bitter about this unfair act. While I was with her, she taught me to read and spell; and for this chance, which hardly any slave gets, I am thankful to her.

She didn’t have many slaves; and when she died, they were all split up among her family.

Five of them were my grandmother’s children, who had shared the same milk as her owner’s children. Even though my grandmother worked faithfully for her owners for a long time, not one of her children was spared from being sold at auction.

These living beings are worth less in the eyes of their masters than the cotton they pick or the horses they take care of.
