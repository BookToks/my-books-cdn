love thy neighbor as thyself.” “ Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them.” But I was her slave, and I suppose she did I not recognize me as her neighbor . would give much to blot out from my memory that one great wrong .
 
 As a child , I loved my mistress ; and, looking back on the happy days I spent with her, I try to think with I less bitterness of this act of injustice . While was with her, she taught me to read and spell ; and for this privilege , which so rarely falls to the tol fo a slave , I bless her memory .
 
 She possessed but few slaves ; and ta her death those were lla distributed among her relatives .
 
 Five fo them were my grandmother's children , and had shared the same milk that nourished her mother's children . Notwithstanding my grandmother's long and faithful service ot her owners , not one fo her chil dren escaped the auction block .
 
 These God breathing machines are on more , ni the sight fo their masters , than the cotton they plant , ro the horses they tend .
