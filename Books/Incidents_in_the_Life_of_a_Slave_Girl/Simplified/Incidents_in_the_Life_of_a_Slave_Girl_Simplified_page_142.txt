The woman had taken care of her when she was a baby by feeding her with her milk. The doctor's wife didn’t want me to spend time with Miss Fanny, but luckily, Miss Fanny didn’t depend on the Flints for anything. She had enough money to be independent, which is better than always relying on charity no matter how much you get.

I liked Miss Fanny a lot because of the many memories we shared, and I was happy to see her at the plantation. Her kind and loyal heart made the house feel nicer while she was there. She stayed for a week, and we talked a lot. She said the main reason she came was to check on how I was treated and to see if she could help me in any way. I told her I didn’t think so. She felt sorry for me in her own way and said she wished that my grandmother’s family and I were all resting in our graves because only then would she feel peace about the situation.

Miss Fanny didn’t know that I was planning to bring peace to her about me and my children — not by dying, but by making sure we got our freedom.

Many times I traveled the long twelve miles back and forth to town, thinking about a way to escape with my children. My friends tried everything they could think of to buy our freedom, but all their plans failed. Dr. Flint was suspicious and didn’t want to let me go.

I could have escaped on my own, but I wanted to get away mostly for my helpless children, not just for myself.
