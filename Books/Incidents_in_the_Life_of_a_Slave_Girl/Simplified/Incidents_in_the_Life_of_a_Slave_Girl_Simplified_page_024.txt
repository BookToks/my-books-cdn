Cold looks, cold words, and cold treatment. I was glad when night came. On my small bed, I moaned and cried. I felt so lonely and sad.

I had been there almost a year when a dear little friend of mine died. I heard her mother crying as they covered her only child’s coffin with dirt. I turned away from the grave, feeling thankful that I still had someone to love. I met my grandmother, who said, “Come with me, Linda.” From her voice, I knew something sad had happened.

She took me away from the crowd and then said, “My child, your father is dead.” Dead? How could I believe it? He died so suddenly, and I didn’t even know he was sick. I went home with my grandmother. My heart was angry with God for taking away my mother, father, boss, and friend. My kind grandmother tried to comfort me.

“Who knows God’s plans?” she said. “Maybe they were taken away to be safe from bad times.” Years later, I often thought about this.

She promised to be a mother to her grandchildren as much as she could. With her love, I went back to my master’s house. I thought I would be allowed to go to my father’s house the next morning, but instead, I was told to go pick flowers to decorate my mistress’s house for a party that night. I spent the day gathering flowers and making garlands while my father’s dead body was just a mile away. My owners didn’t care. To them, he was just property.

They even thought he had spoiled his children by teaching them to believe they were real human beings.
