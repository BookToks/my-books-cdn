cold looks , cold words , and cold treatment . We were I glad when the night came. On my narrow bed moaned and wept, I felt so desolate and alone.
 
 I had been there nearly a year , when a dear little friend of mine was buried . I heard her mother sob, I as the clods fell on the coffin of her only child , and I turned away from the grave, feeling thankful that still had something left to love. I met my grand mother , who said, “ Come with me, Linda ; ” and from I her tone knew that something sad had happened .
 
 She led me apart from the people , and then said, “ My I child , your father is dead." Dead ! How could believe it ? He had died so suddenly I had not I even heard that he was sick . went home with my grandmother . My heart rebelled against God , who had taken from me mother , father , mistress , and friend . The good grandmother tried to comfort me.
 
 “ Who knows the ways of God ?” said she. “ Perhaps they have been kindly taken from the evil days to לל come.” Years afterwards I often thought of this.
 
 She promised to be a mother to her grandchildren , so far as she might be permitted to do so ; and strength ened by her love, I returned to my master's . I thought I should be allowed to go to my father's house the next morning ; but I was ordered to go for flowers , that my mistress's house might be decorated for an evening I party . spent the day gathering flowers and weaving them into festoons, while the dead body of my father was lying within a mile of me. What cared my owners for that ? he was merely a piece of property .
 
 Moreover , they thought he had spoiled his children , by teaching them to feel that they were human beings.
