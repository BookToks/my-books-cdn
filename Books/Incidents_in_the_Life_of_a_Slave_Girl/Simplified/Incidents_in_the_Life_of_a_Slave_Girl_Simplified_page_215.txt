I recently heard about plans for my children and didn’t feel good about accepting them. He had promised to set them free, and it was time for him to keep that promise. I knew there was some danger nearby, but what wouldn’t a mother do for her kids?

He got the message and was surprised. He said, “The children are free. I never meant to keep them as slaves. Linda can decide what happens to them. I think it’s better to send them north because they aren’t safe here. Dr. Flint says they’re still under his control. He claims they belonged to his daughter, and since she was too young when they were sold, the contract isn’t legal.”

So, after everything I went through for my kids, they were stuck between two dangers: my old master and their new master! And I couldn’t do anything.

There was no law to protect me or help me.

Mr. Sands suggested that Ellen should live for now with some of his relatives who had moved to Brooklyn, Long Island. He promised she would be taken care of and sent to school. I agreed because it seemed the best choice for her. My grandmother handled the details, and Mrs. Sands didn’t know about it.

She said they would take Ellen to Washington and keep her until they found a good chance to send her to Brooklyn with friends. Mrs. Sands had a baby daughter. I had seen her once when the nurse walked by holding the baby.

It was hard for me to think that a slave’s child would have to take care of her free-born sister, but there was no other choice.
