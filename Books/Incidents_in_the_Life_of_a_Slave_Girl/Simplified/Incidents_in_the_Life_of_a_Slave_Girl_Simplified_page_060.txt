I had a room next to hers. She cared a lot about me, but it didn’t make her happy because she stayed awake many nights watching over me. Sometimes I woke up and saw her leaning over me. Other times, she whispered in my ear like she was talking to her husband. I listened to hear what I would say back. She surprised me, and then quietly slipped away. The next morning, she told me I had been talking in my sleep and asked who I was talking to.

After a while, I started to be scared for my life. People had threatened me before, and you can imagine how scary it was to wake up at night and see a jealous woman bending over you. Even though this was terrible, I was afraid something even worse would happen.

My mistress got tired of watching me all night because it didn’t work. She tried a new plan. She accused my master of a crime while I was there and said I was the one who said it. To my surprise, he replied, “I don’t believe it; but if she said it, you made her say it by hurting her.” He meant I forced her to tell on him. It was clear he had a very bad heart!

I understood he wanted to show me that I couldn’t get help from my mistress because he was still in control. I felt sorry for Mrs. Flint. She was his second wife and much younger than him. That old, mean man was really hard to deal with.
