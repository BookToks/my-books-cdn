She was smarter and better than most women. She was completely stuck and didn’t know what to do next. She wanted me to be whipped because she thought I lied, but the doctor never let anyone punish me like that. The old man was careful. If I had been whipped, people might have talked and found out the truth in front of his kids and grandkids. I was glad I lived in a small town where everyone knew each other! If I had been on a faraway plantation or lost in a big city, I might not be alive today.

The secrets of slavery were hidden, just like the secrets of the Inquisition. My master was, as far as I knew, the father of eleven slaves. But did the mothers dare to say who the real father of their children was? Did the other slaves talk about it, except in quiet whispers? No, they didn’t! They were too scared of what might happen.

My grandmother couldn’t help but notice things that made her suspicious. She worried about me and tried different ways to buy me. But the answer was always the same: “Linda doesn’t belong to me. She belongs to my daughter, and I don’t have the legal right to sell her.” The man was honest about that! He was too careful to sell me, but he didn’t care at all about doing a much worse wrong to the young girl he was supposed to protect, since I was his daughter’s property. Sometimes my abuser asked me if I wanted to be sold. I said I’d rather be sold to anyone than live the way I did.
