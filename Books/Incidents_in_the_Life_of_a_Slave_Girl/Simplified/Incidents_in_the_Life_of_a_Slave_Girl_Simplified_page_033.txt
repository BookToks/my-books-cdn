27 children were sold to a slave trader, and their mother was bought by a man in her own town. By night, her children were taken far away.

She begged the trader to tell her where he was going to take them, but he refused. How could he tell her when he planned to sell them one by one to whoever paid the most? I met that mother on the street, and her wild, tired face still stays in my mind. She wrung her hands in pain and shouted, “Gone! All gone! Why doesn’t God just kill me?”

I had no words to comfort her.

Stories like this happen every day, even every hour.

Slave owners have a way of getting rid of old slaves who are too worn out from hard work. I knew an old woman who served her master faithfully for seventy years.

She became almost helpless because of hard work and sickness.

Her owners moved to Alabama and left the old black woman to be sold to anyone who would pay twenty dollars for her.
