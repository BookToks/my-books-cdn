INCIDENTS IN THE LIFE OF A SLAVE GIRL.

WRITTEN BY HERSELF.

People in the North don’t really understand slavery.

They think it’s a kind of endless prison.

They don’t know how badly slavery hurts people. If they did, they would have worked harder to end such a terrible system.

A WOMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA

Stand up, all women who are comfortable! Listen to me, all you brave daughters!

Please listen to my words. ISAIAH 32:9.
