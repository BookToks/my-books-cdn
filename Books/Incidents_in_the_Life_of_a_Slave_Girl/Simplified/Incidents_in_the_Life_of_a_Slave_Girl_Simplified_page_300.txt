These letters made me feel both happy and sad. I was always glad to hear from the kind, faithful old friend from my difficult youth. But her messages of love made me want to see her before she died, and I felt sad because it was impossible.

A few months after I came back from New England, I got a letter from her. She wrote, “Dr. Flint is dead. He left a troubled family. Poor old man! I hope he made peace with God.” I remembered how he had cheated my grandmother out of the money she had worked hard to lend. I thought about how he had tried to take away the freedom her mistress promised her and how he had treated her children badly. I thought she must be a better Christian than me if she could forgive him completely.

I can’t honestly say that hearing about my old master’s death made me feel better about him.

Some wrongs don’t go away even after someone dies.

He was hateful to me when he was alive, and I still hate him now.

His death didn’t make me any safer.

He had threatened my grandmother that his family would keep me a slave after he died. He said I would never be free as long as one of his children lived. As for Mrs. Flint, I saw she had suffered more than I thought she would from losing her husband because she had already buried several children. But I never saw her become kinder or softer.

The doctor died with money problems and was finally free at last.
