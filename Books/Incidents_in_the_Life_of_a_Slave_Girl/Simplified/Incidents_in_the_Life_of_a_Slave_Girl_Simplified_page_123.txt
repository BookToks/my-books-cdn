I hadn't gone back to my master's house since my child was born. The old man was very angry that I was out of his control, but his wife promised, by everything good and great, that she would kill me if I came back—and she meant it.

Sometimes he would stay away for a while.

Then he would come back and repeat the same old speech about how patient he was and how ungrateful I was.

He tried, too much, to make me feel like I had lowered myself.

That cruel old man didn’t need to talk about that. I already felt ashamed enough.

My baby, who didn’t know anything, was always there as a reminder of my shame. I listened quietly when he said I had lost his respect, but I cried because I felt I was no longer worthy of respect from good and decent people.

Oh no!

Slavery still held me tightly in its poisonous grip.

There was no chance for me to be respected.

There was no hope that I could live a better life.

Sometimes, when my master saw I still refused to accept what he called his kind offers, he threatened to sell my child. “Maybe that will teach you a lesson,” he said.

Teach me a lesson? Wasn’t I already broken? But that threat hurt my heart deeply. I knew the law gave him the power to do it because slave owners had that right.
