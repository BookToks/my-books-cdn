They were smart enough to make a rule that “the child follows the mother’s condition, not the father’s,” so that bad behavior wouldn’t get in the way of greed. Thinking about this made me hold my innocent baby even tighter to my heart.

Scary thoughts came to my mind when I worried my baby might end up in the hands of slave traders. I cried over him and said, “Oh my child! Maybe they will leave you in some cold cabin to die, then throw you away like a dog.” When Dr. Flint found out I was going to have a baby again, he got really angry.

He ran out of the house and came back with a pair of scissors. I had beautiful hair, and he often complained about how proud I was of styling it nicely.

He cut all my hair close to my head, yelling and swearing the whole time. I answered some of his insults, and he hit me. A few months before, he had thrown me down the stairs in a fit of rage. The injury was so bad I couldn’t even turn myself in bed for many days. He then said, “Linda, I swear to God I won’t hit you again,” but I knew he would forget.

After he found out I was pregnant, he acted like an angry spirit from hell. He came every day, and I had to face insults no one could really explain.

I wouldn’t even describe them if I could because they were too awful. I tried to keep them from my grandmother because I knew she already had enough sadness without my problems.

But when she saw the doctor hurt me and heard what he said...
