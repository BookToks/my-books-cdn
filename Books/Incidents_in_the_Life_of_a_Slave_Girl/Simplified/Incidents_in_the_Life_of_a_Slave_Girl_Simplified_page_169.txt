I was selling the children. I don’t think he’ll ever get their mom back. I guess she ran away to the North. Goodbye, old boy. Remember, I did you a favor. You have to thank me by taking all the pretty girls out with me next fall.

That’s going to be my last trip.

Trading slaves is a bad business for anyone with a heart.

“Move on, you guys!” And the group left—God only knows where. Even though I hate slave traders and think they’re the worst people on earth, I have to admit this man seemed to care a little.

He liked William in jail and wanted to buy him.

When he heard about my children, he was ready to help get them away from Dr. Flint without asking for his usual payment.

My uncle got a wagon and took William and the children back to town. Everyone was so happy at my grandmother’s house!

The curtains were closed, and the candles were lit.

The happy grandmother held the little ones close.

They hugged her, kissed her, clapped their hands, and shouted.

She knelt down and said a thankful prayer to God.

The father was there for a while; even though slaveholders don’t usually care much about their kids, he must have felt some real joy seeing how happy he made them.

I was part of the celebrations that night.
