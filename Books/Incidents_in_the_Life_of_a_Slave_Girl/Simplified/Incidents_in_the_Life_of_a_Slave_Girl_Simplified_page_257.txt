I went home and asked Mrs. Hobbs if she would let her come and see me. We agreed that I would send for her the next day. Her friend Sarah quickly told her mom that I had arrived. When I went into the house, the lady who lived there was not there, so I waited for her to come back. Before I saw her, I heard her say, “Where is Linda Brent? I used to know her mom and dad.” Soon Sarah came back with her mom. So, there were quite a few of us, all from my grandma’s neighborhood.

These friends gathered around me and asked me lots of questions.

They laughed, they cried, and they shouted. They thanked God that I had escaped from the people who were hurting me and was safe now on Long Island. It was a very exciting day.

It was so different from the quiet days I had spent in my sad little room!

The next morning was Sunday.

The first thing I thought about when I woke up was the note I had to send to Mrs. Hobbs, the lady Ellen lived with. It was clear I had just come to the area; otherwise, I would have asked about my daughter earlier.

I didn’t want to tell them I had just come from the South because then they might think I had been hiding there. That could cause trouble or even destroy a lot of people I cared about.

I like to be honest and don’t like to lie.

If I’ve done anything wrong, it’s because of slavery.

That system of violence and cruelty forced me to tell a lie. I started my note by saying that I had just arrived from Canada and that I really wanted to share my story in *Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.*
