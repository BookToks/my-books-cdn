Ellen shrank away from him , and would not speak ; but Benny spoke up, and said , “ Dr. Flint, I I don't know where my mother is. guess she's in New York ; and when you go there again ,I wish you'd ask her to come home, for I want to see her ; but if you put her in jail , or tell her you'll cut her head ff,o I'll tell her ot og right back .
