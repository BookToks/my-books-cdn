The captain called his men together, and after a quick talk, he gave the order to march.

As they went out the gate, the captain turned back and cursed the house.

He said it should be burned to the ground, and each of the thirty people inside should get nine lashes.

We got out of this situation pretty lucky; we only lost some clothes.

By evening, things got worse.

The soldiers, drunk, did even more terrible things.

Screams and shouts filled the air. Not daring to go outside, I looked out from under the window curtain. I saw a crowd dragging some Black people, with white men holding guns and threatening to shoot if they didn’t stop screaming.

Among the prisoners was a respected old Black minister. They had found some shot in his house, which his wife had used for years to weigh things.

For this, they were going to shoot him on Court House Green. What a terrible sight for a so-called civilized country! A drunken mob acting like they were the law!

Some better people in the community tried to help the innocent, scared people; in some cases, they succeeded by keeping them locked in jail until things calmed down.

Finally, the white citizens realized their own property wasn’t safe from the wild mob they had called to protect them. They gathered the drunken crowd, pushed them back to the countryside, and set up guards around the town.
