There was a slave named Aggie. She had seen her children sold away and taken to places she would never hear from again. She noticed my grandmother crying and asked, “What’s wrong, Aunt Marthy?”

My grandmother said, “It feels like I won’t have any children or grandchildren left to give me a drink when I’m dying or to bury me. My boy didn’t come back with Mr. Sands. He stayed up north.”

Poor Aggie was happy and clapped her hands. “Is that why you’re crying?” she said. “Get down on your knees and thank the Lord! I don’t know where my children are, and I never expect to know.”

“You don’t know where Linda went, but you do know where her brother is. He’s free now, and that’s the right place. Don’t be angry at God’s plans, but thank Him for being good.”

What poor Aggie said made me feel selfish. She was happy that one fellow slave escaped, while his sister was only worried about what his freedom might mean for her children. I knelt and prayed for forgiveness, and I thanked God from my heart that one of my family was saved from slavery.

Not long after, we got a letter from William. He said Mr. Sands had always been kind to him, and he tried to do his duties well. But since he was a boy, he had wanted to be free, and he had already gone through an important time in his life.
