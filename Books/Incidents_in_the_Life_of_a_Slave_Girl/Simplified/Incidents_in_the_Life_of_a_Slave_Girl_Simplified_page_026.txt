20 Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

I remember the rough linsey-woolsey dress Mrs. Flint gave me every winter. I really hated it.

It was a sign of being a slave.

While my grandmother worked hard to help support me, the three hundred dollars she lent her mistress were never paid back. When her mistress died, her son-in-law, Dr. Flint, took charge of the estate. When my grandmother asked him for the money, he said the estate had no money and the law wouldn’t let him pay her. But he still kept the silver candelabra that was bought with that money. I guess the family will keep those for many years.

My grandmother’s mistress had promised she would be free after her death. People said the will made sure of it. But when everything was settled, Dr. Flint told my grandmother she had to be sold because of the situation.

On the day of the sale, a notice was put up saying there would be a public sale of slaves, horses, and other things. Dr. Flint called my grandmother and said he didn’t want to hurt her feelings by selling her in public, so he wanted to sell her privately instead.

My grandmother knew he was lying; she understood he was just embarrassed.

She was a strong woman, and if he was cruel enough to sell her when her mistress wanted her free, she made sure everyone would know about it.
