I will take the punishment. I would rather go to the state’s prison than have any poor victim taken from my home and sent back to slavery. Such a kind and brave heart! I have tears in my eyes while I write about her.

I hope God rewards her for caring about my people who are being treated badly.

I was sent to New England, where the wife of a senator gave me shelter. I will always be thankful to her.

This honorable man would not have voted for the Fugitive Slave Law, like the senator in "Uncle Tom’s Cabin." In fact, he was strongly against it. But he was still scared to have me stay in his house for too long.

So, I was sent to the countryside, where I stayed for a month with the baby.

When it seemed that Dr. Flint’s agents had lost track of me and stopped looking for me for a while, I went back to New York.
