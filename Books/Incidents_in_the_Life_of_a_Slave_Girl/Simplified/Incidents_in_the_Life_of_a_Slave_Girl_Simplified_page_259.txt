I used to be wealthy, but I failed and later got a low job at the Custom House.

Maybe they hoped to go back to the south someday. Ellen knew enough for a slave’s life. I was eager to work and earn money to help my kids have a better future. Mr. Sands didn’t keep his promise to free them. I was also lied to about Ellen. What hope did I have for Benjamin?

I felt like I had none.

I went back to my friend’s house feeling worried. To protect my kids, I had to say I was free. Sometimes I felt free, but I knew I wasn’t safe.

That night, I wrote a polite letter to Dr. Flint, asking him to tell me the lowest price he would sell me for. Since I legally belonged to his daughter, I wrote to her too, asking the same question.

Since I came north, I hadn’t forgotten my brother William. I looked hard for him and heard he was in Boston. When I got there, he had left for New Bedford. I wrote there and learned he went on a whaling trip and wouldn’t be back for months.

I went back to New York to find work near Ellen.

Dr. Flint answered my letter but gave me no hope. He told me to go back and obey my owners, and then maybe they would grant my requests. I lent the letter to a friend who lost it, or I would show it to you.
