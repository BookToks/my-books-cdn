273 really wanted to stay in the cabin, not just because it was safer at night, but also to avoid being watched. Lawyer Hopper was waiting on board for us. He talked to the stewardess and asked her as a special favor to treat us well. He told me, "Go and talk to the captain yourself. Take your little girl with you, and I’m sure he won’t let her sleep on the deck." With these kind words and a handshake, he left.

The boat soon started moving, carrying me quickly away from the friendly home where I had hoped to find safety and rest.

My brother had left me to buy the tickets, thinking I might do better than he would. When the stewardess came to me, I paid what she asked, and she gave me three tickets with clipped corners.

In the most simple way, I said, “You made a mistake; I asked for cabin tickets. I can’t agree to sleep on the deck with my little daughter.” She told me there was no mistake.

She said that on some routes, Black people were allowed to stay in the cabin, but not on this route, which was mostly used by rich people. I asked her to take me to the captain’s office, and she said she would after tea. When the time came, I took Ellen by the hand and went to the captain. I politely asked him to change our tickets because it would be very uncomfortable for us on the deck. He said it was against their usual rules, but he would make sure we had beds below. He would also try to get us comfortable seats on the train cars, but he wasn’t sure about that. He said he would talk to the conductor about it.
