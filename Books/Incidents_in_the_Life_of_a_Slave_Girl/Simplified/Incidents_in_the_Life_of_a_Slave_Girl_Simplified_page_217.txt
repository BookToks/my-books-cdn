I had watched over them every day, loving them more and more, but feeling sadder too. I had prayed to God with a heavy heart, asking for forgiveness for the wrong I had done. The memories came back so clearly! After such a long, dark time, I stood there feeling broken.

While I was thinking, I heard footsteps on the stairs.

The door opened, and my uncle Phillip came in, holding Ellen’s hand. I put my arms around her and said, “Ellen, my dear child, I am your mother.” She pulled back a little and looked at me. Then, trusting me, she pressed her cheek against mine, and I hugged her close to my heart, which had felt so empty for so long.

She was the first to speak.

She lifted her head and asked, “Are you really my mother?” I told her I was. I said that even though she hadn’t seen me for a long time, I had loved her very much. Now that she was leaving, I wanted to see her and talk to her so she would remember me.

With a little cry, she said, “I’m glad you came to see me, but why didn’t you come before? Benny and I wanted to see you so much! He remembers you and sometimes tells me about you.”

I answered, “I couldn’t come before, dear. But now that I am here, tell me if you like going away.”

“I don’t know,” she said, crying. “Grandmother says I shouldn’t cry. She says I’m going to a good place where I can learn to read and write, and that soon I can write her a letter. But I won’t have Benny, or grandmother, or uncle Phillip, or anyone to love me.

Can’t you go with me? Oh, dear mother!”
