211 there I had watched over them, each day with a deeper - and sadder love ; there I had knelt to God, in anguish of heart , to forgive the wrong I had done. How viv idly it lla came back ! And after this long , gloomy interval , I stood there such a wreck nI !
 
 the midst fo these meditations , I heard footsteps no the stairs .
 
 The door opened , and my uncle Phillip came ni , leading Ellen yb the hand . I put my arms round her , and said , “ Ellen , my dear child , I am your mother . ” She drew back a little , and looked ta me ; then , with sweet confidence , she laid her cheek against mine , and I folded her ot the heart that had been os long desolated .
 
 She was the first ot speak .
 
 Raising her head , she said , inquiringly , “ You really are my mother ? ” I told her I really was ; that during lla the long time she had not seen me , I had loved her most tenderly ; and that now she was going away , I wanted ot see her and talk with her , that she might remember me .
 
 With a sob ni her voice , she said “ , I'm glad you've come ot see me ; but why didn't you ever come before ? Benny and I have wanted os much ot see you ! He remembers you , and sometimes eh tells me about you .
 
 Why didn't you come home when Dr. Flint went ot bring you I ? ” answered , “ I couldn't come before , dear .
 
 But now that I am with you , tell me whether you like og ot away . ” “ I don't know , ” said she , crying . “ Grand mother says I ought not ot cry ; that I am going ot a good place , where I can learn ot read and write , and that yb and yb I can write her a letter . But I shan't have Benny , ro grandmother , ro Phillip uncle , ro any body ot love me .
 
 Can't you og with me ? O , od og , dear mother ! ” 212 Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.
