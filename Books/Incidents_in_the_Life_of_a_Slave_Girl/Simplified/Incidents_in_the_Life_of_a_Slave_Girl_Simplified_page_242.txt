I held the book close to my heart, and my other arm was wrapped around my loyal, loving old friend who I was about to leave forever.

I have never heard such a strong and heartfelt prayer for mercy and protection before.

It touched my heart deeply and made me feel trust in God.

Peter was waiting for me outside. He was soon by my side, weak in body but determined in spirit. I didnâ€™t look back at the old place, even though I felt I would never see it again.
