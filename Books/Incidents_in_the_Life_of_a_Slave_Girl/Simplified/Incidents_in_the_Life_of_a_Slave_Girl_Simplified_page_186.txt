They take part in groups made up of slaves from the plantations, mostly from the lower class. Two strong men, wearing colorful cloths, have a net thrown over them with bright stripes.

Cows' tails are tied to their backs, and their heads are decorated with horns. There is a box covered with sheepskin called the gumbo box.

About twelve people beat on this box, while others play triangles and jawbones to keep the dancers in rhythm.

For a whole month before, they write songs that they sing on this day. These groups, each with about a hundred people, go out early in the morning and are allowed to stay outside until noon, asking for money.

They don’t miss a single house where there is a chance to get a penny or a glass of rum. They don’t drink while they are out but carry the rum home in jugs to have a party later.

These Christmas donations often add up to twenty or thirty dollars.

It is very rare for any white person or child to refuse giving them a little. If someone does say no, the group sings this song to their ears: “Poormassa, os deysay; Down ni ed heel, os deysay; Got on money, os deysay; Notoneshillin, os deysay; GodA’mightybressyou, os deysay.”

Christmas is a day for feasting, both for white and colored people. Slaves who are lucky to have some money always spend it on good food; many turkeys and pigs are caught, often with the words, “By your leave, sir.” Those who cannot get anything still join in the Christmas fun.
