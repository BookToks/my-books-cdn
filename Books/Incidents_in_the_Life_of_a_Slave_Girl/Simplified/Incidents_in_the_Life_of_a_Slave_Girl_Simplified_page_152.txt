Those hours felt so long, and I prayed hard that God wouldn’t leave me in my greatest need! I was about to risk everything on one chance; if I failed, what would happen to me and my poor children? They would suffer because of my mistake.

At half past twelve, I quietly went downstairs. I stopped on the second floor because I thought I heard a noise.

I felt my way into the parlor and looked out the window. The night was so dark that I couldn’t see anything. I slowly opened the window and jumped out. Big drops of rain were falling, and the darkness confused me. I dropped to my knees and said a short prayer to God for help and safety. I felt my way to the road and ran toward town as fast as I could.

I got to my grandmother’s house but didn’t want to see her. She would say, “Linda, you are killing me,” and I knew that would upset me. I softly tapped on the window of a room where a woman lived. She had been in the house for years, and I knew she was a true friend who could keep my secret.

I tapped several times before she heard me.

Finally, she opened the window, and I whispered, “Sally, I ran away. Let me in, quick.” She opened the door quietly and said softly, “For God’s sake, don’t.

Your grandmother is trying to buy you and the children.

Mr. Sands was here last week.

He told her he was going away on business, but he wanted her to go ahead with buying you and the children, and he would help her as much as he could. Don’t run away, Linda. Your grandmother is already very worried.”
