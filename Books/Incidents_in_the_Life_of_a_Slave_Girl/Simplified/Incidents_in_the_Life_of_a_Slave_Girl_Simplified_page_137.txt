Early the next morning, I left my grandmother’s house with my youngest child. My little boy was sick, so I had to leave him behind. I felt very sad as the old wagon bounced along. Before, I suffered alone, but now my child was treated like a slave too. 

As we got closer to the big house, I remembered the last time I was sent there as a punishment. I didn’t know why I was being sent now. I decided to follow orders as much as I had to, but I planned to stay as little time as possible.

Mr. Flint was waiting for me and told me to go upstairs to get my work for the day.

My little Ellen was left down in the kitchen. This was a change for her because she was always carefully looked after before. 

My young master said she could play in the yard. That was a kind thing to say since he didn’t like to see her.

My job was to clean and prepare the house for the bride’s arrival.

While surrounded by sheets, tablecloths, towels, curtains, and carpets, my mind was busy planning and my hands were busy sewing. At noon, I was allowed to check on Ellen. She had cried herself to sleep.

I heard Mr. Flint tell a neighbor, “I’ve got her down here, and I’ll soon take the silly ideas out of her head. 

My father is partly to blame for her nonsense. 

He should have disciplined her a long time ago.”
