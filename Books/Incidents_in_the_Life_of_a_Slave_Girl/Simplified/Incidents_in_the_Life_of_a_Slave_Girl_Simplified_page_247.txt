The next morning, I went up on deck as soon as the sun started to rise. I called Fanny to watch the sunrise with me. It was the first time in our lives we saw the sun come up on free land. At least, that’s what I believed it was.

We saw the sky turn red, and the big sun slowly rise from the water. Soon, the waves began to sparkle, and everything around us started to glow beautifully. In front of us was a city full of strangers.

We looked at each other, and both of us had tears in our eyes. We had escaped from slavery, and we thought we were safe from the people who had hunted us. But we were alone in the world, and we had left behind people we loved—people who had been cruelly torn away by slavery.
