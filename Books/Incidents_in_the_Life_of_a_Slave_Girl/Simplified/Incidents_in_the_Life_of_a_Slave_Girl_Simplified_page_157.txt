Months of Danger.

My friend asked an old woman, who helped treat slaves, what to do for a snake or lizard bite. She said to soak a dozen copper coins in vinegar overnight and then put the sour vinegar on the swollen bite.

I had carefully sent some messages to my family. They were scared and worried I couldn’t escape. They told me to go back to my master, ask for forgiveness, and tell him to make an example of me.

But I didn’t listen to that advice. When I started this dangerous journey, I decided no matter what, I wouldn’t turn back. “Give me freedom or give me death,” was my motto. When my friend told my family about the tough time I had for twenty-four hours, they didn’t say anything more about me going back to my master.

Something had to be done fast, but they didn’t know where to find help.

God, in His mercy, sent a "friend in need." One of the ladies who knew my grandmother since they were kids was always kind to her. She also knew my mother and her children and cared about them. At this hard time, she visited my grandmother, as she often did. She saw the sad and worried look on her face and asked if she knew where I was.
