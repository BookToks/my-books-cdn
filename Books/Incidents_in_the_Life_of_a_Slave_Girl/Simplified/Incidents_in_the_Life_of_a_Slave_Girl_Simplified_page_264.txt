My young mistress, Miss Emily Flint, didn’t answer my letter asking if I could be sold. But after some time, I got a reply that said it was from her younger brother.

To really understand this letter, you should know the Flint family thought they had been living in the north for many years. They didn’t know that the doctor had come to New York three times looking for me. They didn’t know he asked to borrow five hundred dollars for that, or that I had seen him near the steamboat.

They also didn’t know that I had learned all about Aunt Nancy’s death and burial when it happened. I’ve kept the letter, and here is a copy of it:

“Your sister’s letter was received a few days ago. From it, I understand you want to come back to your hometown, to be near your friends and family.

We were all happy to read your letter and want you to know that if anyone in the family was upset with you before, they aren’t anymore.

We all feel sorry for your hard situation and want to do everything we can to help you be happy.

It is hard for you to come back home as a free person.”
