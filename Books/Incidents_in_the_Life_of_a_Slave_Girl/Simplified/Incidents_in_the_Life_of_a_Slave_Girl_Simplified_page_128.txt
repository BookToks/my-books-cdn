My children grew up strong and healthy. Dr. Flint often said to me with a proud smile, “These kids will bring me a lot of money one day.” But I thought to myself, with God’s help, they would never be in his hands. I felt I would rather see them dead than let him have control over them. We could get money to buy our freedom, but that didn’t help me. Dr. Flint loved money, but he loved having power even more. After many talks, my friends decided to try again.

There was a slave owner who was about to move to Texas, and he was told to try to buy me. He was supposed to start offering nine hundred dollars and could go up to twelve hundred. But my master said no. He said, “She isn’t mine. She belongs to my daughter, and I have no right to sell her. I don’t trust you; maybe you work for her secret boyfriend.”

He said, “Tell him he can’t buy her for any amount of money, and he can’t buy her children either.”

The doctor came to see me the next day, and my heart beat faster when he walked in. I had never seen the old man walk with such a powerful step.

He sat down and looked at me with cold, harsh eyes.

My children had learned to be scared of him.

The little one...
