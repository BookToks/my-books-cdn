We had a boring winter trip, and from far away, scary images seemed to appear on the shores of the United States. It’s a sad feeling to be scared of your own country. We got to New York safely, and I quickly went to Boston to see my kids.

I found Ellen healthy and doing well at her school, but Benny wasn’t there to greet me. He had been left in a good place to learn a job, and for several months everything went well. The boss liked him, and the other kids learning jobs with him were his friends. But one day, they found out something they never knew before — that he was Black!

This suddenly made them treat him very differently.

Some of the kids were Americans, others were American-born Irish, and they thought it wasn’t right to have a “Black kid” with them after they learned the truth. They started ignoring him, and when he ignored them back, they began to insult and bully him.

He was a strong boy and didn’t want to take that, so he left.

Wanting to do something to take care of himself and having no one to help him, he signed up for a whaling trip. When I heard this, I cried a lot and felt very sorry for leaving him alone for so long.

But I had done my best, and now all I could do was pray that God would guide and keep him safe.
