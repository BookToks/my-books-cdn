The captain noticed them and turned the ship to the left. There, he saw an advertisement. Benjamin looked exactly like the description, so the captain caught him and put him in chains. The storm passed, and they continued to New York. Before they got there, Benjamin managed to free himself from the chains and threw them into the water.

He escaped from the ship but was chased, caught, and taken back to his owner.

When my grandmother came home and found her youngest child had run away, she was very sad. But, being a faithful woman, she said, “God’s will be done.” Every morning, she asked if there was any news about her boy. Yes, there was news. The owner was happy because he got a letter saying Benjamin was caught.

That day feels like it was just yesterday because I remember it so well. I saw him walking through the streets in chains, going to jail. His face was very pale but showed he was strong inside.

He had asked one of the sailors to go to his mother’s house and tell her not to come see him.

He said seeing her sad would make him lose control. She wanted to see him, so she went but hid in the crowd so he wouldn’t see her.

We weren’t allowed to visit him, but we had known the jailer for years, and he was kind.

At midnight, he opened the jail door for my grandmother and me to come in, hiding who we were. When we went inside, it was completely quiet.

“Benjamin, Benjamin!” whispered my grandmother.

No answer. “Benjamin! Benjamin!” she said again, softly.
