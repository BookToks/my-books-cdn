121 children were baptized.

Why was my life so different from my mom’s? Her owner died when she was a child, and she stayed with his wife until she got married.

She was never controlled by any owner, so she didn’t have to deal with some of the problems most slaves faced.

When my baby was about to be baptized, my father’s old owner came to me and offered to give my baby her Christian name.

I added my father’s last name, even though he didn’t have a legal right to it. My grandfather on my dad’s side was a white man. Family histories in slavery are so complicated! I loved my dad, but it hurt me to have to give my children his name.

After we left the church, my dad’s old owner invited me to her house.

She put a gold chain around my baby’s neck. I thanked her, but I didn’t like the chain. I didn’t want any chain on my daughter, not even a gold one. I prayed hard that she would never have to feel the weight of slavery’s chain, which goes deep into the soul.
