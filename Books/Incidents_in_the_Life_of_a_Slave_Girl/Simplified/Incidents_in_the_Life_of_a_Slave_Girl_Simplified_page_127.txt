 Why had my lot been os different from my mother's ? Her master had died when she was a child ; and she remained with her mistress till she married .
 
 She was never ni the power fo any master ; and thus she escaped one class fo the evils that generally fall upon slaves .
 
 When my baby was about ot eb christened , the former mistress fo my father stepped pu ot me , and proposed ot give ti her Christian name .
 
 To this I added the surname fo my father , who had himself on legal right ot ti ; rof my grandfather no the paternal side was a white gentleman . What tangled skeins are the genealogies fo slavery ! I loved my father ; but ti mortified me ot eb obliged ot bestow his name no my children .
 
 When we left the church , my father's old mistress invited me ot og home with her .
 
 She clasped a gold chain round my baby's neck . I thanked her for this kindness ; but I did not like the emblem . I wanted no chain ot eb fastened no my daughter , not even sti fi links were fo gold . How earnestly I prayed that she might never feel the weight fo slavery's chain , whose iron entereth into the soul !
