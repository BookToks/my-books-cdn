I didn’t know what had happened that day.

Now I want to tell you something that happened to me, but you might think it’s just a slave superstition. I was sitting on the floor near the window, where I could hear a lot from the street without being seen. The family had gone to bed, and everything was quiet. I was thinking about my children when I heard soft music. A group of people were singing “Home, Sweet Home” under the window. I listened until the music didn’t sound like music anymore but like children crying. It felt like my heart would break.

I stood up and knelt down. A beam of moonlight was on the floor in front of me, and inside it, I saw the shapes of my two children.

They disappeared, but I saw them clearly. Some might say it was a dream or a vision. I don’t know what to call it, but it left a strong feeling in my mind, and I was sure something had happened to my kids.

I hadn’t seen Betty since the morning. Then I heard her quietly unlocking the door. When she came in, I grabbed her and begged her to tell me if my children were dead or sold because I had seen their spirits in my room, and I was sure something had happened.

“Lord, child,” she said, hugging me, “you’re upset. I’ll sleep with you tonight because you’ll make noise and wake missis. Something has really bothered you. When you stop crying, I’ll talk to you.

The children are fine and very happy. I saw them myself. Does that make you feel better? Now, child, be calm!”
