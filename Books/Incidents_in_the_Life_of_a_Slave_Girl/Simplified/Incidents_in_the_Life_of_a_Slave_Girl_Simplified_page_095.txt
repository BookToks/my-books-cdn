I thought I could handle my shame if I could just make up with my grandmother. I really wanted to be honest with her. I believed that if she knew the truth about what had been happening to me for years, she might not be so hard on me.

My friend told me to ask her to come. I did, but I had to wait for days, feeling really nervous, before she finally arrived.

Had she completely given up on me? No. She came in the end. I knelt down in front of her and told her about all the things that had made my life so hard, how long I had been suffering, that I didn’t see any way out, and how desperate I had become. She listened quietly. I said I would do anything if there was still a chance she could forgive me. I asked her to feel sorry for me, because of my mother who had died. And she did feel sorry for me. She didn’t say, “I forgive you,” but she looked at me with loving eyes full of tears. She gently put her old hand on my head and quietly said, “Poor child! Poor child!”
