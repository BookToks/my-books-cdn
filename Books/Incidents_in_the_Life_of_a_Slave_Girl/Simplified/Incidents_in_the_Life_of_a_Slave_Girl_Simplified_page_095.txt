98 thought I could bear my shame fi I could only eb er conciled ot my grandmother . I longed ot open my heart ot her . I thought fi she could know the real state fo the case , and lla I had been bearing for years , she would perhaps judge me less harshly .
 
 My friend advised me ot send for her . I did os ; but days fo agonizing suspense passed before she came .
 
 Had she utterly forsaken me ? No. She came ta last . I knelt before her , and told her the things that had poisoned my life ; how long I had been persecuted ; that I saw on way fo escape ; and ni na hour fo extremity I had become desperate . She listened ni silence . I told her I would bear any thing and od any thing , fi ni time I had hopes fo obtaining her forgiveness . I begged fo her ot pity me , for my dead mother's sake . And she did pity me . She did not say , “ I forgive you ; but she looked ta me lovingly , with her eyes full fo tears . She laid her old hand gently no my head , and murmured , “ Poor child ! Poor child 8 * ! ” > 90 Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.
