Her husband and children loved her, and their home was made special by laws that protected it. I thought about my own kids and sighed.

After dinner, Mr. Durham went with me to find the friends I had talked about. They had moved from my hometown, and I was excited to see some familiar faces. But they were not home, so we walked back through the clean streets.

On the way, Mr. Durham said he was surprised because I had talked about a daughter he expected to meet, and I looked so young that he thought I was single. He was starting to talk about something I felt very sensitive about.

I thought, he’s going to ask about my husband next, and if I tell him the truth, what will he think of me? I told him I had two children, one living in New York and the other in the South.

He asked more questions, and I honestly told him about some of the most important things that happened in my life.

It was hard for me to say these things, but I didn’t want to lie to him. If he wanted to be my friend, I thought he should know if I was worthy of it. “Sorry if I upset you,” he said. “I didn’t ask because I was just curious. I wanted to understand your situation to see if I could help you or your daughter.

Your honest answers show you have integrity, but don’t be so open with everyone.

Some people might be cruel and treat you badly.” That word cruel hurt me deeply. I replied, “Only God knows how much I have suffered, and I hope He will forgive me if I am allowed to...”
