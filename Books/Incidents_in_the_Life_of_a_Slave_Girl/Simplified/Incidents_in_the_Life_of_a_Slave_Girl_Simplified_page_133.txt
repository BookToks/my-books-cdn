127 I caused a scene at my friend’s house. They gave me a dark cloak; I put it on quickly and rushed home. Going fast didn’t help; the doctor had already left, angry. I was scared about the morning but couldn’t avoid it. When it came, it was warm and bright.

Early that morning, the doctor came and asked where I had been the night before. I told him. He didn’t believe me and sent someone to check with my friend. In the afternoon, he came back and said he believed me. He seemed joking, so I thought he might tease me.

“I guess you need some fun,” he said, “but I’m surprised you were there with those Black people. That’s not a place for you.

He didn’t say more but added, “I haven’t seen much of you lately, but I still care about you. When I said I’d be kinder to you, I was wrong.”

I remembered what he said. “Linda, you want freedom for yourself and your children, and you can only get it through me. If you agree to what I say or suggest, you and your children will be free. There must be no contact between you and their father. I will find a small house where you and the children can live together.

Your work will be easy, like sewing for my family.

Think about what I’m offering you, Linda — a home and freedom! Forget the past. If I have been harsh with you sometimes...” 128 Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.
