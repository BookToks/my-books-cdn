After being stuck in the press for four days and five nights, the slave told his master that no water had been used for four mornings and a terrible smell was coming from the gin house. The overseer was sent to check it out. When they opened the press, they found the dead body, partly eaten by rats and bugs. Maybe the rats that ate his bread had also started on him before he died. Poor Charity! Grandma and I often wondered how her kind heart would handle hearing about her son’s murder if she ever found out. We knew her husband and knew that James was like him—strong and smart. These were the qualities that made it so hard for him to be a slave. They put him in a rough box and buried him with less care than they would have for an old house dog.

No one asked any questions.

He was a slave, and people thought the master could do whatever he wanted with his own property.

And why would he care about the value of one slave? He had hundreds. After working all day, slaves had to eat quickly and be ready to put out their pine knots by nine o’clock, when the overseer made his rounds. He checked every cabin to make sure the men and their wives were in bed together, so the men wouldn’t fall asleep by the fire from being too tired and miss the morning horn that called them to work.

Women were seen as worthless unless they kept having children to add to the owner’s slaves. They were treated like animals.

This same master once shot a woman in the head.
