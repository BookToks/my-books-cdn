I wasn’t happy with how Ellen was being treated. 

She didn’t get good care. Sometimes she came to New York to visit me, but she usually brought a request from Mrs. Hobbs asking me to buy her shoes or clothes. Mrs. Hobbs promised to pay me back when Mr. Hobbs got his paycheck from the Custom House, but that day never came. So, I spent a lot of my own money to keep my daughter nicely dressed. 

That was a small problem compared to my fear that they might sell my precious daughter because they didn’t have enough money. I knew they were often in touch with people from the South and had chances to sell her. 

I mentioned before that when Dr. Flint put Ellen in jail at two years old, she had an eye problem caused by measles. The sickness still bothered her, and kind Mrs. Bruce suggested Ellen come to New York for a while to see Dr. Elliott, a famous eye doctor. 

I didn’t think it was wrong for a mother to ask for help like that, but Mrs. Hobbs got very angry and refused. I was in a tough spot and didn’t want to cause trouble, so I didn’t argue. I wished I could fully take care of my children as a mother should. 

The next time I went to Brooklyn, Mrs. Hobbs apologized for being angry and told me she had hired her own doctor to treat Ellen’s eyes. She said she didn’t let Ellen go to New York because she didn’t think it was safe. I didn’t say anything but I realized she saw my child as just her daughter’s property.
