It felt good to see we were getting ready to leave the city. We went to Albany on the steamboat Knickerbocker. When it was time for tea, Mrs. Bruce said, “Linda, it’s late, and you and the baby should come to the table with me.” I said, “I know the baby needs to eat, but I’d rather not go with you. I’m scared someone will be rude to me.” She said, “No, not if you’re with me.” I saw some white nurses going with their ladies, so I decided to try it too.

We sat at the far end of the table. As soon as I sat down, a rough voice said, “Get up! You know you can’t sit here.” I looked up and, to my surprise and anger, saw that the man speaking was Black. If his job was to enforce the boat’s rules, he could at least have done it politely. I said, “I won’t get up unless the captain tells me to.” Nobody offered me any tea, but Mrs. Bruce gave me hers and asked for another cup. I looked around to see if the other nurses were treated the same way.

They were served properly and waited on.

The next morning, when we stopped at Troy for breakfast, everyone rushed to the table. Mrs. Bruce said, “Take my arm, Linda, and we’ll go together.” The landlord heard her and said, “Madam, will you allow your nurse and baby to take…”
