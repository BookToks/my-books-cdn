As I walked through Mrs. Flint’s room, the creaking of my shoes made a loud, annoying noise that bothered her. She called me over and asked what was making that horrible sound. I told her it was my new shoes. “Take them off,” she said. “And if you wear them again, I’ll throw them into the fire!” I took off my shoes and my stockings too. Then she sent me far away on an errand.

Walking through the snow with bare feet, they started to tingle. That night, my voice was hoarse, and I went to bed thinking I might get sick or even die the next day. I was very sad, but when I woke up, I was actually feeling fine!

I had thought that if I died or got sick, my mistress would feel some regret because she had always hated me, calling me a “little imp.”

It was my lack of understanding about my mistress that made me imagine these things.

Sometimes, Dr. Flint was offered a lot of money to sell me, but he always said, “She doesn’t belong to me. She belongs to my daughter, and I can’t sell her.” He was a good, honest man! My young mistress was still a child, so I hoped she would protect me. I loved her, and she loved me back. But once, I overheard her father say she cared for me, and her mother quickly said it was just because she was scared.

This made me feel uneasy.

Did the child pretend to care, or was her mother jealous of the love she gave me? I thought it must be the second. I told myself, “Surely little kids are honest.” One afternoon, while I was sewing, I felt very sad and low.

My mistress had been accusing The Slave who Dared to Feel like a Man.
