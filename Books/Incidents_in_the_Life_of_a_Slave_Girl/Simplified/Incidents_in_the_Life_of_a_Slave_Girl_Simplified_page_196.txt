Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

The day before he left for Washington, he made plans in the evening to help me move from my hiding place into the storeroom below. I felt so stiff and awkward that it was really hard for me to move from one spot to another.

When I finally got to the storeroom, my ankles gave out, and I fell exhausted on the floor. It felt like I would never be able to use my legs again. But the goal I had gave me all the strength I could find. I crawled on my hands and knees to the window, hid behind a barrel, and waited for him to come.

The clock struck nine, and I knew the steamboat would leave between ten and eleven.

My hopes were starting to fade.

Then I heard his voice saying to someone, “Wait for me a moment. I want to see Aunt Martha.” When he came out and passed the window, I said, “Stop one moment, and let me speak for my children.” He stopped, hesitated, and then kept walking out the gate. I closed the shutter I had partly opened and sank down behind the barrel. I had been through a lot, but I rarely felt a pain as sharp as that. Did my children mean so little to him? And did he care so little about their miserable mother that he wouldn’t listen even for a moment while she begged for them? My painful thoughts were so strong that I forgot I hadn’t fully closed the shutter until I heard it opening. I looked up.

He had come back. “Who called me?” he said quietly.

“I did,” I replied.

“Oh, Linda,” he said, “I knew your voice; but I was afraid to answer because my friend might hear me. Why did you come here?” He is the Candidate for Congress.
