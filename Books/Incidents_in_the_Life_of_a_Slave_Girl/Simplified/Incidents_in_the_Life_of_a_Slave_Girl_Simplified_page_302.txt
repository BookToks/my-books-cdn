After some traveling back and forth, the carriage stopped at the house of one of Mrs. Bruce's friends, where I was kindly welcomed. Mrs. Bruce went back right away to tell the servants what to say if anyone came looking for me.

I was lucky.

It was lucky for me that the evening paper wasn’t burned before I could check the list of arrivals.

Soon after Mrs. Bruce got home, several people came asking about me. One asked for me, another asked for my daughter Ellen, and someone else said they had a letter from my grandmother that they needed to deliver in person.

They were told, “She lived here, but she has left.” “How long ago?” “I don’t know, sir.” “Do you know where she went?” “No, sir.” Then the door was closed.

This Mr. Dodge, who said I belonged to him, was originally a Yankee peddler in the South. Later, he became a merchant and finally a slaveholder. He got into what was called the top social circle and married Miss Emily Flint. A fight happened between him and her brother, and the brother beat him up. This caused a family feud, and Mr. Dodge decided to move to Virginia.

Dr. Flint left Mr. Dodge in charge of property, but his own money became limited, and he had a wife and kids who depended on him. Because of this, it made sense that he would try to claim me as his property.
