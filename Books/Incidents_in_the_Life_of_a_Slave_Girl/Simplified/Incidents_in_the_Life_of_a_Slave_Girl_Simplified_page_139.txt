I crawled under and pulled her out. Holding her in my arms, I thought it might be better if she never woke up. I said this out loud. Suddenly, someone asked, “Did you talk to me?” I looked up and saw Mr. Flint standing next to me. He didn’t say anything else but walked away, frowning. That night, he gave Ellen a biscuit and a cup of sweetened milk. I was surprised by his kindness.

Later, I found out he had killed a big snake that had come out from under the house. I guess that made him act nicer than usual.

The next morning, the old cart was packed with shingles to take to town. I put Ellen in the cart and sent her to her grandmother. Mr. Flint said I should have asked him first. I told him the child was sick and needed care, and I didn’t have time to give it.

He said he knew I had done a lot of work in a short time.

I had been on the plantation for three weeks when I planned to visit home. I waited until night, after everyone was asleep. It was six miles from town, and the road was lonely. I was with a young man who often sneaked out of town to see his mother. When everything was quiet, we started walking. Fear made us go faster, and we didn’t take long to get there. I reached my grandmother’s house. Her bedroom was on the first floor, and the window was open because it was warm. I called to her, and she woke up.

She let me in and closed the window so no one passing by would see me. A light was brought, and the whole family gathered around me, some smiling.
