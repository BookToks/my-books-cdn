New Problems.

The doctor, even more angry than before, tried to get back at my family. He arrested my uncle Phillip, saying he helped me escape. Uncle Phillip was taken to court and told the truth that he didn’t know I was planning to run away and hadn’t seen me since I left my master’s farm.

The doctor then wanted Uncle Phillip to pay $500 as a promise that he wouldn’t help me again. Some men offered to support him, but Mr. Sands told Uncle Phillip it was better to go back to jail, and he would make sure he got out without paying bail.

When my grandmother heard about Uncle Phillip’s arrest, she told Betty. Betty, being kind, hid me again under the floor. While she cooked, she pretended to talk to herself but really wanted me to hear what was happening.

I hoped Uncle Phillip wouldn’t be locked up for long, but I was still worried. I thought Dr. Flint would try hard to make fun of him or insult him. I was scared Uncle Phillip might get so upset that he would say something that could get him in more trouble. I also knew that in court, no one would believe a black man over a white man.
