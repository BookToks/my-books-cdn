He didn’t leave much to his family, except for some stuff he couldn’t hold onto. I already knew what to expect from the Flint family, and my worries were confirmed by a letter from the south. It warned me to be careful because Mrs. Flint openly said her daughter couldn’t afford to lose such a valuable slave as me.

I kept a close eye on the newspapers that listed new arrivals. But one Saturday night, I was busy and forgot to check the Evening Express like I usually did. Early the next morning, I went to the parlor and found the boy about to start a fire with the paper. I took it from him and looked at the list of arrivals. Reader, if you’ve never been a slave, you can’t imagine how badly my heart hurt when I saw the names Mr. and Mrs. Dodge at a hotel on Courtland Street.

It was a cheap hotel, and that showed me that what I had heard was true—they didn’t have much money and needed to sell me because I was valuable to them. I quickly took the paper to Mrs. Bruce. She was always kind and ready to help anyone in trouble, and she felt for me deeply.

I couldn’t tell how close the enemy was. He might have passed by the house while we were sleeping. He could have been waiting to catch me if I stepped outside. I had never seen the husband of my young mistress, so I couldn’t tell him apart from any other stranger.

We quickly ordered a carriage, and I followed Mrs. Bruce, hiding my face with a veil and taking the baby with me again as we ran away.

After many twists and turns...
