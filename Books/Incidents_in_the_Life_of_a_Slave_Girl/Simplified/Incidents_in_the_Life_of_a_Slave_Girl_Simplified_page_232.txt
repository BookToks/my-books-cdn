You might think that years of suffering during that happy festival seemed strange to those who were free. On New Year's Day before my aunt died, my friend Fanny was going to be sold at an auction to pay her master's debts. I thought about her all day, and at night I nervously asked what had happened to her.

I was told that she was sold to one master, and her four little girls were sold to another master far away. But she ran away from the person who bought her and nobody had found her. Her mother was old Aggie, who I mentioned before. She lived in a small house that belonged to my grandmother, on the same land as my grandmother’s house.

The police searched Aggie’s house and watched it closely, which made me have to stay hidden in my own place. The hunters somehow didn’t catch us, and soon Benny accidentally saw Fanny in her mother’s hut.

He told his grandmother, who made him promise never to talk about it because it was very dangerous. He kept that promise. Aggie didn’t know that my grandmother knew where her daughter was hiding, and that my grandmother was also very worried and scared. But these secrets made the two old mothers feel closer to each other.

Fanny and I stayed hidden near each other for many weeks, but she didn’t realize it. I wanted her to come stay in my place because it felt safer, but I had already caused my grandmother so much trouble that I didn’t want to make her take more risks.

My Preparations for Escape.
