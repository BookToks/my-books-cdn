When the boat arrived, I thanked him and went back to the ladies' cabin. Later, he came and told me that the conductor of the train was on board. He had talked to him, and the conductor promised to take care of us. I was very surprised by so much kindness. I don’t know if it was because my little girl’s sweet face won his heart or if the stewardess thought I was running away and asked the conductor to help me.

When the boat got to Stonington, the conductor kept his promise and showed us to seats in the first train car, near the engine. He asked us to sit next to the door, but as he walked by, we moved toward the other end of the car. No one was rude to us, and we arrived safely in Boston.

The day after I got there was one of the happiest days of my life. I felt like no one could catch me, and for the first time in many years, I had both my children with me.

They were very happy to be together again. They laughed and talked cheerfully. I watched them with a full heart. Everything they did made me happy.

I didn’t feel safe in New York, so I accepted a friend’s offer to share expenses and live together. I told Mrs. Hobbs that Ellen needed to go to school and stay with me for that. Ellen was ashamed that she couldn’t read or spell well at her age, so instead of sending her to school with Benny, I taught her myself until she was ready for an intermediate school.

The winter went by happily while I worked on my sewing, and my children studied their books.
