My mistress and I got along really well. After a week, old Mrs. Flint came to visit again and spent a long time talking with her daughter-in-law. I had a feeling I knew what they were talking about. The old doctor's wife had heard that I could leave the plantation if I agreed to one condition, and she really wanted to keep me there.

If she had trusted me like she should have, she wouldn’t have been scared that I’d agree to that condition. When she got into her carriage to go home, she said to young Mrs. Flint, “Don’t forget to send for them as soon as possible.” I was paying close attention and immediately guessed she meant my children.

The doctor came the next day, and when I walked into the room to set the tea table, I heard him say, “Don’t wait any longer. Send for them tomorrow.” I understood their plan. They thought having my children there would keep me stuck in one place, and that this was a good way to keep us slaves under control.

After the doctor left, a man came to visit who had always been friendly to my grandmother and her family. Mr. Flint took him around the plantation to show him the work done by men and women who were unpaid, poorly dressed, and very hungry.

The cotton crop was what they wanted to show off. It was admired, and the visitor took some samples to show his friends. I was told to bring water to wash his hands. While I did, he asked, “Linda, how do you like your new home?” I said I liked it as much as I expected. He said, “They don’t think you are happy, and tomorrow they are going...”
