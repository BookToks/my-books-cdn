What made me the most upset was that Benjamin was with his uncle William in California, but my sweet young daughter had come to spend a vacation with me. I thought about how much I had suffered as a slave when I was her age, and my heart felt fierce like a tiger protecting her baby from a hunter.

Dear Mrs. Bruce! I could almost see the look on her face as she turned away, feeling sad because I was so stubborn. When her words didn’t work, she sent Ellen to ask me nicely.

When it was ten o’clock at night and Ellen still hadn’t come back, this careful and tireless friend started to worry.

She came out with a carriage, bringing a big trunk full of things for my trip—hoping that by now I would listen and be reasonable. I finally agreed with her, just like I should have before.

The next day, baby and I left during a heavy snowstorm, heading back to New England. I got letters from the City of Iniquity, sent to me using a fake name. After a few days, one letter came from Mrs. Bruce, telling me that my new owner was still looking for me and that she wanted to stop this by buying my freedom. I was very thankful for her kindness, but the idea didn’t feel as good to me as you might think.

The more I understood, the harder it was for me to see myself as property. Paying money to people who had treated me so badly felt like taking away the victory from my suffering. I wrote back to Mrs. Bruce, thanking her but saying that being sold from one owner to another felt too much like the stories in Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.
