I was told that slavery was a big problem and couldn’t be easily fixed. I decided I wanted to go live with my brother in California.

Without telling me, Mrs. Bruce got a man in New York to talk with Mr. Dodge about buying my freedom.

He offered to pay three hundred dollars right away if Mr. Dodge would sell me and promise never to claim me or my children again.

The man who called himself my master said he thought that was too little money for someone like me.

The man negotiating said, “You can say no if you want, but if you do, you won’t get anything. The woman has friends who will help her and her children leave the country.” Mr. Dodge finally agreed, thinking half a deal was better than no deal.

Soon, I got a short letter from Mrs. Bruce: “I’m happy to tell you that the money for your freedom has been paid to Mr. Dodge. Come home tomorrow. I want to see you and my sweet baby.” My head spun when I read this. A man nearby said, “It’s true; I’ve seen the bill of sale.” The bill of sale! Those words hit me hard. I was finally sold! A person sold in free New York City!

The bill of sale is an important record. Future people will learn from it that women were treated like things to be bought and sold in New York in the late 1800s, even though it was a Christian society. This paper might help historians understand how much the United States has changed. I understand now how valuable freedom really is.
