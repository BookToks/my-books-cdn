Not long after I came back, I got a letter from Miss Emily Flint, who is now Mrs. Dodge. She said, “You will recognize my handwriting since I am your friend and former owner. I heard you went to Europe with a family, and I waited to hear when you got back to write to you. I should have answered your letter earlier, but I couldn’t act without my father’s permission. I knew nothing could be done to help you. Some people here wanted to buy you, and I risked trying to get you. I wouldn’t agree to that. I have always cared about you, and I don’t want you to be someone else’s slave or be treated badly. I’m married now and can protect you. My husband plans to move to Virginia this spring, and we want to settle there. I really want you to come live with me. If you don’t want to come, you can buy your freedom yourself, but I would rather have you live with me. If you come, you can spend a month with your grandma and friends, then come to me in Norfolk, Virginia. Please think about it and write back soon to tell me what you decide. I hope your kids are well. Your friend and mistress.”

Of course, I didn’t write back to thank her for this “friendly” invitation. I felt insulted that she thought I was dumb enough to believe such words.

“Come put into my parlor,” said the spider to the fly; the prettiest little parlor that you ever did spy.

Renewed Invitations to go South.
