The Loophole of Retreat.

A small shed had been added to my grandmother's house years ago. Some boards were placed across the beams at the top, and between these boards and the roof was a tiny attic, where only rats and mice lived. The roof slanted and was covered with shingles, like most buildings in the South. The attic was just nine feet long and seven feet wide. The tallest part was only three feet high and sloped down quickly to the floor made of loose boards. There was no way for light or air to get in.

My Uncle Philip, who was a carpenter, had skillfully made a hidden trapdoor that connected to the storeroom. He made this while I was waiting out in the swamp.

The storeroom opened onto a porch.

As soon as I entered the house, I was taken through this hole. The air was hot and heavy; it was completely dark. A bed had been spread on the floor. I could sleep comfortably on one side, but because of the sharp slope, I couldnâ€™t turn over without hitting the roof.

Rats and mice ran over my bed, but I was so tired that I slept deeply, like someone who has been through a terrible storm.

Morning came. I only knew because of the sounds I heard outside. My small hiding place was the same day and night.

I suffered more from the lack of air than from the darkness. But I was not alone. I heard the voices of my children.
