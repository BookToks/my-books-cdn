There were over 70 people up in the big north who were trying to get their freedom. Some people think that abolitionists have already made them free and that it’s the law, but their owners stop the law from working.

One woman asked me to get a newspaper and read it to her. She said her husband told her that black people sent a message to the queen of America saying they were still slaves. She didn’t believe it, so she went to Washington city to see the president about it.

They argued; she even pulled out a sword and promised he would help her make all of them free.

That poor, confused woman thought America was ruled by a queen, and the president worked for her. I wish the president worked for Queen Justice instead.
