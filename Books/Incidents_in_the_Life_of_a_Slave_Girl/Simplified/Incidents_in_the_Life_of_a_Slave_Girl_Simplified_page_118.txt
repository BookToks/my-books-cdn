He didn’t have any money, but he would bring me nice fruit when it was in season. I asked him if he didn’t know it was against the law, and that slaves could get whipped or put in jail for teaching each other to read. This made him start to cry.

“Don’t worry, Uncle Fred,” I said. “I’m not saying I won’t teach you. I just told you about the law so you’d know the danger and be careful.” He thought he could come three times a week without anyone suspecting him. I picked a quiet spot where no one could interrupt us, and there I taught him his ABCs. Considering his age, he learned really fast.

Soon, he could spell words with two syllables that he wanted to read from the Bible.

The happy smile on his face made me really glad. After spelling out a few words, he stopped and said, “Honey, it looks like when I can read this good book, I’ll be closer to God. White men learn easily.

It’s not easy for an old black man like me. I just want to read this book so I can know how to live, and then I won’t be afraid of dying.” I tried to encourage him by telling him how quickly he was learning.

“Be patient, child,” he said. “I learn slow.” I didn’t need patience. His thankfulness and happiness made all my hard work worth it.

After six months, he had read through the New Testament and could find any verse in it. One day, after he did really well reading, I said, “The Church and Slavery.”
