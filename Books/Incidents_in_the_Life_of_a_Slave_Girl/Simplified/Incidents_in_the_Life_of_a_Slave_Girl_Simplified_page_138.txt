I heard what was said, and it would have been just as brave to say it to my face. He had said things to me before that might have shocked his neighbor if they knew.

He was just like his father. I decided not to let him think I was too delicate when it came to work. I worked day and night, feeling miserable. When I lay down next to my child, I thought it would be easier to lose her than to watch her master hit her like he did to other kids every day. The mothers were so scared by the beatings that they didn’t dare say anything. How much more would I have to go through before I broke like them?

I tried to look as happy as I could. Sometimes I got to send a few words home, but that made me remember things that made it hard to act calm and like I didn’t care. Still, I noticed Mr. Flint looked at me with suspicion. Ellen couldn’t handle the hard life and broke down. Without anyone to take care of her, she wandered around and cried until she got sick. One day, she sat under the window where I was working, crying that heartbreaking cry that makes a mom’s heart hurt. I had to force myself not to cry too. After a while, she stopped.

I looked out, but she was gone. Since it was almost noon, I decided to go find her. The big house was raised two feet off the ground. I looked underneath and saw her halfway under, fast asleep.
