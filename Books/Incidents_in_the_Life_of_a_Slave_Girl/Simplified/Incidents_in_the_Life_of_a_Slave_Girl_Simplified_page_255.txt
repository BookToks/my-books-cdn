When we got to New York, I was almost overwhelmed by the crowd of coachmen shouting, "Carriage, ma'am?" We tried to make a deal with one to take us to Sullivan Street for twelve shillings. Then a big Irishman came up and said, "I'll take you for six shillings." 

Getting the price cut in half sounded great, so we asked if he could go right away. "Sure, I will, ladies," he said. I noticed the other drivers were smiling and asking if his carriage was okay. He said, "It's decent, ma'am. I wouldn’t take ladies in a bad cab." 

We gave him our tickets. He went to get our bags and came back, saying, "This way, please, ladies." We followed him and saw our trunks on a cart. He asked us to sit on them. We told him that wasn’t what we agreed on and he had to take the trunks off. He swore he wouldn’t move them until we paid six shillings.

Since it wasn’t smart to cause a scene, I almost paid him what he wanted. But a man nearby shook his head, telling me not to. 

After some trouble, we got rid of the Irishman and had our trunks properly loaded on a cab. We had been told about a boarding house on Sullivan Street, so we went there. Once we arrived, Fanny and I split up. The Anti-Slavery Society helped us.
