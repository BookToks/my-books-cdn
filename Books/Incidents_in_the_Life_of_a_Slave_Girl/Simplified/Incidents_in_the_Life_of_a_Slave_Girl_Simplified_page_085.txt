The baby cried a lot. She knew that her own husband had broken the trust and purity she had tried so hard to keep. She had a second child by her master, and then he sold her and her children to his brother.

She had two children with the brother and was sold again. The next sister went crazy because the life she had to live was too hard for her. The third sister had five daughters. Before her fourth child was born, their kind mistress died. She always tried to be as nice as she could to the slaves, even though she was in a tough situation. She died peacefully, happy to end a life made so sad by the man she loved.

That man wasted the money he was given and tried to fix things by getting married again. But after a night of heavy drinking, he was found dead in the morning. People said he was a good master because he fed and clothed his slaves better than most, and they didn’t get whipped as often as on other plantations. If it weren’t for slavery, he might have been a better man, and his wife a happier woman.

No words can really explain how much slavery ruins everything. A slave girl grows up in a place full of bad behavior and fear. The whip and the mean words from her master and his sons teach her how to live. When she is about fourteen or fifteen, her owner, his sons, or the overseer might try to bribe her with gifts.

If that doesn’t work, they might whip her or starve her until she does what they want.

She might have learned about religion from a kind person before, but...
