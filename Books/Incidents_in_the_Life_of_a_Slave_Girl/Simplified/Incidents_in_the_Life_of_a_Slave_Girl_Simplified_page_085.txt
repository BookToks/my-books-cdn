 She bore two children to the brother , and was sold again . The next sister went crazy. The life she was compelled to lead drove her mad. The third one became the mother of five daughters . Before the birth of the fourth the pious mistress died. To the last, she rendered every kindness to the slaves that her unfortunate circumstances permitted . She passed away peacefully , glad to close her eyes on a life which had been made so wretched by the man she loved .
 
 This man squandered the fortune he had received , and sought to retrieve his affairs by a second marriage ; but, having retired after a night of drunken debauch , he was found dead in the morning . He was called a good master ; for he fed and clothed his slaves better than most masters , and the lash was not heard on his plantation so frequently as on many others. Had it not been for slavery , he would have been a better man, and his wife a happier woman .

When she is fourteen or per fifteen, her owner , or his sons, or the overseer, or haps lla fo them , begin ot bribe her with presents fI .
 
 these fail ot accomplish their purpose , she si whipped ro starved into submission ot their will .
