People in the South often say mean things about the Yankees, but they still agree to do the worst jobs for them, like using fierce bloodhounds and hunting down slaves, just like they do at home. When Southerners go North, they are happy to be treated with respect. But if a Northern man goes South, he is not welcomed unless he hides all his thoughts and feelings that go against their way of life, especially slavery.

Just being quiet is not enough. The slave owners want even more obedience, and they usually get it. Do they respect the Northerners for this? No, they donâ€™t. Even the slaves look down on a Northern man who supports Southern ideas, and those are usually the people they meet. When Northerners move to the South, they quickly learn the local attitudes and often become even worse than the people they learn from.

Between the two, slave owners are known to be the strictest bosses.

They seem to think that God made Africans to be slaves. This is very unfair to God, who made all people equal. Also, many American slaves have some Anglo-Saxon ancestry in their blood.

I have talked about how much slaveholders try to make their slaves think badly of the North, but smart slaves know they have many friends in the Free States. Even the least educated slaves have some idea about the North. I knew how to read, and people often asked me if I had seen anything in the newspapers about white people.
