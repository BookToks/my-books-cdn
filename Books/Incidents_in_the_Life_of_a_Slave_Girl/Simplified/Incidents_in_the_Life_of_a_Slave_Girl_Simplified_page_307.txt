I have a piece of paper that means I’m free now. Even though I love freedom, I don’t like to think about how I got it. I’m really thankful to the kind friend who helped me get it, but I hate the terrible person who asked for money for something that was never his to sell.

I didn’t want my freedom to be bought, but I have to admit that when it happened, I felt like a big weight was taken off my tired shoulders.

When I rode home on the train, I wasn’t scared to show my face or look at people as they passed by. I wish I could have met Daniel Dodge himself, so he could see me and feel sorry for having to sell me for three hundred dollars.

When I got home, my kind helper hugged me, and we both cried.

As soon as she could talk, she said, “Oh Linda, I’m so glad this is over!

You told me you were afraid you’d be sold from one owner to another. But I didn’t buy you to make you work. I would have done the same thing if you were leaving for California tomorrow. At least I know you left me a free woman.”

My heart was so full of feelings. I thought about how my poor father tried to buy me when I was little, but he was sad that he couldn’t. I hoped his spirit was happy for me now. I thought about my loving grandmother who saved money to buy me later and how many times her plans were stopped.

That faithful, loving old heart would be so happy if she could see me now.
