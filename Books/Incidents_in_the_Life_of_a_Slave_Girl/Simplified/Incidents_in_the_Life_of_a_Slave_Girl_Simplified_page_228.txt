Mrs. Flint had never thought that slaves could have feelings. When my grandmother was asked, she immediately said she wanted Nancy to be buried with all the rest of her family, where her own old body would be buried too.

Mrs. Flint kindly agreed to this, even though she said it was hard for her to have Nancy buried away from her.

She could have added sadly, “I was so used to sleeping with Nancy near me, on the entry floor.” My uncle Phillip asked if he could pay to bury his sister, and slave owners usually said yes to such requests from slaves and their families. The funeral was simple but respectful.

Nancy was buried on Sunday, and Mrs. Flint’s minister led the funeral service.

A large group of Black people, both slaves and free, came, along with a few white people who had always been kind to our family.

Dr. Flint’s carriage was part of the funeral procession. When Nancy’s body was laid to rest in a humble grave, Mrs. Flint cried a little and went back to her carriage, probably feeling she had done her duty well.

The slaves talked about it as a very grand funeral. Visitors from the North might have called this respectful tribute to a humble person a beautiful part of the “patriarchal system,” showing love between slave owners and their slaves. Kind Mrs. Flint would have agreed, wiping tears from her eyes.

But we could have told a different story.

We could have shared many stories of pain and injustice that would have deeply moved Aunt Nancy, if those people had hearts to feel for Black people.
