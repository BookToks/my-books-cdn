Aunt Nancy brought me all the news she could hear about Dr. Flint.  

From her, I learned that the doctor had written to New York about a colored woman who had been born and raised near us and had been around him.  

He offered her a reward if she could find out anything about me.  

I don’t know how she answered, but soon after, she left for New York in a hurry, telling his family she had important business to do.  

I saw him as he passed on his way to the steamboat.  

It felt good to have miles of land and water between us, even if only for a little while. It felt even better knowing he thought I was in the Free States.  

My little hiding place didn’t seem as lonely as before.  

He came back from New York, just like before, without finding any useful information.  

The next morning, when he walked past our house, Benny was standing at the gate. He had heard they said the doctor had gone to find me, so he shouted, “Dr. Flint, did you bring my mother home? I want to see her.”  

The doctor got very angry, stamped his foot, and shouted, “Get out of my way, you little damn rascal! If you don’t, I’ll cut off your head!”  

Benny ran scared into the house, saying, “You can’t put me in jail again. I don’t belong to you now.”  

Luckily, the wind blew his words away from the doctor’s ears.  

I told my grandmother about this when we met next time in our secret spot and asked her not to let the kids be rude or bother the angry old man.  

Autumn came, and the heat became more bearable.
