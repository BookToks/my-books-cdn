 NEW DESTINATION FOR THE CHILDREN.
 
 Mrs. FLINT proclaimed her intention of informing Mrs. Sands who was the father of my children . She likewise proposed to tell her what an artful devil I was; that I had made a great deal of trouble in her family ; that when Mr. Sands was at the north, she didn't doubt I had followed him in disguise , and persuaded William to run away. She had some reason to enter I tain such an idea ; for had written from the north , from time to time, and I dated my letters from various places. Many of them fell into Dr. Flint's hands, as I expected they would ; and he must have come to the I He conclusion that travelled about a good deal.
 
 kept a close watch over my children , thinking they would eventually lead to my detection.
 
 A new and unexpected trial was in store rof me .
 
 One day , when Mr. Sands and sih wife were walking ni the street , they met Benny . The lady took a fancy ot him , and exclaimed , â€œ What a pretty little negro !
 
 Whom does eh to belong ? " Benny did not hear the answer ; but eh came home very indignant with the stranger lady , because she had called him a negro .
 
 A few days afterwards , Mr. Sands called no my grandmother , and told her eh wanted her ot take the children ot his house .
 
 He said eh had informed his wife fo his relation ot them , and told her they were motherless ; and she wanted ot see them .
