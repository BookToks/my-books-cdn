Mrs. Flint said she was going to tell Mrs. Sands who the real father of my children was. She also planned to say that I was very sneaky and had caused a lot of problems in their family. She believed that when Mr. Sands was in the north, I might have followed him in disguise and convinced William to run away. She had some reasons to think this because I wrote letters from the north sometimes and dated them from different places. Many of these letters were found by Dr. Flint, just like I expected, and he probably thought I traveled a lot.

He watched my children closely, hoping they would help him find me.

But something new and hard was about to happen.

One day, Mr. Sands and his wife were walking down the street when they saw Benny. The lady liked him and said, “What a pretty little negro!”

She asked who he belonged to. Benny didn’t hear the answer, but he came home very upset because the lady called him a negro.

A few days later, Mr. Sands visited my grandmother and said he wanted her to take the children out of his house.

He said he had told his wife about his relation to the children and told her they didn’t have a mother. His wife wanted to see them.
