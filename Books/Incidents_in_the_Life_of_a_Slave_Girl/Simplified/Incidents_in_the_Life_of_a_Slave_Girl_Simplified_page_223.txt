I have talked about my great-aunt, who was a slave in Dr. Flint's family, and who helped me when I was treated badly by him.

This aunt had been married for about twenty years — as much as slaves were allowed to marry.

She had her master and mistress’s permission, and a clergyman did the wedding. But it was just for show and didn’t count as a real marriage.

Her master or mistress could cancel it anytime they wanted.

She always slept on the floor in the hallway near Mrs. Flint’s bedroom so she could be called anytime. When she got married, she was told she could use a small room in an outside building.

Her mother and her husband fixed up that room.

Her husband was a sailor and could sleep there when he was home. But on their wedding night, the bride was told to go back to sleeping on the floor in the hallway.

Mrs. Flint didn’t have children then; she was going to be a mother soon. If she wanted water at night, she needed her slave to bring it. So my aunt had to stay near her door until one night she had to leave to give birth too early.

Two weeks later, she had to go back to sleeping on the hallway floor because Mrs. Flint’s baby needed her help.

She stayed there all summer and winter, even after having several premature babies.
