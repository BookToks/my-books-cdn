She worked as both housekeeper and waiting maid for her mistress. She was involved in everything from start to finish. Mrs. Flint, like many southern women, had very little energy. She wasn’t strong enough to manage the household, but she had nerves so tough that she could sit in her chair and watch a woman get whipped until blood came from every lash.

She was part of the church, but taking part in the Lord’s supper didn’t make her act like a Christian. One Sunday, if dinner wasn’t ready at the exact time, she would stand in the kitchen waiting until it was served. Then she would spit in all the kettles and pans used for cooking.

She did this to stop the cook and her children from sneaking extra food from the gravy and scraps.

The slaves only ate what she allowed them to have. Food was measured carefully by pounds and ounces three times a day. She never let them eat wheat bread from her flour barrel.

She knew exactly how many biscuits could be made from a quart of flour and how big they should be.

Dr. Flint liked fancy food. The cook was always scared to send food to his table. If there was a dish he didn’t like, he would either order the cook to be whipped or force her to eat all of it in front of him. The poor cook might not mind eating the food, but she hated being forced to eat it until she nearly choked.

They also had a pet dog that caused problems in the house.
