231 and her house would be torn down. Poor Peter, huh!

I thought about dying a horrible death like the poor slave James did, and because of his kindness in trying to help me, how terrible it would be for us all!

Sadly, I was used to thinking like this, and it made my heart hurt. I tried to hide my worries and speak gently to her.

She mentioned Aunt Nancy, the dear daughter she had just buried, and then she lost control. As she stood there, shaking and crying, a voice from the porch called out, “Where are you, Aunt Marthy?” Grandmother was startled and, in her worry, opened the door without thinking about me.

It was Jenny, the naughty housemaid, who had tried to come into my room when I was hiding in the house for my white helper. “I’ve been looking everywhere for you, Aunt Marthy,” she said.

“Missis wants you to send her some crackers.” I had hidden behind a barrel that completely covered me, but I thought Jenny was looking right at me, and my heart raced. My grandmother realized what she had done and quickly went out with Jenny to count the crackers, locking the door behind her.

She came back to me a few minutes later, looking like the perfect picture of sadness. “Poor child!” she said, “My carelessness has ruined you.

The boat hasn’t left yet.

Get ready right away and go with Fanny. I have nothing more to say about it now; you never know what might happen today.” Uncle Phillip was called, and he agreed with his mother, thinking Jenny would tell Dr. Flint.
