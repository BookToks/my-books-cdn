I had breakfast with my family. I knew this was because of my skin color, but he was polite, so I didn’t mind it.

At Saratoga, the United States Hotel was very crowded, so Mr. Bruce got one of the cottages that belonged to the hotel. I had been happy to think about going to the quiet countryside, where I would meet only a few people. But instead, I found myself surrounded by many Southerners. I looked around nervously, afraid someone might recognize me. I was glad that we would only stay for a short time.

We soon went back to New York to get ready for the rest of the summer at Rockaway.

While the laundress was sorting the clothes, I took a chance to go over to Brooklyn to see Ellen. I met her while she was going to a grocery store. The first thing she said was, “Oh, mother, don’t go to Mrs. Hobbs’s. Her brother, Mr. Thorne, has come from the South, and maybe he’ll tell where you are.” I listened to her warning. I told her I would leave with Mrs. Bruce the next day and would try to see her when I came back.

Because I was a servant of the Anglo-Saxon race, I was not put into a “Jim Crow car” on our way to Rockaway. I was also not asked to ride on top of trunks in a truck through the streets. But everywhere I went, I saw the same cruel prejudice that hurts the feelings and stops the energy of Black people.

We got to Rockaway before it got dark and stayed at the Pavilion — a large hotel beautifully located by the sea — a popular place for many people.
