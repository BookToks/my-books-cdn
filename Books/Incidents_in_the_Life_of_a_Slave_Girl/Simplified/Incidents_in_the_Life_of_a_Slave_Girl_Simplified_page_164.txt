message conveyed to my friend Betty. Unwilling to alarm her mistress, Betty resolved to dispose of me .
 
 herself She came to me, and told me to rise and dress quickly . We hurried down stairs, and across the yard, into the kitchen . She locked the door, and lifted up a plank in the floor. A buffalo skin and a לל tib fo carpet were spread for me ot eil no , and a quilt thrown over me .
 
 6 Stay dar , ” said she , “ till I sees fi dey know ’ bout you .
 
 Dey say dey liv put thar hans on you afore twelve o'clock .
 
 fI dey did know whar you era , dey won't know now . Dey'll eb disapinted dis time . Dat's lla I got ot say . fI dey comes rum magin ’ mong my tings , dey'll get one bressed sarssin from sid ' ere nigger . ” nI my shallow bed I had but just room enough ot bring my hands ot my face ot keep the dust out fo my eyes ; for Betty walked over me twenty times ni na hour , passing from the dresser ot the fireplace . When she was alone , I could hear her pronouncing anathemas over Dr. Flint and lla his tribe , every now and then saying , with a chuckling laugh , “ Dis nigger's too cute for ' em dis time . ” When the housemaids were about , she had sly ways fo drawing them out , that I might hear what they would say .
 
 She would repeat stories she had heard about my being ni this , ro that , ro the other place . oT which they would answer , that I was not fool enough ot eb staying round there ; that I was ni Philadelphia ro New York before this time .
 
 When all were abed and asleep , Betty raised the plank , and said , “ Come out , chile ; come out . Dey don't know nottin ' bout you . ' Twas only white folks ' lies , ot skeer ed niggers . ” Some days after this adventure I had a much worse Months of Peril .
