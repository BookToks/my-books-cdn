I sent a message to my friend Betty. She didn’t want to scare her mistress, so Betty decided to hide me.

She came to me and told me to get up and dress quickly. We rushed downstairs and across the yard to the kitchen. She locked the door, lifted a plank in the floor, and under it, she had spread a buffalo skin and a carpet for me to lie on. Then she covered me with a quilt.

“Stay here,” she said, “until I see if they know about you. They say they want to catch you before twelve o’clock. If they knew where you were, they wouldn’t now. They’ll be disappointed this time. That’s all I can say. If they come searching my things, they’ll get a good surprise from me.”

In my small hiding spot, I barely had enough room to cover my face to keep the dust out of my eyes because Betty kept walking over me all the time, going back and forth between the dresser and the fireplace. When she was alone, I could hear her cursing Dr. Flint and his family, sometimes laughing and saying, “This nigger’s too smart for them this time.” When the housemaids were around, she found sneaky ways to make them talk so I could hear what they said.

She would tell them stories she heard about where I might be, and they would say I was too smart to stay there, that I was probably already in Philadelphia or New York.

When everyone was asleep, Betty lifted the plank and said, “Come out, child; come out. They don’t know anything about you. It’s just white folks’ lies to scare black people.” A few days after this, I had even worse dangers to face.
