My grandmother kept sending him fresh clothes because his old ones were burned.

The last night we saw him in jail, his mother begged him to ask his master for forgiveness.

But no matter what she said, he didn’t change his mind. He calmly said, “I am waiting for his time.” The sound of his chains was very sad.

Three more months went by, and Benjamin left the prison. We who loved him came to say a long and final goodbye. A slave trader had bought him. You remember, I told you how much he was worth when he was ten years old. Now he was over twenty and sold for three hundred dollars. His new master didn’t realize what he was doing.

Being locked up so long made Benjamin’s face very pale and his body very thin. Also, the trader had heard things about Benjamin’s character and didn’t think he would be a good slave. The trader said he would pay any price if Benjamin was a girl. We were grateful he wasn’t.

If you had seen that mother holding her child tight when they put the irons on his wrists; if you had heard her painful cries and seen her wild, red eyes looking for mercy; if you had watched that scene like I did, you would say, “Slavery is terrible!”

Benjamin, her youngest and favorite, was gone forever!

She couldn’t believe it. She even talked to the trader to see if she could buy Benjamin back. She was told he was The Slave who Dared to Feel like a Man.
