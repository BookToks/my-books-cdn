38 My grandmother continued to send him fresh changes of clothes. The old ones were burned up .
 
 The last night we saw him in jail his mother still begged him to send for his master , and beg his pardon .
 
 Neither persuasion nor argument could turn hin from his purpose. He calmly answered , â€œ I am waiting his time." Those chains were mournful to hear .
 
 Another three months passed, and Benjamin left his prison walls . We that loved him waited to bid him a long and last farewell . A slave trader had bought him . You remember , I told you what price he brought when ten years of age. Now he was more than twenty years old , and sold for three hundred dol lars . The master had been blind to his own interest .
 
 Long confinement had made his face too pale, his form too thin ; moreover , the trader had heard some thing of his character , and it did not strike him as suitable for a slave. He said he would give any price if the handsome lad was a girl . We thanked God that he was not.
 
 Could you have seen that mother clinging to her child , when they fastened the irons upon his wrists ; could you have heard her heart -rending groans , and seen her bloodshot eyes wander wildly from face to face, vainly pleading for mercy ; could you have wit I nessed that scene as saw it, you would exclaim , Slavery is damnable !
 
 Benjamin , her youngest, her pet, was forever gone !
 
 She could not realize it. She had had an interview with the trader for the purpose of ascertaining if Benjamin could be purchased . She was told it was The Slave who Dared to Feel like a Man.
