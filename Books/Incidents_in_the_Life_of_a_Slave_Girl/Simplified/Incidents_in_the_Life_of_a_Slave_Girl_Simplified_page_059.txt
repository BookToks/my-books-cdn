I did what she told me. As I kept talking, her face changed a lot. She cried, and sometimes I groaned too. She spoke in a very sad voice, and I felt touched by her sadness. Tears came to my eyes, but I soon realized she was actually angry and hurt in her pride. 

She felt like her marriage vows were broken and her honor was insulted. But she didn’t care about me, the poor victim of her husband’s cheating. She felt sorry for herself like she was a martyr, but she couldn’t feel sorry for me and the shame and misery I was going through.

Maybe she felt a little something for me, because after our talk, she spoke kindly. She said I should be safe and promised to protect me. 

I felt a bit better because of what she said, if only I could trust it. But my experience as a slave made me distrustful. She wasn’t very polite or calm and didn’t control her emotions well.

I made her jealous, so she hated me. I knew I couldn’t expect kindness or trust from her given the situation I was in. I didn’t blame her. Slave owners’ wives act like other women would in similar situations. Her anger started from small things, but it grew so strong the doctor had to stop what he planned to do.

I knew I had started the trouble and expected to be punished later. But I was too grateful to my mistress for helping me when she did to care about that. She took me to sleep after that.
