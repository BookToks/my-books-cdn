$300 REWARD! A smart, bright mixed-race girl named Linda ran away. She is 21 years old and five feet four inches tall. She has dark eyes and black hair that curls but can be straightened. One of her front teeth has a rotten spot. She knows how to read and write. She will probably try to get to the Free States.

No one is allowed to hide or hire her, or they will get in trouble with the law.

$150 will be paid to anyone who catches her in the state. If she is caught outside the state and brought back to me or put in jail, the reward is $300.

DR. FLINT.
