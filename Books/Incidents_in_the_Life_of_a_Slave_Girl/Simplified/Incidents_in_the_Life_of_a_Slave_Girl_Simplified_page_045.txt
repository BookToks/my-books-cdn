It seemed impossible because the man had promised not to sell Benjamin until he was out of the state. He said he wouldn’t sell him until he got to New Orleans.

With a strong will and steady hope, my grandmother started her loving work. Benjamin had to be free.

She knew that even if she succeeded, they would still be apart, but that wasn’t too big a price to pay. She worked day and night. The trader’s price for Benjamin would triple what he originally paid, but she didn’t give up.

She hired a lawyer to write to a man she knew in New Orleans. She asked him to help Benjamin, and he agreed. When he saw Benjamin and explained the situation, the man thanked him but said he wanted to wait before making an offer to the trader. He knew the trader had tried to get a high price but failed. This gave the man hope to try again for Benjamin’s freedom.

One morning, long before sunrise, Benjamin was gone. He was sailing over the blue waves, on his way to Baltimore.

For once, his light skin helped him.

No one suspected he was a slave; otherwise, the law would have been followed, and he would have been sent back to slavery.

Even the brightest days can have dark clouds. Benjamin got sick and had to stay in Baltimore for three weeks.

His strength came back slowly, and his wish to keep traveling seemed to slow down his healing.

How could he get stronger without fresh air and exercise? He decided to try a short walk. He picked a quiet street where he thought he was safe from being seen.
