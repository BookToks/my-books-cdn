There were terrible oaths that could scare anyone into silence, but she couldn’t always stay quiet. It was natural for her, like a mother, to try to protect me, but it only made things worse.

When they told me my new baby was a girl, my heart felt heavier than ever before.

Slavery is awful for men, but it is even worse for women. Besides the usual hard things everyone faces, women have special wrongs, sufferings, and humiliations all their own.

Dr. Flint promised he would make me suffer for this new “crime” against him, as he called it. As long as he had power over me, he kept his promise.

On the fourth day after my baby was born, he suddenly came into my room and told me to get up and bring my baby to him.

The nurse who cared for me had left the room to get some food ready, so I was alone. I had no choice. I got up, picked up my baby, and went over to where he was sitting. “Now stand there,” he said, “and don’t you dare go back!” My child looked a lot like her father and her grandmother, Mrs. Sands, who had died.

He saw this, and while I stood before him, weak and shaking, he called me and my baby every nasty name he could think of. Even the grandmother, who was dead, didn’t escape his curses.

In the middle of his insults, I fainted at his feet. This seemed to shock him back to reality.

He took the baby from my arms, laid her on the bed, splashed cold water on my face, picked me up, and shook me hard to wake me up before anyone else came into the room.

Just then my grandmother...
