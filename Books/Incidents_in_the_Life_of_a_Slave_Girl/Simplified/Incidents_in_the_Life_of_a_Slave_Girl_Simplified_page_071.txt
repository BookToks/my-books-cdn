I was sent out to work in the fields. Was it strange that I didn’t feel proud of the people who were supposed to protect me? As for the overseer, I respected him even less than a hunting dog.

Young Mr. Flint didn’t bring back good news from Louisiana, and after that, I didn’t hear anything more about that plan.

Soon after, my lover met me on the street corner, and I stopped to talk to him. Looking up, I saw my master watching us from his window. I hurried home, shaking with fear. I was called right away and taken to his room. He greeted me with a hit.

“When will your mistress be married?” he asked in a mean voice.

He then started cursing and yelling. I was so thankful my lover was a free man! My cruel master couldn’t punish him for talking to me on the street.

Over and over, I thought about how all this would end.

There was no hope the doctor would agree to sell me, no matter what.

He was very stubborn and determined to keep me and control me.

My lover was smart and religious. Even if he could have gotten permission to marry me while I was a slave, the marriage wouldn’t have protected me from my master.

It would have made him sad to see all the insults I would get. And if we had children, they would have to live as slaves too. “What a terrible pain that would be for a free, smart father!”

For his sake, I felt I shouldn’t tie his life to my unhappy fate.

He was going to Savannah to see about some property left to him by an uncle.
