154, “nice hot supper,” and the lady hurried downstairs to keep things in order until she came back. My heart was so full of thankfulness! I couldn’t find the words to say, but I felt like kissing the feet of the kind woman who helped me. For that act of true kindness, may God always bless her!

That night, I went to sleep feeling like I was the luckiest slave in town.

Morning came and brightened my small room. I thanked God for this safe place.

Across from my window was a stack of feather beds. On top of them, I could hide well and watch the street where Dr. Flint walked to his office. Even though I was worried, I felt a little proud when I saw him. So far, I had tricked him, and I felt like I won. Who can blame slaves for being clever? They have to be.

It’s the only way weak and hurt people can fight against their cruel masters.

I hoped every day to hear that my master had sold my children because I knew someone was ready to buy them. But Dr. Flint cared more about getting revenge than money. My brother William, the kind aunt who had worked for his family for twenty years, my little Benny, and Ellen, who was just over two years old, were all thrown into jail to force my family to tell him where I was.

He promised my grandmother she would never see any of them again until I came back. They didn’t tell me this for several days. When I found out my little ones were in a dirty jail, my first feeling was fear.
