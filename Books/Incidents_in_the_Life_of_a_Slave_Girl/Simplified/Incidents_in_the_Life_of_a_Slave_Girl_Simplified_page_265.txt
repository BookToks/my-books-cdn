If your grandmother bought you, it’s not sure you would be allowed to stay, even if it was legal. If a servant could buy herself after running away for so long and come back free, it would cause problems. From your letter, I think your life must be hard and uncomfortable. Come home. You can still be part of our family. We would welcome you with open arms and happy tears. You don’t have to worry about being treated badly because we didn’t spend any money or effort to get you back. If we had, maybe we would feel different.

You know my sister always cared about you, and you were never treated like a slave. You never had to do hard work or work in the fields. Instead, you lived in the house and were treated almost like a free person. At least, you should have felt you were better than to run away and bring shame on yourself.

I hope you might want to come back on your own, so I’m writing for my sister. The family will be so happy to see you. Your poor old grandmother really wants you to come after hearing your letter. In her old age, she needs comfort from having her children close.

You probably know your aunt died. She was a loyal servant and a faithful member of the church. In her Christian life, she showed us how to live—and, sadly, she also showed us how to die. If you could have seen us by her deathbed, with her mother, all crying together, you would have understood.
