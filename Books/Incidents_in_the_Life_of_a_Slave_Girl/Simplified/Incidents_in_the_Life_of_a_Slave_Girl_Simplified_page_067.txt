The Lover.  

“So you want to get married, do you?” he said. “And to a free Black man.”  

“Yes, sir.”  

“Well, I’ll soon show you if I’m your master, or if that Black man you like is.”  

“If you want a husband, you can marry one of my slaves.”  

What a situation! I would be the wife of one of his slaves, even if I cared for him!  

I answered, “Don’t you think a slave can have some choice about marriage?”  

“Do you think all men are the same?”  

“Do you love this Black man?” he asked suddenly.  

“Yes, sir.”  

“How dare you tell me that!” he shouted angrily.  

After a moment, he said, “I thought you respected yourself more, that you wouldn’t accept insults from such low people.”  

I replied, “If I am a low person, then we both are, because we are both Black.”  

“It’s right and honorable for us to love each other. The man you call low never insulted me, and he wouldn’t love me if he didn’t believe I was a good woman.”  

He jumped at me like a tiger and hit me hard.  

It was the first time he had ever hit me, and I was too scared to control my anger.  

When I felt a little better, I said, “You hit me for telling you the truth. How I hate you!”  

There was silence for a few minutes.  

Maybe he was thinking about how to punish me, or maybe he wanted me to think about what I said.
