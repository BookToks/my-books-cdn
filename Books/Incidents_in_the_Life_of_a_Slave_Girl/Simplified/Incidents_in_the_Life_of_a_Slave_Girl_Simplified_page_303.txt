Free at Last.

I had a Black friend from my hometown who I trusted completely. I sent for him and told him that Mr. and Mrs. Dodge had arrived in New York. They wanted him to visit them to ask about his friends down south, who Dr. Flint’s family knew well. He didn’t think it was wrong to do that, so he agreed.

He went to the hotel and knocked on Mr. Dodge’s door. Mr. Dodge opened it himself and asked gruffly, "What are you doing here? How did you find out I was in the city?" My friend said, "Your arrival was in the evening papers, so I came to ask Mrs. Dodge about my friends back home. I didn’t think it would upset you."

Mr. Dodge asked, "Where is that Black girl that belongs to my wife?" My friend asked, "What girl?" Mr. Dodge answered, "You know well enough. I mean Linda, who ran away from Dr. Flint’s plantation years ago. I’m sure you’ve seen her and know where she is."

My friend said, "Yes, sir, I’ve seen her and know where she is."

Mr. Dodge said, "She’s out of your reach." He added, "Tell me where she is, and I’ll give her a chance to buy her freedom."

My friend replied, "I don’t think that would help. I’ve heard Linda say she’d rather go to the ends of the earth than pay anyone for her freedom because she believes she has a right to it. Besides, even if she wanted to, she couldn’t pay because she’s spent all her money educating her children."

This made Mr. Dodge very angry, and they started arguing. My friend was worried about what might happen next.
