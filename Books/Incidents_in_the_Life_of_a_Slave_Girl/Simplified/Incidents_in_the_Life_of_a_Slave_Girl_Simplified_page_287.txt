It was clear that Dr. Flint’s family knew where I was going because they found out about my trip to Europe. I expected to have more problems with them, but since I had avoided them so far, I hoped to keep doing the same. I wanted to use the money I earned to help pay for my children’s education and to buy a home for them. It felt not only unfair but also wrong to have to pay for myself. I could never see myself as just someone’s property. Also, I had worked many years without getting paid, and during that time, I had to rely on my grandmother for food and clothes.

My children definitely belonged to me. Even though Dr. Flint had paid some money to support them, he had also gotten a lot of money for them. I knew the law would say I was his property, and it might still give his daughter rights over my children. But I thought those laws were like rules made by thieves, and they had no right to be respected.

The Fugitive Slave Law had not been passed yet.

The judges in Massachusetts hadn’t yet been controlled by unfair laws in the courts. I knew my old master was afraid to come to Massachusetts. I trusted that the state loved freedom, and I felt safe there.

Now I realize I gave Massachusetts more credit than she deserved.
