I wanted to stay pure and keep my self-respect, even though things were really hard. But I was fighting alone against the terrible power of slavery, and it was too strong for me. I felt like God and everyone had abandoned me. I thought all my efforts were useless, and I started to act without caring because I was so hopeless.

I told you before that Dr. Flint and his wife caused gossip in the neighborhood. One day, a white single man learned about my situation. He knew my grandmother and often talked about me when we passed in the street.

He became interested in me and asked about my master. I answered some of his questions. He showed a lot of sympathy and said he wanted to help. He tried to see me whenever he could and wrote to me a lot. I was just a poor fifteen-year-old slave girl.

Getting attention from someone important felt good because people are the same everywhere. I also felt thankful for his kindness and felt encouraged by his nice words. Having a friend like that seemed like a big deal. Slowly, I started to feel something more.

He was educated and spoke very well—but too well for a poor slave girl who trusted him. I could tell where all this was going. I knew there was a big gap between us. But having a man who wasn’t married and wasn’t my master pay attention to me felt good for my pride and feelings, even if slavery had taken most of that away.
