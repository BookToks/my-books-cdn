His text was, “Servants, obey your masters who own you, with respect and honesty, as if you were serving Christ.” 

Mr. Pike fixed his hair so it stood up and said seriously, “Listen, servants! Pay close attention to what I say. You are acting badly. Your hearts are full of bad things. The devil is trying to trick you. God is angry and will punish you if you don’t stop doing wrong. Those of you who live in town only pretend to work when your masters are watching.

Instead of doing your work well, which would please God, you are lazy and avoid your jobs. God sees everything. You lie, and God hears you. Instead of worshipping God, you hide away, using your master’s things for fun, like throwing coffee grounds with a fortune teller or playing cards with an old woman. Your masters might not know, but God does, and He will punish you.

How bad your hearts are! When your master’s work is done, do you quietly think about how good God is to you? No, you fight and make little bags of roots to bury under doors to harm each other.

God sees you. You men sneak off to bars to sell your master’s corn to buy rum to drink. God sees you. You hide in back streets or bushes to gamble.

Even if your masters don’t catch you, God sees everything and will punish you. You must leave The Church and Slavery behind.
