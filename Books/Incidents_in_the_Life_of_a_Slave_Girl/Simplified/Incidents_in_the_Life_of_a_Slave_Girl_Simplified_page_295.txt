When he got into that neighborhood, he started acting really bossy and strange. If Luke didn’t want to follow his orders, the constable was called right away.

Some of the things he did were so gross, I can’t even say them.

When I ran away from that terrible house, I had to leave poor Luke still chained by the bed to that cruel and disgusting man.

One day, while I was running an errand for Mrs. Bruce and walking through the back streets like usual, I saw a young man coming toward me. His face looked familiar. As he got closer, I realized it was Luke. I was always happy to see or hear about someone who escaped from slavery, but because I knew how hard his life had been, I was especially glad to see him here in the North, even though I didn’t think of it as truly free anymore. I remembered how lonely it felt to be alone in a strange place, so I went up to him and said hi warmly.

At first, he didn’t recognize me. But when I told him my name, he remembered everything. I told him about the Fugitive Slave Law and asked if he knew that New York was full of kidnappers.

He said, “The risk isn’t as bad for me as it is for you. I ran away from the speculator, and you ran away from the master. Those speculators won’t waste money coming here after a runaway unless they’re sure they can catch him. And I took good care of myself. I had too many hard times down there to let them catch me.” Then he told me about the advice he got and the plans he made. I asked if he had enough money to get to Canada. “That depends,” he said.
