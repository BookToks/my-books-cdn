Terrible thunderstorms were okay sometimes because the rain came through the roof, and I rolled up my bed to cool the hot boards under it. Later in the season, storms would sometimes soak my clothes all the way through, and that was not comfortable when the air got cold.

I could keep out moderate storms by filling the cracks with oakum.

Even though my situation was uncomfortable, I got to see some things outside that made me thankful for my awful hiding place. One day, I saw a slave pass our gate, muttering, “It's his own, and he can kill it if he will.” My grandmother told me her story. That day, the slave's mistress had seen her baby for the first time, and because the baby looked like her husband, she kicked the slave woman and her child out and said they could never come back.

The slave went to her master and told him what happened. He promised to talk to her mistress and fix things. But the next day, she and her baby were sold to a trader in Georgia.

Another time, I saw a scared woman running by, chased by two men. She was a slave, the wet nurse for her mistress's children.

Her mistress had ordered her to be stripped and whipped for some small mistake.

To escape the pain and shame, she ran to the river, jumped in, and ended her suffering by dying.

Senator Brown from Mississippi couldn’t have ignored many stories like these because they happened a lot in every Southern state. Yet he stood in the United States Congress and said slavery was “a great moral, social, and political blessing.”
