He was asked to come inside and stay until the search was finished. He agreed quickly. When he entered the house, the captain of the group came in too. His job was to watch outside the house and make sure no one left. This captain was Mr. Litch, a rich slave owner I mentioned before. He was known for being very cruel. He didn’t want to get his hands dirty with the search. He just gave orders, and if any writing was found, his followers, who couldn’t read, brought it to him.

My grandmother had a big trunk with bedding and tablecloths. When they opened it, everyone shouted in surprise. One person said, “Where did these damn black people get all these sheets and tablecloths?” My grandmother, feeling brave because our white protector was there, said, “You can be sure we didn’t steal them from your houses.” 

Then a serious-looking man without a coat said, “Look here, mammy, you seem real proud because you have all these things. White folks should have them all.” But before he could say more, a group of voices shouted, “We got it! We got it! This yellow girl has letters!” Everyone rushed to see the supposed letter. When they looked closely, it was just some poems a friend had written for me. I had forgotten about them while packing. When the captain told them what the papers really were, they looked very disappointed.

He asked me who had written the poems.
