The time was almost here, and people were being robbed of their clothes and everything else the thieves wanted to take.

All day long, these cruel people went around like monsters, scaring and hurting those who couldn’t defend themselves. At night, they formed groups and went wherever they wanted among the Black people, doing whatever they wanted. Many women hid in the woods and swamps to stay safe. If any husbands or fathers told about these attacks, they were tied up at the public whipping post and beaten badly for saying bad things about white men. Everyone was scared. No one with any color in their skin dared to be seen talking to each other.

I wasn’t too worried about my family because we lived among white families who would protect us. We were ready when the soldiers arrived. Soon, we heard footsteps and voices coming closer.

The door was suddenly pushed open, and the soldiers rushed in like hungry wolves. They grabbed everything they could. Every box, trunk, closet, and corner was checked carefully.

They quickly grabbed a box in a drawer that had some silver coins inside. When I tried to take it from them, one soldier angrily said, “Why are you following us around? Do you think white people come here to steal?” I replied, “You are here to search, but you have already searched that box, so I will take it, please.” Then I saw a white gentleman who was friendly to us, and I called to him for help.
