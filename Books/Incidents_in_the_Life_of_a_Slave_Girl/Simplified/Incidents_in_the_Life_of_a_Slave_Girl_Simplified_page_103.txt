Not long before this, Nat Turner’s rebellion happened, and the news made our town very scared and upset. It was weird because they always said their slaves were “happy and content.”

But that’s how it was.

Every year, there was a big event called a muster. On that day, every white man carried his gun. The important white men wore military uniforms. The poor white people stood in line wearing regular clothes, some without shoes or hats. This big event had already happened once; when the slaves heard there would be another one, they were surprised and happy. They thought it was going to be a holiday.

I found out the real reason for the muster and told a few people I trusted. I wanted to tell all the slaves, but I was too scared. Not everyone could be trusted. The whip was a powerful tool of control.

At sunrise, people came from all over, some from as far as twenty miles away. I knew the plan was to search houses, and I thought it would be done by rough country men and poor white people.

I knew those men hated seeing Black people living well and with respect, so I made special plans to protect them.
