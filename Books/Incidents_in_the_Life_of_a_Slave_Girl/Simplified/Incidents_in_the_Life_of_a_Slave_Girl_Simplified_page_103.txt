 FEAR OF INSURRECTION .
 
 Not far from this time Nat Turner's insurrection broke out; and the news threw our town into great commotion . Strange that they should be alarmed , when their slaves were so “ contented and happy ” !
 
 But so it was.
 
 It was always the custom to have a muster every year. On that occasion every white man shouldered his musket . The citizens and the so-called country gentlemen wore military uniforms . The poor whites took their places in the ranks in every-day dress, some without shoes, some without hats. This grand occa sion had already passed ; and when the slaves were told there was to be another muster , they were sur prised and rejoiced. Poor creatures ! They thought I it was going to be a holiday . was informed of the I true state of affairs, and imparted it to the few could I trust . Most gladly would have proclaimed it to every slave ; but I dared not. All could not be relied on. Mighty is the power of the torturing lash.
 
 By sunrise , people were pouring in from every quar I ter within twenty miles of the town . knew the I houses were to be searched ; and expected it would I be done by country bullies and the poor whites .
 
 knew nothing annoyed them so much as to see colored I people living in comfort and respectability ; so made I arrangements for them with especial care. arranged 9 98 Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.
