The Fugitive Slave Law.

My brother was upset because his plan didn’t work, so he decided to go to California. It was agreed that Benjamin would go with him.

Ellen liked her school a lot and was very popular there. No one knew her past, and she didn’t tell anyone because she didn’t want people to feel sorry for her.

But when people found out by accident that her mother was a runaway slave, they did everything they could to help her and lower her costs.

I was alone again. I needed to earn money, and I wanted to work where people knew me.

When I came back from Rochester, I visited Mr. Bruce’s house to see Mary, the sweet little baby who had melted my heart when I had lost faith in everyone.

Mary was growing into a tall girl now, but I always loved her.

Mr. Bruce had gotten married again, and they wanted me to be the nurse for the new baby.

I hesitated only because I felt unsafe in New York after the Fugitive Slave Law was passed. But I decided to give it a try. I was lucky with my new employer.

The new Mrs. Bruce was a native American who grew up in a fancy, rich environment and still lived there. If she had any bias against people of color, she never showed it.
