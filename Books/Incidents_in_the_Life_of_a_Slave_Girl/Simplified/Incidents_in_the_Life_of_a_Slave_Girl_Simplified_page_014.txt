There are reasons that explain this. First, she was naturally quick at learning. Second, the woman she lived with until she was twelve was kind and caring, and she taught her to read and spell. Third, after she moved North, she met smart people who cared about her and gave her chances to improve herself.

I know some people will say it’s wrong to share her story. Her experiences are about a topic many find uncomfortable or even shameful. Usually, this part of slavery is kept secret. But people need to know about these terrible truths, so I choose to tell them clearly. I do this for the sake of my sisters still in slavery, who suffer such awful wrongs that many don’t want to hear about. 

I hope this will make thoughtful women in the North realize their duty to help fight slavery whenever they can. I also hope every man who reads this will promise God that, as far as they can, they will never send someone trying to escape slavery back to that horrible place of pain and cruelty.
