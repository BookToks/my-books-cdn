The New Master and Mistress.

This was a shocking idea for a slave to say; it was bold of him and risky for the masters.

The next day, I went with his body to a simple grave next to my dear mother’s. Some people knew my father’s value and respected him. My home felt lonelier than ever. The laughter of the little slave children sounded harsh and mean. It was selfish to feel bad about others being happy.

My brother moved around with a very serious face.

I tried to cheer him up by saying, “Be brave, Willie; better days will come.” “You don’t understand, Linda,” he said. “We will have to stay here all our lives; we will never be free!” I said we were getting older and stronger, and maybe soon we could hire our own time and earn money to buy our freedom. William said that was easier said than done, and he didn’t even want to buy his freedom.

We argued about this every day.

The slaves didn’t get much attention at mealtime in Dr. Flint’s house.

If they could grab a bit of food while it was going around, that was good. I didn’t worry about food because I often passed my grandmother’s house, where there was always something extra for me. I was often warned I would be punished if I stopped there; to avoid keeping me too long, my grandmother often stood at the gate with something for my breakfast or dinner. I owed her for all my comforts, both in spirit and in life.
