Mrs. Bruce didn’t know I was running away. I told her I had important business in Boston, where my brother was, and asked if I could bring a friend to take my place as nurse for two weeks. I started my trip right away. As soon as I got there, I wrote to my grandmother that if Benny came, he should be sent to Boston. I knew she was just waiting for a chance to send him north, and luckily, she had the legal power to do it without asking anyone’s permission. She was free, and when my children were bought, Mr. Sands preferred to have the bill of sale in her name.

People guessed that she gave the money, but no one knew for sure.

In the South, a man could own many colored children without shame. But if he was known for buying them to set them free, it was seen as dangerous to their “peculiar institution,” and he would become unpopular.

There was a good chance to send Benny on a ship going straight from New York.

He was put on board with a letter from a friend who was asked to take care of him from Boston. One early morning, there was a loud knock on my door, and Benjamin rushed in, out of breath. “O mother!” he said, “Here I am! I ran all the way and came all alone. How do you do?” Reader, can you imagine my happiness? No, you can’t, unless you have been a mother who was a slave. Benjamin talked as fast as he could.

“Mother, why don’t you bring Ellen here? I went over to Brooklyn to see her, and she felt very sad when I left.
