I looked for her and later heard she was doing well. I called an old friend from my hometown who had been working in New York. He came right away.

I told him I wanted to see my daughter and asked him to help me meet her.

I warned him not to tell the family I had just come from the south because they thought I had been in the north for seven years. He said there was a Black woman in Brooklyn from my town and suggested I meet my daughter at her house.

I was happy with this idea, and he agreed to take me to Brooklyn.

We crossed Fulton ferry, went up Myrtle Avenue, and stopped at the house he pointed out. Just as I was about to go in, two girls walked by. My friend showed me them. I looked and recognized the oldest, Sarah, whose mother used to live with my grandmother but had left the south years ago. Surprised and happy, I hugged her and asked about her mother.

“Look at the other girl,” my friend said. I turned and there was my Ellen! I hugged her tight and then stepped back to look at her.

She had changed a lot in the two years since I last saw her. It was clear she hadn’t been taken care of well, even to someone who wasn’t a mother.

My friend said we should go inside, but Ellen said she had been sent on an errand and would be back soon.
