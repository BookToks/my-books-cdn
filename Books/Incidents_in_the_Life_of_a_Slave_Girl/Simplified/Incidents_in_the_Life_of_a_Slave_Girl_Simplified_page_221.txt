Was my child dead, or had they tricked me and sold her?

If the secret stories of many members of Congress were shared, strange details would come out.

I once saw a letter from a member of Congress to a slave who was the mother of six of his children. He asked her to send her children away from the big house before he came back because he expected guests. The woman couldn’t read, so she had to get someone else to read the letter. This man didn’t care about his children being mixed race; he was only worried that his friends might notice they looked like him.

After six months, my grandmother got a letter from Brooklyn. It was from a young lady in the family and said that Ellen had just arrived. The letter included a message from Ellen: “I do just as you told me, and I pray for you every night and morning.” I knew these words were meant for me, and they comforted my heart.

The letter ended by saying, “Ellen is a nice little girl, and we will like to have her with us. My cousin, Mr. Sands, gave her to me to be my little waiting maid. I will send her to school, and I hope one day she will write.”
