He was unhappy. He wrote that he had decided to go to Louisiana and that he would take several slaves with him, and I was supposed to be one of them. My mistress would stay where she was, so I didn’t have to worry about her. He said if I was kind to him, he would be very kind to me. He asked me to think about it and give him an answer the next day.

The next morning, I was sent to bring a pair of scissors to his room. I put them on the table with the letter beside them. He thought that was my answer and didn’t call me back. I went as usual to take my young mistress to and from school. He met me on the street and told me to stop by his office on my way back. When I went in, he showed me the letter and asked why I hadn’t answered.

I said, “I belong to your daughter, and you can send me or take me wherever you want.” He said he was happy I was willing to go and that we would leave early in the fall.

He had many patients in town and probably made up the story just to scare me. But no matter what, I was sure I would never go to Louisiana with him.

Summer passed, and early in the fall, Dr. Flint’s oldest son was sent to Louisiana to check out the place because they were thinking about moving. That news didn’t bother me. I knew I wouldn’t be sent with him. The reason I hadn’t been taken to the plantation yet was because Dr. Flint was jealous. He was jealous of his son and the overseer, and that stopped him from punishing me harshly.
