Dr. Flint gave both of them to a slave trader. The bad man put the money he got in his pocket and felt happy knowing they were far away and couldn’t hear or see anything. When the mother was handed over, she said, “You promised to treat me well.” He answered, “You talk too much; damn you!” She forgot that slaves could get in trouble for saying who the father of their child was.

Other people besides the master also treated slaves badly. I once saw a young slave girl dying after giving birth to a baby who looked almost white. In her pain, she cried out, “Oh Lord, come and take me!” Her owner stood nearby and made fun of her like an evil person. “You’re hurting, are you?” she said. “I’m glad for it. You deserve it, and even worse.” The mother said, “The baby is dead, thank God; and I hope my poor child will soon be in heaven.”

“Heaven?” the owner answered. “There is no such place for someone like you and your child.” The sad mother turned away, crying. Her dying daughter called her softly, and when she leaned over, I heard her say, “Don’t be sad, mother; God knows everything about this, and He will be kind to me.” The girl’s pain got so bad later that her owner couldn’t stay in the room, but when she left, she still had a mean smile on her face. The girl had seven children she called her mother.

The poor black woman only had one child, whose eyes she saw closing in death while she thanked God for taking her away from the worse pain of life.
