Dr. Flint owned a nice house in town, several farms, and about fifty slaves. He also hired some slaves by the year.

Hiring day in the South happens on the evening before January 1st. On that day, slaves have to go to their new masters.

On a farm, they work until the corn and cotton are harvested.

Then, they get two holidays. Some masters give them a good dinner outside under the trees. After that, they work until Christmas. If the slaves do something wrong, they might get four or five holidays, depending on what the master or overseer decides.

Next comes New Year's Eve. The slaves gather their few belongings and wait nervously for the new day to start.

At the right time, the area fills with men, women, and children, all waiting like criminals to hear their fate.

The slaves always know who the kindest or cruelest master is within forty miles.

It’s easy to see that day who takes good care of their slaves, because slaves surround those masters and beg, "Please, master, hire me this year. I will work very hard, master."

If a slave doesn’t want to go with their new master, they get whipped or locked up until they agree to go and promise not to run away during the year.
