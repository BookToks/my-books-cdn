After the fear caused by Nat Turner's rebellion died down, slave owners decided it was a good idea to teach slaves some religion to stop them from hurting their masters. An Episcopal priest offered to hold a special church service on Sundays just for the slaves. He didnâ€™t have many Black members, but those he had were very respectful, which probably influenced his offer. The problem was figuring out where they could worship.

The Methodist and Baptist churches let them come in the afternoon, but their carpets and cushions weren't as nice as those in the Episcopal church.

Finally, it was decided that they would meet at the home of a free Black man who was a church member.

I was invited to go because I could read. Sunday evening came, and trusting the dark, I went out. I rarely went out during the day because I was always scared. I thought I might run into Dr. Flint, who would make me turn back or ask me where I got my bonnet or some other piece of clothing. When Reverend Mr. Pike arrived, about twenty people were there. The reverend knelt to pray, then sat down and asked everyone who could read to open their books. He then gave out parts for them to say together.
