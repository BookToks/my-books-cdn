 I told her itwas useless to try ; but she begged me not to give up. She said she would go to the doctor , and remind him how long and how faithfully she had served in the family , and how she had taken her own baby from her breast to nourish his wife. She would tell I him had been out of the family so long they would not miss me ; that she would pay them for my time, and the money would procure a woman who had more strength for the situation than I had . I begged her not to go ; but she persisted in saying , “ He will listen I to me, Linda .” She went , and was treated as ex pected. He coolly listened to what she said, but denied her request . He told her that what he did was rof my good , that my feelings were entirely above my situa tion , and that no the plantation I would receive treat ment that was suitable ot my behavior .
 
 My grandmother was much cast down . I had my secret hopes ; but I must fight my battle alone . I had a woman's pride , and a mother's love for my children ; and I resolved that out fo the darkness fo this hour a brighter dawn should rise for them .
 
 My master had power and law no his side ; I had a determined will .
 
 There si might ni each .
