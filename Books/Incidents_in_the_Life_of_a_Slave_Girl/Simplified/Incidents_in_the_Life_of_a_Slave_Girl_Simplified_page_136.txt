I told her it was useless to try, but she begged me not to give up. She said she would go to the doctor and remind him how long and how well she had worked for the family, and how she had stopped feeding her own baby to help his wife. She said she would tell him I had been gone from the family so long they wouldn’t miss me. She would pay them for my time, and that money would help get a woman stronger than me for the job.

I begged her not to go, but she kept saying, “He will listen to me, Linda.” She went, but he treated her like I expected. He listened calmly, but said no. He told her he was doing what was best for me, that my feelings didn’t matter, and no matter where I worked on the plantation, I would get treatment that matched how I behaved.

My grandmother was very sad. I still had quiet hope, but I knew I had to fight alone. I had a woman’s pride and a mother’s love for my kids. I decided that from this dark time, a better future would come for them.

My master had power and the law on his side. I had a strong will.

There is power in both.
