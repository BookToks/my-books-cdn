A Visit to England

In the spring, I got some sad news. Mrs. Bruce had died. I would never see her kind face or hear her caring voice again. I had lost a good friend, and little Mary had lost her loving mother. Mr. Bruce wanted the child to visit some of her mother’s family in England, and he wanted me to take care of her. Mary knew me and liked me, so I thought she would be happier with me than with a stranger. I could also make more money this way than by sewing. So, I taught Benny a trade and left Ellen at home with my friend to go to school.

We sailed from New York and reached Liverpool after a nice twelve-day trip. We went straight to London and stayed at the Adelaide Hotel. The food wasn’t as fancy as what I had seen in American hotels, but my situation was much better. For the first time, people treated me based on how I acted, not because of my skin color. It felt like a huge weight was lifted off my chest. Sitting in a nice room with my little charge, I went to bed feeling truly free for the first time.
