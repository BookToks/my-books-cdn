 A VISIT TO ENGLAND .
 
 In the spring , sad news came to me. Mrs. Bruce , I was dead. Never again, in this world should see her gentle face, or hear her sympathizing voice. I had lost an excellent friend , and little Mary had lost a tender mother . Mr. Bruce wished the child to visit some of her mother's relatives in England , and he was desirous that I should take charge of her. The little motherless one was accustomed to me, and attached to me, and I thought she would be happier in my care I than in that of a stranger . could also earn more in this way than I could by my needle . So I put Benny to a trade ,and left Ellen to remain in the house with my friend and go to school.
 
 We sailed from New York , and arrived in Liverpool after a pleasant voyage of twelve days. We proceeded directly to London , and took lodgings at the Adelaide Hotel . The supper seemed to me less luxurious than those I had seen in American hotels ; but my situation was indescribably more pleasant. For the first time in my life I was in a place where I was treated accord ing to my deportment , without reference to my com plexion . I felt as if a great millstone had been lifted from my breast. Ensconced in a pleasant room , with my dear little charge, I laid my head on my pillow , for the first time, with the delightful consciousness of pure, unadulterated freedom.
