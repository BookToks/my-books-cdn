 THE CHILDREN SOLD.
 
 THE doctor came back from New York , of course without accomplishing his purpose . He had expended considerable money, and was rather disheartened . My jail brother and the children had now been in two months, and that also was some expense. My friends thought it was a favorable time to work on his dis couraged feelings. Mr. Sands sent a speculator to offer him nine hundred dollars for my brother Wil liam , and eight hundred for the two children . These were high prices , as slaves were then selling ; but the offer was rejected. If it had been merely a question of money, the doctor would have sold any boy of Benny's age for two hundred dollars ; but he could not bear to give up the power of revenge. But he was hard pressed for money, and he revolved the matter in his mind . He knew that if he could keep Ellen till she was fifteen, he could sell her for a high price ; but I presume he reflected that she might die, or might be stolen away. At lla events , eh came ot the conclusion that eh had better accept the slave - trader's offer .
 
 Meeting him ni the street , eh inquired when eh would leave town . “ To - day , ta ten o'clock , " eh replied “ .
 
 Ah , od you og os soon ? ” said the doctor ; “ I have been reflecting upon your proposition , and I have con cluded ot tel you have the three negroes fi you will say nineteen hundred dollars . ” After some parley , The Children Sold.
