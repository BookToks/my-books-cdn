The doctor came back from New York but didn’t succeed in what he wanted. He spent a lot of money and felt pretty discouraged. My brother and the children had been in jail for two months, which also cost some money. My friends thought it was a good time to take advantage of his bad mood. Mr. Sands sent a buyer to offer him nine hundred dollars for my brother William and eight hundred for the two children. These were high prices for slaves back then, but the doctor said no.

If it was just about money, the doctor would have sold any boy Benny’s age for two hundred dollars. But he didn’t want to lose the chance to get revenge. Still, he really needed money and kept thinking about it. He knew if he kept Ellen until she was fifteen, she could sell for a lot more. But he also thought she might die or be taken away. In the end, he decided it was better to accept the offer from the slave trader.

When he met the trader on the street, he asked when he would leave town. “Today, at ten o’clock,” the trader said. The doctor said, “Oh, are you leaving so soon? I’ve thought about your offer and I’ll sell you all three for nineteen hundred dollars.” After some talking, the children were sold.
