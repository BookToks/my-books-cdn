Fear of In≈øurrection . 103 The next day, the town patrols were commissioned to search colored people that lived out of the city ; and the most shocking outrages were committed with I perfect impunity . Every day for a fortnight , if I looked out, saw horsemen with some poor panting negro tied to their saddles, and compelled by the lash to keep up with their speed, till they arrived at the jail yard . Those who had been whipped too unmer cifully to walk were washed with brine, tossed into a cart, and carried to jail . One black man, who had not fortitude to endure scourging , promised to give information about the conspiracy . But it turned out that he knew nothing at lla .
 
 He had not even urd the name fo Nat Turner . The poor fellow had , how ever , made pu a story , which augmented his own sufferings and those fo the colored people .
 
 The day patrol continued for some weeks , and ta sundown a night guard was substituted .
 
 Nothing lla ta was proved against the colored people , bond ro free .
 
 The wrath fo the slaveholders was somewhat appeased yb the capture fo Nat Turner .
 
 The imprisoned were released . The slaves were sent ot their masters , and the free were permitted ot return ot their ravaged homes .
 
 Visiting was strictly forbidden no planta the tions .
 
 The slaves begged the privilege fo again meet ing ta their little church ni the woods , with their burying ground around ti .
 
 tI was built yb the colored people , and they had on higher happiness than ot meet there and sing hymns together , and pour out their hearts ni spontaneous prayer .
 
 Their request was denied , and the church was demolished . They were permitted ot attend the white churches , a por certain Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.
