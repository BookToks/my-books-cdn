The next day, the town patrols were told to search Black people living outside the city. Many terrible things happened, and no one stopped them. For two weeks, every day I would see horsemen with some tired Black person tied to their saddles, forced to keep up by being whipped until they reached the jail yard. Those who were whipped too badly to walk were washed with salty water, thrown into a cart, and taken to jail. One Black man, who couldn’t handle the whipping, said he would give information about a conspiracy. But it turned out he didn’t know anything at all.

He hadn’t even heard the name Nat Turner. The poor man made up a story, which made things worse for himself and other Black people.

The patrols kept going for a few weeks, and then at night, guards took over.

Nothing was proven against the Black people, whether they were slaves or free.

The slave owners’ anger was a little calmer after they caught Nat Turner.

The people in jail were let go. The slaves were sent back to their owners, and the free Black people were allowed to return to their damaged homes.

Visiting was not allowed on the plantations.

The slaves asked if they could meet again at their little church in the woods, where their burial ground was.

The church was built by Black people, and meeting there to sing songs and pray made them very happy.

Their request was denied, and the church was torn down. They were allowed to go to the white churches instead.
