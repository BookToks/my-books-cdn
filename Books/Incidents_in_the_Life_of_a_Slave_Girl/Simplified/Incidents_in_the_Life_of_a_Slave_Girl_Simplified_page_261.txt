Going up and down the stairs a lot made my arms and legs swell so much that it hurt, and I couldn’t do my work anymore. Many ladies might have fired me without care, but Mrs. Bruce helped me by finding ways to save my steps and hired a doctor to take care of me. I still hadn’t told her that I was a runaway slave.

She noticed I was often sad and kindly asked why. I talked about being separated from my children and family who meant a lot to me, but I didn’t say how scared and unsafe I always felt inside. I wanted someone to trust, but I had been tricked by white people so many times that I didn’t trust them anymore.

When they said nice things to me, I thought they just wanted something from me.

I came into this family already feeling suspicious because of my past in slavery, but after six months, Mrs. Bruce’s kind way and the smiles of her sweet baby started to warm my cold heart.

My small world grew bigger because of her smart talks and the chance to read whenever I wasn’t working.

Slowly, I felt stronger and happier.

Still, the old fear, especially about my children, often made me feel sad again. Mrs. Bruce offered me a home for Ellen, which would have been nice, but I didn’t accept because I was scared of upsetting the Hobbs family. They knew about my risky situation and had control over me. I felt it was important to stay on their good side until, by working hard and saving money, I could make a home for my children.
