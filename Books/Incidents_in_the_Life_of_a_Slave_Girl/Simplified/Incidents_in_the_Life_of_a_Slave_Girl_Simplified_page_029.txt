The New Master and Mistress.

The cook was told to make some Indian mush for a dog. The dog wouldn’t eat it, and when his head was held over the mush, foam came out of his mouth into the bowl.

He died a few minutes later. When Dr. Flint came in, he said the mush wasn’t cooked right, which is why the dog wouldn’t eat it. He called the cook and made her eat the mush. He thought her stomach was stronger than the dog’s, but she got sick afterward, showing he was wrong.

This poor woman went through a lot of cruel treatment from her master and mistress. Sometimes she was locked up away from her baby for a whole day and night.

After I had been with the family for a few weeks, one of the plantation slaves was brought to town by his master’s order. It was almost night when he arrived, and Dr. Flint told them to take him to the workhouse and tie him up so his feet barely touched the ground.

He had to stay like that until the doctor finished his tea. I will never forget that night. I had never heard so many hits on one person before. His sad cries and “Oh, please don’t, massa,” stayed in my mind for months.

People guessed why he was punished so badly. Some said the master thought he stole corn. Others said the slave had argued with his wife in front of the overseer and accused his master of being the father of her child.

Both were black, but the child was very light-skinned.

The next morning, I went into the workhouse and saw the whip still wet with blood and the floor covered in it.

The poor man lived and kept arguing with his wife.
