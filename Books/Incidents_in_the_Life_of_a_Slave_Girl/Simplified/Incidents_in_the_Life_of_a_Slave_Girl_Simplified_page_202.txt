When you get her freedom, you'll have a happy family. I guess, Martha, you don’t mind if I read you the letter Linda wrote to you.” He opened the letter, and I heard him read it. That old villain! He hid the real letter Linda wrote to her grandmother and made his own fake one instead. It said something like this: “Dear Grandmother, I wanted to write to you for a long time, but I felt ashamed because I ran away and left you and my kids behind. If you knew how much I’ve suffered since I escaped, you would feel sorry for me and forgive me. I bought my freedom for a high price. If there’s any way I can come back to the south without being a slave, I would gladly do it. If not, please send my children north. I can’t live without them anymore. Let me know soon, and I will meet them in New York or Philadelphia, wherever my uncle finds best. Please write back quickly to your unhappy daughter, LINDA.”

“It’s just what I thought it would be,” said the old hypocrite, standing up. “You see, the foolish girl regrets running away and wants to come back. We have to help her, Martha. Talk to Phillip about it. If he goes for her, she will trust him and return. I want an answer tomorrow. Good morning, Martha.” He stepped out onto the porch and stumbled over something.
