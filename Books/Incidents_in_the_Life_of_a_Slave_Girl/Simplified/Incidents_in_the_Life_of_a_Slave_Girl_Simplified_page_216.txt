Ellen was getting ready for the trip. Oh, how my heart wanted to stop her from going, so young, alone, and surrounded by strangers!

Without a mother’s love to protect her from life’s troubles; almost without any memory of her mother! I wasn’t sure if she and Benny would feel the natural love kids usually have for a parent. I thought I might never see my daughter again, and I really wanted her to see me before she left so she could remember me.

It seemed cruel to have her taken from my dungeon.

It was sad enough for her young heart to know her mother was a slave, without also having to see the terrible place where I was kept. I asked if I could spend the last night in one of the open rooms with my little girl. They thought I was crazy to trust such a young child with my dangerous secret.

I told them I had watched her closely and was sure she wouldn’t betray me; that I was determined to have this meeting, and if they didn’t help, I would find a way myself. They warned me it was risky, but when they saw I wouldn’t change my mind, they agreed. I slipped through the trapdoor into the storeroom, and my uncle watched the gate while I went into the piazza and upstairs to the room I used to live in. It had been over five years since I last saw it, and so many memories came rushing back! That was where I hid when my mistress kicked me out; where my old enemy came to mock, insult, and curse me; and where my children were first held in my arms.
