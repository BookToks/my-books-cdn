The trader agreed to his terms. He wanted the bill of sale written and signed right away because he had a lot to do in the short time he stayed in town. The doctor went to the jail and told William he would take him back to work if he promised to behave. But William said he would rather be sold. “And you will be sold, you ungrateful rascal!” the doctor said. In less than an hour, the money was paid, the papers were signed, sealed, and handed over, and my brother and the children were now with the trader.

It all happened quickly, and after it was done, the doctor became careful again.

I went back to the trader and said, “Sir, I want to give you a thousand dollars so you won’t sell any of these slaves in this state.” “You’re too late,” the trader said. “Our deal is done.” He had already sold them to Mr. Sands but didn’t say that. The doctor made him put iron chains on Bill and told him to take the group out of town through the back streets.

The trader was secretly told to follow the doctor’s wishes. My kind old aunt went to the jail to say goodbye to the children, thinking they belonged to the trader now and she would never see them again. While holding Benny in her lap, he said, “Aunt Nancy, I want to show you something.” He took her to the door and showed her a long line of marks. He said, “Uncle Will taught me to count. I made a mark for every day I’ve been here, and it’s sixty days. That’s a long time, and the trader is going to take me and Ellen away.”

“He’s a bad man.”
