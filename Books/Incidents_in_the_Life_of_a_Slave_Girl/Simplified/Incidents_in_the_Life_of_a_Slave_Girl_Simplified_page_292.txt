She really hated slavery. No matter what people from the South said, she could see how terrible it was.

She was a person with strong values and a kind heart. To me, from that moment until now, she has been a true and caring friend. I wish good things for her and her family!

Around the time I joined the Bruce family again, something really bad happened to Black people. A slave named Hamlin, the first runaway caught under the new law, was tracked down by bloodhounds and caught.

This started a scary time for Black people.

The big city quickly got very excited, ignoring the real pain of poor people. While rich folks enjoyed Jenny Lind singing at Metropolitan Hall, the cries of scared Black people were rising up in prayer at Zion's church. Many families who had lived in the city for years had to run away.

Many hard-working washerwomen, who had saved enough for a nice home, had to sell their things quickly, say goodbye to friends, and try to start over in Canada.

Many wives found out secrets they never knew â€” their husbands were runaways and had to leave to stay safe. Even worse, many husbands learned their wives had escaped slavery years ago, and because "the child follows the condition of the mother," their children could be taken and sold into slavery. Everywhere in those simple homes, people were scared and confused.
