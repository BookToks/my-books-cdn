Something happened that made people suspect I was nearby. They searched the house I was in. I heard their footsteps and voices. At night, when everyone was asleep, Betty came to let me out of the place I was kept. The fear I felt, sitting still all the time, and the wet ground made me sick for a few days. Soon after, my uncle was taken to prison, but the movements of my family and friends were watched very closely.

We all knew I couldn’t stay where I was much longer. I had already stayed longer than planned, and I knew I was causing my kind helper to worry all the time.

During this time, my friends made many plans to help me escape, but the people watching me were so careful that none of the plans worked.

One morning, I was really surprised to hear someone trying to get into my room.

They tried several keys, but none worked. I guessed it was one of the maids. I thought she must have heard a noise or seen Betty come in. When Betty came at her usual time, I told her what happened. “I know who it was,” she said. “It was Jenny. That girl always gets into trouble.” I thought maybe Jenny had seen or heard something that made her curious.

But Betty said, “No, she didn’t see or hear anything. She just suspects something.

That’s all.

She wants to find out who made my dress.

But she will never know.

That’s for sure. I’ll tell Missis about her.” New Problems.
