The Church and Slavery. 109

"I have nothing left to live for now. God, please make my time short!" She sat down, shaking all over. I saw the constable class leader turn red in the face, trying not to laugh. He held up his handkerchief so the crying people wouldn’t see him smiling. Then, acting serious, he said to the grieving mother, "Sister, pray to the Lord that every part of His plan may help your poor soul!"

The congregation started singing a hymn, singing as if they were as free as the birds around us:  
“Old Satan thought he had a mighty aim;  
He missed my soul and caught my sins.  

Cry Amen, cry Amen, cry Amen to God!”  

He took my sins on his back;  
Went muttering and grumbling down to hell.  

Cry Amen, cry Amen, cry Amen to God!  

Old Satan’s church is here below.  
Up to God’s free church I hope to go.  

Cry Amen, cry Amen, cry Amen to God!”  

These moments were very special for the poor slaves.  

If you heard them at times like this, you might think they were happy.  

But can singing and shouting at that hour keep them strong through the long week of hard work, without pay, always scared of being whipped?  

The Episcopal clergyman, who had always been like a god to the slave owners since I was young, decided that because he had a big family, he needed to move where there was more money.
