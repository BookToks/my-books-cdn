I ran quickly to the grave feeling hopeful again. Saying that prayer by the graves made me believe in God even more.

My plan was to hide at a friend’s house and stay there for a few weeks until the search was over. I hoped the doctor would get tired of looking for us. Maybe he would want to sell us because he didn’t want to lose his money or find my kids missing. I knew someone would buy us. I did everything I could to make my children comfortable, even though I thought we might be separated.

I was packing my things when my grandmother came into the room and asked what I was doing. “I’m putting my things in order,” I said. I tried to look and sound happy, but she saw that something was wrong.

She pulled me close and told me to sit down. She looked at me seriously and asked, “Linda, do you want to hurt your old grandmother? Do you mean to leave your little, helpless children?”

“I’m old now,” she said, “and I can’t take care of your babies like I used to for you.”

I told her, “If I leave, maybe their father can help get their freedom.”

“Oh, my child,” she said, “don’t trust him too much. Stay with your children and suffer with them until the end.

No one respects a mother who leaves her children. If you leave, you’ll never be happy. If you go, you’ll make me sad during the little time I have left to live. You might be caught and brought back, and it would be terrible.

Remember poor Benjamin.”
