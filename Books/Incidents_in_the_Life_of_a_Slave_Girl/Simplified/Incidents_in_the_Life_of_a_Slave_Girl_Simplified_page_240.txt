They took him to a storeroom and locked us up together in a hidden place away from the piazza door.

It was a very emotional meeting for both of us. After we talked and cried for a little while, he said, "Mother, I'm glad you’re leaving. I wish I could go with you. I knew you were here, and I was so scared they would catch you!"

I was very surprised and asked him how he found out.

He said, "One day, before Ellen left, I was standing under the roof and heard someone cough near the woodshed. I don’t know why, but I thought it was you. I missed Ellen the night before she left, and grandmother brought her back to the room at night. I thought maybe she had gone to see you before she left because I heard grandmother whisper to her, ‘Now go to sleep and don’t tell anyone.’"

I asked if he ever told his sister about his suspicions. He said no. But after hearing the cough, when he saw Ellen playing with other kids on that side of the house, he always tried to get her to come to the other side, afraid they would hear him cough, too. 

He said he watched carefully for Dr. Flint, and if he saw him talking to a policeman or guard, he always told grandmother. I remembered seeing him look worried when people were near that side of the house, and I had wondered why he acted that way. 

This kind of carefulness might seem unusual for a twelve-year-old boy, but slaves, who live surrounded by secrets, lies, and dangers, learn to be ready to escape very early.
