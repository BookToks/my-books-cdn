She told him she wasn’t always like this; she used to be like him. But when she went through really hard times and had no one to help her, she learned to pray to God, and He made her problems easier to bear. She asked him to do the same.

We stayed too long and had to rush out of the jail. Benjamin had been locked up for three weeks when my grandmother tried to talk to his master to free him. The master wouldn’t change his mind. He said Benjamin needed to be an example for the other slaves. Benjamin would stay in jail until he gave up, or he would be sold for whatever little money they could get. Later, the master softened a bit. The chains were taken off, and we could visit Benjamin again.

His food was really bad, so we brought him warm dinners whenever we could, even though the jailer wasn’t very nice.

Three months went by, but there was no chance he would be let out or sold.

One day, we heard Benjamin singing and laughing.

This was reported to his master, and the overseer was told to chain him again. Now he was locked up with other prisoners, who wore dirty rags.

Benjamin was chained near them and soon got covered in bugs.

He worked on his chains until he managed to get free.

He passed the chains through the window bars with a note asking that they be taken to his master and that someone should tell him Benjamin was covered in bugs.

Because of this bold move, he was given even heavier chains, and we were not allowed to visit him anymore.
