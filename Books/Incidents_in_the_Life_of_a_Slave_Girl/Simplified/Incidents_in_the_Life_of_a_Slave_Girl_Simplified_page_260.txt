My biggest worry right now was to find a job.

My health had gotten a lot better, but my legs still swelled up when I walked too much. The hardest part was that employers wanted a recommendation. Since I was in a special situation, I couldn’t get any certificates from the families I had worked for.

One day, someone I knew told me about a lady who needed a nurse for her baby, so I applied for the job right away.

The lady said she wanted someone who had been a mother and knew how to take care of babies. I told her I had taken care of two babies of my own.

She asked me a lot of questions, but luckily she didn’t ask for a recommendation from my old employers.

She said she was English, which was good for me because I had heard English people were less prejudiced about skin color than Americans.

We agreed to try working together for a week. The trial went well for both of us, so I got hired for a month.

God had been very kind to me by bringing me to this place.

Mrs. Bruce was a kind and gentle lady, and she became a true and caring friend.

Before the month was over, I had found a home.
