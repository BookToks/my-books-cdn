Phillip stayed with his uncle whenever he could, and I wanted to be there too, to watch over my children and keep them safe as much as I could. Also, if I stayed much longer, I might get kicked out of my den because the little roof was falling apart. Phillip and uncle were scared to move the shingles, worried someone might see inside. When storms came at night, they spread mats and bits of carpet, which looked like they were just drying in the morning. But covering the roof during the day might have gotten unwanted attention. Because of this, my clothes and bedding often got soaked, which made the pain and stiffness in my cramped body worse.

I thought of many ways to escape and sometimes told my grandmother about them when she whispered to me at the trap door.

The kind old woman felt deeply sorry for runaway slaves.

She had seen too much cruelty happen to those who were caught.

Her mind always went back to the suffering of her bright and handsome son, Benjamin, who was the youngest and most loved. So, whenever I talked about it, she would sigh, “Oh, don’t think about it, child. You’ll break my heart.” I had good Aunt Nancy to encourage me, but my brother William and my children kept calling me to the north.

Now, I need to go back a few months in my story.

I said that the first of January was the time when slaves were sold or rented out to new masters.

Time was counted by heartbeats for the poor slaves.
