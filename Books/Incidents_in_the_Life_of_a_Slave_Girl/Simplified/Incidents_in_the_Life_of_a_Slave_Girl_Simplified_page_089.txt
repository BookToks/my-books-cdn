My life felt like a desert. After fighting him for so long, I didn’t want him to finally crush me. I was ready to do anything to beat him. What could I do? I thought and thought until I felt hopeless and made a risky choice.

Now, reader, I’m going to tell you about a sad part of my life that I wish I could forget. Thinking about it makes me sad and ashamed. It hurts to share it, but I promised to be honest, no matter the cost. I won’t say I was forced by my master because that’s not true. I also can’t say I didn’t understand. For years, my master tried hard to fill my mind with bad ideas and ruin the good lessons my grandmother and my childhood caretaker taught me. Being a slave had the same effect on me as on other young girls—it made me understand the bad side of the world too early. I knew what I was doing, and I did it on purpose.

But, oh, happy girls who have been protected since you were little, who can choose who you love, and whose families are safe because of the law, please don’t judge me, the poor lonely slave, too harshly! If slavery had ended, I could have married who I wanted, had a home protected by law, and wouldn’t have to tell you this painful story. But all my hopes had been destroyed.
