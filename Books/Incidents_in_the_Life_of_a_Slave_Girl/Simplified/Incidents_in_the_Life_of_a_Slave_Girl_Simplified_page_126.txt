I came in, and he quickly left the house. I suffered because of how I was treated, but I asked my friends to let me die instead of calling a doctor.

I was really scared of him.

My life was saved, and I was happy because of my little kids. If it weren’t for them, I would have been okay with dying, even though I had only lived nineteen years.

It always hurt me that my kids didn’t have a real family name. Their dad wanted to give them his name, but I didn’t want to take it while my master was alive. Also, I knew the name wouldn’t be accepted when they were baptized. At least they deserved Christian names, so we decided to name my boy after our dear Benjamin, who had gone far away.

My grandmother was part of the church and really wanted the kids to be baptized.

I knew Dr. Flint would say no, so I didn’t try to do it. But luck was on my side.

He had to visit a patient out of town and would be gone on Sunday. “Now is the time,” said my grandmother. “We’ll take the children to church and have them baptized.” When I went into the church, I thought about my mother and felt calm inside.

She had brought me to be baptized without any reason to be ashamed. She was married and had the legal rights that slavery allowed.

She took her promises seriously and never broke them. I was glad she wasn’t alive to see how different my life had become.
