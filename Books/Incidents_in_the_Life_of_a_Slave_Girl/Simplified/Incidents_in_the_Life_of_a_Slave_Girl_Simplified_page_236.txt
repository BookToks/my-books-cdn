Plans were made for her to get on the ship the next night.

They both thought I had been far away in the north for a long time, so my name wasn’t mentioned in the deal.

Fanny was taken on board at the right time and hidden in a very small cabin. This place was bought for a price that could pay for a trip to England.

But when someone wants to go to old England, they don’t stop to think if they can really afford it; and when trying to escape from slavery, the scared person is ready to say, “Take all I have, just don’t betray me!” The next morning, I looked through my small window and saw that it was dark and cloudy.

At night, I heard that the wind was blowing the wrong way, so the ship hadn’t left yet. I was very worried about Fanny and Peter, who was taking a huge risk because of me.

The next day, the weather was still bad.

Poor Fanny was almost scared to death when they took her on board, and I could easily imagine how much she was suffering now.

Grandmother often came to my hiding place to say how thankful she was that I didn’t leave.

On the third morning, she knocked for me to come down from the storeroom.

The poor old lady was breaking down from all the trouble. She got upset easily now. I didn’t know she forgot to lock the door behind her like usual.

She was very worried because the ship was still stuck. She was scared everything would be found out, and then Fanny, Peter, and I would be tortured or killed, and Phillip would be completely ruined.
