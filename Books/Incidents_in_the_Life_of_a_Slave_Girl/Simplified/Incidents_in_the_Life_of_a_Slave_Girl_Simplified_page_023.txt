Dr. Flint, a doctor nearby, had married my mistress’s sister, and now I belonged to their little daughter. I wasn’t happy about moving to my new home. What made me even more sad was that my brother William was bought by the same family.

My father, by his nature and because of his work as a skilled mechanic, felt more like a free man than most slaves did. My brother was a strong-willed boy. Growing up around my father, he didn’t like the idea of having a master or mistress. One day, when both his father and his mistress called him at the same time, he didn’t know who to listen to first.

He finally decided to go to his mistress. When my father scolded him, he said, “You both called me, and I didn’t know who I should go to first.” Our father told him, “You are my child, and when I call you, you should come right away, even if you have to go through fire or water.” Poor Willie!

He was about to learn his first lesson in obeying a master.

Our grandmother tried to comfort us with hopeful words, and we believed them because we were young and trusting.

When we arrived at our new home, we faced many challenges.
