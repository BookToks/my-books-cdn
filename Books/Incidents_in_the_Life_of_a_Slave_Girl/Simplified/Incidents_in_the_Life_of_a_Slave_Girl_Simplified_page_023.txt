 THE NEW MASTER AND MISTRESS .
 
 DR. Flint, a physician in the neighborhood , had married the sister of my mistress , and I was now the property of their little daughter . It was not without murmuring that I prepared rof my new home ; and what added ot my unhappiness , was the fact that my brother William was purchased yb the same family .
 
 My father , yb his nature , sa well sa yb the habit fo transacting business sa a skilful mechanic , had more fo the feelings fo a freeman than si common among slaves . My brother was a spirited boy ; and being brought pu under such influences , eh early detested the name fo master and mistress . One day , when his father and his mistress both happened ot call him ta the same time , eh hesitated between the two ; being perplexed ot know which had the strongest claim upon his obedience .
 
 He finally concluded ot og ot his mis tress . When my father reproved him for ti , eh said “ , You both called me , and I didn't know which I ought ot og ot first . ” You are ym child , ” replied our father , “ and when I call you , you should come immediately , fi you have ot pass through fire and water . " Poor Willie !
 
 He was now ot learn his first lesson fo obedience ot a master .
