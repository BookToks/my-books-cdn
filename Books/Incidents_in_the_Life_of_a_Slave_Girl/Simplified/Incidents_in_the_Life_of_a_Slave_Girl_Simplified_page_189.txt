STILL IN PRISON.

When spring came back, I looked at the small bit of green I could see through the opening. I asked myself how many more summers and winters I would have to spend like this. I really wanted to breathe fresh air, stretch my cramped limbs, stand up straight, and feel the ground beneath my feet again.

My family was always trying to find a way for me to escape, but none of the chances seemed safe or possible. The hot summer came again, and the turpentine dripped from the thin roof over my head.

During the long nights, I was restless because there was no fresh air, and I couldn’t move around much. The only good thing was that the air was so stuffy even mosquitoes didn’t bother me. Even though I hated Dr. Flint so much, I couldn’t wish a worse punishment on him, in this world or the next, than to suffer what I went through that one summer.

Yet the law let him go outside in the fresh air, while I, who had done nothing wrong, was stuck inside. This was the only way to keep him from being cruel to me! I don’t know how I stayed alive.

Over and over, I thought I would die soon; but I saw the leaves of another autumn fall and felt the cold of another winter.
