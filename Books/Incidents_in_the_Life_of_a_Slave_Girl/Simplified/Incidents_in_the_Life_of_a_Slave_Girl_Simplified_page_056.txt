He thought that if he could achieve this, it might help with his favorite plan. Soon, he started slipping notes into my hand. I would give them back and say, “I can’t read these, sir.” “Can’t you?” he replied. “Then I’ll have to read them to you.” He always finished by asking, “Do you understand?”

Sometimes he would complain about how hot the tea room was and order his supper to be brought out to a small table on the porch. He would sit there with a satisfied smile and tell me to stand nearby and brush away the flies.

He ate very slowly, stopping between bites.

During these pauses, he would talk about the happiness I was foolishly giving up and warn me about the punishment I would face for not obeying him.

He often bragged about how patient he had been with me and reminded me that his patience had limits. When I managed to avoid letting him talk about me at home, he would order me to come to his office on some errand.

There, I had to stand and listen to the mean things he said about me.

Sometimes I openly showed that I didn’t respect him, and he would get very angry. I wondered why he didn’t hit me. Given the situation, he probably thought it was smarter to hold back.

But things kept getting worse every day.

In desperation, I told him I would ask my grandmother for help.

He threatened to kill me or worse if I told her. Strange as it sounds, I didn’t lose hope. I was naturally a cheerful person, and always... The Jealous Mistress.
