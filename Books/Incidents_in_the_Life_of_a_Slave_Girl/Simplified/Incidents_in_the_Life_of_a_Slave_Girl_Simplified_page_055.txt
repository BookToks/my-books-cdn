The Jealous Mistress.

I would much rather my kids be poor and hungry in Ireland than be spoiled slaves in America.

I’d rather work hard on a cotton plantation until I die than live with a bad master and a jealous lady.

A criminal in prison has a chance to regret what they did and find peace. But a favorite slave doesn’t have that chance.

She isn’t allowed to feel proud of herself.

It’s seen as a crime if she wants to be a good person.

Mrs. Flint knew her husband’s character before she was even born. She could have used this to help and protect the young, innocent slaves. But she didn’t care about them. She always suspected them and wished them harm.

She watched her husband all the time, but he was good at avoiding her.

When he couldn’t speak out loud, he used signs to communicate.

He made up more signs than anyone in a school for deaf and dumb people.

I had to let them go because I didn’t understand what he meant, and I got many curses and threats for my stupidity.

One day he caught me teaching myself to write. He didn’t like it and frowned at me, but I guess he didn’t stop me.
