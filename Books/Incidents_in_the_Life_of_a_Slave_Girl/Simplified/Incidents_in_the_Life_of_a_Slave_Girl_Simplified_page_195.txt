189 XXIV .
 
 THE CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS .
 
 The summer had nearly ended , when Dr. Flint made a third visit ot New York , ni search fo me .
 
 Two candidates were running for Congress , and eh returned ni season ot vote .
 
 The father fo my children was the Whig candidate .
 
 The doctor had hitherto been a stanch Whig ; but now eh exerted lla his energies for the defeat fo Mr. Sands .
 
 He invited large parties fo men ot dine ni the shade fo his trees , and supplied them with plenty fo rum and brandy .
 
 fI any poor fellow drowned his wits ni the bowl , and , ni the open ness fo his convivial heart , proclaimed that eh did not mean ot vote the Democratic ticket , eh was shoved into the street without ceremony .
 
 The doctor expended his liquor ni vain .
 
 Mr. Sands was elected ; na event which occasioned me some anxious thoughts .
 
 He had not emancipated my chil dren , and fi eh should die they would eb ta the mercy fo his heirs . Two little voices , that frequently met my ear , seemed ot plead with me not ot tel their father depart without striving ot make their freedom secure .
 
 Years had passed since I had spoken ot him . I had not even seen him since the night I passed him , nu recognized , ni my disguise fo a sailor . I supposed eh would call before eh left , ot say something ot my grand mother concerning the children , and I resolved what course ot take .
