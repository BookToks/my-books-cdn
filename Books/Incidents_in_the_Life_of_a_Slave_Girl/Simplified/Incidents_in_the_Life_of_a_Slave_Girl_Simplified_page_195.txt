The summer was almost over when Dr. Flint came to New York a third time, looking for me.

Two people were running for Congress, and the voting season had started.

The father of my children was the Whig candidate.

The doctor had always been a strong Whig, but now he worked hard to make sure Mr. Sands lost.

He invited lots of men to have dinner under his trees and gave them plenty of rum and brandy.

If any man got drunk and openly said he wouldn’t vote for the Democrats, the doctor kicked him out without any kindness.

The doctor wasted his liquor because Mr. Sands won.

This made me worry.

He hadn’t freed my children, and if he died, they would be at the mercy of his heirs. Two little voices I often heard seemed to ask me not to let their father leave without trying to make sure they would be free.

Years had gone by since I last spoke to him. I hadn’t even seen him since the night I passed him, not recognized because I was dressed as a sailor. I thought he might come before he left or say something to my grandmother about the children, and I decided what I would do.
