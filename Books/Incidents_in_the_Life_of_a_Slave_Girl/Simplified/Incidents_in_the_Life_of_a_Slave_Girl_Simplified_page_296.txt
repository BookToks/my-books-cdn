“290 dollars,” he answered. “I took care of that. I’d been working all my life for those cursed white people, and I never got paid, just beatings and insults. So I thought this man had a right to money enough to bring him to the Free States. Massa Henry was so mean everyone wished he was dead; and when he did die, I knew the devil would have him, and I didn’t want him to bring his money along either.

So I took some of his bills and put them in the pocket of his old pants. And when he was buried, this man asked for those old pants, and they gave them to me.” With a quiet, laughing voice, he added, “You see, I didn’t steal it; they gave it to me. I tell you, I had a really hard time keeping the greedy man from finding it, but he never got it.” This shows how the idea of right and wrong is messed up by slavery.

When a man has his pay stolen from him year after year, and the law allows it, how can he be expected to care about honesty more than the person who robs him? I have learned a bit, but I admit I agree with poor, uneducated, and badly treated Luke, who thought he had a right to that money because it was part of his unpaid wages.

He went to Canada right away, and I haven’t heard from him since.

All that winter, I lived in worry. When I took the children outside to breathe the air, I watched the faces of everyone I met carefully. I was scared of summer coming, when snakes and slave owners appear. I was actually a slave in New York, under slave laws just like I had been in a Slave State. It was strange and unfair in a place called free!

Spring came back, and I got a warning from the Fugitive Slave Law.
