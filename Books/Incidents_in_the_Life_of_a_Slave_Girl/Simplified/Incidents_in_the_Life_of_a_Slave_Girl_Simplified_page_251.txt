I want to have my children, and I plan to be a good mother. I want to live in a way that makes people respect me, not look down on me. “I respect how you feel,” he said. “Trust God and live by good values, and you will find friends.”

When we got home, I went to my room, happy to be alone for a while. His words stayed with me. They made me remember sad things from my past. While I was thinking, someone knocked on the door. Mrs. Durham came in, smiling kindly, and told me there was an anti-slavery friend downstairs who wanted to see me.

I felt scared to meet strangers, but I went with her. They asked many questions about my life and how I escaped from slavery. But they were careful not to say anything that would hurt my feelings.

This kindness was something only people who have been treated like they don’t matter can really understand.

The anti-slavery friend had come to learn about my plans and offer help if I needed it. Fanny was staying comfortably with a friend of Mr. Durham for now.

The Anti-Slavery Society agreed to pay for Fanny’s expenses in New York.

They also offered to pay for mine, but I said no. My grandmother had given me enough money to pay for the rest of my trip.

They wanted us to stay in Philadelphia for a few days until they could find someone to safely take us on. I happily agreed to stay.
