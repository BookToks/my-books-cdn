PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR .
 
 I READER , be assured this narrative is no fiction.
 
 am aware that some of my adventures may seem in I credible ; but they are, nevertheless, strictly true.
 
 have not exaggerated the wrongs inflicted by Sla very ; on the contrary, my descriptions fall far short I of the facts. have concealed the names of places, I and given persons fictitious names. had no motive I for secrecy on my own account, but deemed it kind and considerate towards others to pursue this course.
 
 I I I wish were more competent to the task have I undertaken. But trust my readers will excuse de I ficiencies in consideration of circumstances. was I born and reared in Slavery ; and remained in a I Slave State twenty -seven years. Since have been at the North , it has been necessary for me to work diligently for my own support, and the education of my children. This has not left me much leisure to make up for the loss of early opportunities to im prove myself ; and it has compelled me to write these I pages at irregular intervals, whenever could snatch an hour from household duties.
