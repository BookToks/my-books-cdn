PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR

Dear reader, please know this story is not made up.

I know some of my adventures might sound unbelievable, but they are all true.

I have not exaggerated the terrible things caused by slavery; in fact, I have left out many details. I have changed the names of places and people. I did this not to hide anything for myself, but to protect others.

I wish I was better at telling this story. But I hope you will forgive me because of my situation. I was born and raised as a slave and lived in a slave state for twenty-seven years. Since moving North, I have had to work hard to support myself and my children. This left me little time to improve my writing, so I wrote these pages whenever I could find a moment between taking care of my family.
