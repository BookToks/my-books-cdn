I answered her calmly and seriously, even though it was really hard for me, “Listen to me, Ellen; I have something to tell you!” I told her about the hard times I had as a slave and how almost everything broke me down. I started to explain how it made me very sad.

But she stopped me when she hugged me and said, “Oh, don’t, mother! Please don’t tell me anymore!”

I said, “But, my child, I want you to know about your father.”

She replied, “I already know about him, mother. I’m nothing like my father, and he’s nothing like me. All my love is for you. I was with him five months in Washington, and he never cared about me.”

She told me that he treated me like he treated Fanny, his little girl. I knew he was my father because Fanny’s nurse told me, but she said I must never tell anyone, so I never did. I used to wish he would hold me and kiss me like he did Fanny, or at least smile at me like he did her. I thought if he was really my dad, he should love me. I was just a little girl then and didn’t understand much.

But now, I don’t think about my father at all. All my love is for you.” She hugged me tighter as she said this, and I thanked God that telling her something I was so scared of hadn’t made her love me any less.

I didn’t know she already knew that part of my past. If I had known, I would have talked to her about it a long time ago because I often wanted to share my feelings with someone I could trust.

But I loved her even more for being so gentle and caring toward her unlucky mother.
