For 155 months, I was supposed to go to them, but I kept facing dangers. I wanted to free them, but I didn’t want to be the reason they died. That thought was really painful. My kind helper tried to calm me down by saying my aunt would take good care of the kids while they stayed in jail.

But it hurt me more to think that my good old aunt, who was always so nice to her sister’s orphan kids, was locked up in prison for no other reason than loving them. I guess my friends were scared I might do something crazy because they knew my life was tied to my children.

I got a note from my brother William. It was hard to read, and it said: “Wherever you are, dear sister, please don’t come here, Lila. You are much better off than you are now. If you come, you will ruin us all. They would force you to say where you’ve been, or they would kill you. Listen to your friends; if not for me and your kids, then do it for those you would hurt.” Poor William! He had to suffer just for being my brother. I listened to him and stayed quiet. My aunt was let out of jail after a month because Mrs. Flint couldn’t keep her any longer.

She was tired of taking care of her own house.

It was just too exhausting to cook her dinner and eat it too.

My children stayed in jail, and William did everything he could to keep them comfortable. Betty went to see them sometimes and brought me news.

She wasn’t allowed inside the jail, but William would hold them up to the grated window while she talked to them.

When she told me what they said and how they talked, it helped a little.
