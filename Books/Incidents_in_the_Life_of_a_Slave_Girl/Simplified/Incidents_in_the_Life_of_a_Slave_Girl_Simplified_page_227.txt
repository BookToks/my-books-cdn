What happened to her made me really sad. Finally, when Uncle Phillip came into the house, I heard someone ask, "How is she?" and he said, "She is dead." My little room felt like it was spinning, and I didn’t know anything else until I opened my eyes and saw Uncle Phillip leaning over me. I didn’t need to ask any questions.

He whispered, "Linda, she died happy." I couldn’t cry. My stare worried him. "Don’t look like that," he said. "Don’t make my poor mother more upset. Remember how much she’s already going through, and that we should do everything we can to comfort her." Oh yes, that wonderful old grandmother, who at seventy-three years old had gone through all the hard times of a slave mother’s life.

She really needed comfort!

Mrs. Flint had made her poor foster sister lose her child, without feeling sorry. She selfishly ruined her health after years of hard, unpaid work and no rest. But now Mrs. Flint got all emotional. I think she wanted to show how close slave owners and slaves were, by having the old tired servant buried near her.

She called the clergyman and asked if he had any problem with burying Aunt Nancy in the doctor’s family burial place.

No Black person had ever been allowed to be buried in the white people’s graveyard, and the minister knew that all the people who died from our family were buried in the old slave graveyard.

So he said, "I don’t have a problem with doing what you want, but maybe Aunt Nancy’s mother might have an opinion about where her body should be buried."
