When I first arrived in Philadelphia, Bishop Paine told me to write about my life, but I told him I wasn’t able to do that. Even though I have learned more since then, I still feel the same way. But I hope people will understand my reasons for trying, even if it seems bold.

I didn’t write about my experiences to get attention. Actually, I would have preferred to keep my story private. I also don’t want people to feel sorry for me.

What I really want is to wake up the women in the North so they understand what life is like for two million women in the South. These women are still slaves, suffering like I did, and many are suffering even worse.

I want to add my story to others to help people in the free states see what slavery truly is. You have to experience it to know how terrible and evil it really is. I hope God will bless this imperfect effort to help my suffering people!

LINDA BRENT.
