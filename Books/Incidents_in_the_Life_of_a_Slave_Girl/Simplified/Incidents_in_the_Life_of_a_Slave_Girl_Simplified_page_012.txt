I When first arrived in Philadelphia , Bishop Paine I advised me to publish a sketch of my life, but told him I was altogether incompetent to such an undertaking Though I have improved my mind I somewhat since that time, still remain of the same I opinion ; but trust my motives will excuse what I might otherwise seem presumptuous. have not written my experiences in order to attract attention to myself ; on the contrary, it would have been more pleasant to me to have been silent about my own history . Neither do I care to excite sympathy for my I own sufferings. But do earnestly desire to arouse the women of the North to a realizing sense of the condition of two millions of women at the South, I still in bondage, suffering what suffered, and most I of them far worse. want to add my testimony to that of abler pens to convince the people of the Free States what Slavery really is. Only by experience can any one realize how deep, and dark, and foul is that pit of abominations. May the blessing of God rest on this imperfect effort in behalf of my perse cuted people !
