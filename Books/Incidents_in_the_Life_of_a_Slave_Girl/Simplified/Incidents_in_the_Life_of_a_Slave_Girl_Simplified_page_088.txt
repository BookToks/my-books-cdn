A Dangerous Time in the Slave Girl's Life.

After my boyfriend left, Dr. Flint came up with a new plan. He thought that my fear of my mistress was the biggest problem. In a calm voice, he told me he was going to build a small house for me, far away from town, in a quiet place. I felt scared, but I had to listen as he talked about giving me a home and making me a lady. Until then, I had avoided my terrible fate by being around other people.

My grandmother had already argued with my master about me. She told him exactly what she thought about him, and many people in the neighborhood were talking about it. Mrs. Flintâ€™s jealousy made the gossip even worse.

When my master said he was going to build the house for me and that it would be easy and cheap, I hoped something would stop his plan. But soon, I found out the house was actually being built.

I promised God I would never go inside that house. I would rather work hard all day on the plantation or even go to jail than live a life like that. I was determined not to let the master, who I hated and who ruined my youth, control me like that.
