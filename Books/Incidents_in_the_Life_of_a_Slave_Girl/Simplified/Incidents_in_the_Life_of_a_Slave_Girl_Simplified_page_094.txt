88 Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

She grabbed my mother’s wedding ring and her silver thimble.

“Go away!” she shouted, “and never come to my house again.” Her angry words were so strong that I couldn’t even answer. The only thing I could do was cry bitter tears, tears that only come once in a lifetime. I stood up but then fell back down, sobbing. She didn’t say anything, but tears ran down her wrinkled face, and they hurt me like fire. She had always been so kind to me! So kind! I wanted to kneel at her feet and tell her the whole truth! But she told me to leave and never come back. After a few minutes, I found the strength to obey her. I closed that little gate, the one I used to open happily as a child. This time, it shut with a sound I had never heard before.

Where could I go? I was too scared to go back to my master’s house. I walked without thinking, not caring where I was or what would happen to me. After four or five miles, I got too tired and had to stop. I sat on an old tree stump. The stars were shining above through the branches. Their bright, calm light seemed to make fun of me! Hours passed, and as I sat alone, I felt cold and very sick. I fell to the ground.

My mind was full of terrible thoughts. I prayed to die, but my prayer wasn’t answered. Finally, I forced myself to get up and walk a little farther, to the house of a woman who had been a friend of my mother. When I told her why I was there, she spoke kindly to me, but I still couldn’t feel better.
