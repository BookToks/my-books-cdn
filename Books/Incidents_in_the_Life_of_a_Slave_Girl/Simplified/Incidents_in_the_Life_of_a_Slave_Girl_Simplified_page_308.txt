My children, now that we were free! My family had tried but failed to help me, but God gave me a friend among strangers who gave me the precious, long-awaited gift. Friend! It’s a common word, often used without much thought. Like other good and beautiful things, it can be spoiled by careless use; but when I call Mrs. Bruce my friend, the word is very special.

My grandmother was happy about my freedom; but not long after, a letter came with a black seal. She had gone “where the wicked stop bothering people, and the tired find rest.”

Time went by, and I got a paper from the south with an obituary for my uncle Phillip.

It was the only time I ever saw such an honor given to a Black person.

It was written by one of his friends and said: “Now that death has brought him down, they call him a good man and a useful citizen; but what do praises mean for a Black man when he can no longer see the world? He doesn’t need human praise to rest in God’s kingdom.” So they even called a Black man a citizen! Strange words to hear in that place!

Reader, my story ends with freedom; not in the usual way, with marriage. My children and I are now free!

We are as free from slaveholders’ power as white people in the north; and even though that, in my opinion, isn’t saying a lot, it is a big improvement for me. The dream of my life is not yet complete. I do not live with my children in a home of my own. I still wish for a home that belongs to me, no matter how simple. I want that, my “Free at Last.”
