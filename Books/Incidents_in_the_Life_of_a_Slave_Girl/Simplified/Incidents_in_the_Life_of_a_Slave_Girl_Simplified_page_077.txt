There was a rich farmer nearby named Mr. Litch. He wasn’t educated and had rude manners, but he owned six hundred slaves. He didn’t even know many of them by sight.

His big farm was run by well-paid managers. On his land, there was a jail and a place for whipping. Whatever bad things happened there were ignored. Because he was so rich, no one ever punished him for his crimes, not even for murder.

He used different punishments. One favorite was tying a rope around a man’s body and hanging him off the ground. He would also start a fire under the man, and hang a piece of pork above it. As the pork cooked, hot drops of fat would fall on the man’s bare skin.

On his own farm, he demanded strict obedience to the rule “Don’t steal.” But if his slaves stole from neighbors, it was okay as long as they didn’t get caught.

If a neighbor accused one of his slaves of stealing, Mr. Litch would scare the neighbor and say his slaves had enough food at home and no reason to steal. But as soon as the neighbor left, the slave accused would be found and whipped.
