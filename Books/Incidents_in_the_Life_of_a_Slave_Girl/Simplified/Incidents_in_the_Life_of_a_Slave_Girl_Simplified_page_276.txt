I've been waiting for you for a long time. I'm afraid Mr. Thorne has written to tell Dr. Flint where you are.

Hurry and come in. Mrs. Hobbs will tell you all about it!

The story was soon told.

While the kids were playing in the grapevine arbor the day before, Mr. Thorne came out with a letter in his hand. He tore it up and scattered the pieces around.

Ellen was sweeping the yard at the time. She was already suspicious of him, so she picked up the pieces and took them to the children. She said, "I wonder who Mr. Thorne has been writing to."

"I don’t know, and I don’t care," said the oldest child. "And I don’t see why it matters to you."

"But it does matter to me," Ellen said. "Because I’m afraid he’s been to the south asking about my mother."

They laughed at her and called her silly, but they kindly put the torn letter back together to read it.

As soon as they finished, one of the kids said, "I swear, Ellen, I think you were right."

The letter said, as nearly as I can remember: "I have seen your slave, Linda, and talked with her. She can be taken easily if you are careful. There are enough people here who can swear she is your property. I am a patriot who loves my country, and I do this as an act of justice for the laws."

He ended the letter by telling the doctor the street and number where I lived.

The kids took the pieces to Mrs. Hobbs, who immediately went to her brother’s place.
