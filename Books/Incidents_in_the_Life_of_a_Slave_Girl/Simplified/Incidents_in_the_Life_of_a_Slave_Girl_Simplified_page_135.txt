I felt powerless, and the thought was terrifying. Even if I knelt before him and begged him to spare me for the sake of my children, I knew he would step on me without mercy, and my weakness would only make him stronger.

Before the week was over, I heard that young Mr. Flint was about to marry a woman just like him. I imagined the terrible place I would have in his house. I had once been sent to the plantation as punishment, and my fear for my son made his father bring me back very quickly. I made up my mind; I was determined to trick my master and save my children, even if it meant dying trying. I kept my plans secret because I knew friends would try to stop me, and I didn’t want to hurt their feelings by refusing their advice.

On the important day, the doctor came and said he hoped I had made a smart choice. “I’m ready to go to the plantation,” I said.

“Have you thought about how important your decision is for your children?” he asked.

I told him I had.

“Alright. Go to the plantation, and my curse goes with you,” he said. “Your boy will be forced to work, and soon he will be sold; your girl will be raised just to be sold well. Do what you want!” He left the room, cursing loudly.

I stood frozen, and then my grandmother came and asked, “Linda, child, what did you tell him?”

I answered that I was going to the plantation.

“Must you go?” she asked. “Can’t something be done to stop it?”
