This story is from a man who is now a very respected Black citizen of Boston. His name is L. M. C.

He says, “This story has some parts that seem really unbelievable. Many people who read it might think it is made up to prove a certain point. But no matter what people think, I know it is completely true. I have known the author since we were kids. I am very familiar with the events in her story. I knew how her owner treated her, how her children were put in prison, sold, and later bought back. I also knew about the seven years she spent hiding and how she finally escaped to the North. I live in Boston now and I can say for sure that this story is true.

GEORGE W. LOWTHER.”
