I was scared to meet slaveholders, and I was also a little scared of railroads. I had never been on a train before, and it felt like a big deal to me.

That night, I went to bed with feelings I had never felt before. I truly believed I was a free woman. I stayed awake for a long time, and just as I was falling asleep, the fire bells woke me up. I quickly got up and put on my clothes.

Where I lived, everyone hurried to dress when the fire bells rang. The white people thought a big fire could be a chance for a rebellion, so they wanted to be ready. The black people were told to help put out the fire. Our town had only one fire engine, and black women and children often had to pull it to the river to fill it with water. Mrs. Durham's daughter slept in the same room as me, and since she was still sleeping through all the noise, I thought I should wake her up.

"What’s wrong?" she asked, rubbing her eyes.

"They’re shouting fire in the streets, and the bells are ringing," I said.

"Why?" she asked, still sleepy.

"I’m used to it. We never get a fire without the bells," I explained.

I was surprised that it wasn’t necessary for us to help with the fire engine. I was just a child, still learning how things worked.

By daylight, I heard women selling fresh fish, berries, radishes, and other things. These were all everyday events in Philadelphia.
