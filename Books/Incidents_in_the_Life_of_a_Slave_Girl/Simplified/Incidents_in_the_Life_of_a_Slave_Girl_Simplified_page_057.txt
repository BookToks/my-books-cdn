I hoped that somehow I could get away from his control.

Like many other poor, simple slaves before me, I believed that some happiness might still come into my dark life.

I was sixteen years old, and every day it became clearer that Mrs. Flint could not stand having me around. She often argued angrily with her husband. He never punished me himself and wouldn’t let anyone else punish me either. But Mrs. Flint was never happy with that. When she was mad, she said terrible things to me. Even though she hated me so much, I felt more sorry for her than he did. It was his job to make her happy, but he didn’t. I never hurt her or wanted to, and just one kind word from her would have made me want to help her.

After many fights between the doctor and his wife, he said he would take his youngest daughter, who was four years old, to sleep in his apartment. A servant had to sleep in the same room to watch the child if she woke up.

I was chosen for this job and told why. During the daytime, I tried to stay where people could see me as much as possible to avoid my master. Sometimes, he even held a razor to my throat to make me stop doing this.

At night, I slept next to my great aunt because I felt safe there. He was careful not to come into her room.

She was an old woman and had worked for the family for many years. Also, since he was married and a professional man, he wanted to keep up appearances.
