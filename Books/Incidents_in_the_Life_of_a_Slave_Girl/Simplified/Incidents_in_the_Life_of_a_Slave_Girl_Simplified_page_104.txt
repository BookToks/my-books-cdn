I cleaned everything in my grandmother's house as neatly as I could. I put white quilts on the beds and decorated some rooms with flowers. When I finished, I sat by the window to watch.

As far as I could see, there were lots of soldiers. Drums and fifes were playing military music. The men were split into groups of sixteen, each led by a captain. Orders were shouted, and the scouts ran everywhere, looking for any Black people.

This was a great chance for poor white people who didn’t own any Black slaves to show off some power. They enjoyed having a little control and pleasing the slave owners. They didn’t realize that the same power that hurt Black people also kept them poor, uneducated, and stuck in bad situations. People who didn’t see this can hardly believe what happened to innocent men, women, and children who were not guilty of anything.

Black people and slaves living far from town didn’t suffer as much.

Sometimes, the searchers would put powder and shot in their clothes. Then they sent other groups to find these and say it was proof they were planning a rebellion. Everywhere, men, women, and children were whipped until blood pooled on the ground. Some got five hundred lashes; others were tied up and hurt with a bucking paddle that made terrible blisters.

The homes of Black people were destroyed unless a powerful white person protected them.
