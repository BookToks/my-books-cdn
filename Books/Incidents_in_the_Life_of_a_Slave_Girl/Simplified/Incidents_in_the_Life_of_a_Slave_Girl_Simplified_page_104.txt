every thing in my grandmother's house as neatly as possible. I put white quilts on the beds, and deco rated some of the rooms with flowers . When all was arranged , I sat down at the window to watch. Far as my eye could reach, it rested on a motley crowd of soldiers . Drums and fifes were discoursing martial music . The men were divided into companies of six teen, each headed bya captain . Orders were given, and the wild scouts rushed in every direction , wherever a colored face was to be found .
 
 It was a grand opportunity for the low whites , who had no negroes of their own to scourge . They exulted in such a chance to exercise a little brief authority , and show their subserviency to the slaveholders ; not reflecting that the power which trampled on the col ored people also kept themselves in poverty , ignorance , and moral degradation . Those who never witnessed such scenes can hardly believe what I know was in flicted at this time on innocent men, women , and chil dren , against whom there was not the slightest ground rof suspicion .
 
 Colored people and slaves who lived ni remote parts fo the town suffered ni na especial manner nI .
 
 some cases the searchers scattered powder and shot among their clothes , and then sent other parties ot find them , and bring them forward sa proof that they were plotting insurrection . Every where men , women , and children were whipped till the blood stood ni puddles at their feet . Some received five hundred lashes ; others were tied hands and feet , and tortured with a bucking paddle , which blisters the skin terribly .
 
 The dwellings fo the colored people , unless they happened ot eb protected yb some influential white person , who Fear of In≈øurrection .
