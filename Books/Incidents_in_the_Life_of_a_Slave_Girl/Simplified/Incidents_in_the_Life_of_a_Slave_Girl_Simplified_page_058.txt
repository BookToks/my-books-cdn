He wanted to get rid of the problem blocking his plan, and he thought he had figured out a way to do it without anyone getting suspicious. He knew how much I loved staying with my old aunt, and he decided to take that away from me. The first night, the doctor had the little child alone in his room. The next morning, I was told to take my place as the nurse that night. Luckily, something good happened to help me.

During the day, Mrs. Flint found out about the new plan, and she got really upset. I was happy to hear her angry.

After some time, my boss called me to her room. The first thing she asked was, "Did you know you were going to sleep in the doctor's room?" I said, "Yes, ma'am." She asked, "Who told you?" I said, "My master." Then she said, "Will you answer all my questions honestly?" I said, "Yes, ma'am."

She said, "Tell me, if you want to be forgiven, are you innocent of what I accused you of?" I said, "I am." She gave me a Bible and said, "Put your hand on your heart, kiss this holy book, and swear before God that you are telling me the truth." I took the oath she asked for, and I did it honestly.

She said, "You have promised on God's holy word that you are innocent. If you lied to me, watch out! Now take this stool, sit down, look me in the face, and tell me everything that happened between your master and you."
