I care about the children much more than I do about myself. But God makes sure I stay with my friend Mrs. Bruce. Love, duty, and thankfulness also keep me close to her. It is an honor to help her because she feels sorry for my suffering people and has given me and my children the amazing gift of freedom.

Remembering the sad years I spent as a slave has been very hard for me. I wish I could forget them. But looking back isnâ€™t all bad; along with those dark memories come kind thoughts of my good old grandmother, like soft, light clouds floating over a dark and stormy sea.
