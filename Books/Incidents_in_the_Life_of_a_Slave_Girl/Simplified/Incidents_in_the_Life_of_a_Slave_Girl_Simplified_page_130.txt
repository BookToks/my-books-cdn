Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

"Don't you move a step, you little troublemaker!" he said.

The child came closer to me and wrapped his arms around me like he wanted to protect me. This made my angry master even more furious. He grabbed the child and threw him across the room. I thought the boy was dead and quickly ran to pick him up.

“Not yet!” the doctor said. “Let him lie there until he wakes up.” 

“Let me go! Let me go!” I screamed. “Or I will make everyone in the house hear me.” I struggled and got free, but he grabbed me again. Someone opened the door, and he let me go. I picked up my unconscious child, and when I looked back, my abuser was gone. I carefully watched the little boy, pale and still. When his brown eyes finally opened, I didn’t know if I should feel happy or worried.

All the doctor’s past cruel actions started again.

He came morning, noon, and night.

No jealous lover ever watched a rival more closely than he watched me and the unknown slave owner he accused me of trying to have an affair with.

When my grandmother was away, he searched every room to find him.

During one visit, he found a young girl he had sold to a trader a few days before.

He said he sold her because she had been too friendly with the overseer.

She had a tough life with him and was glad to be sold.

She had no mother or family. She had been taken away from her family years before.

A few friends promised to keep her safe if the trader allowed her to spend time with them before everything was settled.
