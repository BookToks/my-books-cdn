I was too sick in my mind and body to enjoy my friends like I used to. For some weeks, I couldn’t get out of bed. I didn’t want any doctor except my master, and I didn’t want him called. But finally, worried about how sick I was getting, they called for him. I was very weak and scared, and as soon as he came in the room, I started to scream. They told him I was in really bad shape.

He didn’t want to help me get better, and he left.

When my baby was born, they said he was born too early. He only weighed four pounds, but God helped him live. I heard the doctor say he wouldn’t live until morning.

I had often wished for death, but now I didn’t want to die unless my baby would die too. Many weeks went by before I could leave my bed. I was just a shadow of who I used to be.

For a whole year, I almost never went a day without chills and fever.

My baby was sick too.

His little arms and legs hurt a lot. Dr. Flint kept coming to check on me, and he always reminded me that my child was just another slave of his.

I was too weak to argue with him, so I stayed quiet.

He came less often, but he couldn’t stay still.

He got my brother to work for him, and my brother became the person who passed notes and messages between us.

William was smart and really helpful to the doctor. He had learned how to give medicines, use leeches, cups, and bleed people.

He taught himself how to read and spell.

I was proud of my brother, and the old doctor noticed that. One day, when I hadn’t seen the doctor for weeks, I heard him coming.
