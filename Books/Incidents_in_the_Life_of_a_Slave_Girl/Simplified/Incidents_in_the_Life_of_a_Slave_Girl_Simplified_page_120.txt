Are people who support slavery fake? Some might be, and some might not. But I think if they really cared about poor and helpless people like they should, they wouldn’t be so blind to the truth. When a preacher visits the South for the first time, he usually feels deep down that slavery is wrong. The slave owner knows this and acts in a way to trick him.

He tries to be as nice as possible and doesn’t talk about religion or anything like that. The preacher is asked to say a prayer over a table full of fancy food.

After dinner, he walks around and sees beautiful trees, flowering plants, and the nice small houses where the favored slaves live.

The slave owner invites him to talk to these slaves. He asks if they want to be free, and they say, “Oh no, sir.” That’s enough to convince the preacher. He goes home and writes about the “good side” of slavery and complains that abolitionists (people who want to end slavery) are exaggerating.

He tells people he has been to the South and seen slavery himself; that it’s a kind of “family-like system”; that the slaves don’t want freedom; and that they have church meetings and other religious activities.

But what does he know about the half-starved people working from sunrise to sunset on the plantations? About mothers crying for their children taken by slave traders? About young girls forced into terrible situations? About pools of blood near the whipping posts? About dogs trained to attack people? About men stuck in cotton machines who die? The slave owner didn’t show him any of this, and the slaves wouldn’t have told him even if he asked.
