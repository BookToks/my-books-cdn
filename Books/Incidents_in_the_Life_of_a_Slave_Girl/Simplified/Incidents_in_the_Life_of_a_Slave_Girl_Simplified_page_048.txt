I told him something about it, and I wished old Flint was dead or a better man. When I was in jail, he asked her if she wanted him to ask my master to forgive me and take me home again. She said no; that I didn’t want to go back. He got mad and said we were all alike. I never hated my own master as much as I hate that man. There are many worse slaveholders than my master, but even so, I wouldn’t want to be his slave.

While Benjamin was sick, he had sold almost all his clothes to pay for what he needed. But he kept a little pin I fastened on his chest when we parted. It was the most valuable thing I owned, and I thought no one deserved it more than him.

He still had it. His brother gave him clothes and the money he had. They said goodbye with tears in their eyes. As Benjamin walked away, he said, “Phil, I’m leaving all my family.” And it was true. We never heard from him again.

Uncle Phillip came home, and the first thing he said when he entered the house was, “Mother, Ben is free! I saw him in New York.” She looked at him like she couldn’t believe it. “Mother, don’t you believe it?” he said, putting his hand gently on her shoulder. She raised her hands and said, “God be praised! Let us thank Him.” She dropped to her knees and prayed from her heart. Phillip then sat down and told her every word Benjamin had said. He told her everything, except how sick and pale her dear son was.
