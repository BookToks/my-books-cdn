I had a brother named William who was two years younger than me. He was smart and loving. I also had a special grandmother on my mom’s side. She was an amazing woman in many ways.

Her dad was a planter in South Carolina. When he died, he left his wife and three kids free and with money to go to St. Augustine, where they had family. But it was during the Revolutionary War. They were caught on their way there, taken back, and sold to different owners.

That’s the story my grandmother used to tell me, but I don’t remember all the details.

She was just a little girl when she was captured and sold to the owner of a big hotel. I often heard her talk about how hard her childhood was.

As she grew up, she showed she was very smart and loyal. Her master and mistress realized she was valuable and needed to be taken care of. She became very important in the house, doing many jobs like cooking, nursing babies, and sewing.

People loved her cooking, especially her crackers, which became famous in the neighborhood. Many people wanted to buy them.

Because so many people asked for her crackers, she asked her mistress if she could bake crackers at night after all the housework was done. Her mistress said yes, as long as she could pay for clothes for herself and her kids with the money she made. So, after working hard all day, she started baking crackers at night.
