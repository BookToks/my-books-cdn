I was going to see your children soon, and there was no hope that I would ever even hear from mine. The ship started moving, but we didn’t go fast because the wind was against us. I wouldn’t have minded this if we were far away from the town, but until we were miles from our enemies, we were always worried that the police might come on board.

I also didn’t feel comfortable with the captain and his crew. I didn’t know people like them, and I had heard sailors could be rough and sometimes mean. We were completely under their control, so if they were bad people, our situation would be terrible. Now that the captain was paid to take us, I wondered if he might try to make extra money by giving us back to those who claimed we were their property.

I usually trusted people, but slavery had made me suspicious of everyone. Fanny didn’t feel the same way about the captain or his men. She said she was scared at first, but she had been on the ship for three days while it stayed in the dock, and nobody had hurt her or treated her badly.

The captain soon told us to come on deck for some fresh air. He was friendly and respectful, and because Fanny said he was nice, I felt better and went with him. He sat us in a comfortable spot and sometimes talked with us. He said he was from the South and had lived most of his life in the Slave States. He also said he recently lost a brother who traded slaves. “But,” he said, “it is a sad and shameful business, and I always felt ashamed to admit my brother was involved.”
