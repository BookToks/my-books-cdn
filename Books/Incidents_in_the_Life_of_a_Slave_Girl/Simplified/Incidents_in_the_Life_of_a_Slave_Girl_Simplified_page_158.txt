She was safe. My grandmother shook her head but didn’t answer. “Come, Aunt Martha,” said the kind lady. “Tell me all about it. Maybe I can help you.” The lady’s husband owned many slaves and bought and sold them. She also owned some slaves herself, but she treated them kindly and never let any of them be sold.

She was different from most slave owners’ wives.

My grandmother looked at her carefully.

There was something in the lady’s face that said, “Trust me!” and she did trust her.

She listened carefully to my story and then thought for a while.

At last, she said, “Aunt Martha, I feel sorry for you both. If you think there’s any chance Linda can get to the Free States, I will hide her for a while. But you must promise me that my name will never be mentioned. If people find out, it would ruin me and my family.

No one in my house can know about this except the cook. She is so trustworthy that I would trust my own life with her, and I know she likes Linda. This is a big risk, but I believe no harm will come from it.

Get word to Linda to be ready when it is dark, before the patrols come. I will send the housemaids on errands, and Betty will go meet Linda.” The place where we would meet was agreed on.

My grandmother couldn’t thank the lady enough. Overcome with emotion, she dropped to her knees and cried like a child.

I got a message to leave my friend’s house at a certain hour and go to a place where a friend would be waiting for me. To be safe, no names were mentioned. I had no way to guess what was coming next. Months of danger were ahead.
