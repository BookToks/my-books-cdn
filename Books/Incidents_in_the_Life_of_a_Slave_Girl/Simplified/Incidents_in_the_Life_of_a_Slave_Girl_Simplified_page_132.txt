She got more and more excited as she talked. “I’ll tell you what, Dr. Flint,” she said, “you don’t have many years left, and you better start saying your prayers. You’ll need them all to clean the dirt off your soul.”  

“Do you know who you’re talking to?” he shouted.  

She answered, “Yes, I know exactly who you are.” He left the house very angry.  

I looked at my grandmother. Our eyes met. The anger in her face was gone, but she looked tired and sad—tired of all the fighting. I wondered if it made her love me less, but if it did, she never showed it. She was always kind and ready to understand my problems. There could have been peace and happiness in our simple home if it weren’t for the terrible problem of slavery.  

Winter passed without the doctor bothering us. Then beautiful spring came; when nature becomes lovely again, people’s spirits often lift too. My hopes, which had been low, grew again like the flowers.  

I started dreaming of freedom again, mostly for my children’s sake, not just my own. I made plans and plans.  

But problems kept getting in the way. There seemed to be no way to fix them, but I still hoped.  

Then the tricky doctor came back. I wasn’t home when he visited. A friend asked me to a small party, so I went to make her happy.  

To my shock, a messenger hurried to say Dr. Flint was at my grandmother’s house and insisted on seeing me.  

They didn’t tell him where I was, so he wouldn’t find me.
