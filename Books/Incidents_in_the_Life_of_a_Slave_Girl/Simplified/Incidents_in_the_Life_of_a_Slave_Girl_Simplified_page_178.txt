Peter brought a lot of tobacco to burn this time to keep the mosquitoes away. It worked on them, but it made me feel sick and gave me a bad headache. We went back to the boat at dark. I had been so sick all day that Peter said I should go home that night, even if the devil was out.

They told me they had found a secret place for me to hide at my grandmother's house. I couldn’t understand how they could hide me there because the Flint family knew every corner of that house. They told me to wait and see.

We were rowed ashore and walked bravely through the streets to my grandmother's. I wore my sailor clothes and had blackened my face with charcoal. I passed by people I knew. The father of my children was so close he almost brushed my arm, but he didn’t recognize me.

“You have to enjoy this walk,” said my friend Peter, “because you might not get another one soon.” His voice sounded sad. It was kind of him to hide from me how bad the place I was going to live in would be for a long time.
