Dr. Flint knew I had come back to my old home and was getting ready to catch me.

Later, I found out that some Northern people who helped slave owners told him what I and Mrs. Bruce’s children were wearing. Slave owners use these people for their dirty work and then make fun of them for being greedy and weak.

I told Mrs. Bruce about the danger I was in, and she quickly helped me stay safe. I was her nurse, and no one could replace me right away. This kind lady suggested I take her baby with me. It made me feel better to have the child because it’s hard to leave behind something you love. But not many mothers would agree to let their own baby run away just to help a poor, hunted nurse like me, who the law wanted to catch!

When I talked about how much she was giving up by letting me take her baby, she said, “It’s better for you to have the baby, Linda. If they don’t catch you, they’ll have to bring the child back to me. Then, if there’s a chance to save you, you will be saved.” This lady had a rich relative who was kind in many ways but also supported slavery and thought he was better than others.

He told her she was breaking the law by hiding a runaway slave and asked if she knew the punishment. She said, “I know it’s prison and a thousand-dollar fine.

I’m ashamed of my country for this! I’m ready to face it.”
