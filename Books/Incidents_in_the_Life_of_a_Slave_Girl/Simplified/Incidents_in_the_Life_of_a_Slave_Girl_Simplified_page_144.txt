My parents were buried in the slaves’ graveyard. “There the bad people stop bothering, and the tired find rest. The prisoners rest together; they don’t hear the oppressor’s voice; the servant is free from the master.” I knelt by my parents’ graves and thanked God, like I often did, that they hadn’t lived to see all my struggles or to watch me mourn my mistakes. I had my mother’s blessing when she died, and during many hard times, I thought I heard her voice—sometimes scolding me, sometimes softly comforting my hurt heart. I cried many times, feeling sad that when I’m gone, my children might not remember me as well as I remember my mother.

The graveyard was in the woods, and it was getting dark. Everything was so still, like death itself, except for a few birds chirping. The quiet made me feel very serious and respectful. I had come here for more than nine years, but it never felt so special or sacred as it did now.

A black stump was all that was left of the tree my father had planted by my mother’s grave.

His grave was marked by a small wooden board with his name on it, but the letters were almost worn away.

I knelt down, kissed the graves, and prayed to God for help and strength for the dangerous step I was about to take.

As I walked past the ruins of the old meeting house, where before Nat Turner’s time the slaves had been allowed to gather and worship, I thought I heard my father’s voice telling me not to wait, but to keep moving until I reached freedom.
