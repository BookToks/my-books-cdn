She said, "Oh Ben, I wish I was going too. I thought she'd know a lot, but she doesn't know as much as I do because I can read and she can't. And, mother, I lost all my clothes coming here. 

What can I do to get some more? I guess free boys can get along here in the North as well as white boys."

I didn’t want to tell the happy little boy how wrong he was. I took him to a tailor and got him some new clothes. We spent the rest of the day asking and answering questions, wishing the good old grandmother was with us. Benny kept telling me to write to her right away and to tell her everything about the trip and his journey to Boston.

Dr. Flint came to New York and tried hard to find me and invite me to go back with him. But since he couldn’t find where I was, his kind plans didn’t work out, and the loving family waiting for me were disappointed.

As soon as I knew Benny was safe at home, I left him with my brother William and went back to Mrs. Bruce. I stayed there all winter and spring, trying to do my duties well and feeling happy because of baby Mary, her kind mother, and sometimes seeing my dear daughter.

But when summer came, I started feeling unsafe again. 

I had to take little Mary outside every day for fresh air and exercise, and The Old Enemy was back.
