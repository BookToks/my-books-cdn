I suffered a lot more during the second winter than the first. My arms and legs felt numb because I wasn’t moving, and the cold made them cramp up. My head felt painfully cold; even my face and tongue got stiff, and I couldn’t speak. Of course, it was impossible to get a doctor. My brother William came and did everything he could to help me.

Uncle Phillip also took care of me kindly, and poor grandmother kept checking to see if I was getting better. I woke up when cold water was splashed on my face and found myself leaning against my brother’s arm while he cried.

He later told me he thought I was dying because I had been unconscious for sixteen hours. Then I started acting crazy and was in danger of revealing secrets about myself and my friends.

To stop this, they gave me medicine to make me sleepy. I stayed in bed for six weeks, feeling tired and sad.

The problem was how to get medical help. William finally went to a Thompsonian doctor and said he had all the pains and aches. The doctor gave him herbs, roots, and ointment.

He was told to rub the ointment on me by a fire, but how could we make a fire in my small room? We tried charcoal in a furnace, but there was no way for the smoke to get out, and it almost killed me.

Later, they brought hot coals in an iron pan and put it on bricks. I was so weak, and it had been so long since I had felt the warmth of a fire.
