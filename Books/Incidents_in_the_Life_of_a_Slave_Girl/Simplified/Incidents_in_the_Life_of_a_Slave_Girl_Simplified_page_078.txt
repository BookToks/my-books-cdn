If a slave stole even a little bit of meat or corn and was caught, he was chained up and put in prison. He stayed there until he became very thin from hunger and pain. One time, a flood carried away the owner’s wine cellar and meat house far from the farm. Some slaves followed the flood and took pieces of meat and bottles of wine. Two slaves were caught because a ham and some liquor were found in their huts. Their master called them.

He didn’t say anything but hit them with a club until they fell down. They were put in a rough box like a coffin, but their burial was treated like a dog’s. No one said a word.

There was so much murder on his farm that he was scared to be alone at night. Maybe he believed in ghosts.

His brother wasn’t as rich but was just as cruel. His bloodhounds were well trained.

The dogs lived in a big pen that scared the slaves a lot.

The dogs were let loose to catch any runaway slaves. If they caught one, they bit so hard they tore the slave’s flesh off. When this slave owner died, his screams were so scary that even his friends were shocked.

His last words were, “I am going to hell; bury my money with me.” After he died, his eyes stayed open.

To close his eyes, people put silver dollars on them.

The money was buried with him. Because of this, a rumor spread that his coffin was full of money. Three times his grave was dug up, and his coffin was taken out. The last time, his body was missing, and buzzards were seen pecking nearby.
