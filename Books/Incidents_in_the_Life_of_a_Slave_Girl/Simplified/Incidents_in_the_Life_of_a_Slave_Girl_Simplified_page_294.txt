I’ll tell you a short story about a slave named Luke. I kinda knew him. He belonged to a rich man nearby. When the owner died, he left his money to his son and daughter. The son got Luke as part of his share.

The son started acting badly because of the bad system they lived in. When he went north to finish school, he kept doing bad things. He came back home broken and couldn’t use his legs because of how badly he had lived.

Luke had to take care of his sick master, who was mean and bossy. The master kept a whip next to him and would hit Luke for the smallest reasons. Luke had to kneel and get whipped until he was too tired to stand. Sometimes, he wasn’t even allowed to wear anything but his shirt so he was ready to get hit. Every day, Luke got whipped at least a little bit.

If Luke ever tried to fight back, the town cop was called to punish him. Luke learned that the cop was even scarier than his master. Over time, the master got weaker and his arm stopped working right. Then the cop had to do the whipping all the time. Even though the master depended on Luke to take care of him like a baby, he didn’t feel thankful or kind. Instead, he got even meaner. He was just a broken, cruel man lying in bed.
