I felt more and more restless. I had lived too long with pain in my body and sadness in my heart. I was always scared that somehow, by accident or on purpose, slavery would take my children away from me.

This fear almost made me go crazy, so I decided to head for the North Star no matter what. At this moment, something unexpected happened that gave me a chance to escape.

One evening, my friend Peter came and asked to talk with me.

“Your chance has come, Linda,” he said. “I found a way for you to get to the Free States. You have two weeks to decide.” The news sounded too good to be true, but Peter explained everything. All I had to do was say I wanted to go. I was about to say yes happily when I thought about Benny. I told him the choice was very tempting, but I was really scared of Dr. Flint’s control over my child and didn’t want to leave him behind.

Peter argued with me seriously.

He said a chance like this might never come again; Benny was free and could be sent to me. For my children’s sake, I shouldn’t wait at all. I told him I would talk to my Uncle Phillip.

My uncle was happy about the plan and told me to go by any means.

He promised that if he stayed safe, he would bring or send my son to me as soon as I was safe. I decided to go but thought it was better not to tell my grandmother until it was almost time to leave.

But my uncle thought she would be more hurt if I left suddenly. “I will talk to her,” he said, “and help her understand how important this is.”
