She was sure trouble would come from this. I also told my plan to Aunt Nancy, so she could tell us what was said at Dr. Flint’s house.

I whispered to her through a crack, and she whispered back, “I hope it works. I don’t mind being a slave all my life if I can only see you and the children free.”

I had asked that my letters be put in the New York post office on the 20th of the month.

On the evening of the 24th, my aunt came to say that Dr. Flint and his wife were talking quietly about a letter he had received. When he went to his office, he promised to bring it when he came out to tea. I thought I would hear my letter read the next morning. I told my grandmother that Dr. Flint would come for sure and asked her to have him stand near a certain door and leave it open so I could hear what he said.

The next morning, I stood close to that door and stayed still like a statue. Soon, I heard the gate slam and the familiar footsteps enter the house.

He sat down in the chair waiting for him and said, “Well, Martha, I brought you a letter from Linda. She sent me one too. I know exactly where she is, but I don’t want to go to Boston for her. I’d rather she come back on her own, in a decent way. Her uncle Phillip is the best person to go for her. With him, she would feel free to act. I’m willing to pay his travel costs both ways. She should be told about her friends.

Her children are free; at least, I think they are.”
