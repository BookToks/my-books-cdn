For two years, my daughter and I lived comfortably in Boston. After that time, my brother William offered to send Ellen to a boarding school. It was hard for me to agree because I didn’t have many close friends, and having her with me made our small apartment feel like home. But I decided it was the right thing to do and got ready for her to leave.

During those two years, I often wanted to tell her something about her father, but I never found the courage. I was afraid it might make her love me less. I knew she was curious, but she never asked. She was always careful not to remind me of my troubles.

Now that she was leaving, I worried that if I died before she came back, someone else might tell her the story without understanding the whole situation. If she didn’t know anything, it might hurt her feelings badly.

When we went to bed, she said, “Mom, it’s really hard to leave you alone. I almost don’t want to go, even though I want to get better. But you’ll write to me a lot, won’t you, Mom?” I didn’t hug her or answer right away.
