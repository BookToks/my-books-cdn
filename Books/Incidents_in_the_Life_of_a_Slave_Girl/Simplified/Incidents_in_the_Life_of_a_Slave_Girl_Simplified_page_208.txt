autumn , accompanied by a bride . Still no letters from I I William. felt almost sure should never see him again on southern soil ; but had he no word of comfort to send to his friends at home ? to the poor captive in her dungeon ? My thoughts wandered through the dark past, and over the uncertain future . Alone in my I cell , where no eye but God's could see me, wept bit I ter tears. How earnestly prayed to him to restore me to my children , and enable me to be a useful woman and a good mother !
 
 At last the day arrived for the return of the travellers .
 
 Grandmother had made loving preparations to welcome her absent boy back to the old hearthstone . When the dinner table was laid , William's plate occupied sti old place .
 
 The stage coach went yb empty .
 
 My grand mother waited dinner .
 
 She thought perhaps eh was necessarily detained yb his master . nI my prison I listened anxiously , expecting every moment ot hear my dear brother's voice and step .
 
 nI the course fo the after noon a lad was sent yb Mr. Sands ot tell grandmother that William did not return with him ; that the aboli tionists had decoyed him away .
 
 But eh begged her not ot feel troubled about ti , for eh felt confident she would see William ni a few days .
 
 As soon sa eh had time ot reflect eh would come back , for eh could never expect ot eb os well off ta the north sa eh had been with him .
 
 If you had seen the tears , and heard the sobs , you would have thought the messenger had brought tidings fo death instead fo freedom .
 
 Poor old grandmother felt that she should never see her darling boy again .
 
 And I was selfish . I thought more fo what I had lost , Important Era in my Brother's Life.
