It was autumn, and a bride was with us. Still, no letters came from William. I almost believed I would never see him again in the South. But did he have no kind words to send to his friends at home? To the poor prisoner locked away? My mind drifted through the dark past and the uncertain future. Alone in my cell, where only God could see me, I cried bitter tears. I prayed hard for Him to bring me back to my children and help me be a good mother and a useful woman.

Finally, the day came for the travelers to return.

Grandmother had made loving plans to welcome her absent boy back home. When the dinner table was set, William’s plate was still in its old place.

The stagecoach passed by empty.

My grandmother waited for dinner.

She thought maybe William was held back by his master. In my prison, I listened nervously, hoping every moment to hear my dear brother’s voice and footsteps.

In the afternoon, a boy sent by Mr. Sands came to tell grandmother that William did not come back with him. The abolitionists had tricked him away.

But he asked her not to worry because he believed she would see William in a few days.

He said William would return once he had time to think, because he could never expect to be as well off in the North as he had been with him.

If you had seen the tears and heard the sobs, you would have thought the messenger brought news of death instead of freedom.

Poor old grandmother felt she would never see her dear boy again.

And I was selfish. I thought more about what I had lost.
