I sadly looked away from the beautiful sight. I could see that the little slave's heart would soon be hurt.

I knew her laughter would turn into sadness. The sweet girl grew up to be an even more beautiful woman. From childhood to adulthood, her life was full of happiness and sunshine. Almost every day was bright and happy, especially on her wedding day.

But what about her slave sister, the little friend she played with as a child? She was also very beautiful, but love and happiness were not for her. She had to face pain, shame, and misery, things her race was forced to endure.

Seeing all this, why are the free men and women of the North silent? Why do they hesitate to stand up for what is right? I wish I could do more! But my heart is too full, and my pen feels too weak. There are brave men and women who fight for justice, trying to help those who canâ€™t help themselves.

God bless them!

God give them strength and courage to keep going! God bless everyone everywhere who is working to make the world a better place!
