As we passed Snaky Swamp, he pointed to it and said, “That place was a slave territory that ignored all the laws. I thought about the terrible days I spent there. Even though it wasn’t called Dismal Swamp, it still made me feel really sad when I looked at it.

I will never forget that night. The warm spring air was so refreshing! And how can I explain how I felt when we were sailing on Chesapeake Bay? The sunshine was beautiful! The breeze made me feel so happy! I could enjoy all of that without being scared or held back. I never knew how great fresh air and sunlight were until I had been kept away from them.

Ten days after we left land, we were getting close to Philadelphia.

The captain said we would get there at night, but he thought it was better to wait until morning and go ashore in daylight. That way, it would be easier to avoid suspicion.

I asked, “You know best. But will you stay on board and protect us?” He saw that I was worried and said he was sorry that now, at the end of our trip, I didn’t trust him much. If he had ever been a slave, he would understand how hard it is to trust a white man. He promised we could sleep safely through the night and that he would make sure we weren’t left alone or unprotected.

I can say for sure that this captain, even though he was a Southerner, treated Fanny and me with as much respect as if we had been white ladies traveling with a legal ticket.

My smart friend, Peter, had guessed the character of the man who was in charge of us very well.
