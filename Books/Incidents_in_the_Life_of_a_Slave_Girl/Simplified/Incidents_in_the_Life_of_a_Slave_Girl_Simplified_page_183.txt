The Loophole of Retreat.  

My eyes got used to the dim light, and by holding my book or work in a certain way near the little window, I managed to read and sew. That made my boring life a bit better. But when winter came, the cold came through the thin roof, and I was really cold.  

The winters there are not as long or as cold as in the north, but the houses aren’t built well to keep out the cold. My little room was especially uncomfortable. The kind grandmother brought me blankets and warm drinks.  

Often I had to stay in bed all day to keep warm; even with all my efforts, my shoulders and feet got frostbite. Oh, those long, sad days with nothing to look at or think about except the unhappy past and the unknown future! I was happy when a warm day came so I could wrap up and sit by the little window to watch people passing by.  

People in the South often stop and talk in the streets, and I heard many talks not meant for me. I heard slave hunters planning how to catch some poor runaway slaves. Several times I heard people talking about Dr. Flint, me, and the story of my children, who were maybe playing near the gate. One person said, “I wouldn’t move a finger to catch her, she’s old Flint’s property.” Another said, “I’ll catch any slave for the reward.”  

A man should have what belongs to him, they said, calling Flint a cruel man. People often said I wasn’t in the Free States.  

Almost no one thought I might be nearby.  

If anyone had even guessed I was at my grandmother’s house, it would have been burned down.
