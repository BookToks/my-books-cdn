Anyone who knew him did not recognize him; but a voice called out, "Hey, Ben, my boy! What are you doing here?" At first, he wanted to run, but his legs shook so much he couldn’t move.

He turned to face the person, and there stood his old master’s next-door neighbor! Ben thought it was all over for him now, but it wasn’t. That man was a miracle. He owned many slaves but still cared and listened to his conscience.

“Ben, you look sick," he said. “You look like a ghost. I guess I scared you.”

“Don’t worry, Ben, I’m not going to hurt you. You’ve had a hard time, and you should be proud of yourself.”

“But I think you should leave here quickly. There are some men from our town nearby.” He told Ben the safest way to get to New York and said, “I’ll be happy to tell your mother I saw you. Goodbye, Ben.” Benjamin walked away feeling thankful and surprised that someone in a town he hated could be so kind.

This man was from the North but had married a Southern woman. When he got back, he told Ben’s grandmother that he had seen her son and helped him.

Benjamin made it to New York safely and decided to stay there until he was strong enough to keep going.

It just so happened that my grandmother’s only other son had sailed to the same city on business for his mistress. Through God’s help, The Slave who Dared to Feel like a Man.
