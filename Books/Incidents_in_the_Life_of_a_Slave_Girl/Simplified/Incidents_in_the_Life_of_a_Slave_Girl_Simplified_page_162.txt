Whenever I wanted to see their mom, I would start crying. Old Betty would say, "Lord, child! Why are you crying? These young ones will wear you out. Don’t be so scared! If you are, you’ll never get through life." She was a good, kind person.

She had lived her whole life without having children.

She never had little kids to hug her; she never saw their soft eyes looking at her. No sweet little voices ever called her mother. She never held her own babies close to her heart, feeling that even in hard times, there was something to live for.

So, she couldn’t understand how I felt. Betty’s husband loved children a lot and wondered why God never gave them any.

He felt very sad when he told Betty that Ellen had been taken out of jail and brought to Dr. Flint’s house.

Ellen had the measles not long before they took her from jail, and the sickness had hurt her eyes.

The doctor had taken her home to take care of her.

My children were always scared of the doctor and his wife.

They had never been inside their house.

Poor little Ellen cried all day when they took her back to prison.

Kids just know the truth.

She knew she was loved in jail.

Her screams and crying upset Mrs. Flint.

That night, she told one of the slaves, “Here, Bill, take this brat back to jail. I can’t stand her noise. If she was quiet, I might like to keep her.

She could be a good helper for my daughter some day.

But if she stays here with her pale face, I think I’d either kill her or ruin her. I hope the doctor will…”
