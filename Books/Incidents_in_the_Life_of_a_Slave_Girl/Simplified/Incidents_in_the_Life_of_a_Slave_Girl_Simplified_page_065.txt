59 was a stubborn and unfair man who wouldn’t agree to that plan. I knew he would cause a lot of problems, and I couldn’t expect any help from my mistress.

She would have been happy to get rid of me, but not in that way. She might have felt better if I was sold far away, but if I got married close by, I’d still be under her husband’s control — and husbands had no real power to protect slaves. Also, my mistress, like many others, didn’t think slaves should have family ties. She believed slaves were only made to serve the mistress’s family.

I once heard her yell at a young slave girl who said a black man wanted to marry her. “I’ll skin you alive, my lady,” she said, “if I ever hear you talk about that again. Do you think I’ll let you take care of my children with that nigger’s kids?” The girl had a mixed-race child, but the father never claimed him.

The poor black man who loved her would have been proud to take care of his child.

I had many worried thoughts running through my mind. I didn’t know what to do. More than anything, I wanted to protect my lover from the insults that hurt me so much. I talked to my grandmother about it and told her some of my fears.

But I didn’t dare tell her the worst. She had long suspected something was wrong, and if I confirmed it, I knew it would cause a big fight that would ruin all my hopes.
