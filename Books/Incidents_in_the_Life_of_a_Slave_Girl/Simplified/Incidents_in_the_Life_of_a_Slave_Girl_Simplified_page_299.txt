Free at Last.

Mrs. Bruce and everyone in her family were very kind to me. I was grateful for the good things in my life, but I couldn’t always look happy. I wasn’t hurting anyone; in fact, I was trying to do all the good I could in my small way. Still, I was always scared when I went outside into the fresh air.

This felt really unfair, and I couldn’t believe it was right for any country that called itself civilized.

Sometimes I got news from my dear old grandmother. She couldn’t write, so she asked others to write letters for her.

Here is part of one of her last letters: “Dear Daughter: I don’t expect to see you again on earth, but I pray that God will bring us together in heaven, where this weak body won’t hurt anymore; where there will be no more sadness or goodbyes to my children. God has promised this if we stay faithful until the end.

I’m too old and sick to go to church now, but God is with me here at home.

Thank your brother for being kind.

Give him lots of love and tell him to remember God while he is young, and to try to meet me in heaven.

Give my love to Ellen and Benjamin. Don’t forget about them. Tell him to be a good boy. Try, my child, to teach them about God.”
