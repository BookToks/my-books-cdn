In this situation, I felt sure I should get the chance I wanted.

I also believed they would be set free. With all these thoughts in my mind, and seeing no other way to escape the terrible fate I feared, I made a quick decision. Feel sorry for me, and forgive me, good reader!

You have never known what it’s like to be a slave; to be completely unprotected by law or custom; to have the laws treat you like property, totally under someone else’s control. You have never tried to avoid traps or escape the power of a cruel boss; you have never been scared by the sound of footsteps or shaken when you heard his voice. I know I did wrong. No one feels it more than I do. The painful and embarrassing memory will stay with me until I die. Still, looking back calmly at my life, I think a slave woman should not be judged the same way as others.

Months went by. I had many sad moments.

I quietly felt bad about the pain I was causing my grandmother, who had tried so hard to protect me. I knew I was the biggest comfort in her old age, and she was proud that I had not lowered myself like most slaves. I wanted to tell her I was no longer worthy of her love, but I couldn’t say the scary words.

As for Dr. Flint, I felt a kind of satisfaction and victory at the thought of telling him.

Sometimes he told me about his plans, and I stayed quiet. Finally, he said the cottage was finished and told me to go there. I told him I would never go inside. He said, “I have heard...”
