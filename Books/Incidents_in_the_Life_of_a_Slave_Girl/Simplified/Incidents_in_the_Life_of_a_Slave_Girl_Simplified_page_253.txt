I got up early, got dressed, and sat by the window to watch the busy city life outside.

Philadelphia seemed like a really big and amazing place to me.

At breakfast, I told them I wanted to go help with the engine, but they laughed at the idea, and I laughed along with them.

I went to see Fanny, but she was so happy hanging out with her new friends that she didn’t want to leave. I was also very happy with my kind host.

She had a good education and was much smarter than me. Every day, almost every hour, I learned something new. She took me around the city when she thought it was okay.

One day, she took me to an artist’s studio and showed me pictures of some of her children. I had never seen paintings of Black people before, and I thought they were beautiful.

After five days, one of Mrs. Durham’s friends said she would go with us to New York the next morning. As I held Mrs. Durham’s hand goodbye, I wondered if her husband had told her what I had said to him. I thought he had, but she never talked about it. I guess she was quietly understanding.

When Mr. Durham gave us our tickets, he said, “I’m sorry, but you’ll have an uncomfortable ride; I couldn’t get tickets for the first-class cars.” I thought maybe I hadn’t given him enough money and offered more. “No,” he said, “they don’t sell first-class tickets to Black people, no matter how much money you have.” This was the first time my hope about the Free States was shaken. Black people were allowed to ride the train, but not in first class.
