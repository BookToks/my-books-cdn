He asked me if the father of my child was white or black. I hesitated. "Answer me right now!" he shouted.

I did answer. He jumped on me like a wolf and grabbed my arm hard, like he wanted to break it. "Do you love him?" he hissed.

"I'm glad I don’t hate him," I said.

He raised his hand to hit me, but then stopped.

I don’t know why he didn’t hit me. He sat down, and I kept my lips shut tight. Finally, he spoke. "I came here to offer you a friendly deal," he said, "but your ungratefulness makes me so angry I can’t stand it. You reject all my good intentions. I don’t know why I haven’t killed you." He stood up again, like he wanted to hit me.

But then he sat back down. "I will forgive your rudeness and mistake on one condition.

From now on, you must have no contact at all with the father of your child.

You can’t ask him for anything or take anything from him. I will take care of you and your child.

You better promise this now, before he leaves you. This is the last kindness I will show you." I said I didn’t want my child to be supported by a man who had cursed both the child and me. He said a woman like me shouldn’t expect anything else. He asked one last time if I would accept his kindness. I said no.

"Fine," he said. "Then deal with the consequences of your choices.

Don’t ever ask me for help."
