Learning could help them become capable men and protect their wives and children. If the non-Christian people in our Christian country had as much education as some people in India, they would think differently. They would see that freedom is more important than life. They would start to believe in themselves and try hard to become real men and women.

But as long as the Free States have laws that send runaway slaves back to slavery, how can slaves decide to become strong and free? Some try to protect their wives and daughters from their masters’ abuse, but those people have had better chances than most slaves. They have been somewhat taught and influenced by kindness or religion. Some even dare to say these things to their masters. Oh, if there were more like them!

Some poor slaves have been treated so badly with whipping that they hide to let their masters have their wives and daughters easily. Does this mean black people are naturally worse? What would you be like if you were born and raised as a slave, with generations of slaves before you? I admit black people seem weaker. But why is that?

It’s because white people force them to live in ignorance. It’s the cruel whips that beat the strength out of them. It’s the fierce dogs in the South and the almost as cruel people in the North who catch runaway slaves. They do the dirty work.

Rich Southern men act with the most disrespect...
