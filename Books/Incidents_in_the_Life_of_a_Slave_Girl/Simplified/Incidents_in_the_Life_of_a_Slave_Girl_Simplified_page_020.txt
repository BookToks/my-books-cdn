I was lucky in many ways when I was a kid.  

When I was six years old, my mom died. That’s when I first found out, from people talking, that I was a slave.  

My mom’s mistress was the daughter of my grandma’s mistress. She was like my mom’s foster sister because they were both breastfed by my grandma.  

Actually, my mom stopped breastfeeding when she was three months old so the mistress’s baby could have enough milk. They played together as kids, and when they grew up, my mom worked faithfully for her foster sister.  

Before she died, her mistress promised that her children would never suffer. She kept that promise while she was alive.  

Everyone spoke kindly about my mom, who was a slave in name only—she was noble and womanly. I was sad she was gone and worried about who would take care of me and my little brother. I was told my new home was with her mistress, and I found it to be a happy place.  

I didn’t have any hard or unpleasant chores. My mistress was so kind that I was always happy to do what she asked and proud to work for her as much as I could at my age. I would sit by her side for hours, sewing carefully, feeling as carefree as any free white kid.  

When she thought I was tired, she would send me outside to run and jump. I would happily go to pick berries or flowers to decorate her room.  

Those were the days of my childhood.
