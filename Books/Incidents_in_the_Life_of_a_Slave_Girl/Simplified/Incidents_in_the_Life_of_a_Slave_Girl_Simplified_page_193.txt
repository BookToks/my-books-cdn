There was a mix of rain and sunshine. Before night, Benny was full of energy and threatening to destroy the dog. He was very happy when the doctor told him the next day that the dog had bitten another boy and was shot. Benny got better from his wounds, but it took a long time before he could walk again.

When my grandmother got sick, many women who were her customers came to bring her little gifts and to ask if she had everything she needed.

One night, Aunt Nancy asked if she could stay and watch over her sick mother. Mrs. Flint said, “I don’t think you need to stay. I can’t spare you.” But when she saw other women nearby being so kind, not wanting to be outdone in helping, she also went to stay by the bedside of the woman who had cared for her as a baby, even though she had been treated badly in return.

Mrs. Flint seemed surprised that her mother was so sick and blamed Uncle Phillip for not calling Dr. Flint sooner. She sent for the doctor right away, and he came. If I had known he was so close, I would have been scared.

The doctor said my grandmother was in very bad shape and said he would visit if her main doctor wanted him to. No one wanted him to come to the house all the time because they didn’t want to pay a big bill.

Mrs. Flint went out, and Sally told her that Benny was lame because a dog had bitten him. “I’m glad,” she said. “I wish it had killed him. That would be good news to send to his mother. Her time will come.”
