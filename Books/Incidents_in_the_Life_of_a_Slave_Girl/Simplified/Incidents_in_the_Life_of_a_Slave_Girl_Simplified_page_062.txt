He would act like I was a very hurt person and blame me for being ungrateful.

“Didn’t I take you into my house and treat you like one of my own kids?” he would say.

“Have I ever treated you like a slave? I never let you get punished, not even to please your boss.

And this is how you repay me, you ungrateful girl!” I told him he had his own reasons for protecting me from punishment, but his way of doing it made my boss hate me and treat me badly. If I cried, he would say, “Poor child!

Don’t cry!

Don’t cry! I will make peace for you with your boss.

Just let me handle things my way. Poor girl, foolish! You don’t know what’s good for you. I would take care of you. I would make a lady out of you. Now go and think about all I promised you.”

Reader, I’m painting a picture of southern homes, but I’m telling you the honest truth. When slaves run away from this cruel system, people in the North act like hunting dogs and chase the poor runaway back to a terrible place, full of death and dirt.

Even worse, they don’t just help catch them—they’re proud to marry their daughters off to slave owners.

These girls have dreamy ideas about a warm place with pretty flowers and a happy home all year round.

But what huge letdowns they face!

The young wife soon finds out her husband doesn’t care about his marriage promises at all.

Children of every shade—the jealous mistress.
