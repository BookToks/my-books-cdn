They sing songs without worrying much about the rhythm. They often sing these lines: “Old Satan is a busy old man; He rolls his blocks all in my way; But Jesus is my best friend; He rolls those blocks away.

“If I had died when I was young, Then my stammering tongue would have sung; But I am old, and now I stand A small chance to reach the heavenly land.”

I remember one time when I went to a Methodist class meeting feeling very sad. I sat next to a poor mother who was even more heartbroken than I was.

The leader of the class was the town policeman – a man who sold slaves and punished church members by whipping them at the public whipping post or putting them in jail.

He was willing to do this harsh job anywhere for fifty cents.

This mean man came near us and asked the sad woman, “Sister, can you tell us how the Lord is dealing with your soul? Do you love Him like you used to?” She stood up and said, in a sad voice, “My Lord and Master, help me! My burden is more than I can bear. God has hidden Himself from me, and I am left in misery and darkness.” Then, hitting her chest, she added, “I can’t tell you what is inside me!

They have taken all my children.

Last week they took the last one.

God only knows where they sold her. They tell me she is sixteen years old, and then – Oh! Oh! Pray for her brothers and sisters!”
