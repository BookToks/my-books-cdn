I didn’t know where he was, but during the day I got a note from him. I figured they hadn’t come from the south just for fun in the winter. Now, I understood what they really wanted.

Mrs. Bruce came to me and begged me to leave the city the next morning. She said her house was being watched, and someone might find out about me. I didn’t want to listen to her. She asked me with a gentle kindness that should have made me change my mind, but I was feeling angry and hopeless. I was tired of running around all the time. I had been chased for most of my life, and it felt like it would never stop.

There I was, in that big city, innocent but not even able to go to church. I heard the bells ringing for the afternoon service, and I thought bitterly, “Will the preachers talk about freeing prisoners, or about treating others the way you want to be treated?” People from Poland and Hungary could find safety there. John Mitchell was free to say he wanted a plantation full of slaves. But I, an oppressed American, couldn’t even show my face. God forgive the dark and angry thoughts I had that Sunday. The Bible says, “Oppression makes even a wise man crazy,” and I wasn’t wise.

I had heard that Mr. Dodge said his wife never gave up her rights to my children, and if he couldn’t get me, he would take them. This was what scared me the most.
