The Flight.

Mr. Flint didn’t have enough servants for the house, and instead of getting rid of me, he held back his anger.

I did my work carefully, but I didn’t want to do it. They seemed scared I might leave. Mr. Flint wanted me to sleep inside the big house, not in the servants’ rooms.

His wife agreed, but said I couldn’t bring my bed inside because it would make feathers fall on her carpet. I knew from the start they wouldn’t give me a bed for me and my little child.

So, I brought my own bed, but now I wasn’t allowed to use it. I did what they said. But when I realized they wanted to take my children away to control me better, I decided to run away that night. I knew it would make my dear old grandmother very sad, but nothing less than my children’s freedom would make me ignore her advice.

I did my evening work with shaking steps.

Mr. Flint called twice from his room, asking why the house wasn’t locked yet. I said I hadn’t finished my work. “You’ve had enough time,” he said. “Be careful how you answer me!” I closed all the windows, locked all the doors, and went up to the third floor to wait until midnight.
