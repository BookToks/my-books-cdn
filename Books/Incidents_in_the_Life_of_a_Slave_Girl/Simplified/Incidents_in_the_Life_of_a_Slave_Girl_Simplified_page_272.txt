The fashionable world had thirty or forty nurses from many different countries. Some women had colored maids and coachmen, but I was the only nurse with African blood. When the tea bell rang, I took little Mary and followed the other nurses.

Supper was served in a long hall. A young man, who was in charge, walked around the table a few times and then pointed to a seat at the far end for me. Since there was only one chair there, I sat down and held the child in my lap. Then the young man came over and said very politely, “Please put the little girl in the chair, stand behind her, and feed her. After that, you will be shown to the kitchen for a good supper.”

This was the worst part! I almost lost my self-control when I looked around and saw other nurses, who were only a little lighter in skin than me, looking at me like I was dirty. But I said nothing. I quietly took the child, went to our room, and refused to go back to the table.

Mr. Bruce had meals sent to the room for Mary and me. This worked for a few days, but the white waiters started complaining because they didn’t want to serve black people. The landlord asked Mr. Bruce to make me eat downstairs because his servants refused to bring food to our room. The colored servants for other guests were upset too because not everyone was treated the same.

I said the colored servants should be treated fairly.
