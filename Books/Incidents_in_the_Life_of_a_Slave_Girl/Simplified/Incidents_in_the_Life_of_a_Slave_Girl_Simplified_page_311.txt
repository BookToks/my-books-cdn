No woman can easily tell a close friend about her painful experiences more than she can write them down for everyone to read. Even while talking to me, she cried a lot and seemed to be in so much mental pain that I felt her story was too personal to force out with questions. So, I let her share as much or as little as she wanted. Still, I encouraged her to publish her story because it could help others, and finally, she agreed to do it.

She had been a slave for most of her life and didn’t have much education. She had to work hard to support herself and to get her children educated. Many times, she had to quit her jobs to escape the people who were trying to capture her and take her back. But she kept going and overcame all these problems.

After working all day, she would secretly write down the true story of her difficult life late at night by the lamp.

This state, New York, isn’t a great place for poor people to find safety, but here, through worry, trouble, and sadness, Linda and her children finally became free thanks to the help of a kind friend. She was thankful, but the idea that she had to be bought was painful to her proud spirit. Soon after it happened, she wrote, “Thank you for caring about my freedom, but the freedom I had before being bought was more precious to me. God gave me that freedom, but a man put God’s gift on a scale and valued it at only three hundred dollars. I worked for my freedom as faithfully as Jacob worked for Rachel. In the end, Jacob had many possessions, but I was robbed of my victory; I had to give up my crown to a cruel master.”

Her story, written by herself, will definitely interest readers. It shows how sad the situation is in this country, which says it is civilized but still has laws and customs that make real life experiences seem stranger than any old stories.
