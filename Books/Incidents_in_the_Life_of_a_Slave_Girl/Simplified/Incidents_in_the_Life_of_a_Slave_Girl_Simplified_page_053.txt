I knew she was really strict about these kinds of things. Also, she was a strong and proud woman.

She was usually quiet and calm, but if she got angry, she didn’t calm down easily. I heard she once chased a white man with a loaded gun because he insulted one of her daughters. I was scared of what might happen if she got really mad, so I stayed quiet out of pride and fear.

Even though I didn’t talk to my grandmother much and tried to avoid her watchful eyes, having her nearby gave me some protection. Even though she had been a slave, Dr. Flint was afraid of her. He didn’t want her harsh words or for people to find out about his bad behavior because she was respected by many.

I was lucky not to live on a faraway plantation, but in a town where people knew about each other’s lives.

Even though the laws and rules for slaves were unfair, Dr. Flint, being a professional man, thought it was smart to act like he was decent.

That man caused me so much fear and sadness! I’m not telling you this to make you feel sorry for me, but to help you understand and care about the many other girls who are still slaves and suffering like I did.

One time, I saw two beautiful kids playing together.

One was a fair white child; the other was her slave and also her sister. When I saw them hugging and laughing happily, I felt something inside me.
