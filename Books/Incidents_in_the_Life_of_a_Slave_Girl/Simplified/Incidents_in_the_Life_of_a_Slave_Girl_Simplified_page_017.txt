I was born a slave, but I didn’t know it until I was six years old and had a happy childhood. My dad was a carpenter and was so smart and good at his job that people from far away asked for him to be the lead worker when special buildings were made. 

He was allowed to work and take care of his own business as long as he paid my owner two hundred dollars a year and supported himself. His biggest wish was to buy his children’s freedom, but even though he tried many times with the money he earned, he never succeeded. 

My parents had light brown skin and were called mulattoes. They lived together in a nice home, and even though we were slaves, I was protected so well that I never thought of myself as a slave.
