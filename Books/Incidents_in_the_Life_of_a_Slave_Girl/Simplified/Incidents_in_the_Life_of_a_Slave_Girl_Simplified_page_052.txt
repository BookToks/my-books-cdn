She had to face the truth that she was no longer a child. God had given her beauty, but it would end up being her biggest curse. The things that made white women admired only made the life of a female slave worse.

Some slaves were so used to the cruelty of slavery that they didn’t even feel ashamed of their situation. But many slaves felt it deeply and tried to forget about it. I can’t explain how much I suffered because of these wrongs, and even now, thinking about it still hurts me.

My master was always reminding me that I belonged to him. He promised he would make me obey him no matter what. Even when I went outside for fresh air after working all day, he followed me. When I knelt by my mother’s grave, his dark presence was there too. My heart grew heavy with sadness and fear.

The other slaves in my master’s house noticed I had changed. Many felt sorry for me, but none of them dared to ask why. They already knew what was happening, and they knew that talking about it was dangerous and always punished.

I wished I could tell someone what was wrong. I wanted to lay my head on my grandmother’s chest and share all my problems with her.

But Dr. Flint threatened to kill me if I didn’t stay as quiet as a grave. Even though my grandmother didn’t live with me, I both feared and loved her.

I had always looked up to her with respect and a little fear. I was very young and felt embarrassed to tell her such bad things.
