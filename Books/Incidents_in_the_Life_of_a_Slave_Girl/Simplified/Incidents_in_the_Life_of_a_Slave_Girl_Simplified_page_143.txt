I wanted freedom so much.

Even though it would have been very valuable to me, I would not take it if it meant leaving my family in slavery. Every hard thing I went through and every sacrifice I made was because of them. It made me love them more and gave me new strength to fight against the dark and endless troubles around me.

Almost six weeks had passed when Mr. Flintâ€™s new wife was about to move into their home. Everything was ready, and Mr. Flint said I had done a good job. He planned to leave on Saturday and come back with his wife the next Wednesday.

After following his orders, I finally asked if I could spend Sunday in town.

He said yes, and I was very thankful. It was the first time I ever asked, and I planned for it to be the last. I needed more than one night to do what I wanted, but having all of Sunday gave me a chance.

I spent that Sunday with my grandmother. It was a calm and beautiful day, like it came from heaven.

That day brought so many mixed feelings.

Maybe it was the last day I would ever be under that old, safe roof.

Maybe it was the last time I could talk with my loyal old friend.

Maybe it was the last time my children and I would be together.

But I thought it was better than them being slaves. I knew how terrible slavery would be for my baby, and I promised to save her from it, even if it meant risking my life.

I made this promise at the graves of my poor family.
