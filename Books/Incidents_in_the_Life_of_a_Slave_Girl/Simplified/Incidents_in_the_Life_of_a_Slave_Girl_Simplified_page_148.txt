I felt really stressed when he said “your mistress.” I was treated like a soldier who had done something wrong. When the work was over and the last lock was turned, I looked for my pillow, thankful that God had given a time to rest for those who are tired.

The next day, my new mistress started running the house. I wasn’t exactly made a maid for all the work, but I had to do whatever I was told. Monday evening came, which was always a busy time. That night, the slaves got their weekly food allowance. Every man got three pounds of meat, a peck of corn, and maybe a dozen herring.

Women got one and a half pounds of meat, a peck of corn, and the same number of herring.

Children over twelve years old got half the amount women received.

The meat was cut and weighed by the foreman for the field workers, then piled on planks in front of the meat house. The second foreman stood behind the building, and when the first foreman shouted, “Who takes this piece of meat?” the second foreman called out someone’s name.

This was done to make sure the meat was given out fairly.

The young mistress came out to see how things were done on her plantation, and she quickly showed what kind of person she was.

Among the people waiting for their food was a very old slave who had worked faithfully for the Flint family for three generations.

When he slowly walked up to get his piece of meat, the mistress said he was too old to get any food; she believed that when slaves were too old to work, they should be fed grass instead.

Poor old man!

He suffered a lot before he finally found peace in the grave.
