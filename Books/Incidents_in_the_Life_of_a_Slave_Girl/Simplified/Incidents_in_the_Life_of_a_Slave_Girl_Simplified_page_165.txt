159 fear. I sat very still in my hiding place upstairs, trying to stay calm. I hoped Dr. Flint would get tired and agree to sell my children when he couldn’t find me. I knew who would be ready to buy them. Suddenly, I heard a voice that scared me so much it felt like ice in my veins.

The voice was too familiar and too awful for me not to recognize my old master right away. He was in the house, and I was sure he had come to catch me. I looked around in terror.

There was no way to escape.

The voice got quieter. I thought the policeman was with him, and they were searching the house.

Even though I was scared, I didn’t forget the trouble I was causing my kind helper.

It felt like I was born to bring pain to everyone who helped me, and that was the hardest part of my life.

After a while, I heard footsteps coming closer; someone unlocked my door. I leaned against the wall to keep from falling. I looked up and saw my kind helper standing there alone. I was too overwhelmed to speak and sank down on the floor.

“I thought you would hear your master’s voice,” she said. “And knowing you’d be terrified, I came to tell you there’s nothing to fear.

You can even laugh at the old man’s expense. He is so sure you’re in New York that he came to borrow five hundred dollars to chase after you. My sister had some money to lend without charging interest.

He got the money and plans to leave for New York tonight. So, for now, you are safe.

The doctor will just lose some money chasing after the bird he left behind.” 160 Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.
