The clouds slowly moved away, and the sunshine came out. There was a big oven there that baked bread and tasty treats for the town, and we always knew there was a little special piece saved for us.

But sadly, even the nice oven couldn’t make us feel better about our hard lives. Benjamin was now a tall, handsome young man, strong and graceful, with a brave spirit that wasn’t meant for a slave. My brother William, who was now twelve, still hated the word "master" just like he did when he was seven. He trusted me and shared all his problems with me. I remember one moment clearly.

It was a beautiful spring morning, and the sunlight was dancing everywhere, but the beauty only made me feel sadder.

My master, who was always restless and cruel, had just left me after saying harsh, burning words that hurt my ears and mind like fire. Oh, how much I hated him! I wished that one day, if he walked on earth, the ground would open up and swallow him to get rid of the terrible trouble he caused.

He told me that I was made just to serve him, to obey him in everything. That I was nothing but a slave whose will must always give in to his. I had never felt so weak, and I was lost in painful thoughts. I didn’t even notice when someone came in until I heard William’s voice right next to me. “Linda,” he said, “why do you look so sad?”
