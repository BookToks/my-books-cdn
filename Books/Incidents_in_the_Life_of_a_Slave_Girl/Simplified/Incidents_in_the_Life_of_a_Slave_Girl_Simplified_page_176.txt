“Go down to the lower gate. Put your hands in your pockets, and walk shaky, like the sailors.” I did it the way she wanted. At the gate, I saw Peter, a young Black man, waiting for me. I had known him for years.

He used to be my father’s apprentice and always had a good reputation. I trusted him.

Betty said a quick goodbye, and we left.

“Linda,” said my friend Peter, “I have a dagger, and no one will take you from me unless they get past me first.” It had been a long time since I had walked outside, and the fresh air made me feel better. It was nice to hear someone talking to me instead of just whispers.

I passed several people I knew, but none of them recognized me because of my disguise. I hoped nothing would happen to make Peter use his dagger, for both our sakes.

We walked until we reached the wharf. My Aunt Nancy’s husband was a sailor, and he knew our secret.

He took me to his boat, rowed out to a ship nearby, and helped me get on board.

The three of us were the only ones on the ship. I asked what they planned to do with me. They said I would stay on the ship until almost dawn, then they would hide me in Snaky Swamp until my Uncle Phillip was ready to hide me somewhere safe.

If the ship had gone north, it wouldn’t have helped me because it would have been searched.

Around four o’clock, we got back in the boat and rowed three miles out into the swamp.

I was afraid of snakes, and now I faced new dangers.
