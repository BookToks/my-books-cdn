I told her I couldn’t come now, but someday I would visit her. Then she, Benny, and I would live together and be happy. She wanted to run and bring Benny to see me right away. I told her he was going north soon with Uncle Phillip, and I would visit him before he left. I asked if she wanted me to stay the night and sleep with her. “Yes,” she said.

Then she looked at her uncle and asked, “May I stay? Please, Uncle! She is my real mother.” He put his hand on her head and said seriously, “Ellen, this is a secret you promised Grandma not to tell. If you tell anyone, you will never see your Grandma again, and your mother can never come to Brooklyn.” “Uncle,” she said, “I will never tell.” He said she could stay with me.

After he left, I held her in my arms and told her I was a slave, and that’s why she must never say she saw me. I told her to be a good child, try to please the people where she was going, and that God would help her make friends. I told her to say her prayers and always pray for her poor mother, hoping God would let us meet again. She cried, and I didn’t stop her tears. Maybe she would never get to cry in her mother’s arms again.

All night she cuddled in my arms, and I didn’t want to sleep. The moments were too special to lose. Once, when I thought she was asleep, I kissed her forehead softly. She said, “I am not asleep, dear mother.” Before dawn, they came to take me back to my place.
