After we got back to New York, I went to see Ellen as soon as I could. I asked to see her downstairs because I thought Mrs. Hobbs's brother from the South might still be there, and I wanted to avoid him if possible. But Mrs. Hobbs came to the kitchen and told me I had to go upstairs.

"My brother wants to see you," she said. "He’s sorry you seem to avoid him. He knows you live in New York. He asked me to tell you he’s thankful to good old Aunt Martha for all her kindness and that he wouldn’t betray her grandchild."  

Mr. Thorne had been poor and careless before he left the South. People like him would rather borrow money or get a meal from loyal old slaves than from someone they saw as an equal. He said he was grateful to my grandmother for those kinds of kindnesses.  

I wished he had stayed away, but since he was here and knew where I was, I thought it was better not to avoid him. Avoiding him might make him angry. So, I went upstairs with his sister. He greeted me kindly, congratulated me on escaping slavery, and hoped I had a good place where I was happy.
