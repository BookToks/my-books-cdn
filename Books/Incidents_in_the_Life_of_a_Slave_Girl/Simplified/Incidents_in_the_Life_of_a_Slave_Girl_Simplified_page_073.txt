Slave owners like to think of themselves as good and honest people. But if you heard the huge lies they tell their slaves, you wouldn't trust them at all. I’m being honest here. I can’t say it any nicer.

When slave owners visit the North and come back, they tell their slaves about runaway slaves they say they saw. They describe these runaways as being in terrible shape. One slave owner once told me he saw a runaway friend of mine in New York. He said she begged him to take her back to her master because she was starving. He said she sometimes only had one cold potato to eat and other times had nothing at all.

He said he didn’t take her back because he knew her master wouldn’t want someone so miserable in his house.

He finished by saying, “This is what happens to people who run away from a kind master.” But this whole story was a lie. I later stayed with that friend in New York and found she was living comfortably.

She never even thought about going back to slavery.

Many slaves believe stories like this and think it’s not worth it to give up slavery for a hard kind of freedom.

It’s really hard to convince them that freedom is better.
