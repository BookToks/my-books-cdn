A 7-year-old boy named James was sold to a kind master.

Later, James got into debt and was sold to a rich slave owner who was very cruel.

With this man, James grew up and was treated like a dog. After a bad whipping, to avoid more punishment, he ran away into the woods. He was in terrible shape—half naked, starving, and had no way to find food.

A few weeks after he escaped, he was caught, tied up, and taken back to his master’s farm.

The master thought jail was too easy punishment for James. After hundreds of lashes, he wanted to punish James more.

So, after the overseer whipped James enough, the master decided to put him in a cotton gin between two screws for as long as he had been in the woods.

James was whipped from head to toe, then his wounds were washed with strong salt water to stop infection and help them heal faster.

He was then put into the cotton gin, which was squeezed tight, only letting him turn on his side, but not on his back.

Each morning, a slave brought him some bread and water and placed them near him.

The slave was told, under threat of punishment, not to speak to James.

Four days went by, and the slave kept bringing bread and water. On the second morning, the bread was gone, but the water was still there.
