I love you. Oh, Linda, isn’t this world a bad place? Everybody seems so angry and unhappy. I wish I had died like poor father did.

I told him that not everyone is angry or unhappy; people who have nice homes, kind friends, and aren’t scared to love them are happy. But we, who are slave children without a father or mother, can’t expect to be happy. We have to be good; maybe that will make us feel better.

“Yes,” he said, “I try to be good, but what’s the point? They are always bothering me.” Then he started to tell me about the trouble he had that afternoon with young master Nicholas.

It seemed that the brother of master Nicholas liked making up stories about William.

Master Nicholas said William should be whipped, and he would do it. So he started, but William fought back hard, and when the young master saw he was losing, he tried to tie William’s hands behind his back.

He couldn’t do that either.

By kicking and hitting, William got out of the fight with only a few scratches.

He kept talking about how mean his young master was; how he whipped little boys but was a coward when he fought boys his own size.

At times like that, he always ran away.

William also had other complaints about him.

One was that he rubbed pennies with quicksilver to make them look like quarters and tricked an old man who sold fruit.

William was often sent to buy fruit, and he told me all this.
