A slave had run away but was caught and brought back. No one was punished for this. If a slave refused to be whipped, bloodhounds were let loose to attack him and tear his skin off. The master who did these things was well-educated and acted like a perfect gentleman. He also called himself a Christian, but he was really as cruel as Satan.

I could tell you about more slave owners as cruel as these. They are not just rare cases. Don’t say there are no kind slave owners. Some do exist, even though it’s hard to stay kind in such a harsh world. But they are very rare, like angels visiting – few and far between.

I knew a young lady who was one of these rare kind owners. She was an orphan and inherited a woman and her six children as slaves. Their father was a free man. They had a nice home where parents and children lived together. The mother and oldest daughter worked for their mistress during the day, but at night they went back to their own home on the property. The young lady was very religious and true to her faith.

She taught her slaves to live good lives and wanted them to enjoy the results of their hard work. Her religion wasn’t just something she showed on Sundays and forgot about the rest of the week.

The oldest daughter of the slave mother was promised to marry a free man. The day before the wedding, the kind mistress freed her so the marriage would be legal.

People said this young lady cared a lot about her slaves.
