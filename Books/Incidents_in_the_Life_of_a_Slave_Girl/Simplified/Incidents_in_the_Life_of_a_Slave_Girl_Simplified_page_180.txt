There was happiness and sadness in the sounds I heard. They made me cry. I really wanted to talk to the people making those sounds!

I wanted to see their faces, but there was no hole or crack where I could peek. The dark was hard to bear. It felt terrible to stay in a small space every day without any light. Still, I would have chosen this instead of being a slave, even though white people thought being a slave was easy. Compared to others, my life wasn’t as bad. I was never forced to work too hard or whipped badly. I wasn’t beaten so badly that I couldn’t move. My feet weren’t tied to stop me from running away. I wasn’t chained to a heavy log or made to work in fields all day. I was never burned with hot iron or chased by dogs. Actually, I was treated kindly and cared for until Dr. Flint took me.

I never wanted freedom before then. But even though my life wasn’t too hard, God help any woman who has to live like that!

My food was passed to me through a trap door my uncle made. My grandmother, Uncle Phillip, and Aunt Nancy would take chances to climb up and talk to me through the opening.

But this wasn’t safe during the day.

So, it had to be done in the dark.

I couldn’t stand up, but I crawled around my small space to get some exercise.

One day I bumped my head on something and found out it was a small tool called a gimlet.
