While she worked as a night nurse for Mrs. Flint's children, she was very tired. Working all day and not getting enough sleep at night made her very weak. Dr. Flint said it was impossible for her to ever have a healthy baby.

Because they were afraid of losing such a good worker, they let her sleep in a small room in the out-house, except when someone in the family was sick.

Later, she had two weak babies. One died after a few days, and the other died after four weeks.

I remember how sad she was when she held the last baby in her arms. “I wish the baby could have lived,” she said. “But I believe it is God's will that my children should not live. Still, I will try to meet their spirits in heaven.” 

Aunt Nancy took care of the house and worked as a maid for Dr. Flint’s family. She did many jobs around the house.

Nothing worked well without her.

She was my mother’s twin sister, and she did her best to be like a mother to us orphans.

I slept with her all the time I lived in my old master’s house, and we were very close.

When my friends told me not to run away, she always told me to keep trying. When they said I should go back and ask my master to forgive me because I couldn’t escape, she sent me a message to never give up.

She said if I kept trying, I might get freedom for my children. Even if I died trying, that would be better than letting them suffer the same pain I had.

After I was locked in my dark cell, she secretly went to see Aunt Nancy whenever she could.
