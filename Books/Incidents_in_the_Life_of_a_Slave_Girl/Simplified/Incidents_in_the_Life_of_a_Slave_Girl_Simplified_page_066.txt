This dream of love kept me going through many hard times, and I didn’t want to risk losing it all of a sudden. There was a lady nearby who was a good friend of Dr. Flint. She often visited his house. I respected her a lot, and she always seemed to care about me.

My grandmother thought this lady could influence the doctor. So, I went to her and told her my story. I said I knew it was a problem that my lover was a free man, but he wanted to buy me. If Dr. Flint agreed, I was sure he would pay a fair price.

The lady knew Mrs. Flint didn’t like me, so I suggested maybe my mistress would be happy if I was sold and gone from her.

The lady listened kindly and promised to do her best to help me.

She talked to the doctor and tried hard to help, but it didn’t work.

I was so scared of my master now! I thought he would call me to see him any minute. The day went by, and I didn’t hear from him. The next morning, I got a message: “Master wants you in his study.” I saw the door open a little and stood for a moment, looking at the horrible man who said he owned me, body and soul. I went inside and tried to stay calm.

I didn’t want him to see how much I was hurting inside.

He stared at me like he was thinking, “I almost want to kill you right now.” Finally, he spoke, and it was a relief for both of us to break the silence.
