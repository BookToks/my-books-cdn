The venom from the snake bite I got made me feel worse, and I was really scared to go into this hiding place. But I didn’t have any other choice, so I was thankful for what my friends, who were also in trouble, could do to help me.

Peter got there first. He used a big knife to cut through the thick bamboo and thorny bushes.

Then he came back, picked me up, and carried me to a seat made among the bamboo.

Before we even got there, hundreds of mosquitoes were biting us.

In just an hour, they had bitten me so much that my skin was a terrible sight to see.

As the light got brighter, I saw snake after snake crawling around us.

I had seen snakes all my life, but these were bigger than any I had ever seen.

Even now, I get chills thinking about that morning. As evening came, the number of snakes got so high that we had to keep hitting them with sticks to stop them from crawling on us.

The bamboo was so tall and thick that we couldn’t see very far. Just before it got dark, we moved closer to the swamp’s entrance because we were scared we might get lost on the way back to the boat.

Not long after, we heard the sound of paddles and a quiet whistle we had agreed on as a signal. We quickly got in the boat and were rowed back to the ship.

I had a terrible night because of the heat, the mosquitoes, and being scared of the snakes. I even got a fever. Just as I was falling asleep, someone told me it was time to go back to that awful swamp. I could hardly find the strength to get up.

But even those big, poisonous snakes were less scary than what was coming next.
