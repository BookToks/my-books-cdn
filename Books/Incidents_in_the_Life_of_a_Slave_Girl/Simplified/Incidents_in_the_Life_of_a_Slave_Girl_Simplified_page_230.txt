I can’t believe it myself, but I lived in that tiny, dark hole with almost no light or air and barely any room to move for almost seven years. It was a really sad time for me, and even now my body still feels the effects of being trapped for so long. My family, who live in New York and Boston now, can prove that what I’m saying is true.

Many nights I sat by the little window, which was just big enough to see one tiny star. I heard the guards and slave catchers talking about chasing runaways, knowing they would be so happy if they caught me.

Season after season, year after year, I looked at my children’s faces and heard their sweet voices, wishing I could tell them, “Your mother is here.” Sometimes it felt like forever since I started living that dark, boring life.

Sometimes I felt numb and tired; other times I got really impatient, wanting to know when these dark years would end so I could feel the sunshine again and breathe fresh air.

After Ellen left us, these feelings got stronger. Mr. Sands had agreed that Benny might go to the North. Preparations for Escape.
