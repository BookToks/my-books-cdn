We were packed into a dirty box car at the back, behind white people in the south, but there they didnâ€™t have to pay for the spot. It made me sad to see how the north copied the bad parts of slavery.

We were hidden away in a big, rough car with windows on each side, but they were too high to see out without standing up. It was crowded with people from many different countries.

There were lots of beds and cradles with babies crying and kicking.

Almost every man had a cigar or pipe in his mouth, and whiskey was passed around a lot.

The smell of whiskey and thick tobacco smoke made me feel sick, and the rude jokes and dirty songs made my mind upset too. It was a really unpleasant trip. Since then, things have gotten a little better.
