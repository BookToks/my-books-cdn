I was scared to meet him and hid myself. He asked about me, of course, but I was nowhere to be found. He went to his office and sent William with a note. My brother’s face turned red when he gave it to me, and he said, “Don’t you hate me, Linda, for bringing you these things?” I told him I couldn’t blame him because he was a slave and had to obey his master’s orders.

The note told me to come to his office. I went. He asked where I was when he called. I said I was at home. He got very angry and said he knew better. Then he started talking about how I had wronged him and was ungrateful for his kindness. He reminded me of the rules again and sent me away. I felt ashamed that my brother had to stand by and listen to such harsh words, words fit only for a slave. Poor boy! He couldn’t defend me, but I saw tears he tried to hide.

This showed the doctor was annoyed.

William couldn’t do anything right for him.

One morning William didn’t get to the office as early as usual, and the doctor used this chance to get angry.

William was put in jail.

The next day my brother sent a trader to the doctor to ask if William could be sold. The doctor was very angry about what he called William’s silence.

He said he put William in jail to think about his bad behavior, but William wasn’t showing any signs of feeling sorry.

For two days, the doctor tried to find someone to do William’s work, but everything went wrong without him. William was let out of jail and told to go back to his old job.
