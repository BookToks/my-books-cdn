When I first started working for Dr. Flint’s family, I was treated a little better and got to enjoy some things with my mistress’s children. I thought this was fair and was thankful for it, so I worked hard to do my duties well. But when I turned fifteen, things got really bad for me as a slave girl. My master began to say awful things to me. Even though I was young, I understood what he meant.

I tried to ignore him or act like it didn’t bother me.

Because my master was older, I was very young, and I was scared my grandmother would find out, he put up with me acting this way for many months.

He was sneaky and used different ways to get what he wanted. Sometimes he was angry and scary, which made me very afraid. Other times he acted kind, hoping that would make me give in. I actually preferred when he was angry, even though it scared me a lot. He worked hard to ruin the good values my grandmother had taught me.

He filled my mind with disgusting thoughts that only a terrible person would have. I felt sick and hated him. But he was my master. I had to live in the same house as him, where I saw a man forty years older than me breaking the most important rules every day.
