I thought the same strong feelings existed between a master and his servant, just like between a mother and her child.  

But this topic is too painful to talk about. I have to finish my letter. If you are happy staying away from your old grandmother, your child, and the friends who love you, then stay where you are.  

We will never try to find or bother you.  

But if you want to come home, we will do everything we can to make you happy. If you don’t want to stay in the family, I know that father, with your asking, will agree to let you be sold to anyone you choose in our community.  

Please answer as soon as you can and tell us what you decide.  

Your sister sends lots of love to you.  

For now, believe me to be your true friend and well-wisher.  

This letter was signed by Emily’s brother, who was still very young. I knew from how it was written that it wasn’t written by someone his age, and even though the handwriting was changed, I was too unhappy in the past not to recognize Dr. Flint’s handwriting right away.  

Oh, the lies of slaveholders! Did the old fox think I was dumb enough to fall for this trick? He really thought African people were stupid. I didn’t thank the Flint family for their fake invitation, even though I was probably called ungrateful.  

Not long after, I got a letter from one of my friends in the South, telling me that Dr. Flint was planning to visit the North.  

The letter was late, so I thought maybe he was already here. The old enemy was back again.
