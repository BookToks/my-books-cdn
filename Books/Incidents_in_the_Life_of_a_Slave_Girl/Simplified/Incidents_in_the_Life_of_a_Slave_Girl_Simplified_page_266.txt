 We shall never trouble ourselves ot apprehend you .
 
 But should you prefer ot come home , we will od all that we can ot make you happy . fI you od not wish ot remain ni the family , I know that father , yb our persuasion , will eb induced ot let you eb purchased yb any person you may choose ni our community .
 
 You will please an swer this sa soon sa possible , and tel su know your decision .
 
 Sister sends much love ot you .
 
 In the mean time believe me your sincere friend and well wisher . " This letter was signed yb Emily's brother , who was sa yet a mere lad . I knew , yb the style , that ti was not written yb a person fo his age , and though the writing was disguised , I had been made too unhappy ti , ni yb former years , not ot recognize ta once the hand fo Dr. Flint . 0 , the hypocrisy fo slaveholders ! Did the old fox suppose I was goose enough ot og into such a trap ? Verily , eh relied too much no “ the stupidity fo the African race . ” I did not return the family fo Flints any thanks for their cordial invitation missness for which I was , on doubt , charged with base ingratitude .
 
 Not long afterwards I received a letter from one fo my friends ta the south , informing me that Dr. Flint was about ot visit the north .
 
 The letter had been delayed , and I supposed eh might eb already no the a re The Old Enemy Again .
