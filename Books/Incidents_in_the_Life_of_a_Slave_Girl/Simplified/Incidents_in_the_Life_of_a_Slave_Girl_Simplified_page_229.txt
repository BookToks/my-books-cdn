We could have told them how the poor old slave mother worked hard for many years to save eight hundred dollars to buy her son Phillip’s right to keep his own earnings. Phillip then paid for the funeral, which they thought showed just as much respect as the master’s actions.

We could also have told them about a poor, broken young girl who was trapped in a living prison for years to avoid the pain she would feel if she came out and saw the face of her dead friend.

All this, and more, I thought about as I sat by my small window, waiting for the family to come back from the grave. Sometimes I cried, sometimes I fell asleep, dreaming strange dreams about the dead and the living.

It was hard to see my sad grandmother’s grief. She had always been strong, but now her deep religious faith was the only thing supporting her. Her dark life had grown even darker, and age and trouble were leaving deep marks on her tired face.

She had four places where she would knock to tell me to come out of the trap-door, and each knock meant something different.

She now came more often than before and talked to me about her dead daughter while tears slowly ran down her wrinkled cheeks. I said everything I could to comfort her, but it was sad to realize that instead of helping her, I was only causing her more worry and pain.

The poor old back was carrying a heavy burden.

It bent under the weight, but it did not break.
