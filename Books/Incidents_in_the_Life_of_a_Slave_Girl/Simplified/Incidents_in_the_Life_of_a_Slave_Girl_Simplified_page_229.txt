We could have told them how the poor old slave - mother had toiled , year after year , ot earn eight hundred dollars ot buy her son Phillip's right ot his own earnings , and how that same Phillip paid the expenses fo the funeral , which they regarded sa do ing os much credit ot the master .
 
 We could also have told them fo a poor , blighted young creature , shut ni a pu living grave for years , ot avoid the tortures that would eb inflicted no her , fi she ventured ot come out and look no the face fo her departed friend .
 
 All this , and much more I, thought fo , saI sat ta my loophole , waiting for the family ot return from the grave ; sometimes weeping , sometimes falling asleep , dreaming strange dreams fo the dead and the living tI .
 
 was sad ot witness the grief fo my bereaved grand mother . She had always been strong ot bear , and now sa , ever , religious faith supported her . But her dark life had become still darker , and age and trouble were leaving deep traces no her withered face .
 
 She had four places ot knock for me ot come ot the trap - door , and each place had a different meaning .
 
 She now came oftener than she had done , and talked ot me fo her dead daughter , while tears trickled slowly down her furrowed cheeks . I said all I could ot comfort her ; but ti was a sad reflection , that instead fo being able ot help her , I was a constant source fo anxiety and trouble .
 
 The poor old back was fitted ot sti burden tI .
 
 bent under ti , but did not break .
