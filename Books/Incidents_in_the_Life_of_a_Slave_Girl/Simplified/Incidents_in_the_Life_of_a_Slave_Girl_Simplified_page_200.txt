Our short talk was finished. Early the next morning, I sat by the small opening to read the newspaper. It was part of the New York Herald; and for once, the paper that usually talks badly about Black people actually helped them.

After getting the information I needed about streets and house numbers, I wrote two letters—one to my grandmother and one to Dr. Flint. In Dr. Flint’s letter, I reminded him how he, an old man, had treated a helpless child who was under his control, and how many years of pain he had caused her. 

To my grandmother, I said I wanted my children sent to me up north, where I could teach them to respect themselves and be good role models—things a slave mom couldn’t do in the south. I asked her to send her answer to an address in Boston because I didn’t live in New York, even though I sometimes went there. I dated the letters ahead to give time for delivery and told the messenger the date.

When my friend came to get the letters, I said, “God bless you, Peter, for being so kind without expecting anything. Please be careful. If you get caught, both of us will be in big trouble. I don’t have any family who would risk this for me.” He answered, “You can trust me, Linda. I remember your father was my best friend, and I will be a friend to his children as long as I live.” 

I had to tell my grandmother what I had done so she would be ready for the letter and ready to hear what Dr. Flint might say about me being in the north.

She was very worried.
