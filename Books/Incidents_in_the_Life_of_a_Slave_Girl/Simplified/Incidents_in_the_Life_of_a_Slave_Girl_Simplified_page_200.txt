our brief interview was over. Early the next morn ing, I seated myself near the little aperture to examine the newspaper . It was a piece of the New York Her ald ; and, for once, the paper that systematically abuses the colored people, was made to render them a service.
 
 Having obtained what information I wanted concern ing streets and numbers , I wrote two letters, one to I my grandmother , the other to Dr. Flint. reminded him how he, a gray-headed man, had treated a helpless child , who had been placed in his power , and what years of misery he had brought upon her. To my grandmother , I expressed a wish to have my children sent to me at the north , where I could teach them to respect themselves , and set them a virtuous example ; which a slave mother was not allowed to do at the I south. asked her to direct her answer to a certain street in Boston, as I did not live in New York , though I went there sometimes. I dated these letters ahead, to allow for the time it would take to carry them, and sent a memorandum of the date to the messenger.
 
 I When my friend came for the letters , said, “ God bless and reward you, Peter , for this disinterested kind ness. Pray be careful . If you are detected,both you I I and will have to suffer dreadfully . have not a relative who would dare to do it rof me . ” He replied “ , You may trust ot me , Linda . I don't forget that your father was my best friend , and I will eb a friend ot his children os long sa God lets me live tI . ” was necessary ot tell my grandmother what I had done , ni order that she might eb ready for the letter , and prepared ot hear what Dr. Flint might say about my being ta the north .
 
 She was sadly troubled .
