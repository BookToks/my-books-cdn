There was a noise of chains rattling. The moon had just come up, shining weak light through the window bars. We knelt down and held Benjamin’s cold hands. We didn’t say anything. We heard crying, and Benjamin’s lips moved because his mother was hugging him and crying on his neck.

I remember that sad night very clearly! Mother and son talked quietly. He said sorry for all the pain he caused her. She said she didn’t have anything to forgive and that she understood why he wanted to be free. He told her that when he was caught, he tried to run away and even thought about jumping into the river. But then he thought about her and stopped.

She asked if he thought about God too. I think I saw his face look angry in the moonlight. He said, “No, I didn’t think about God. When a man is chased like an animal, he forgets about God and heaven. He forgets everything just to escape the dogs.” 

“Don’t talk like that, Benjamin,” she said. “Trust God. Be humble, my child, and your master will forgive you.” 

“Forgive me for what, mother? For not letting him treat me like a dog? No! I will never be humble to him. I have worked for him for nothing all my life, and this is how he pays me back—with whipping and prison. I will stay here until I die or until he sells me.” 

The poor mother shivered at his words. I think he felt that too because when he spoke again, his voice was softer. “Don’t worry about me, mother. I’m not worth it,” he said. “I wish I had some of your kindness. You accept everything quietly, like you think it’s all right. I wish I could do that.” 

The Slave who Dared to Feel like a Man.
