Many people were unhappy with themselves because they didnâ€™t have enough self-respect to accept bad treatment. There was no difference in the price of food and housing for black and white workers, so there was no reason to treat them differently.  

I stayed for a month after this, and when they saw I was ready to stand up for my rights, they decided to treat me better.  

Every black man and woman should do this, and one day we will stop being treated unfairly by those who want to keep us down.
