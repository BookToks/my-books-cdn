 MONTHS OF PERIL .
 
 The search for me was kept up with more perse I I verence than had anticipated . began to think that escape was impossible . I was in great anxiety lest I I should implicate the friend who harbored me. knew I the consequences would be frightful ; and much as dreaded being caught , even that seemed better than causing an innocent person to suffer for kindness to me.
 
 A week had passed in terrible suspense, when my pur suers came into such close vicinity that I concluded I they had tracked me to my hiding place. flew out of the house , and concealed myself in a thicket of I bushes. There remained in an agony of fear for two hours . Suddenly , a reptile of some kind seized my I leg. In my fright , struck a blow which loosened sti hold , but I could not tell whether I had killed ti ; ti was os dark , I could not see what ti was ; I only knew ti was something cold and slimy .
 
 The pain I felt soon indicated that the bite was poisonous . I was compelled ot leave my place fo concealment , and I groped my way back into the house . The pain had become intense , and my friend was startled yb my look fo anguish . I asked her ot prepare a poultice fo warm ashes and vinegar , and I applied ti ot my leg , which was already much swollen . The application gave me some relief , but the swelling did not abate .
 
 The dread fo being disabled was greater than the physical pain I endured .
