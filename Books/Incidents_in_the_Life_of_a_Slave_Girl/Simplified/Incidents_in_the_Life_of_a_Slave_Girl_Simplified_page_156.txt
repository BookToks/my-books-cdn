The search for me went on longer than I thought it would. I started to believe that escaping was impossible. I was very worried that my friend who was hiding me might get in trouble. I knew the consequences would be terrible. Even though I was scared of being caught, that seemed better than making an innocent person suffer for helping me.

A week passed in awful suspense. Then my pursuers came so close that I thought they had found where I was hiding. I ran out of the house and hid in some thick bushes. I stayed there, very scared, for two hours. Suddenly, something like a snake bit my leg. I was so scared that I hit it hard and it let go. I couldn’t tell if I had killed it because it was so dark. I only knew it felt cold and slimy.

The pain showed me the bite was poisonous. I had to leave my hiding spot and felt my way back inside the house. The pain got worse, and my friend was shocked by how much I was hurting. I asked her to make a poultice from warm ashes and vinegar. I put it on my leg, which was already very swollen. The poultice helped a little, but the swelling didn’t go down.

I was more afraid of being hurt badly and not able to move than of the pain itself.
