That was enough talk for now. You shall go, if you are forced; and you shall stay there.” I replied, “I will never go there. In a few months, I will be a mother.” He stood and looked at me in silent shock, then left the house without saying a word. I thought I would feel happy because I had won over him.

But now that the truth was out, and my relatives would find out, I felt terrible. Even though their lives were hard, they were proud of my good reputation. Now, how could I face them? I had lost my self-respect! I had promised myself to stay pure, even though I was a slave. I had said, “Let the storm come! I will face it until I die.” And now, I felt so ashamed!

I went to my grandmother. I tried to tell her everything, but the words stuck in my throat. I sat down in the shade of a tree near her door and started to think. I guess she saw that something was wrong with me.

A mother of slaves is very careful.

She knows there is no safety for her children.

After they become teenagers, she expects trouble every day.

This makes her ask many questions.

If a girl is sensitive, shyness might stop her from telling the truth, and this can push her away from her mother’s advice.

Soon, my mistress came like a crazy woman and accused me about her husband.

My grandmother, who had already started to suspect something, believed her. She said, “Oh Linda! Has it come to this? I would rather see you dead than see you like this now.

You are a shame to your dead mother.” She tore something from me.
