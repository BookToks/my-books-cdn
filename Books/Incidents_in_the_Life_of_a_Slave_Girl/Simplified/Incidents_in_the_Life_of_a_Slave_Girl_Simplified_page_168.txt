I was wrong for him to take grandmother's children. They want to go to my mother. My grandmother was told that the children would be given back to her, but she had to pretend they were really going away. So, she packed a bundle of clothes and went to the place.

When she got there, she saw William handcuffed with the group, and the children were in the trader's cart.

The scene felt too real. She was scared there might be a trick or mistake. She fainted and was carried home.

When the wagon stopped at the hotel, some men came out and wanted to buy William, but the trader said no, without saying he was already sold. Now came the hard time for those people, driven away like animals to be sold somewhere unknown. Husbands were separated from wives, parents from children, never to see each other again while alive. There was crying and sadness.

Dr. Flint was happy to see the wagon leave town, and Mrs. Flint was glad, thinking my children were going “where the wind and water would take them.” According to the plan, my uncle followed the wagon for a few miles until they reached an old farm.

There the trader took the irons off William and said, “You are a smart guy. I wish I could own you myself. Those men who wanted to buy you said you were a bright, honest boy, and I must find you a good home. I guess your old master will be angry tomorrow and call himself a fool for selling you.”
