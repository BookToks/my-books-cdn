Give it up, Linda. Try to hold on a little longer. Things might turn out better than we think.” My courage ran out because I didn’t want to hurt that faithful, loving old heart. I promised her I would try harder and that I wouldn’t take anything from her house without her knowing.

Whenever the children climbed on my knee or laid their heads on my lap, she would say, “Poor little souls! What would you do without a mother? She doesn’t love you like I do.” Then she would hug them tightly, like she was mad at me for not showing enough love. But she knew all along that I loved them more than my own life. I slept with her that night, and it was the last time.

The memory of it stayed with me for many years.

On Monday, I went back to the plantation and started getting ready for the important day.

Wednesday came.

It was a beautiful day, and the slaves’ faces were as bright as the sunshine.

The poor people were happy.

They were hoping to get little gifts from the bride and were looking forward to better times with her in charge. I had high hopes for them too. I knew that young wives of slave owners often tried to show their power by being cruel. What I had heard about young Mrs. Flint made me think she might be even harsher than the master or the overseer. Still, the Black people are the happiest and most forgiving people on earth.

Their masters feel safe because they have so much kindness in their hearts; yet they suffer without complaining.
