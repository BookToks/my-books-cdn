More people felt sorry for slaves than they would for horses or dogs.

I stood at the door with others to welcome the bride and groom. She was a pretty, delicate-looking girl, and her face turned red with feelings when she saw her new home. I thought she was probably imagining a happy future. It made me sad because I knew problems would come soon.

She looked at every part of the house and told me she loved how I had set things up. I worried that old Mrs. Flint had said bad things about me to her, so I tried my best to make her happy.

Everything went fine for me until dinner time. I didn’t mind serving dinner for the first time in my life, but I was nervous about meeting Dr. Flint and his wife, who were guests. I didn’t understand why Mrs. Flint hadn’t shown up at the plantation while I was getting the house ready. I hadn’t seen her face to face in five years, and I didn’t want to see her now.

She was a religious woman and probably thought my current situation was an answer to her prayers.

Nothing would make her happier than to see me broken down and controlled by a cruel, selfish master.

She didn’t talk to me when she sat at the table, but her proud, satisfied smile when I handed her plate said everything.

The old doctor was louder with his orders.

He told me what to do and spoke sharply.
