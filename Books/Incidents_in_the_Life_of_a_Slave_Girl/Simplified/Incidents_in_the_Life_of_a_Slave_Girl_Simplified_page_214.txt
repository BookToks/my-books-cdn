After he left, my grandmother came and asked me what I would do. The question felt like a joke.

What could I do? They were Mr. Sands's slaves, and their mother was a slave too, who he had told me was dead. Maybe he thought I was dead as well. I was too hurt and confused to make any decisions, and the children were taken away without me knowing.

Mrs. Sands had a sister from Illinois staying with her. This lady didn’t have any kids, and she liked Ellen so much that she offered to adopt her and raise her like a daughter. Mrs. Sands wanted to take Benjamin. When my grandmother told me this, I almost couldn’t handle it anymore. Was this what I had suffered for, just so my children could be free? It seemed like a good chance, but I knew slave owners didn’t care much about being like parents. If money problems came up, or if the new wife needed more money, my children might be used to get the money somehow. I didn’t trust slavery at all. I knew I wouldn’t have peace until my children were freed with all the proper legal papers.

I was too proud to ask Mr. Sands for anything for myself, but I could ask for my children. I decided to remind him of the promise he made to me and to rely on his honor to keep it. I convinced my grandmother to go see him and tell him I was not dead, and to ask him strongly to keep his promise. I had heard about the New Destination for the children.
