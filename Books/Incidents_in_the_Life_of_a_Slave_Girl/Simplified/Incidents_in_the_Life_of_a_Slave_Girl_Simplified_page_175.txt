I thought for a moment and said, “Betty, I have to leave here tonight.” She replied, “Do what you think is best, poor child.”

“I’m really scared that someone might catch you,” she said. She told her mistress what happened, and her mistress told her to keep Jenny busy in the kitchen until she could see my uncle Phillip. He said he would send a friend to get me that very evening. She said she hoped I was going north because it was really dangerous for me to stay nearby.

Sadly, it wasn’t easy for someone like me to get to the north.

To make sure the coast was clear for me, she went to the country to spend the day with her brother, and Jenny went with her. She was too scared to come say goodbye, but she left a kind message with Betty. I heard her carriage leave, and I never saw her again — the kind person who had helped me so much!

Even though she was a slaveholder, I still thank her from my heart!

I had no idea where I was going.

Betty brought me a sailor’s outfit — a jacket, trousers, and a tarpaulin hat. She gave me a small bundle, saying I might need it where I was going. Cheerfully, she said, “I’m so glad you’re going to free parts!

Don’t forget old Betty.

Maybe I’ll come along with you someday.” I tried to tell her how thankful I was for all her kindness, but she stopped me. “I don’t want thanks, honey. I’m just glad I could help you, and I hope the good Lord will open the way for you.”
