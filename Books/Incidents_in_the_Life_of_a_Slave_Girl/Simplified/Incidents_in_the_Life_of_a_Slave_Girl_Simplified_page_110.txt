After everyone else had taken communion and the blessing was said, the minister called out, “Come down now, my colored friends.” 

They listened and came forward to eat the bread and drink the wine. This was to remember Jesus, who was gentle and humble and said, “God is your Father, and you are all brothers.” 

This shows how the church and slavery were connected.
