People were really surprised when they found out my kids had gone back to their grandma’s.

The news spread all over town, and lots of kind people said nice things about the little ones.

Dr. Flint went to my grandma’s to find out who owned my children, and she told him.

“I figured as much,” he said. “I’m glad to hear it. I’ve heard from Linda recently, and I’ll get her soon. Don’t ever think you’ll see her free.

She’ll be my slave as long as I live, and when I’m dead, she’ll belong to my children. If I find out you or Phillip helped her run away, I’ll kill him. And if I see William on the street and he looks at me wrong, I’ll beat him badly. Keep those kids out of my sight!” When he turned to leave, my grandma said something to remind him of his own bad actions. He looked at her like he wanted to hit her.

I felt happy and thankful. It was the first time since I was a kid that I’d really felt joy. I heard about the doctor’s threats, but they didn’t scare me anymore. The worst part of my life was gone. No matter what happened to me, my children were safe. If I had to suffer, my little ones were saved. It was good that I believed everything that was promised to help them.

It’s always better to trust than to doubt.
