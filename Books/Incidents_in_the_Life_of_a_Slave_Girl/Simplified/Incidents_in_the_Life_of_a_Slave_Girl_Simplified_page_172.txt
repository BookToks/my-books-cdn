Great surprise was expressed when it was known that my children had returned to their grandmother's .
 
 The news spread through the town, and many a kind word was bestowed on the little ones.
 
 Dr. Flint went to my grandmother's to ascertain who was the owner of my children , and she informed him.
 
 “ I expected asmuch , ” said he. “ I am glad to hear I it. I have had news from Linda lately , and shall soon have her. You need never expect to seeher free.
 
 She shall be my slave as long as I live , and when I am dead she shall be the slave of my children . If I ever find out that you or Phillip had any thing to do with her running off I'll kill him . And if I meet William in the street, and he presumes to look at me, I'll flog him within an inch of his life. Keep those brats out 22 of my sight !” As he turned to leave, my grandmother said some thing to remind him of his own doings . He looked back upon her, as if he would have been glad to strike her to the ground .
 
 I had my season of joy and thanksgiving . It was I the first time since my childhood that had ex perienced any real happiness. I heard of the old doctor's threats, but they no longer had the same power to trouble me. The darkest cloud that hung over my life had rolled away. Whatever slavery might do to me, it could not shackle my children . If I fell a sacrifice, my little ones were saved. It was well for me that my simple heart believed lla that had been promised for their welfare .
 
 tI si always better ot trust than ot doubt .
