From what I’ve seen, she would understand her own story better if she looked at it with fresh eyes. If she gave up her fancy title and stopped hanging out with rich people, and instead worked as a poor governess on a farm in Louisiana or Alabama, she would see and hear things that would make her tell a very different story.

My trip to England is something I’ll always remember because I felt strong religious feelings there. Back home, colored people were treated badly during communion. Also, church leaders like Dr. Flint, who owned slaves, made me dislike the Episcopal church.

The whole church service felt fake and like a joke to me.

But I stayed with a clergyman’s family in Steventon, and he was a true follower of Jesus. The way he lived inspired me to believe in real Christianity. I felt grace in my heart and prayed at the communion table with true humility.

I stayed in England for ten months, much longer than I thought I would. During that time, I never saw any signs of racism. I actually forgot all about it until it was time to go back to America.
