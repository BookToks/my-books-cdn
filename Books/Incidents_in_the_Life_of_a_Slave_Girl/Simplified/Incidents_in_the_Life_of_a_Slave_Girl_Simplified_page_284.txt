If she were to lay aside her title , and, instead of visiting among the fashionable, become domesticated , as a poor governess, on some plantation in Louisiana or Alabama , she would see and hear things that would make her tell quite a dif ferent story.
 
 My visit to England is a memorable event in my life, from the fact of my having there received strong re ligious impressions . The contemptuous manner in which the communion had been administered to colored people, in my native place ; the church membership of Dr. Flint, and others like him ; and the buying and selling of slaves, by professed ministers of the gospel, had given me a prejudice against the Episcopal church .
 
 The whole service seemed to me a mockery and a sham.
 
 But my home in Steventon was in the family of a cler gyman , who was a true disciple of Jesus . The beauty of his daily life inspired me with faith in the genuine ness of Christian professions. Grace entered my heart, and I knelt at the communion table, I trust , in true humility of soul.
 
 I remained abroad ten months , which was much longer than I had anticipated . During lla that time I , never saw the slightest symptom fo prejudice against color . Indeed , I entirely forgot ti , till the time came for us ot return ot America .
