I was more worried than happy about what my brother had gained. A new worry started bothering me. Mr. Sands had spent a lot of money, and he would naturally be upset about losing it. I really feared this might hurt my children's future, who were becoming more valuable. I wanted to make sure they would be free soon. This was even more important because their father, who was also their master, had just gotten married. I knew about slavery enough to understand that promises made to slaves, even if meant kindly, often didn’t happen because of many problems.

Even though I wanted William to be free, what he did made me sad and worried.

The next Sunday was calm and clear; it was so beautiful it felt like a Sunday in heaven.

My grandmother took the children out on the porch so I could hear them.

She thought hearing them would make me feel better when I was feeling down, and it did. They talked happily, like only kids can. Benny said, “Grandmother, do you think Uncle Will has gone for good? Won’t he ever come back? Maybe he’ll find Mother if he does. Won’t she be happy to see him! Why don’t you and Uncle Phillip and Ella follow us and live where Mother is? I would like that, wouldn’t you, Ellen?” “Yes, I would like that,” Ellen said. “But how could we find her? Do you know where she is, Grandmother? I don’t remember what Mother looked like, do you, Benny?” Benny was just starting to describe me when an old slave woman from nearby interrupted them.
