This kind of favor didn’t happen often. It saved the trader money on food and jail costs. Even though the amount was small, it was still important to a slave trader.

Dr. Flint didn’t like seeing slaves after he had sold them. He told Rose to leave the house, but he wasn’t her master anymore, so she ignored him. For once, Rose, who was usually beaten down, was the one in control. His angry gray eyes stared at her, but that was all he could do.

“Why is this girl here?” he shouted. “How could you let her stay when you knew I sold her?” I said, “This is my grandmother’s house, and Rose came to visit her. I can’t make someone leave if they come here for a good reason.”

He hit me with a blow that would have hit Rose if she was still his slave. My grandmother heard the loud voices and came in just in time to see him hit me again. She wasn’t the kind of woman to let that happen in her own house without saying something.

Dr. Flint tried to explain that I had been rude. But my grandmother got more and more upset until she shouted, “Get out of my house! Go home and take care of your wife and kids. You have enough to do without watching my family.”

He brought up the fact that I had his children, and I told her she was okay with the life I was living. She said I was living with her because his wife forced me to. She told him not to blame her because he was the one responsible for everything that happened.
