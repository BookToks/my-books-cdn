He told me the land was his and that everything on it had to obey him.

My heart rebelled against this cruel control.

But where could I go to be safe? It didn’t matter if the girl slave was as black as night, as fair as her mistress, or anything in between. There were no laws to protect her from being hurt, insulted, or even killed. All these terrible things were done by people who looked like men but acted like monsters. The mistress, who should protect the helpless girl, only felt jealousy and anger toward her. The shame, the pain, and the bad things that come from slavery are too much to even explain.

They are worse than you might want to believe. If you believed even half the stories about the millions suffering in slavery, people in the North wouldn’t help make their chains tighter.

You would refuse to work for the master, even if it meant doing cruel jobs on your own land, like the cruel tasks done by trained dogs and the worst people in the South.

Everywhere, life brings its share of trouble, but in slavery, even the beginning of life is covered by darkness. Even little children who serve their mistress and her kids will learn before they turn twelve why their mistress hates certain slaves.

Maybe the child’s own mother is one of those hated ones.

She hears angry fights caused by jealousy and begins to understand why.

She will grow up too quickly, learning about bad things too soon.

Soon, she will start to feel scared whenever she hears her master’s footsteps.
