I will not go after him or send for him. I’m sure he will come back to me soon.

Later, I heard the story from William himself. He was not pushed away by abolitionists. He didn’t need them to tell him about slavery to want freedom. He looked at his hands and remembered when they were chained. How could he be sure they wouldn’t be chained again? Mr. Sands was kind, but he might delay giving him freedom. He could have money problems, or he might die without making sure William was free. William had seen this happen to other slaves with kind owners, so he decided to take the chance to be free now.

He was careful not to take money from his master by lying. So, he sold his best clothes to pay for his trip to Boston. Slave owners called him a mean, ungrateful person for doing this to a nice master.

What would they have done if they were in his place?

When Dr. Flint’s family heard William left Mr. Sands, they laughed. Mrs. Flint showed her usual fake kindness by saying, “I’m glad he left. I hope he never comes back. I like to see people get what they deserve. I think Linda’s children will have to pay for this. I’d like to see them back with the slave trader because I’m tired of seeing those little black kids walking around.” New Place for the Children.
