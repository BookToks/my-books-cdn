"Uncle Fred, how do you manage to learn your lessons so well?"  
"God bless you, child," he answered. "I always pray to God to help me understand what I read and spell. And He helps me, child. Praise His holy name!"  

There are thousands of people like good Uncle Fred who really want to learn and grow, but the law stops them, and the churches don’t help. They send Bibles to people far away but ignore the people who need it right here at home.  

I’m happy missionaries go to faraway places, but they shouldn’t forget about the hard places here at home. Talk to American slave owners like you talk to people in Africa who don’t know better. Tell them it’s wrong to treat people like property. Tell them it’s a sin to sell their own children and terrible to hurt their own daughters. Tell them that all people are brothers and no one should keep knowledge away from others.  

Tell them they will have to answer to God for keeping the truth away from people who are thirsty for it.  

There are people who want to do this kind of important work, but sadly, there aren’t many of them. The South hates them and would kick them out, put them in jail, or worse—like they did before.  

The time is right to help these people, and the chance to do so is waiting for those who will step up.  

Maybe Uncle Fred’s great-grandchildren will freely share the spiritual gifts he had to hide and risk prison to find.  

Are religious leaders blind, or are they just pretending not to see?
