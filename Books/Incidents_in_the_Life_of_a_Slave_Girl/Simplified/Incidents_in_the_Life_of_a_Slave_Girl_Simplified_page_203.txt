197 my little girl. “Ah, Ellen, is that you?” he said, in his nicest way. “I didn’t see you. How are you?”  
“Pretty well, sir,” she replied. “I heard you tell grandmother that my mother is coming home. I want to see her.”  
“Yes, Ellen, I am going to bring her home very soon,” he answered. “And you shall see her as much as you like, you little curly-headed girl.”  
This was as funny as a comedy to me, who had heard it all before; but grandmother was scared and upset, because the doctor wanted my uncle to go for me.

The next evening Dr. Flint came to talk about the matter.

My uncle told him that from what he had heard in Massachusetts, he thought he would be attacked if he went there after a runaway slave.  
“All stuff and nonsense, Phillip!” said the doctor. “Do you think I want you to cause trouble in Boston?  
The business can all be done quietly.  
Linda writes that she wants to come back. You are her relative, and she would trust you.  
The case would be different if I went. She might refuse to come with me; and the awful abolitionists, if they knew I was her master, wouldn’t believe me if I said she begged to come back. They would make a fuss; and I wouldn’t want to see Linda dragged through the streets like a common slave.  
She has been very ungrateful to me for all my kindness; but I forgive her, and I want to act like a friend toward her. I have no wish to keep her as my slave.  
Her friends can buy her as soon as she arrives here.”
