Even though it was hard to tell him how I felt, I begged him not to come back. I told him to go to the Free States, where he could speak freely and use his smarts better. He left me, still hoping that one day I could be bought. But for me, hope was gone. The dream I had since I was a girl was finished.

I felt lonely and empty.

Still, I wasn’t completely alone. I had my kind grandmother and my loving brother. When he put his arms around my neck and looked into my eyes, I felt he understood the troubles I couldn’t say out loud. That made me feel like I still had someone to love.

But even that feeling was sad because I knew he could be taken away from me at any moment by my master.

If my master had known how much we loved each other, I think he would have been happy to separate us.

We often made plans together to escape to the north. But, as William said, it’s easier to say than do.

I was watched very closely, and we had no money to pay for the trip.

My grandmother didn’t want us to try to run away.

She remembered how badly Benjamin suffered, and she was scared that if another child tried to escape, they might have the same or worse luck. To me, nothing seemed worse than my life now. I told myself, “William must be free. He will get to the north, and I will follow him.” Many other slave sisters have made the same plans.
