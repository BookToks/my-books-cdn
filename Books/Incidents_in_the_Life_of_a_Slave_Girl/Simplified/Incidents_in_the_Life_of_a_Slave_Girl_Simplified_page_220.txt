They were very upset. Mrs. Flint went to Mrs. Sands’s sister to ask about the situation. She spoke openly about how little respect Mr. Sands showed for his wife and his own character by admitting those “young black children.” She said that sending Ellen away was just like stealing, like taking furniture from her living room. She said her daughter was too young to sign any papers, and the children belonged to her. When her daughter grew up or got married, she could take the children wherever she wanted.

Miss Emily Flint, the girl I had been given to, was now sixteen years old. Her mother thought it was okay and honorable for her future husband to steal my children, but she didn’t understand how anyone could feel proud after buying their own children, like Mr. Sands had done. Dr. Flint didn’t say much. Maybe he thought Benny would be sent away less if he stayed quiet.

One of my letters, which he found, was from Canada. After that, he rarely talked about me. This situation let me go down to the storeroom more often, where I could stand up and move more easily.

Days, weeks, and months went by, and news came about Ellen. I sent a letter to Brooklyn, using my grandmother’s name, to ask if Ellen had arrived there. The answer was that she had not. I also wrote to her in Washington, but no one replied. There was one person there who should have known the children’s new location.
