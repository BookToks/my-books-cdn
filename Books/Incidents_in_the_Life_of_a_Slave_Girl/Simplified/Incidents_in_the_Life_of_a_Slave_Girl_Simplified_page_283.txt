Even the poorest and least educated people there lived much better than the best-treated slaves in America. They worked hard, but they didn’t have to work all night long under the hot sun or freezing cold, being whipped by overseers. Their homes were simple, but the law protected them. No rude guards could come in the middle of the night and beat them for no reason.

A father felt safe when he locked his door with his family inside. No master or overseer could take his wife or daughter away. They had to live apart sometimes to earn money, but parents knew where their kids were and could write letters to them. Families were very important, and even the richest nobles couldn’t break them without punishment. 

Many people were trying to help these poor folks get smarter. Schools were set up, and kind groups worked to make their lives better. There was no law stopping them from learning to read and write. If they helped each other learn the Bible, they wouldn’t get whipped like I and my old, religious uncle Fred did. I say again, even the poorest peasants were a thousand times better off than the best American slaves I knew.

I don’t say the poor people in Europe weren’t treated badly. I’m not trying to make their lives seem perfect. But Miss Murray shows how bad slavery was in the United States. A small part…
