But I was quick enough to think that he probably meant something the captain had told him; so I thanked him and said I hoped we would have good weather.

When I got on the ship, the captain came to meet me. He was an old man with a friendly face. He showed me to a tiny cabin where my friend Fanny was sitting. She jumped like she saw a ghost. She stared at me in total shock and said, “Linda, is that really you? Or is it your ghost?” When we hugged, I couldn’t hold back my feelings anymore and started crying.

The captain heard my sobs and kindly reminded us that for his safety and ours, it was better if we didn’t attract attention. He said that when another ship was nearby, we should stay below deck, but at other times, it was okay to be on deck. He promised to watch carefully and thought we would be safe if we followed his rules. He told others we were just women going to meet our husbands. We thanked him and promised to listen to everything he said.

Fanny and I then talked quietly in our small cabin. She told me about the terrible things she went through to escape and how scared she was hiding at her mother’s house.

Most of all, she talked about how painful it was to be separated from her children on that awful auction day.

She could hardly believe me when I told her where I had spent almost seven years.

“We have the same sorrows,” I said.

“No,” she answered, “you are Northward Bound.”
