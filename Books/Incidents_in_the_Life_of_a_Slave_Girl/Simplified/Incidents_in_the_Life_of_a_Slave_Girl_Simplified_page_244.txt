but I had presence of mind to think that it probably I referred to something the captain had told him ; so I thanked him , and said hoped we should have pleasant weather .
 
 I When entered the vessel the captain came forward to meet me. He was an elderly man, with a pleasant countenance . He showed me to a little box of a cabin, where sat my friend Fanny . She started as if she had seen a spectre. She gazed on mein utter astonishment , and exclaimed , “ Linda, can this be you ? or is it your ghost ?” When we were locked in each other's arms, my overwrought feelings could no longer be restrained .
 
 My sobs reached the ears of the captain ,who came and very kindly reminded us, that for his safety, as well as our own, it would be prudent for us not to attract any attention . He said that when there was a sail in sight he wished us to keep below ; but at other times, hehad no objection to our being on deck. He assured us that pru he would keep a good lookout , and if we acted dently, he thought we should be in no danger. He had represented us as women going to meet our hus bands in - We thanked him, and promised to observe carefully lla the directions eh gave su.
 
 Fanny and I now talked yb ourselves , qui low and etly , ni our little cabin . She told me fo the sufferings she had gone through ni making her escape , and fo her terrors while she was concealed ni her mother's house .
 
 Above lla , she dwelt no the agony fo separation from lla her children no that dreadful auction day .
 
 She could scarcely credit me , when I told her fo the place where I had passed nearly seven years .
 
 66 We have the same sorrows , " said .I " No , " replied she , “ you are Northward Bound .
