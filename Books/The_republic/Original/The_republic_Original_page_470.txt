 If you consider, I said, that when in misfortune we feel a natural hunger and desiretorelieveoursorrowbyweepingandlamentation,andthatthisfeeling whichiskeptundercontrolinourowncalamitiesissatisfiedanddelightedby the poets;–the better nature in each of us, not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is another’s; and the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he is, and making a fuss about his troubles; he thinks that the pleasure is a gain, and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem too?
 
 Few persons ever reflect, as I should imagine, that from the evil of other men somethingofeviliscommunicatedtothemselves. Andsothefeelingofsorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with difficultyrepressedinourown.
