 LikeSocrates,wemayrecapitulatethevirtuesofthephilosopher. Inlanguage whichseemstoreachbeyondthehorizonofthatageandcountry,heisdescribed as ’the spectator of all time and all existence.’ He has the noblest gifts of nature,andmakesthehighestuseofthem. Allhisdesiresareabsorbedinthe love of wisdom, which is the love of truth. None of the graces of a beautiful soul are wanting in him; neither can he fear death, or think much of human life. Theidealofmoderntimeshardlyretainsthesimplicityoftheantique;there is not the same originality either in truth or error which characterized the Greeks. The philosopher is no longer living in the unseen, nor is he sent by anoracletoconvincemankindofignorance;nordoesheregardknowledgeas a system of ideas leading upwards by regular stages to the idea of good.

Still, in the altered conditionsofknowledge,theparallelisnotwhollylost;andtheremaybeause in translating the conception of Plato into the language of our own age. The philosopher in modern times is one who fixes his mind on the laws of natureintheirsequenceandconnexion,notonfragmentsorpicturesofnature; on history,notoncontroversy;onthetruthswhichareacknowledgedbythefew, notontheopinionsofthemany. Heisawareoftheimportanceof’classifying accordingtonature,’andwilltryto’separatethelimbsofsciencewithoutbreakingthem’(Phaedr.).
