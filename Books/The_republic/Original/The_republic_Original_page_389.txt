I acknowledge, he said, the justice of your rebuke. Still, I should like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive to that knowledgeofwhichwearespeaking?
 
 I will tell you, I said: The starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most perfect of visible things,mustnecessarilybedeemedinferiorfartothetruemotionsofabsolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are relative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in them, in the true number and in every truefigure. Now, thesearetobeapprehendedbyreasonandintelligence, but notbysight.
 
 True,hereplied.
 
 The spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that higher knowledge; their beauty is like the beauty of figures or pictures excellently wrought by the hand of Daedalus, or some other great artist, which we may chance to behold; any geometrician who saw them would appreciate the exquisitenessoftheirworkmanship,buthewouldneverdreamofthinkingthat inthemhecouldfindthetrueequalorthetruedouble,orthetruthofanyother proportion.

 And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movementsofthestars? Willhenotthinkthatheavenandthethingsinheaven are framed by the Creator of them in the most perfect manner? But he will never imagine that the proportions of night and day, or of both to the month, orofthemonthtotheyear,orofthestarstotheseandtooneanother,andany other things that are material and visible can also be eternal and subject to no deviationâ€“thatwouldbeabsurd;anditisequallyabsurdtotakesomuchpains ininvestigatingtheirexacttruth.
 
 Iquiteagree,thoughIneverthoughtofthisbefore.
 
 Then, I said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ problems, and lettheheavensaloneifwewouldapproachthesubjectintherightwayandso makethenaturalgiftofreasontobeofanyrealuse.
