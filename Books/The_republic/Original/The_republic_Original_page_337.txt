 Good. But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the absolute negationofbeing?
 
 Yes,betweenthem.
 
 And, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to notbeing,forthatintermediatebetweenbeingandnot-beingtherehastobediscoveredacorrespondingintermediatebetweenignoranceandknowledge,ifthere besuch?
 
 Certainly.

 Undoubtedly.

 Yes.
 
 And knowledge is relative to being and knows being. But before I proceed furtherIwillmakeadivision.
 
 Whatdivision?

 Yes,Iquiteunderstand.
 
 Then let me tell you my view about them. I do not see them, and therefore the distinctions of figure, colour, and the like, which enable me to discern the differences of some things, do not apply to them. In speaking of a faculty I thinkonlyofitssphereanditsresult;andthatwhichhasthesamesphereand the same result I call the same faculty, but that which has another sphere and anotherresultIcalldifferent. Wouldthatbeyourwayofspeaking?
 
 Yes.
