I mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds; some of them do not invitethoughtbecausethesenseisanadequatejudgeofthem; whileinthecase of other objects sense is so untrustworthythat further enquiry is imperatively demanded.

 No,Isaid,thatisnotatallmymeaning.

 Verygood.

 Whatisit?
 
 Each of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle or at the extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin–it makes no difference; a finger is a finger all the same. In these cases a man is not compelled to ask of thoughtthequestionwhatisafinger? forthesightneverintimatestothemind thatafingerisotherthanafinger.
 
 True.
 
 Andtherefore,Isaid,aswemightexpect,thereisnothingherewhichinvitesor excitesintelligence.
 
 Thereisnot,hesaid.
 
 Butisthisequallytrueofthegreatnessandsmallnessofthefingers? Cansight adequatelyperceivethem? andisnodifferencemadebythecircumstancethat one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the extremity? And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness,ofsoftnessorhardness? Andsooftheothersenses; dotheygiveperfect intimations of such matters? Is not their mode of operation on this wise–the sensewhichisconcernedwiththequalityofhardnessisnecessarilyconcerned also with the quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same thingisfelttobebothhardandsoft?
