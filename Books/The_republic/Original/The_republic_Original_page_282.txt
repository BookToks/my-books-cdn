Charming! he replied. I see nothing charming in going into a passion with a manwhotellsyouwhatisright.

 Assuredlynot.
 
 Nor would you praise the behaviour of States which act like the men whom I was just now describing. For are there not ill-ordered States in which the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the constitution; and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under this regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in anticipating and gratifying their humoursisheldtobeagreatandgoodstatesmanâ€“donottheseStatesresemble thepersonswhomIwasdescribing?
 
 Yes, hesaid; theStatesareasbadasthemen; andIamveryfarfrompraising them.
 
 Butdoyounotadmire,Isaid,thecoolnessanddexterityofthesereadyministersofpoliticalcorruption?
 
 Yes,hesaid,Ido;butnotofallofthem,fortherearesomewhomtheapplause ofthemultitudehasdeludedintothebeliefthattheyarereallystatesmen,and thesearenotmuchtobeadmired.
 
 What do you mean? I said; you should have more feeling for them. When a man cannot measure, and a great many others who cannot measure declare thatheisfourcubitshigh,canhehelpbelievingwhattheysay?
 
 Nay,hesaid,certainlynotinthatcase.
 
 Well,then,donotbeangrywiththem;foraretheynotasgoodasaplay,trying theirhandatpaltryreformssuchasIwasdescribing;theyarealwaysfancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds in contracts, and the other rascalitieswhichIwasmentioning,notknowingthattheyareinrealitycutting offtheheadsofahydra?
 
 Yes,hesaid;thatisjustwhattheyaredoing.
 
 I conceive, I said, that the true legislator will not trouble himself with this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the constitution either in an ill-ordered or in a well-ordered State; for in the former they are quite useless, andinthelattertherewillbenodifficultyindevisingthem;andmanyofthem willnaturallyflowoutofourpreviousregulations.
