Yes, Polemarchus,–Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was commandedbytheirrulersisjust.
 
 Yes, Cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest of the stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further acknowledged that thestrongermaycommandtheweakerwhoarehissubjectstodowhatisnot forhisowninterest; whencefollowsthatjusticeistheinjuryquiteasmuchas theinterestofthestronger.
 
 But,saidCleitophon,hemeantbytheinterestofthestrongerwhatthestronger thought to be his interest,–this was what the weaker had to do; and this was affirmedbyhimtobejustice.
 
 Thosewerenothiswords,rejoinedPolemarchus.
 
 Never mind, I replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept his statement. Tellme,Thrasymachus,Isaid,didyoumeanbyjusticewhatthestronger thoughttobehisinterest,whetherreallysoornot?
 
 Certainly not, he said. Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken the strongeratthetimewhenheismistaken?
 
 Yes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted that the rulerwasnotinfalliblebutmightbesometimesmistaken.
 
 You argue like an informer, Socrates. Do you mean, for example, that he who ismistakenaboutthesickisaphysicianinthatheismistaken? orthathewho errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian at the time whenheismakingthemistake,inrespectofthemistake? True,wesaythatthe physicianorarithmeticianorgrammarianhasmadeamistake,butthisisonly a way of speaking; for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what his name implies; they none of them err unless their skill fails them, and then they cease to be skilled artists. No artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when he is what his name implies; though he is commonly said to err, and I adopted the common mode of speaking. But to be perfectly accurate, since you are such a lover of accuracy,weshouldsaythattheruler,insofarasheisaruler,isunerring,and, being unerring, always commands that which is for his own interest; and the subjectisrequiredtoexecutehiscommands;andtherefore,asIsaidatfirstand nowrepeat,justiceistheinterestofthestronger.
 
 Indeed,Thrasymachus,anddoIreallyappeartoyoutoarguelikeaninformer?
 
 Certainly,hereplied.
