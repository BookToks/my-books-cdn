He who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing?  
Yes.  

And not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, nothing?  
True.  

Of not-being, ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative; of being, knowledge?  
True, he said.  

The opinion is not concerned either with being or with not-being?  
Not with either.  

And can there for neither be ignorance nor knowledge?  
That seems to be true.  

But is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in a greater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than ignorance?  
In neither.  

Then I suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge, but lighter than ignorance?  
Both; and in no small degree.  

And also to be within and between them?  
Yes.  

Then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?  
No question.  

But were we not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of a sort which is and is not at the same time, that sort of thing would appear also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute not-being; and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance, but will be found in the interval between them?  
True.  

And in that interval there has now been discovered something which we call opinion?  
There has.  

Then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally of the nature of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be termed either, pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we may truly call the subject of opinion, and assign each to their proper faculty, â€“ the extremest to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to the faculty of the mean.
