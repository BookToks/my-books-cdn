What I am going to tell is only another version of the legend of Cadmus; but our unbelieving generation will be slow to accept such a story. The tale must be imparted, first to the rulers, then to the soldiers, lastly to the people.

These brothers and sisters have different natures, and someofthemGodframedtorule,whomhefashionedofgold;othershemade of silver, to be auxiliaries; others again to be husbandmen and craftsmen, and these were formed by him of brass and iron.
