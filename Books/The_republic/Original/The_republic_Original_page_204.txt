Aswewerenowagreedthatjusticewasvirtueandwisdom, andinjusticeviceandignorance,Iproceededtoanotherpoint: Well, I said, Thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were we not also sayingthatinjusticehadstrength;doyouremember?
 
 Yes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what you are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be quite certaintoaccusemeofharanguing;thereforeeitherpermitmetohavemysay out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer ’Very good,’ as they saytostory-tellingoldwomen,andwillnod’Yes’and’No.’ Certainlynot,Isaid,ifcontrarytoyourrealopinion.
 
 Yes, he said, I will, to please you, since you will not let me speak. What else wouldyouhave?
 
 Nothingintheworld,Isaid;andifyouaresodisposedIwillaskandyoushall answer.
 
 Proceed.
 
 Then I will repeat the question which I asked before, in order that our examinationoftherelativenatureofjusticeandinjusticemaybecarriedonregularly.
 
 A statement was made that injustice is stronger and more powerful than justice, butnowjustice, havingbeenidentifiedwithwisdomandvirtue, iseasily showntobestrongerthaninjustice,ifinjusticeisignorance;thiscannolonger be questioned by any one. But I want to view the matter, Thrasymachus, in a differentway: Youwouldnotdenythatastatemaybeunjustandmaybeunjustly attempting to enslave other states, or may have already enslaved them, andmaybeholdingmanyoftheminsubjection?
 
 True,hereplied;andIwilladdthatthebestandmostperfectlyunjuststatewill bemostlikelytodoso.
