We know that all human actions are imperfect; but we do not therefore attribute them to the worse rather than to the better motive or principle. Such a philosophyisbothfoolishandfalse, likethatopinionofthecleverroguewho assumes all other men to be like himself. And theories of this sort do not represent the real nature of the State, which is based on a vague sense of right graduallycorrectedandenlargedbycustomandlaw(althoughcapablealsoof perversion), any more than they describe the origin of society, which is to be sought in the family and in the social and religious feelings of man. Nor do theyrepresenttheaveragecharacterofindividuals,whichcannotbeexplained simply on a theory of evil, but has always a counteracting element of good.
