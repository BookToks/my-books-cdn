Socrates, in order to test this statement, employs once more the favourite analogy of the arts. The musician,doctor,skilledartistofanysort,doesnotseektogainmorethanthe skilled, butonlymorethantheunskilled(thatistosay,heworksuptoarule, standard, law, and does not exceed it), whereas the unskilled makes random effortsatexcess.

But his other thesis that injustice was stronger than justice has not yet been refuted, and Socrates now proceeds to the consideration of this, which, with the assistance of Thrasymachus, he hopes to clear up; the latterisatfirstchurlish,butinthejudicioushandsofSocratesissoonrestored to good-humour: Is there not honour among thieves?

 Thrasymachus replies: ’Let this be your entertainment, Socrates, at the festival of Bendis.’ Yes; and a very good entertainment with which your kindness has supplied me, now that you have left off scolding.

 Thus the sophistical fabric has been demolished, chiefly by appealing to the analogyofthearts. ’Justiceislikethearts(1)inhavingnoexternalinterest,and (2)innotaimingatexcess, and(3)justiceistohappinesswhattheimplement of the workman is to his work.’ At this the modern reader is apt to stumble, because he forgets that Plato is writing in an age when the arts and the virtues,likethemoralandintellectualfaculties,werestillundistinguished.
