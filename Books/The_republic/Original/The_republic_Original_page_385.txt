 Thatisverytrue.
 
 Now, suppose a person were to say to them: O my friends, what are these wonderfulnumbersaboutwhichyouarereasoning,inwhich,asyousay,there isaunitysuchasyoudemand,andeachunitisequal,invariable,indivisible,â€“ whatwouldtheyanswer?
 
 They would answer, as I should conceive, that they were speaking of those numberswhichcanonlyberealizedinthought.

 Verytrue,hesaid.
 
 And indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and not many as difficult.
 
 Youwillnot.

 Iagree.
 
 Let this then be made one of our subjects of education. And next, shall we enquirewhetherthekindredsciencealsoconcernsus?
