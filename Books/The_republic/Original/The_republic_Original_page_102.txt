 The explanation given in the text supposes the two harmonies to make up the number 8000. This explanation derives a certain plausibility from the circumstancethat8000istheancientnumberoftheSpartancitizens(Herod.),and would be what Plato might have called ’a number which nearly concerns the population of a city’; the mysterious disappearance of the Spartan population maypossiblyhavesuggestedtohimthefirstcauseofhisdeclineofStates. The lesserorsquare’harmony,’of400,mightbeasymboloftheguardians,–thelarger or oblong ’harmony,’ of the people, and the numbers 3, 4, 5 might refer respectivelytothethreeordersintheStateorpartsofthesoul, thefourvirtues, the five forms of government.

 The terms used in the statement of the problem may be explained as follows.
 
 A perfect number (Greek), as already stated, is one which is equal to the sum ofitsdivisors. Thus6,whichisthefirstperfectorcyclicalnumber,=1+2+3.
