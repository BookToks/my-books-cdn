For consistency, too, is the growth of time; andsomeofthegreatestcreationsofthehumanmindhavebeenwanting in unity. Tried by this test, several of the Platonic Dialogues, according to our modern ideas, appear to be defective, but the deficiency is no proof that they were composed at different times or by different hands.

Or, described in Christian language, the kingdom of God is within, and yet developes into a Church or external kingdom; ’the house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,’ is reduced to the proportions of an earthly building. Or, to use a Platonic image, justice and the State are the warp and the woof which run through the whole texture.
