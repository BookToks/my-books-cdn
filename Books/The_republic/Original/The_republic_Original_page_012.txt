The moderation with which old age is pictured by Cephalus as a very tolerable portion of existence is characteristic, not only of him, but ofGreekfeelinggenerally,andcontrastswiththeexaggerationofCicerointhe De Senectute. The evening of life is described by Plato in the most expressive manner, yet with the fewest possible touches.

 The ’Chalcedonian giant,’ Thrasymachus, of whom we have already heard in the Phaedrus, is the personification of the Sophists, according to Plato’s conception of them, in some of their worst characteristics.
