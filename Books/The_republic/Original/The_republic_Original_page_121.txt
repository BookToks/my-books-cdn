 WhyPlato,whowashimselfapoet,andwhosedialoguesarepoemsanddramas, should have been hostile to the poets as a class, and especially to the dramatic poets; why he should not have seen that truth may be embodied in verse as well as in prose, and that there are some indefinable lights and shadows of human life which can only be expressed in poetry–some elements of imaginationwhichalwaysentwinewithreason;whyheshouldhavesupposed epicverseto beinseparablyassociatedwiththeimpuritiesofthe oldHellenic mythology;whyheshouldtryHomerandHesiodbytheunfairandprosaictest ofutility,–arequestionswhichhavealwaysbeendebatedamongststudentsof Plato.
