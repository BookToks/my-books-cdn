I have loved Homer ever since I was a boy, and even now he appears to me to be the great master oftragicpoetry. ButmuchasIlovetheman,Ilovetruthmore,andthereforeI mustspeakout:andfirstofall,willyouexplainwhatisimitation,forreallyIdo notunderstand? ’HowlikelythenthatIshouldunderstand!’ Thatmightvery wellbe, forthedulleroftenseesbetterthanthekeenereye. ’True,butinyour presenceIcanhardlyventuretosaywhatIthink.’ Thensupposethatwebegin inouroldfashion,withthedoctrineofuniversals. Letusassumetheexistence of beds and tables. There is one idea of a bed, or of a table, which the maker ofeachhadinhismindwhenmakingthem;hedidnotmaketheideasofbeds andtables,buthemadebedsandtablesaccordingtotheideas.Andistherenot a maker of the works of all workmen, who makes not only vessels but plants and animals, himself, the earth and heaven, and things in heaven and under theearth? HemakestheGodsalso. ’Hemustbeawizardindeed!’ Butdoyou not see that there is a sense in which you could do the same? You have only totakeamirror,andcatchthereflectionofthesun,andtheearth,oranything else–there now you have made them. ’Yes, but only in appearance.’ Exactly so; andthepainterissuchacreatorasyouarewiththemirror,andheiseven more unreal than the carpenter; although neither the carpenter nor any other artistcanbesupposedtomaketheabsolutebed. ’Notifphilosophersmaybe believed.’ Nor need we wonder that his bed has but an imperfect relation to the truth. Reflect:–Here are three beds; one in nature, which is made by God; another,whichismadebythecarpenter;andthethird,bythepainter.Godonly made one, nor could he have made more than one; for if there had been two, therewouldalwayshavebeenathird–moreabsoluteandabstractthaneither, underwhichtheywouldhavebeenincluded. WemaythereforeconceiveGod to be the natural maker of the bed, and in a lower sense the carpenter is also the maker; but the painter is rather the imitator of what the other two make; hehastodowithacreationwhichisthriceremovedfromreality. Andthetragic poet is an imitator, and, like every other imitator, is thrice removed from thekingandfromthetruth. Thepainterimitatesnottheoriginalbed, butthe bedmadebythecarpenter. Andthis,withoutbeingreallydifferent,appearsto be different, and has many points of view, of which only one is caught by the painter,whorepresentseverythingbecauseherepresentsapieceofeverything, andthatpieceanimage.
