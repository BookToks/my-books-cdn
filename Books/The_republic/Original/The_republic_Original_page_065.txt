This is my parable; which I will beg you to interpretformetothosegentlemenwhoaskwhythephilosopherhassuchan evilname,andtoexplaintothemthatnothe,butthosewhowillnotusehim, are to blame for his uselessness. The philosopher should not beg of mankind to be put in authority over them. The wise man should not seek the rich, as theproverbbids,buteveryman,whetherrichorpoor,mustknockatthedoor of the physician when he has need of him. Now the pilot is the philosopher– he whom in the parable they call star-gazer, and the mutinous sailors are the mobofpoliticiansbywhomheisrendereduseless.

 Every one will admit that the philosopher, in our description of him, is a rare being. Butwhatnumberlesscausestendtodestroytheserarebeings! Thereis nogoodthingwhichmaynotbeacauseofevil–health,wealth,strength,rank, and the virtues themselves, when placed under unfavourable circumstances.
 
 For as in the animal or vegetable world the strongest seeds most need the accompaniment of good air and soil, so the best of human characters turn out the worst when they fall upon an unsuitable soil; whereas weak natures hardlyeverdoanyconsiderablegoodorharm;theyarenotthestuffoutofwhich either great criminals or great heroes are made. The philosopher follows the same analogy: he is either the best or the worst of all men.
