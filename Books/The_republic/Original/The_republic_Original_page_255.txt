Next in order to harmonies, rhythms will naturally follow, and they should be subject to the same rules, forweoughtnottoseekoutcomplexsystemsofmetre,ormetresofeverykind, but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of a courageous and harmonious life; and when we have found them, we shall adapt the foot and themelodytowordshavingalikespirit,notthewordstothefootandmelody.
