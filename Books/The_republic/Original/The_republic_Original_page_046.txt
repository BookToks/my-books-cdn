 BOOKIV.Adeimantussaid: ’Supposeapersontoargue,Socrates,thatyoumakeyourcitizensmiserable,andthisbytheirownfree-will;theyarethelordsof thecity,andyetinsteadofhaving,likeothermen,landsandhousesandmoney of their own, they live as mercenaries and are always mounting guard.’ You may add, I replied, that they receive no pay but only their food, and have no money to spend on a journey or a mistress. ’Well, and what answer do you give?’ My answer is, that our guardians may or may not be the happiest of men,–Ishouldnotbesurprisedtofindinthelong-runthattheywere,–butthis isnottheaimofourconstitution,whichwasdesignedforthegoodofthewhole and not of any one part. If I went to a sculptor and blamed him for having painted the eye, which is the noblest feature of the face, not purple but black, he would reply: ’The eye must be an eye, and you should look at the statue asawhole.’ ’NowIcanwellimagineafool’sparadise, inwhicheverybodyis eating and drinking, clothed in purple and fine linen, and potters lie on sofas andhavetheirwheelathand,thattheymayworkalittlewhentheyplease;and cobblersandalltheotherclassesofaStatelosetheirdistinctivecharacter. And a State may get on without cobblers; but when the guardians degenerate into booncompanions,thentheruiniscomplete. Rememberthatwearenottalking of peasants keeping holiday, but of a State in which every man is expected to do his own work. The happiness resides not in this or that class, but in the State as a whole. I have another remark to make:–A middle condition is best for artisans; they should have money enough to buy tools, and not enough to be independent of business. And will not the same condition be best for our citizens?
