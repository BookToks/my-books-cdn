There must. 

But if the trader goes empty-handed, having nothing which they require who would supply his need, he will come back empty-handed. That is certain. 

And therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves, but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those from whom their wants are supplied. 

Very true. 

Then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required? 

They will. 

Not to mention the importers and exporters, who are called merchants? 

Yes. 

Then we shall want merchants? 

We shall. 

And if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful sailors will also be needed, and in considerable numbers? 

Yes, in considerable numbers. 

Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions? To secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of our principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a State. 

Clearly they will buy and sell. 

Then they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes of exchange. 

Certainly. 

Suppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some production to market, and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with him, â€“ is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market-place? 

Not at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake the office of salesmen. In well-ordered states they are commonly those who are the weakest in bodily strength, and therefore of little use for any other purpose; their duty is to be in the market, and to give money in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from those who desire to buy.
