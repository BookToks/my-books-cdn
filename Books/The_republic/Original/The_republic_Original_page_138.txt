But these ideals had no counterpart in actual life. The Athenian woman was in no way the equal of her husband; shewasnottheentertainerofhisguestsorthemistressofhishouse, butonly his housekeeper and the mother of his children.

 The modern antagonist of the equality of the sexes would argue that the differences between men and women are not confined to the single point urged by Plato; that sensibility, gentleness, grace, are the qualities of women, while energy, strength, higher intelligence, are to be looked for in men. And the criticism is just: the differences affect the whole nature, and are not, as Plato supposes, confined to a single point. But neither can we say how far these differences are due to education and the opinions of mankind, or physically inheritedfromthehabitsandopinionsofformergenerations.

 The first wave having been passed, we proceed to the second–community of wives and children. ’Is it possible? Is it desirable?’ For as Glaucon intimates, andaswefarmorestronglyinsist,’Greatdoubtsmaybeentertainedaboutboth thesepoints.’ Anyfreediscussionofthequestionisimpossible, andmankind are perhaps right in not allowing the ultimate bases of social life to be examined.
