He attempts a task really impossible, which is to unite thepastofGreekhistorywiththefutureofphilosophy,analogoustothatother impossibility, which has often been the dream of Christendom, the attempt to unitethepasthistoryofEuropewiththekingdomofChrist. Nothingactually existing in the world at all resembles Plato’s ideal State; nor does he himself imagine that such a State is possible.

 Niebuhr has asked a trifling question, which may be briefly noticed in this place–Was Plato a good citizen? If by this is meant, Was he loyal to Athenian institutions?–he can hardly be said to be the friend of democracy: but neither is he the friend of any other existing form of government; all of them he regarded as ’states of faction’ (Laws); none attained to his ideal of a voluntary ruleover voluntary subjects, which seems indeed more nearly to describe democracythananyother;andtheworstofthemistyranny.
