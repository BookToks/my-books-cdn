And we grant all this, accompanying the permission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may come into being from seeing the light; and if any force a way to the birth, the parents must understand that the offspring of such an union cannot be maintained,andarrangeaccordingly.

 They will never know. The way will be this:–dating from the day of the hymeneal, the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his sons, and the femalechildrenhisdaughters,andtheywillcallhimfather,andhewillcalltheir childrenhisgrandchildren,andtheywillcalltheeldergenerationgrandfathers andgrandmothers.

 Suchisthescheme,Glaucon,accordingtowhichtheguardiansofourStateare to have their wives and families in common. And now you would have the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest of our polity, andalsothatnothingcanbebetter–wouldyounot?
 
 Yes,certainly.
 
 Shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the organization of a State,–whatisthegreatestgood,andwhatisthegreatestevil,andthenconsider whetherourpreviousdescriptionhasthestampofthegoodoroftheevil?
