 Still, mathematics admit of other applications, as the Pythagoreans say, and we agree. There is a sister science of harmonical motion, adapted to the ear as astronomy is to the eye, and there may be other applications also. Let us inquire of the Pythagoreans about them, not forgetting that we have an aim higherthantheirs,whichistherelationofthesesciencestotheideaofgood.The errorwhichpervadesastronomyalsopervadesharmonics. Themusiciansput theirearsintheplaceoftheirminds. ’Yes,’repliedGlaucon,’Iliketoseethem laying their ears alongside of their neighbours’ faces–some saying, "That’s a newnote,"othersdeclaringthatthetwonotesarethesame.’ Yes,Isaid;butyou meantheempiricswhoarealwaystwistingandtorturingthestringsofthelyre, and quarrelling about the tempers of the strings; I am referring rather to the Pythagoreanharmonists,whoarealmostequallyinerror. Fortheyinvestigate onlythenumbersoftheconsonanceswhichareheard,andascendnohigher,– of the true numerical harmony which is unheard, and is only to be found in problems, they have not even a conception. ’That last,’ he said, ’must be a marvellous thing.’ A thing, I replied, which is only useful if pursued with a viewtothegood.
 
 All these sciences are the prelude of the strain, and are profitable if they are regarded in their natural relations to one another. ’I dare say, Socrates,’ said Glaucon; ’but such a study will be an endless business.’ What study do you mean–of the prelude, or what? For all these things are only the prelude, and you surely do not suppose that a mere mathematician is also a dialectician?
 
 ’Certainlynot. Ihavehardlyeverknownamathematicianwhocouldreason.’ And yet, Glaucon, is not true reasoning that hymn of dialectic which is the musicoftheintellectualworld,andwhichwasbyuscomparedtotheeffortof sight, when from beholding the shadows on the wall we arrived at last at the imageswhichgavetheshadows?

 ’So far, I agree with you. But now, leaving the prelude, let us proceed to the hymn. What,then,isthenatureofdialectic,andwhatarethepathswhichlead http://www.idph.net IDPH 83 thither?
