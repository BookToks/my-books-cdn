 Butwhere,amidallthis,isjustice? sonofAriston,tellmewhere. Nowthatour city has been made habitable, light a candle and search, and get your brother andPolemarchusandtherestofourfriendstohelp,andletusseewhereinit we can discover justice and where injustice, and in what they differ from one another,andwhichofthemthemanwhowouldbehappyshouldhaveforhis portion,whetherseenorunseenbygodsandmen.
 
 Nonsense, said Glaucon: did you not promise to search yourself, saying that foryounottohelpjusticeinherneedwouldbeanimpiety?
 
 I do not deny that I said so, and as you remind me, I will be as good as my word;butyoumustjoin.

 AndwhicheverofthesequalitieswefindintheState,theonewhichisnotfound willbetheresidue?
 
 Verygood.
