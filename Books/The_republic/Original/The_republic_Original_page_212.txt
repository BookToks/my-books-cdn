 I wish, he said, that you would hear me as well as him, and then I shall see whetheryouandIagree. ForThrasymachusseemstome,likeasnake,tohave beencharmedbyyourvoicesoonerthanheoughttohavebeen;buttomymind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been made clear. Setting aside theirrewardsandresults,Iwanttoknowwhattheyareinthemselves,andhow theyinwardlyworkinthesoul. Ifyou,please,then,Iwillrevivetheargument of Thrasymachus. And first I will speak of the nature and origin of justice accordingtothecommonviewofthem. Secondly, Iwillshowthatallmenwho practise justice do so against their will, of necessity, but not as a good. And thirdly,Iwillarguethatthereisreasoninthisview,forthelifeoftheunjustis afterallbetterfarthanthelifeofthejust–ifwhattheysayistrue,Socrates,since I myself am not of their opinion. But still I acknowledge that I am perplexed whenIhearthevoicesofThrasymachusandmyriadsofothersdinninginmy ears; and, on the other hand, I have never yet heard the superiority of justice toinjusticemaintainedbyanyoneinasatisfactoryway.

 Indeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense would oftenerwishtoconverse.
