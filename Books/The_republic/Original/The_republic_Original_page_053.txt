Forexample,theterm’greater’issimplyrelativeto’less,’andknowledgereferstoasubjectofknowledge. Butontheother hand, a particular knowledge is of a particular subject. Again, every science hasadistinctcharacter,whichisdefinedbyanobject;medicine,forexample,is thescienceofhealth,althoughnottobeconfoundedwithhealth. Havingclearedourideasthusfar,letusreturntotheoriginalinstanceofthirst,whichhas a definite object–drink. Now the thirsty soul may feel two distinct impulses; theanimalonesaying’Drink;’therationalone,whichsays’Donotdrink.’ The twoimpulsesarecontradictory;andthereforewemayassumethattheyspring fromdistinctprinciplesinthesoul. Butispassionathirdprinciple, orakinto desire? There is a story of a certain Leontius which throws some light on this question. He was coming up from the Piraeus outside the north wall, and he passed a spot where there were dead bodies lying by the executioner. He felt alongingdesiretoseethemandalsoanabhorrenceofthem;atfirstheturned awayandshuthiseyes,then,suddenlytearingthemopen,hesaid,–’Takeyour fill,yewretches,ofthefairsight.’ Nowistherenothereathirdprinciplewhich isoftenfoundtocometotheassistanceofreasonagainstdesire,butneverofdesireagainstreason? Thisispassionorspirit,oftheseparateexistenceofwhich wemayfurtherconvinceourselvesbyputtingthefollowingcase:–Whenaman suffersjustly,ifhebeofagenerousnatureheisnotindignantatthehardships whichheundergoes: butwhenhesuffersunjustly, hisindignationishisgreat support; hungerandthirstcannottamehim; thespiritwithinhimmustdoor die,untilthevoiceoftheshepherd,thatis,ofreason,biddinghisdogbarkno more,isheardwithin. Thisshowsthatpassionistheallyofreason. Ispassion then the same with reason? No, for the former exists in children and brutes; andHomeraffordsaproofofthedistinctionbetweenthemwhenhesays,’He smotehisbreast,andthusrebukedhissoul.’ And now, at last, we have reached firm ground, and are able to infer that the virtuesoftheStateandoftheindividualarethesame.
