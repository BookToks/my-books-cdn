All of whom will call one another citizens?

Of course.

But is there not another name which people give to their rulers in other States?

Generally they call them masters, but in democratic States they simply call them rulers.

And in our State what other name besides that of citizens do the people give their rulers?

They are called saviours and helpers, he replied.

And what do other rulers call the people?

Their maintainers and foster-fathers.

And what do they call them in other States?

Slaves.

And what do other rulers call one another in other States?

Fellow-rulers.

And what in ours?

Fellow-guardians.

Did you ever know an example in any other State of a ruler who would speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being his friend?

Yes, very often.

And the friend here regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?

Exactly.

But would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a stranger?

Certainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded by them either as a brother or sister, or father or mother, or son or daughter, or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected with him.

Capital, I said; but let me ask you once more: Shall they be a family in name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the name? For example, in the use of the word ’father,’ would the care of a father be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him which the law commands; and is the http://www.idph.net 322 IDPH violator of these duties to be regarded as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much good either at the hands of God or of man?
