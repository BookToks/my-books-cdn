Nothingremainstousbutthatuniversalorprimaryscienceofwhichall the arts andsciences are partakers, Imean number or calculation. ’Very true.’ Including the art of war? ’Yes, certainly.’ Then there is something ludicrous about Palamedes in the tragedy, coming in and saying that he had invented number,andhadcountedtheranksandsettheminorder. ForifAgamemnon could not count his feet (and without number how could he?) he must have been a pretty sort of general indeed. No man should be a soldier who cannot count, and indeed he is hardly to be called a man. But I am not speaking of these practical applications of arithmetic, for number, in my view, is rather to beregardedasaconductortothoughtandbeing. IwillexplainwhatImeanby thelastexpression:–Thingssensibleareoftwokinds;theoneclassinviteorstimulatethemind,whileintheotherthemindacquiesces. Nowthestimulating class are the things which suggest contrast and relation. For example, supposethatIholduptotheeyesthreefingers–aforefinger,amiddlefinger,alittle finger–thesightequallyrecognizesallthreefingers,butwithoutnumbercannot further distinguish them. Or again, suppose two objects to be relatively great andsmall,theseideasofgreatnessandsmallnessaresuppliednotbythesense, butbythemind. Andtheperceptionoftheircontrastorrelationquickensand setsinmotionthemind,whichispuzzledbytheconfusedintimationsofsense, and has recourse to number in order to find out whether the things indicated areoneormorethanone. Numberrepliesthattheyaretwoandnotone, and are to be distinguished from one another. Again, the sight beholds great and small, butonlyinaconfusedchaos, andnotuntiltheyaredistinguisheddoes thequestionariseoftheirrespectivenatures;wearethusledontothedistinctionbetweenthevisibleandintelligible.
