 Twice has the just man overthrown the unjust–once more, as in an Olympian contest,firstofferingupaprayertothesaviourZeus,lethimtryafall. Awise manwhisperstomethatthepleasuresofthewisearetrueandpure;allothers are a shadow only. Let us examine this: Is not pleasure opposed to pain, and is there not a mean state which is neither? When a man is sick, nothing is more pleasant to him than health. But this he never found out while he was well. In pain he desires only to cease from pain; on the other hand, when he is in an ecstasy of pleasure, rest is painful to him. Thus rest or cessation is both pleasure and pain. But can that which is neither become both? Again, pleasure and pain are motions, and the absence of them is rest; but if so, how cantheabsenceofeitherofthembetheother? Thusweareledtoinferthatthe contradictionisanappearanceonly,andwitcheryofthesenses. Andtheseare nottheonlypleasures,forthereareotherswhichhavenoprecedingpains.Pure pleasurethenisnottheabsenceofpain,norpurepaintheabsenceofpleasure; although most of the pleasures which reach the mind through the body are reliefs of pain, and have not only their reactions when they depart, but their anticipations before they come. They can be best described in a simile. There is in nature an upper, lower, and middle region, and he who passes from the lower to the middle imagines that he is going up and is already in the upper world; and if he were taken back again would think, and truly think, that he wasdescending.
