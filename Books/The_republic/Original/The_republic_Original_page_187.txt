But can the musician by his art make men unmusical? Certainly not.

Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen? Impossible.

Or drought moisture? Clearly not.

Nor can the good harm anyone? Impossible.

I think that what you say is quite true, Socrates.

Then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts, and that good is the debt which a just man owes to his friends, and evil the debt which he owes to his enemies, – to say this is not wise; for it is not true, if, as has been clearly shown, the injuring of another can be in no case just.
