Will any private training help him stay strong against the huge wave of what most people think? Or will he just go along with the crowd? Will he not have the ideas of good and bad that most people have—so he will do what they do, and be like they are?

Yes, Socrates, he will have to.

But I said, there is an even stronger force that hasn’t been talked about yet.

What is that?

The quiet power of blame, taking away property, or even death, which, as you know, the new Sophists and teachers—who represent the public—use when their words don’t work.

Yes, they do; and rightly so.

Now, what chance does any other Sophist, or any private person, have to win against such a one-sided fight?

None, he answered.

No, really, I said, even trying is very foolish; there has never been, and probably never will be, any person who learned virtue from anything but public opinion—I mean human virtue only; things beyond human, as the sayings go, are not included. Because I want you to know that in today’s bad governments, whatever good exists is saved by God’s power, we can truly say.

I agree completely, he said.

Then please agree with one more thing I want to say.

What is it?

That all those paid people, called Sophists by many and seen as their enemies, actually teach nothing but what most people think—the opinions of their groups; and this is their wisdom. I could compare them to a man who studies the moods and wants of a huge strong animal he feeds—he would learn how to get close to it and handle it, when it is dangerous or calm, what its different sounds mean, and what makes it happy or angry. Then, after watching it all the time, he becomes an expert and calls this knowledge wisdom, making it into a system or skill to teach. But he doesn’t really understand what he means by feelings or reasons he talks about, only calling some things honorable and others dishonorable, or good and evil, or just and unjust—all based on the moods and tastes of that big animal.
