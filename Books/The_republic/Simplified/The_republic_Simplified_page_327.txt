Next, as to war: what should be the relationship between your soldiers and each other, and with their enemies? I think that any soldier who leaves his rank, throws away his weapons, or does anything cowardly should be lowered to the rank of a farmer or craftsman. What do you think?

By all means, I agree.

And anyone who lets himself be captured by the enemy might as well be a gift to them; he belongs to them now, and they can do what they want with him.

Certainly.

But what about the hero who has done something great? First, he should be honored in the army by his young comrades; each one should celebrate him. What do you say?

I approve.

And what about giving him a special handshake or sign of friendship?

I agree with that too.

But you might not agree with my next idea.

What is it?

That he should kiss and be kissed by them.

Most certainly! And I would even say: no one he wants to kiss should refuse while the mission lasts. So if there’s someone in the army who loves someone else, whether boy or girl, he might be more eager to win in battle.

Great! You said brave men should have more wives than others, and they get first choice so they can have as many children as possible?

Agreed.

Also, there’s another way brave young people should be honored, according to Homer. He tells how Ajax, after doing well in battle, was rewarded with long ribbons, which seems like a fitting honor for a hero in the best years of his life. It was both a sign of respect and something that made him stronger.

That’s true, he said.

Then, I said, Homer will be our guide; and we too, at sacrifices and similar events, will honor the brave based on how brave they are, whether men or women, with songs and other awards we talked about. Also with special seats, good food, and full cups. While honoring them, we will also be training them.
