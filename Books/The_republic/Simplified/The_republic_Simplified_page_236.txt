We shouldn’t have moms who scare their kids with bad versions of old stories, saying that some gods “go around at night looking like strangers and changing their shapes.” But they should be careful not to make their kids scared or disrespect the gods.

“No way,” he said.

Even though gods don’t change, can magic or tricks make us think they appear in different forms?

Maybe, he answered.

But do you think God would lie or show a fake version of himself?

I don’t know, he replied.

Don’t you know that real lies are hated by both gods and people?

“What do you mean?” he asked.

I mean no one wants to be tricked about the most important parts of themselves or about the biggest truths. That’s the one thing people fear the most.

“I still don’t get it,” he said.

That’s because you’re reading too much into what I said. I just mean that people hate being lied to or fooled about the deepest parts of themselves—their soul. That’s what they truly hate.

There’s nothing worse to them.

Like I said, not knowing the truth inside the soul is the real lie. A lie in words is just a copy or a shadow of what the soul once felt, not a pure, complete lie. Am I right?

Exactly right.

So the real lie is hated by gods and people?

Yes.

Sometimes lying with words can be okay, like when dealing with enemies or protecting friends who might hurt themselves. It can even help in stories or myths, because we don’t really know the truth about ancient times, so we mix lies with truth to understand them better.
