Socrates wants to test a statement again by using a comparison with skills and crafts. A musician, doctor, or any skilled artist doesn’t try to do better than other skilled people, but only better than those who are unskilled. They follow rules and don’t go beyond them. On the other hand, unskilled people try random things too much. So, skilled people are on the side of good, and unskilled people are on the side of evil. Being just is like being skilled, and being unjust is like being unskilled.

It was hard to convince Thrasymachus. The day was hot, he was sweating a lot, and for the first time, he even blushed. But his idea that injustice is stronger than justice wasn’t proven wrong yet. Socrates decides to talk about this more, hoping to clear things up with Thrasymachus’s help. At first, Thrasymachus is rude, but Socrates soon makes him calm again. They ask, “Is there honor among thieves? Isn’t the power of injustice just a part of justice? Isn’t total injustice actually weakness? A house that fights itself can’t stand. Two people who argue make each other weaker. Someone who fights with themselves is their own enemy and also against the gods. So, it’s not full wickedness but only partial wickedness that exists in states. Some good is needed to work together. There is no kingdom of pure evil in this world.”

Another question remains: Is the just person happier, or is the unjust person?

The answer is that every skill or art has a goal and a way to do it well. Isn’t the goal of the soul happiness? And isn’t justice the way the soul works well to reach happiness? Since justice and happiness are connected, the question of who is happier disappears.

Thrasymachus replies, “Let this be your entertainment, Socrates, at the festival of Bendis.” Socrates says it’s a good entertainment, especially now that Thrasymachus is not angry. But Thrasymachus says it’s not such a good entertainment because he has thought about too many things. First, they talked about what justice really is, then if justice is a good thing like wisdom or if it is bad and foolish, and then about the benefits of being just or unjust. In the end, Thrasymachus says he still doesn’t know what justice is, so how can he know if the just person is happy or not?

So, the tricky ideas have been broken down, mostly by comparing justice to skills. Justice is like skills because (1) it doesn’t care about outside rewards, (2) it doesn’t try to do too much, and (3) justice is to happiness like a tool is to the work a craftsman does. Modern readers might find this confusing because Plato lived when skills and virtues, like moral and intellectual qualities, were still mixed up. Back then, comparing skills to virtues was a way to understand human actions, and people didn’t see this comparison as wrong.
