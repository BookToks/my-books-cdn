In this part, the mind works with numbers and shapes, but these come from real things, not just shadows. The truth about them is only seen with the mind’s eye. These ideas are used as guesses without being fully studied.

In the other part, reason uses these guesses as steps to reach the idea of what is good. It holds on to this idea and then comes back down, staying firmly in the world of ideas during both going up and coming down, finally resting there.

“I kind of get it,” he said. “You mean the ideas in science are better than the guesses or images in geometry and other subjects. You don’t treat those guesses as pure knowledge because they don’t start with a first principle. But if they do start with a first principle, they become part of higher knowledge.”

“That’s right,” I said. “And you can match four kinds of knowledge with four abilities: pure intelligence for the highest level; active intelligence for the second; faith for the third; and seeing shadows for the fourth. How clear these abilities are depends on how true the things they deal with are.”

Like Socrates, we can think again about what makes a philosopher great. He is called “the watcher of all time and existence.” He has the best natural gifts and uses them well. All his wants focus on loving wisdom, which means loving truth. He has all the good qualities of a beautiful soul; he is not afraid of death and does not care too much about human life.

Today’s ideal is not as simple as it was in ancient times. There is less original thinking in truth or error than the Greeks had. The philosopher no longer lives in a hidden world or tries to convince people they are ignorant. He no longer sees knowledge as a system leading step by step to the idea of good.

People today are less eager to search for truth; there is more special work and less deep thinking about nature and life as a whole. There is more careful watching and less dreaming and inspiring. Still, even with these changes, the idea is not completely lost, and it’s useful to explain Plato’s ideas in today’s language.

Today’s philosopher focuses on the laws of nature in their order and connection, not just pieces or pictures of nature. He studies history, not arguments. He looks for truths accepted by a few, not opinions held by many. He knows it is important to “classify according to nature” and tries to “separate parts of science without breaking them.” He respects all truths, big or small, and in small things, he finds the greatest.

Like the old philosophers, he sees the world full of comparisons, but he can also explain why sometimes one example is enough to prove something, while other times thousands of examples prove nothing.
