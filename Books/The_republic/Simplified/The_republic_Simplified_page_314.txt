So, this is what music and gymnastics, when done the way we talked about, will achieve?

Definitely.

So, we have created a system that is not just possible but also really good for the State?

True.

Then, let the wives of our guardians take off their clothes, because their virtue will be their clothes, and let them help with the hard work of war and protecting their country. Women, being physically weaker, will do the easier jobs, but in every other way, their duties will be the same. And if a man laughs at women exercising naked for good reasons, he is showing he is immature and doesn’t understand what he’s laughing at or doing; because the saying is true: useful things are noble, and harmful things are low.

That’s very true.

So, here is one problem with our law about women, which we can say we have now avoided; we are safe from being overwhelmed by the idea that guardians of both sexes should share everything. The usefulness and possibility of this plan prove it makes sense.

Yes, that was a huge problem you avoided.

Yes, I said, but a bigger problem is coming; you won’t care much about this one when you hear the next.

Go on; let me hear it.

The law, I said, which follows from this and everything before it, says this: the wives of our guardians will be shared, and their children will be shared too. No parent will know their own child, and no child will know their parent.

Yes, he said, that’s an even bigger problem than the last one, and whether this law is possible or useful is much more doubtful.

I don’t think anyone can argue about how useful it would be to have wives and children shared by all; but whether it’s possible is a totally different question and will be debated a lot.
