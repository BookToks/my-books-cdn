Sometimes, a leader’s ability to make decisions is weak because they think too much but don’t act. When it’s time to take action, they hesitate or just talk about general ideas to explain changes. Sometimes, they don’t understand the world well and get tricked by others. In some cases, they become like people who just enjoy sounding smart but never actually do anything helpful. That’s why people often call these kinds of leaders boring, tricky, or unrealistic.

It’s like they are bad copies of what a wise leader should be. A good leader should be able to think clearly and take action equally, balancing what’s happening now with what might happen in the future. But such perfect leaders are very rare, especially in a government with rules.

Just like philosophers can struggle with everyday politics, regular leaders can fail during big problems. When things start to change a lot, they still follow old ideas and stick to their political groups without seeing what’s really happening. They don’t learn from new events and try to stop change with old advice. They focus more on their own group while the world changes around them. This is why old ways often look bad when new things come in, why churches don’t change easily, and why political changes can be confusing and chaotic.

Big moments in history often meet strong resistance from religious or political groups who refuse to change their ideas, even when those ideas no longer fit the people’s needs. Some stubborn leaders get so stuck in their ways that they act like they’re crazy, ignoring others’ opinions and only trusting their own.

Plato, the ancient thinker, mixed up some ideas by comparing a country to a single person. He thought the best country was one where everyone was very similar, like one person. But this isn’t quite right because a country is made up of many different people with different wills, and they have to work together.

A group of people can’t move or act as easily as one person. People have some freedom, but it’s even more limited when they are part of a nation. The feelings and actions of many people together are weaker and more balanced than those of one person. That’s why people often ask if a nation can have a “conscience” like a person does. It’s hard to say because a nation is more than just the sum of all the individuals—it’s also about how their different feelings and wills affect each other.
