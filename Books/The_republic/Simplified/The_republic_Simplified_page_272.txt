All people come from the same family line, but sometimes a golden parent will have a silver child, or a silver parent will have a golden child. God tells leaders that the most important thing they must protect is the purity of their people. They need to watch what traits mix in their children. If a child of a golden or silver parent has some traits of brass or iron, then nature says their status should change. The leader should not feel sorry for the child if they have to move down in rank and become a farmer or craftsman. Just like some kids of craftsmen might have golden or silver traits and be raised up to honored positions, like soldiers or helpers.

There is a saying that if a man made of brass or iron guards the State, it will be destroyed. That’s the story. Do you think people will believe it?

Not in this generation, he said. It can’t be done now, but maybe their children and grandchildren will believe it.

I see it’s hard, I said, but if they believe it, they will care more about the city and each other. Enough about this story, which might spread by rumor, while we prepare our real heroes and lead them under their leaders. Let them find a place where they can stop any rebellions inside and protect themselves from enemies outside who might attack like wolves. Let them set up camp, make offerings to the right gods, and prepare their homes.

Yes, he said.

Their homes must keep them warm in winter and cool in summer.

I guess you mean houses, he said.

Yes, I said, but these must be soldiers’ houses, not shops.

What’s the difference? he asked.

I’ll try to explain, I said. Imagine keeping guard dogs that, because they are not trained or are hungry or have bad habits, attack the sheep instead of protecting them. That would be terrible for a shepherd, right?

Truly terrible, he said.

So, we must be very careful that our soldiers, who are stronger than the citizens, don’t become wild tyrants instead of friends and helpers.
