I haven’t really enjoyed this, but that’s my own fault, not yours. It’s like when someone tries a little bit of every dish that’s brought to the table without stopping to enjoy any of them. That’s how I’ve been jumping from one topic to another without really understanding what I first wanted to find out: what justice really is.

I stopped thinking about that and started wondering if justice is something good and smart, or something bad and foolish. Then, when a new question came up about whether justice or injustice is better, I couldn’t help but move on to that.

In the end, all this talking has left me knowing nothing. I don’t know what justice really means, so I can’t say if it’s good or bad. And I don’t know if a just person is happy or unhappy.
