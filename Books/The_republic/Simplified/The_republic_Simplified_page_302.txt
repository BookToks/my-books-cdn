You were exactly right, Socrates.

Great! And if we said we found the just man and the just State, and we understood what justice is in both, would we be lying?

Definitely not.

Can we say that then?

Let’s say it.

Now, I said, we need to think about injustice.

Of course.

Isn’t injustice like a fight inside us—like one part of the soul causing trouble and going against the whole? It’s like a rebel going against the true ruler, even though the rebel should follow the ruler. All this mess, confusion, and wrongness is injustice, and also includes things like selfishness, fear, and not knowing right from wrong.

Exactly.

So if we know what justice and injustice really are, then we will also understand what it means to act unjustly or justly, right?

What do you mean? he asked.

Well, I said, it’s like the difference between being sick and being healthy; justice and injustice are like health and disease in the soul.

How is that? he asked.

Because, I said, what is healthy makes the body healthy, and what is unhealthy makes it sick.
