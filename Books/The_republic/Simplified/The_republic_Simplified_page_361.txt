So now, I asked, are we starting to convince those people you called rushing in with all their energy that the painter of constitutions is really someone as great as we say? They were very angry at him because we gave him control of the State. Are they getting a little calmer after hearing this?

Much calmer, if they have any sense.

Why, where can they still find a reason to complain? Will they doubt that the philosopher loves truth and reality?

They wouldn’t be that unreasonable.

Or that his nature, as we described, is connected to the highest good?

They can’t doubt that either.

But again, will they say that such a nature, when placed in good conditions, won’t be perfectly good and wise if anyone ever could be? Or will they prefer those we have rejected?

Surely not.

Then will they still be angry when we say that until philosophers rule, States and people will have nothing but trouble, and our imaginary State will never be real?

I think they will be less angry.

Should we assume that they are not just less angry but actually calm and willing to agree, and that they are so ashamed, if for no other reason, they can’t refuse to make peace?

By all means, he said.

Then let’s suppose they have made peace. Will anyone deny the other point, that there can be sons of kings or princes who are naturally philosophers?

Surely no one, he said.

And when they exist, will anyone say they must be destroyed? We don’t even deny that it’s hard to save them, but who would say that over all time not one of them can survive?

Who indeed!

But, I said, one is enough; let there be one man with a city that listens to him, and he might create the perfect government that the world finds so unbelievable.
