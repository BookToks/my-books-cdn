The unjust person wants to be truly unfair, not just look unfair. He doesn’t care about how things seem—he wants to actually be unjust. His mind is clever and full of ideas that help him plan well. First, people think he is fair, so he gets to be in charge in the city. He can marry whoever he wants and arrange marriages for others. He can trade and do business wherever he likes, always for his own benefit because he doesn’t worry about being unfair. In every contest, whether public or private, he wins and gains from others, getting richer all the time. With his wealth, he can help his friends and hurt his enemies. He can also offer sacrifices and gifts to the gods in a big and impressive way, and honor the gods or anyone else better than a just person can. Because of this, gods and people think the unjust person’s life is better than the just person’s life.

I was about to answer Glaucon when his brother Adeimantus stopped me. “Socrates,” he said, “don’t you think there’s more to say?”

“What else is there?” I asked.

“The most important point hasn’t even been mentioned yet,” he said.

“Okay, then,” I said, “Let’s help each other out—if he misses something, you can help. Although I must admit, Glaucon has already said enough to make me feel defeated and unable to defend justice.”

“That’s not true,” Adeimantus said. “But let me add something else. There’s another side to Glaucon’s argument about why people praise or blame justice and injustice, and it’s important to understand his point.”

Parents and teachers always tell their kids to be just, but why? Not for the sake of being just, but to build a good character and reputation. They hope that if someone is known as just, they will get the jobs, marriages, and other advantages that Glaucon talked about, which the unjust get from just having a good reputation. These people care even more about appearances than others. They say the gods think well of just people and that many blessings come to those who are pious. This matches what the famous poets Hesiod and Homer said: the gods make good things happen for just people, like oak trees growing acorns and bees making honey, and sheep with heavy fleeces, plus many other similar blessings.
