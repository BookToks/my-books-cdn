The father didn’t have his son to serve him or to support him and his friends. Instead, the son was supposed to protect his father and help him be free from the control of the rich and powerful people. So, the father told his son and his friends to leave, just like any parent might kick out a child and their bad company.

He said that the parent will realize what a terrible person he has been raising. When he tries to kick him out, he will find that the father is weak but the son is strong.

You don’t mean to say the ruler will use violence, do you? What! Beat his own father if he doesn’t agree?

Yes, he will, but only after he has taken away his father’s weapons.

That makes him a child-killer and a cruel guardian of his old parent. This is true tyranny, and there is no doubt about it. Like they say, people who try to escape the slavery of free men end up falling into the worse slavery of slaves. So, freedom, when it loses order and reason, turns into the worst and cruelest kind of slavery.

True, he said.

Okay, then can we say we have talked enough about what tyranny is and how democracy changes into tyranny?

Yes, quite enough, he said.

Finally, we come to the tyrannical man. We still need to ask how he is made from the democratic man.
