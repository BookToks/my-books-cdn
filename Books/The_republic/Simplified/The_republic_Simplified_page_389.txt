I agree, he said, that you’re right to criticize me. But I still want to know how we can learn astronomy in a way that really helps us understand what we’re talking about.

I said, I will tell you: The starry sky we see is made on a visible background, so even though it’s the most beautiful and perfect thing we can see, it’s still less important than the true feelings of absolute speed and absolute slowness. These feelings relate to each other and include what’s inside them, like true numbers and shapes. These things can be understood by thinking and using your mind, but not just by looking.

That’s true, he replied.

The stars should be used as a model to reach that higher knowledge. Their beauty is like the beauty of shapes or pictures made by a great artist, like Daedalus. Anyone who knows geometry would admire how well they’re made, but no one would think they could find the true equal, double, or any exact ratio in them.

No, he said, that would be a silly idea.

And won’t a real astronomer feel the same when he watches the stars move? He will think the sky and everything in it was made perfectly by its Creator. But he won’t think that the lengths of night and day, or how day and night relate to the month, or how months relate to the year, or how the stars relate to each other, or any other visible things, are perfect and never change—that would be ridiculous. It’s also pointless to spend so much effort trying to find their exact truth.

I agree, though I never thought about it like that before.

Then I said, in astronomy, like in geometry, we should use problems and leave the sky alone if we want to study the subject the right way and really use our natural ability to reason.

That, he said, is way beyond what our current astronomers can do.

Yes, I said; and there are many other things that need this kind of deeper study if our laws are to mean anything. But can you tell me about any other studies like this?

No, he said, not without thinking.
