The situation is cleverly compared to a made-up son who finds out that the people he thought were his parents aren’t really his parents, so they don’t have control over him anymore.

There’s also a clear difference between a mathematician and a dialectician. Plato knows that a mathematician’s skill is different from the deeper philosophical understanding that sees and puts together basic ideas. Plato doesn’t care much about arguing over words, worries about accidentally lying, and Socrates explains why he talks so seriously—this shows Plato’s unique way of thinking.

There’s a funny idea that if Palamedes invented numbers, then Agamemnon couldn’t count his feet. The way we are made to believe our State isn’t just a dream, the serious way the first step in making the State is done—sending away all kids who turn ten to speed up education—are all very Plato-like ideas. (For this last point, see the part at the end of the third book, where he expects people to believe a lie about earthborn people in the second generation.)

BOOK VIII. So, we come to the idea that in the perfect State, wives and kids are shared by everyone. Men and women both share the same education and activities, whether in war or peace. Kings are both philosophers and warriors. The soldiers live together, share everything, and don’t get paid money, only food from other citizens.

Now, let’s go back to where we left off. “That's easy,” he said. “You were talking about the State you made and the person who fits it, both of whom you said are good. You also said there are four types of worse States and four people who match them. Even though these are flawed in different ways, all are worth looking at to see how happy or unhappy the best or worst person is.”

Then Polemarchus and Adeimantus interrupted, which caused another argument—and here we are now. Imagine we put ourselves back in the same spot, and you ask your question again. “I want to know which kinds of governments you were talking about?”

Besides the perfect State, there are only four main ones in Greece: first, the famous Lacedaemonian or Cretan government; second, oligarchy, a State full of problems; third, democracy, which comes next; and fourth, tyranny, which is like the sickness or death of any government.

States aren’t made of wood or stone but of real people. So, since there are five types of States, there must be five kinds of people that match them. First is the ambitious type, which fits the Lacedaemonian State; second, the oligarchic type; third, the democratic type; and fourth, the tyrannical type.
