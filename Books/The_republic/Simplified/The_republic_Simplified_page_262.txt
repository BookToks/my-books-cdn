Well, he said, that was definitely a special drink to give someone in his condition.

Not so special, I replied, if you remember that a long time ago, before Herodicus’s time, the doctors didn’t use the kind of medicine we have now, which can kind of train diseases away. But Herodicus, who was a trainer and also often sick, found a way to keep himself, and others, suffering by mixing training with medicine.

How’s that? he asked.

By creating a slow and painful way to die; he had a serious illness that he kept managing but never cured. Since he couldn’t get better, he spent his whole life acting like someone always sick. He could only take care of himself and was always in pain if he didn’t follow his strict routine. So, with science’s help, he kept struggling on until he got very old.

That’s a strange reward for his skill!

Yes, I said; a reward you’d expect from someone who never understood that, if Asclepius didn’t teach his followers how to live like patients, it wasn’t because he didn’t know how. It was because he knew that in a well-run society, everyone has a job to do and can’t spend all their time being sick. This was true for artists, but funny enough, people didn’t apply this rule to richer folks.

What do you mean? he asked.

I mean this: When a carpenter gets sick, he asks the doctor for a quick cure—maybe a medicine that makes him vomit, or a purge, or even surgery. If someone told him to follow a strict diet and wrap his head up all day, he’d say right away that he doesn’t have time to be sick and that living just to care for his illness isn’t worth it. So he says goodbye to that kind of doctor, goes back to his usual work, and either gets better and keeps working, or if he’s too weak, he dies without more suffering.

Yes, he said, a person in his situation should only use medicine this way.

Doesn’t he have a job? I said. And what good would his life be if he couldn’t do his job?
