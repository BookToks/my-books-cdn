Clearly, hesaid, weareconcernedwiththatpartofgeometrywhichrelatesto war; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position, or closing or extending thelinesofanarmy,oranyothermilitarymanoeuvre,whetherinactualbattle or on a march, it will make all the difference whether a general is or is not a geometrician.
 
 Yes,Isaid,butforthatpurposeaverylittleofeithergeometryorcalculationwill beenough;thequestionrelatesrathertothegreaterandmoreadvancedpartof geometry–whetherthattendsinanydegreetomakemoreeasythevisionofthe ideaofgood;andthither,asIwassaying,allthingstendwhichcompelthesoul toturnhergazetowardsthatplace,whereisthefullperfectionofbeing,which sheought,byallmeans,tobehold.
 
 True,hesaid.

 Yes,thatiswhatweassert.

 Howso?
 
 They have in view practice only, and are always speaking, in a narrow and ridiculousmanner,ofsquaringandextendingandapplyingandthelike–they confusethenecessitiesofgeometrywiththoseofdailylife;whereasknowledge istherealobjectofthewholescience.
 
 Certainly,hesaid.
 
 Thenmustnotafurtheradmissionbemade?
 
 Whatadmission?
 
 That the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal, and notofaughtperishingandtransient.

 Then, mynoblefriend, geometrywilldrawthesoultowardstruth,andcreate thespiritofphilosophy, andraiseupthatwhichisnowunhappilyallowedto falldown.

 Then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants of http://www.idph.net IDPH 387 your fair city should by all means learn geometry.
