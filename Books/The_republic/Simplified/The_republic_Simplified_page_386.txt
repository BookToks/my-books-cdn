He said we care about the part of geometry that has to do with war. When setting up a camp, or choosing a spot, or moving army lines, or any other military action—whether in battle or marching—it really matters if a general understands geometry.

I said yes, but for that, only a little bit of geometry or calculation is needed. The real question is about the bigger and more advanced part of geometry—whether it helps us better see the idea of what is good. And that’s where everything pushes the soul to look toward the place of perfect being, which we should all try to understand.

He agreed.

I asked, if geometry makes us look at being, then it matters to us; but if it only deals with change, it does not matter?

He said yes, that’s what we believe.

But anyone who knows even a little about geometry will say this idea is the opposite of how most geometers talk.

I asked why?

He said they only think about practical stuff and always talk narrowly about squaring, extending, and applying shapes. They mix up what geometry needs with everyday needs, but real knowledge is the true goal of geometry.

He agreed.

I asked if we should accept something else?

He asked what?

I said that geometry aims to know what is eternal, not things that disappear or change.

He said yes, that’s true.

Then I said, geometry will lead the soul to truth, create a love of philosophy, and lift up what is now sadly falling down.

He said nothing will do that better.

So, nothing is more important than making sure the people in your city learn geometry.
