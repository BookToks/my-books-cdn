Heasksonly asks, "What good have they done?" and isn't happy with the answer, which is, "They have given innocent pleasure to people." He says he is glad poets are pushed aside because, after studying the soul, he found that poets focus on less important parts of the mind.

He means that the higher parts of the mind deal with big ideas, while the lower parts deal with specific things we sense. Poets fit with their own time, but not with thinkers like Socrates and Plato. He knew that Homer and Hesiod couldn’t be used as guides for living life through proper understanding. When he talks about them in a joking way, he is actually saying they don’t have real authority. He also saw that poets were not good critics themselves – as he says in the Apology, “Anyone was a better interpreter of their writings than they were.” He stopped being a poet when he became a student of Socrates, although he says Solon might have been a great poet if he hadn’t been distracted by other things.

From many angles, Plato and the poets were against each other, which was clear from the old fight between philosophy and poetry. Plato says in Protagoras that poets were like the Sophists of their time, and his dislike of the Sophists affected his view of poets too. He sees both as enemies of logical thinking and abstract ideas, though with Euripides, he especially dislikes his wrong ideas about tyrants and such. Plato sees himself as the person who “came into the world to convince men” – first that senses and opinions can be wrong, and second that abstract ideas are real. Even though it might seem strange today to put philosophy against poetry since they seem similar, the strangeness goes away if we think of poetry as tied to the senses and philosophy as tied to thinking and abstract ideas. Sadly, the word “idea,” which to Plato means the most real thing, now makes us think of something personal and unreal. We can also see how Plato is different from Aristotle, who says poetry is truer than history because poetry deals with big ideas, while history deals with specific events.

In the Bible, things we see are opposed to things we don’t see – this is similar to how Plato separates universals and ideas from particular things. To Plato, all particular things seem to exist only in the world of senses, and they have some kind of mistake or even evil in them. It’s easy to see this as a mistake because an individual man, horse, or bed isn’t more likely to be wrong or different than the whole group of men, horses, or beds. Also, the truth shown by individual examples isn’t less certain than the truth shown by big ideas. But Plato, who really cares about universals as tools for thinking, believes they have a deep truth that is actually imaginary and not real, because universals can be false and particulars can be true.
