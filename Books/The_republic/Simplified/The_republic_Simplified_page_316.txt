True, I said; and this, Glaucon, like everything else, has to happen in an organized way. In a perfect city, wild behavior is bad and the rulers will not allow it.

Yes, he said, and it shouldn’t be allowed.

Then the next thing is to make marriage very important and treat what is best as sacred.

Exactly.

But how can marriages be made the best? I ask you this because I see you have hunting dogs and some really nice birds. Have you ever watched how they mate and have babies?

In what way?

Well, first of all, even though they are all good, aren’t some better than others?

True.

Do you let all of them breed, or do you only let the best ones have babies?

Only the best.

Do you let the oldest or the youngest breed, or just those who are the right age?

I only pick those who are the right age.

If you didn’t take care when breeding, would your dogs and birds get worse?

Definitely.

And the same thing goes for horses and other animals?

For sure.

Wow, my friend, I said, our rulers will need a lot of skill if the same rules apply to humans!

Sure, the same rules apply. But why would that need special skill?

Because, I said, our rulers will often have to take care of the whole city with medicines. When people just need to follow a routine, a simple doctor is okay; but when medicine is needed, the doctor has to be very skilled.
