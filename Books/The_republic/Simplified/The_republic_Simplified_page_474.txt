Do they kill the soul by attaching to it and finally bring her to death, separating her from the body?

Definitely not.

But I said, isn’t it strange to think that something can be destroyed from the outside by some evil, when it could actually be destroyed from the inside by its own corruption?

It is, he replied.

Think about it, Glaucon. Even if food goes bad—like if it gets stale or rotten—that bad food doesn’t destroy the body just by touching it. But if the bad food causes the body to get sick, then the body is destroyed by its own sickness, which is a kind of corruption. Still, the body itself can’t be destroyed just because it touched bad food that doesn’t cause any natural infection. We have to agree on that, right?

Very true.

By the same idea, unless something wrong inside the body can cause something wrong in the soul, we shouldn’t think the soul, which is one thing, can be destroyed by some outside evil that belongs to something else.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, either we prove this wrong, or until someone does, we shouldn’t say that a fever, or any disease, or even a knife at the throat, or cutting up the body into tiny pieces can destroy the soul—unless the soul itself becomes more evil or less pure because of these things done to the body. No one should say that if the soul isn’t hurt from inside, it can be destroyed by something outside.

And surely, he said, no one can ever prove that people’s souls become more unfair or bad because they die.

But if someone who doesn’t want to believe the soul lives forever says that dying really makes people more evil, then, if that person is right, I guess injustice, like disease, must be deadly to the unfair person. Those who do wrong die because the evil inside them destroys them in the end, but in a different way than when the wicked die by others punishing them.

No, he said, if injustice kills the unfair person, then it’s not so scary for them, because it saves them from evil. But I think the opposite is true. Injustice, if it could kill others, actually keeps the wrongdoer alive—and wide awake too. Their home is far from being a place of death.
