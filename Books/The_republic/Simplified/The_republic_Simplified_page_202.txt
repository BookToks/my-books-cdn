Nothing, he said, can be better than that statement.

And is the unfair person good and smart, while the fair person is not?

Good again, he said.

And isn’t the unfair person like the wise and good, and the fair person unlike them?

Of course, he said. Someone who has a certain nature is like others with the same nature; someone who doesn’t is not.

Each person is like those who are like them?

Certainly, he replied.

Very good, Thrasymachus, I said. Now, about skills: you would agree that one person is a musician and another is not?

Yes.

And which one is wise and which one is foolish?

Clearly, the musician is wise, and the one who is not a musician is foolish.

And the musician is good because they are wise, and bad because they are foolish?

Yes.

And you would say the same about a doctor?

Yes.

Do you think, my good friend, that a musician, when tuning a lyre, would want or claim to be better than another musician?

I don’t think so.

But would they want to be better than a non-musician?

Of course.

What about the doctor? When choosing food and drinks, would they want to be better than another doctor or go beyond medical knowledge?

They would not.

But would they want to be better than a non-doctor?

Yes.
