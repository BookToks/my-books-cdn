Polemarchus said to me, “Socrates, I see that you and your friend are already on your way to the city.”

“You’re not wrong,” I said.

“But do you see how many of us are here?” he asked.

“Of course,” I replied.

“Are you stronger than all of us? Because if not, you’ll have to stay where you are.”

“Maybe there’s another option,” I said. “What if we convince you to let us go?”

“But can you convince us if we don’t listen to you?” he said.

“Definitely not,” Glaucon answered.

“Then we’re not going to listen, just so you know.”

Adeimantus added, “Has no one told you about the torch race on horseback in honor of the goddess that will happen tonight?”

“With horses?” I said. “That sounds new. Will horse riders carry torches and pass them to each other during the race?”

“Yes,” said Polemarchus. “And not only that, there will be a festival at night that you should definitely see. Let’s get up soon after dinner and watch the festival. There will be a lot of young people there, and we can have a good chat.”

“Alright, then. Don’t be stubborn.”

Glaucon said, “I guess since you insist, we have to.”

“Good,” I said.

So we went with Polemarchus to his house. There we found his brothers Lysias and Euthydemus, along with Thrasymachus from Chalcedon, Charmantides from Paeania, and Cleitophon, son of Aristonymus.

Also there was Cephalus, Polemarchus’s father, whom I hadn’t seen for a long time. He looked very old. He was sitting on a soft chair with a wreath on his head because he had been making a sacrifice outside. There were some other chairs arranged in a half-circle, and we sat down next to him. He greeted me warmly and then said:

“You don’t come to see me, Socrates, as often as you should. If I could still go out and visit you, I wouldn’t ask you to come to me. But at my age, it’s hard to get to the city, so you should come to Piraeus more often. Let me tell you, as the pleasures of the body fade away, the joy and charm of good conversation become even better for me.”
