Of course.

So, things like math and geometry, which help prepare us for debating and thinking deeply, should be taught to kids when they’re young. But we shouldn’t force it on them.

Why not?

Because someone who is free shouldn’t feel like a slave when learning anything. Exercising your body when you have to doesn’t hurt, but being forced to learn doesn’t really stick in your mind.

That’s true.

So, my friend, I said, don’t force kids to learn. Make early education fun and interesting. That way, you can see what they naturally like.

That makes a lot of sense, he said.

Do you remember when kids were taken to see battles on horseback? If it was safe, they got to get close and even experience some of the excitement like young hunting dogs.

Yes, I remember.

We can do the same with all kinds of work, lessons, and challenges. The kids who do best in all these should be picked for a special group.

At what age?

When they finish the important gym classes, usually after two or three years of training. This time can’t be used for much else because sleep and exercise don’t help learning. Being the best in gym class is one of the biggest tests for young people.

Definitely, he said.

After that, the kids chosen from the group around twenty years old will get higher honors. The science and knowledge they learned randomly before will now be organized so they can see how everything connects and relates to reality.

Yes, he said, that’s the only kind of knowledge that really lasts.

Yes, I said; being able to understand this kind of knowledge shows how good someone is at thinking deeply. A mind that can see the big picture is always good at debating.

I agree with you, he said.
