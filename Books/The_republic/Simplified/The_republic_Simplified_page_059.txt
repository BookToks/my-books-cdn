The job of staying awake and getting up at night will be given to helpers. Then, the wives of those who take care of us will have an easy time when they have babies. And that’s fair, I said, because they should.

Parents should be in the best years of their life. For men, that’s between twenty-five and fifty-five years old. For women, it’s between twenty and forty. Anyone outside these ages who gets married will be doing something wrong. Also, people inside these ages must get permission from the leaders before marrying. After these ages, they can marry whoever they want, as long as they don’t marry close family like parents or siblings, unless they get special permission. You might wonder how we’ll know who is family if everything is shared. The answer is that brothers and sisters are the children born seven or nine months after the parents get married, and everyone will have many children and many parents.

Socrates goes on: I need to show that this plan is good and fits well with how our society works. The best thing for a country is unity, and the worst is fighting and confusion. There will be unity when no one cares only about their own happiness or pain—if one person hurts, everyone feels it quickly. Even a small problem in the country will affect the whole community deeply. Like a person’s body, the whole country is hurt if any part is hurt.

Every country has rulers and people who follow them. In a democracy, the rulers are called leaders, and in other places, masters. But in our country, rulers are called saviors and helpers. People who are called slaves elsewhere are called nurturers and supporters here. Friends and teammates in other places are called fathers and brothers in ours. While in other countries, people in the government might see some as friends and others as enemies, in our country no one is a stranger. Every citizen is connected like family. Words like brother, father, sister, and mother will be real and not just words because children will hear them from a young age. Also, citizens will share everything, including property, so they will share joys and pains together.

Can people who think the same way fight? Or can there be arguments about property when people don’t own anything but their own bodies? Or lawsuits about violence when everyone has to protect themselves?

Allowing people to hit back when insulted will stop bigger fights and keep peace in the country. But no young person will hit an elder because respect will stop them, and they will be afraid the family might get back at them. Also, our citizens will avoid the small problems of life; there will be no lying to rich people, no messy family problems, and no borrowing money without paying it back.
