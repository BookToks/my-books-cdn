Experience shows that in life, the fair and honest person usually loses, while the unfair and dishonest person usually wins, especially when the unfairness happens on a big scale. This is very different from small-time cheating or stealing, like what swindlers or temple robbers do. People’s words prove this too – we call rulers “kind” or “blessed” even when they’re cruel. This shows two things: (1) justice is really what helps the stronger people, and (2) being unfair often makes you more money and power than being fair.

Thrasymachus, who is better at talking than making strong arguments, tries to leave after saying a lot, but the others won’t let him go. Socrates asks him nicely to stay and keep talking because their discussion is really important right now. Thrasymachus asks what more he can do, joking if he should put the words directly into their minds. Socrates says no, but asks him to be consistent with his words. He says don’t use “doctor” in a strict way and then use “ruler” loosely – a ruler or a shepherd should care only about the good of the people or animals they lead, not themselves. But Thrasymachus says rulers only care about their own power.

Socrates asks why rulers get paid if they only care about power. Thrasymachus says it’s because their personal interest isn’t part of their job, so another skill – the skill of paying people – is needed. No one would want to be a ruler unless they hope for a reward like money or honor, or are afraid of punishment like being ruled by someone worse.

If a government (or church) was made only of good people, they would only fear being ruled by someone worse, not want money or honor. But that’s not how things are now.

The joke about current governments is even stronger because it’s said so simply, like it’s just a side note. There’s also an irony in the idea that rulers don’t want to be in charge but still want to get paid.

Enough of that: Thrasymachus’s other big claim is more important – that living unfairly is more profitable than living fairly. Since you and I, Glaucon, aren’t convinced, we need to answer him. But if we try to compare their rewards, we’ll need someone to judge. So it’s better to agree to be honest with each other first.

Thrasymachus said that being perfectly unfair is better than being perfectly fair. After thinking a bit, Socrates gets him to admit an even stranger idea – that being unfair is a kind of strength, and being fair is a weakness. Socrates praises him for being honest, and acts like he just wants to understand what Thrasymachus means. At the same time, Socrates is setting up an argument that traps Thrasymachus. He gets him to admit that fair people only try to get an advantage over unfair people, but unfair people want an advantage over everyone.
