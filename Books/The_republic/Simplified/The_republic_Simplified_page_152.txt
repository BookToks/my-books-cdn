A whole nation might be smarter than any one person in it. Or maybe everyone in the nation shares the same opinion or feeling, which one person alone wouldn’t have. Sometimes, a really smart leader can inspire people to do amazing things. Plato didn’t really think about how complicated it is when lots of people act together. He also didn’t see that comparisons, even if they sound good, might not be true or helpful. In this way, he’s not as good as Aristotle, who usually isn’t fooled by bad comparisons. Plato mixes up the heart and virtues, always switching between the two. He thinks music is about the harmony of sounds and also the harmony of life. This idea is helped by confusing language and old Pythagorean beliefs. Since he compares the state to a person, he expects that the way states change over time is like how people’s lives go.

Still, even if his ideas aren’t perfect, they help us think bigger.

When people didn’t really understand virtues, comparing them to arts was a big step forward because virtue is kind of like an art, with both outer forms and inner meaning. Music’s harmony gives a clear picture of the harmony in the world and human life, and people naturally thought this comparison was real. Similarly, mixing ethics with politics helped make ethics clearer and made people think higher about government and citizens’ duties. Ethics can be seen as an ideal law and politics as ethics put into real life. But trying to make them the same caused problems, and modern writers often keep them apart or even against each other. Still, something important was lost when they were separated. Ancient philosophers cared more about people’s moral and intellectual well-being first, and then about wealth and power. Their ideas might still help us today. Many political ideas come from reacting against past mistakes, but when those mistakes go away, the new ideas can become mistakes too.

Plato’s ideas about education are interesting. Like the rest of the Republic, they are partly Greek and partly ideal. They start with what Greek kids usually learned and go on to life after school. Plato was the first to say that education should cover your whole life and prepare you for another life where education starts again. This idea is a main theme in the Republic and is more useful now than ever.
