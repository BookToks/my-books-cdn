Go ahead and enjoy your victory feast, and argue as much as you want; I won’t stop you because I don’t want to upset everyone here.

Okay, then keep answering while I finish my food. We’ve already shown that good people are definitely smarter, better, and stronger than bad people. Also, bad people can’t really work well together. Actually, it’s not totally true that bad people always act strongly together because if they were completely bad, they would fight each other too. There must have been some part of fairness in them that helped them team up; if not, they would have hurt each other as well as their victims. They were only half-bad in what they did. If they were fully bad and unfair, they wouldn’t be able to work together at all. I believe this is the real truth, not what you said at first. But whether good people live better and happier lives than bad people is another question we wanted to think about. I believe they do, for the reasons I said, but I still want to look into it more because this is a big deal — it’s about how people should live.

Go on.

I’ll start by asking a question: Would you say a horse has a purpose or goal?

I would.

And the purpose or goal of a horse or anything else would be what that thing does best and can’t be done as well by something else, right?

I don’t get it, he said.

Let me explain: Can you see anything without eyes?

No.

Or hear anything without ears?

No.

So, can we say that seeing and hearing are the main jobs of eyes and ears?

Yes, we can.

But you can cut a branch off a vine with a knife or a chisel, and in lots of other ways too, right?

Of course. 

And yet it’s not done as well with a special pruning tool made for that job?
