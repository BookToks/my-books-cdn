He couldn’t find a place to rest his eyes, nor see any part of the future clearly by looking at history. What seems like a very narrow view to us was natural, or maybe even necessary, for him.

First, about how the Republic relates to the Statesman and the Laws, and the two other works by Plato that deal directly with politics, you can check the introductions to those last two. Here, we’ll just mention a few general points.

Starting with the Laws.

(1) The Republic, though probably written over time, was mostly done during the middle part of Plato’s life. The Laws were definitely written in his later years, and some parts seem to be from when he was very old.

(2) The Republic is full of hope and dreams. The Laws feel like they show failure and disappointment. The Republic is a finished work with the final touches from Plato, while the Laws seem unfinished and less polished. The Republic has the beauty and energy of youth, but the Laws are more serious and full of the knowledge that comes with old age.

(3) The Laws don’t have much dramatic power, while the Republic is full of sharp contrasts in ideas and characters.

(4) The Laws are more like a sermon, and the Republic is more like a poem. The Laws are more religious; the Republic is more focused on thinking and ideas.

(5) Many of Plato’s famous ideas, like the theory of forms or the idea that philosophers should rule the world, don’t appear in the Laws. The idea of the soul living forever is only mentioned later on, and Socrates doesn’t appear at all. The Laws give up on sharing women and children in the community, but for the first time, they suggest public meals for women.

(6) The Laws still dislike poets. They praise them with fancy words but also say poets must leave the city if they don’t agree to have their poems checked by the city officials, like in the Republic.

(7) Even though the Laws are mostly not as good, some parts stand out. These include respect for the soul, warnings about bad or unnatural love, the whole of Book 10 about religion, criticism of dishonest selling and inheritance. These parts feel more modern and relate to us more than almost anything in the Republic.
