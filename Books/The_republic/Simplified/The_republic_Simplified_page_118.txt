He was supposed to have died in battle, but ten days later his body was found fresh and not decayed, and it was sent home for burial. On the twelfth day, he was placed on the funeral pyre, and there he came back to life and told what he had seen in the world below.

He said that his soul went with a big group to a place where there were two deep holes close together in the earth below, and two matching holes in the sky above. Judges sat in the space between, telling the good people to go up to heaven on the right side, with a special mark showing they were judged fair. The bad people, marked behind, were told to go down on the left side. They told him to watch and listen because he was going to be their messenger to the living. He saw souls leaving after the judgment at both holes; some came from earth looking tired and worn, while others came from heaven looking clean and bright.

They seemed happy to meet and rest for a while in a meadow. Here they talked about what they had seen in the other world. Those who came from earth cried when they remembered their pain, but the spirits from above spoke of amazing sights and heavenly happiness. He said that for every bad thing done, people were punished ten times worse. The journey took a thousand years because a human life was counted as a hundred years, and the rewards for good deeds were also in the same amount. He mentioned something sad about babies dying almost right after they were born. He told about even worse punishments for people who killed their own family members or others.

He was there when one spirit asked, "Where is Ardiaeus the Great?" (Ardiaeus was a cruel ruler who killed his father and older brother a thousand years ago.) Another spirit said, "He doesn’t come here and never will. I saw something terrible. At the entrance of the hole, just as we were about to go back up, Ardiaeus appeared with some other sinners—mostly tyrants but not all. Just when they thought they were going back to life, the hole roared loudly. Then wild, fiery men who understood the sound grabbed Ardiaeus and some others, tied them up, threw them down, dragged them by the road, cut and tore their bodies like wool, and told people passing by that they were going to be thrown into hell." The biggest fear for those going up was hearing that voice, but when it was quiet, they passed up happily. There were matching joys for those who suffered.

On the eighth day, the souls started their journey again and after four days reached a place where they looked down on a line of light like a rainbow but brighter and clearer. One more day brought them to the place, and they saw that this was a column of light holding the whole universe together. The ends of the column were tied to heaven, and from it hung the distaff of Necessity, on which all the stars and planets turned—the hook and spindle were made of diamond, and the whorl was made of a mixed material.
