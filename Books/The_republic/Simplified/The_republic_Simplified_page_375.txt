Sure.

He would then say that this person is the one who decides the seasons and years, and watches over everything we can see. In a way, he causes everything that happens, just like he and his friends have always believed.

He said that the person would first look at the sun and then think about the world around him.

And when he remembered where he used to live, and the wisdom of the cave and the other prisoners, wouldn’t he feel happy about the change and feel sorry for the others?

Definitely, he would.

If the prisoners usually gave awards to those who were fastest at noticing the shadows moving, and who could guess what would happen next, do you think the person would want those awards or be jealous of the winners?

Wouldn’t he say, like Homer, “It’s better to be a poor servant than to think and live like them”?

Yes, I think he would rather go through anything than think like they do and live that sad life.

Now imagine, I said, that this person suddenly came back out of the sun and was put back in his old place. Wouldn’t his eyes be full of darkness?

For sure, he said.

And if there was a contest where he had to measure the shadows with the prisoners who never left the cave, while his eyes were still weak and not used to the dark anymore (which might take a long time), wouldn’t he look silly? People would say he went up and then came down without being able to see, and that it’s better not to try to go up at all. If anyone tried to help someone else get out to the light, they would catch that person and even kill them.

No doubt, he said.

So, this whole story, I said, you can connect to the earlier idea: the prison is the world we see, the firelight is like the sun, and the journey upward is like the soul rising to understand deeper truths. This is just my humble opinion, which I’m sharing because you asked, but only God knows if it’s right or wrong.
