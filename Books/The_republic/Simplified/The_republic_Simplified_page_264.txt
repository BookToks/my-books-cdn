But they wouldn’t help people who were unhealthy and didn’t take care of themselves, especially if their lives didn’t matter to them or anyone else. Medicine wasn’t meant for those people, and even if they were as rich as Midas, the sons of Asclepius wouldn’t treat them.

They were very sharp and smart, those sons of Asclepius.

Of course, I replied. But the tragedians and Pindar don’t follow our ideas. Even though they know Asclepius was the son of Apollo, they say he was bribed to heal a rich man who was about to die, and because of that, he was hit by lightning. But based on what we already said, we won’t believe both things; if he was the son of a god, we say he wasn’t greedy, or if he was greedy, he wasn’t the son of a god.

All that, Socrates, is good; but I want to ask you a question: shouldn’t there be good doctors in a State? And aren’t the best doctors those who have treated many different kinds of people, both healthy and sick? And aren’t the best judges those who know all kinds of people’s characters?

Yes, I said, I also want good judges and good doctors. But do you know who I think are good?

Will you tell me?

I will, if I can. But first, I want to say that you mixed two different things in the same question.

How do you mean? he asked.

Well, I said, you mixed doctors and judges. The best doctors are those who, from when they were young, have learned a lot about their work and have a lot of experience with sickness. It’s better if they haven’t always been perfectly healthy and have been sick sometimes themselves. Because the body, as I see it, is not the tool doctors use to heal other bodies; if it were, we wouldn’t let doctors ever be sick. But doctors heal with their minds, and a mind that has been sick can’t heal anything.

That’s very true, he said.
