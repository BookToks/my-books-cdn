True.

Then comes debt and having to sell off his stuff.

Of course.

When he has nothing left, his wants don’t stop. They pile up like hungry baby birds, crying out for food. Pushed on by these desires, especially by love, which is like the leader of them all, he goes wild and tries to find someone to cheat or steal from to get what he wants.

Yes, that’s definitely what happens.

He needs money no matter what, or else he’ll suffer terrible pain and hunger.

He must.

Just like how new pleasures replace old ones, a young person will want more than their parents. If he spends his own share, he’ll try to take some of theirs.

No doubt about that.

If his parents won’t give it, he’ll try to trick and lie to them first.

Very true.

If that doesn’t work, he’ll use force and rob them.

Yes, probably.

And if the old man and woman fight back, what then? Will the son feel bad about being cruel to them?

No, he said, he wouldn’t feel bad at all about his parents.

But, oh wow! Adeimantus, can you believe that because of a new love for a random girl—someone who’s not really important—he would hurt his mother, who has been his lifelong friend and is essential to his life? Would he let her come under the control of the other woman, living in the same house? Or would he do the same to his old father, his most important friend, just for the sake of some new young lover who is the opposite of important?

Yes, he said, I believe he would.

Truly, then, I said, a cruel son is a blessing to his parents.
