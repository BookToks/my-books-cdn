The time has come when he will have to flatter many of his slaves and make lots of promises about freedom and other things, even if he doesn’t want to—he will have to trick his own servants.

Yes, he said, that’s the only way he can save himself.

Now imagine the same god who took him away also surrounds him with neighbors who won’t let one person be the boss of another, and if they catch the bad guy, they would kill him.

His situation will be even worse if you imagine him being watched and followed by enemies everywhere.

Isn’t this the kind of prison the tyrant is trapped in—someone like him, full of all kinds of fears and desires?

His soul is picky and greedy, but he’s the only one in the city who’s never allowed to travel or see the things other free people want to see. He lives hidden away like a woman stuck inside a house and is jealous of anyone who goes to other places and sees interesting things.

That’s true, he said.

And wouldn’t a devil like this, the badly ruled tyrant you said was the most miserable of all, be even more miserable when, instead of living privately, he has to be a public tyrant? He has to control others even though he can’t control himself. He’s like a sick or paralyzed man forced to spend his life fighting and struggling with other people.

Yes, he said, that’s exactly right.

Isn’t his situation super miserable? Doesn’t the actual tyrant live a worse life than the one you said was the worst?

Definitely.

The real tyrant, no matter what people think, is actually a slave. He has to flatter the worst kinds of people and act like a servant. He wants things he can’t get and needs more than anyone else. If you look closely at his whole soul, you’ll see he’s truly poor. He lives his whole life full of fear, shaking, and confusion—just like the country he rules. And that comparison is true, right?

Yes, he said, absolutely.

Also, like we said before, having power only makes him worse: he becomes more jealous, less trustworthy, more unfair, with fewer friends, and less respectful than before. He encourages all kinds of bad behavior, and because of that, he’s extremely unhappy and makes everyone around him just as unhappy.
