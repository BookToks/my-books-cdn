True.

The same thing looks straight when you see it out of water, but it looks bent when it's in the water. A concave shape can look like a convex one because of the way our eyes can be tricked by colors. This shows how confused our minds can get. That’s why magic tricks and illusions using light and shadow fool us—they take advantage of this weakness in how we see things.

True.

But tools like measuring, counting, and weighing help our minds understand better—they’re really useful. When we use these tools, things that seemed bigger, smaller, heavier, or lighter don’t trick us anymore because we can check with measurements.

Most true.

Surely, this is because our thinking part of the mind helps us figure things out logically.

To be sure.

When this thinking part says some things are equal or that some are bigger or smaller, sometimes it looks like there’s a contradiction.

True.

But didn’t we say that the same part of the mind can’t have two opposite opinions at the same time about one thing?

Very true.

So, the part of the mind that disagrees with the measurement isn’t the same part that agrees with it.

True.

And the better part of the mind is probably the one that trusts measurements and calculations.

Certainly.

The part that disagrees is likely a weaker or less reliable part of the mind.

No doubt.

This is what I meant when I said that painting, drawing, and all kinds of copying don’t show the truth. They’re linked to a part inside us that isn’t logical and doesn’t aim for what’s true or healthy.
