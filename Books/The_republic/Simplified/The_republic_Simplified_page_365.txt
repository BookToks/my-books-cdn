Do you think having everything else is worth anything if we don’t have what’s truly good? Or can we really know anything if we don’t understand what beauty and goodness are?

Definitely not.

You also know that most people say pleasure is the good thing, but smarter people say it’s knowledge, right?

Yes.

And you know that those smarter people can’t really explain what they mean by knowledge. They end up saying it’s knowledge of the good, like they expect us to understand what “good” means already.

That’s pretty silly!

Yes, I said, it’s silly for them to say we don’t know the good, but then act like we do—especially when they define “good” as knowledge. It’s like they think we get it just because they say it.

That’s true.

And the people who say pleasure is the good are confused too, because they have to admit that some pleasures are bad and some are good.

Right.

So, does that mean good and bad are the same thing?

Exactly.

There’s no doubt this is a really tricky question.

There isn’t.

Also, don’t we see that many people want to act or look like they are fair and honorable, even if they aren’t really? But no one is happy with just looking good—they want to really be good. When it comes to goodness, pretending isn’t enough.

Very true, he said.

So, this good thing that every person wants and tries to reach, even though they aren’t sure what it really is or don’t understand it as well as other things, and because of that lose the good in other things—should the smartest and most trusted people in our city be the ones who don’t understand it?

Of course not, he said.
