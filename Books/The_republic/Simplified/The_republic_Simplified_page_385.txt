Like I was saying, arithmetic really helps your mind because it makes you think about numbers in a very clear way, without using things you can see or touch. You know how artists don’t like it when someone tries to split a whole number into parts when they’re working with numbers? If you try dividing, they actually think of it like multiplying, making sure that the number stays whole and doesn’t get lost in fractions.

That’s definitely true.

Now, imagine someone asks them: “Hey friends, what are these amazing numbers you’re talking about, where each one is a whole unit, always the same size and can’t be broken down?” What do you think they would say?

They’d probably say they’re talking about numbers you can only understand in your mind.

So you see, this kind of knowledge is really important because it makes you use pure thinking to find pure truth, right?

Yes, that’s a main feature of it.

Also, have you noticed that people who are naturally good at math usually learn other things faster? Even people who aren’t very smart become quicker if they’ve practiced arithmetic, even if that’s the only thing they’ve learned.

That’s very true, he said.

And honestly, you won’t find a harder subject, and not many are as tough.

You won’t.

So for all these reasons, arithmetic is a type of knowledge that smart people should definitely practice and not give up on.

I agree.

So let’s make this a subject in our education. Next, should we look into if a similar science matters to us too?

You mean geometry?

Exactly.
