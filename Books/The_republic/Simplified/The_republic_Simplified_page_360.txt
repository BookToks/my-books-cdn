Can a person copy perfectly what they admire and respect?  
No, that’s impossible.  

A philosopher who thinks about the divine order becomes more orderly and divine himself, as much as human nature allows. But like everyone else, he will face criticism.  
Of course.  

If a philosopher is forced to shape not only himself but human nature in general—whether in countries or individuals—into what he sees in the divine, do you think he will be bad at creating justice, self-control, and other good qualities?  
Definitely not.  

If the world sees that what we say about him is true, will they get mad at philosophy? Will they refuse to believe us when we say no country can be happy unless its leaders copy the perfect heavenly example?  
They won’t be mad if they understand. But how will they come up with the plan you’re talking about?  

They will start by looking at the country and the habits of its people like a blank tablet. They will erase the old picture and start fresh. This is not easy. But whether it’s easy or not, this is what makes them different from other lawmakers—they won’t make laws for individuals or the country until they have a clean slate.  
That’s right.  

After that, will they begin to draw the outline of the country’s government?  
No doubt about it.  

And when they fill in the details, I think they will often look up and down—that means they will first look at perfect justice, beauty, and self-control, then at the human version. They will mix and adjust the different parts of life to match the image of a perfect person. They will base this on the other image, which Homer called the form and likeness of God.  
Very true.  

They will erase some features and add others until they make human ways as close as possible to God’s ways?  
Yes, and they couldn’t make a better picture than that.
