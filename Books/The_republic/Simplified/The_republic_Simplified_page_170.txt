As soon as he was baptized, he started, even though we didn’t want him to, to talk very strongly and with more passion than good sense about Christ’s religion. He became so intense about it that he not only said our religion was better than all others, but he also looked down on all the others, calling them bad and their followers wicked and cursed forever. After arguing about this for a long time, people caught him, accused him, and sent him away, not because he hated religion, but because they thought he was causing trouble and making people fight.

In public services, no prayers were used except ones that anyone could say without offending any group. He pointed out that some worship a man who was once very good or famous, not only as a god but as the highest god. But most wise people reject these ideas and believe there is one godly power that no human can fully understand. This power is spread all over the world, not by size but by strength and power. They call this power the Father of all and believe He alone is responsible for the beginning, growth, changes, and end of everything. They don’t worship any other gods besides Him. This shows that More shared some common beliefs of his time. Still, at the end, he reminds us that he doesn’t agree with all the customs and opinions of the Utopians he describes. We should let him keep this secret and not force him to reveal everything about himself.

He is also ahead of his time when it comes to politics and morals. He wants to make military glory seem unimportant. He wants to give all kinds of lazy people useful jobs, including priests, women, nobles, gentlemen, and even strong, brave beggars, so that everyone works only six hours a day. He doesn’t like the death penalty and wants to reform criminals. He hates priests and lawyers (he jokes that Utopians have very holy priests, so they have very few). He also says that even though people know about dangerous animals and cruel humans, it is hard to find states that are well and wisely governed. These ideas are very different from what people thought back then and even from his own life. In many ways, he sounds modern and even reminds us of Plato.

He cares about public health and believes that civilized countries have a right to use the land of wild, unused places. He thinks happiness comes from good and natural pleasures, and he agrees with other philosophers who say that living a good life means living according to nature. He also expands the idea of happiness to include making others happy, and he cleverly argues, “Everyone agrees we should make others happy; but if we want to make others happy, shouldn’t we want to make ourselves happy even more?”
