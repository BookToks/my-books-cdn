People live in a dark cave with an opening that lets in some light. They have been there since they were kids. Their legs and necks are chained so they can’t move or turn their heads. They can only see straight ahead.

Behind them and above, there is a fire burning far away. Between the fire and the people, there is a path with a low wall like the screen puppet shows use. 

I see.

Do you see men walking along the wall carrying different objects like pots, statues, and animal figures made from wood, stone, and other things? Some are talking, and some are quiet.

You’ve shown me a strange picture, and the people seem like strange prisoners.

They are like us, I said. They only see shadows of themselves or each other on the wall, made by the fire’s light.

That’s right, he said. How could they see anything but shadows if they can’t move their heads?

And would they only see shadows of the things being carried by the men?

Yes, he said.

If they talked to each other, wouldn’t they think the shadows were the real things?

Exactly.

And if the cave made an echo, wouldn’t they think the sounds they heard came from the shadows walking by?
