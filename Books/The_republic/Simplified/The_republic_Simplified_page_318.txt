Yes, he said, this must be done if we want the guardian group to stay pure.

They will take care of feeding the babies and bring the mothers to the group when they have lots of milk. They will make sure that no mother knows her own child. If more help is needed, other wet-nurses can be hired. They will also make sure babies aren’t fed for too long, so the mothers don’t have to get up at night or deal with other troubles. The nurses and helpers will handle all of this.

You think the wives of our guardians will have an easy time when they have children.

Why, I said, and they should. But let’s keep going with our plan. We said parents should be in their prime years, right?

Exactly.

And what is the prime of life? Can it be about twenty years for a woman and thirty for a man?

Which years do you mean?

A woman, I said, can start having children for the State at twenty years old and continue until forty. A man can start at twenty-five, after his strongest years, and keep having children until fifty-five.

Yes, he said, those years are the best for both physical and mental strength in men and women.

Anyone older or younger than those ages who has children in public ceremonies will be seen as doing something wrong. If their child is born, it will have been made in bad circumstances, not with the right prayers and sacrifices that the priests and the whole city offer to make the new generation better and more useful than their parents. Instead, their child will be born from darkness and strange desires.

Very true, he replied.
