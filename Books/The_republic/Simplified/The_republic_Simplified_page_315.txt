I think a lot of questions can be asked about both ideas.

You said that the two questions have to be joined together, I answered. What I meant was that you should accept the usefulness; that way, I thought I could avoid one of the questions, and only the question of possibility would be left.

But that little trick is noticed, so please give a defense for both questions.

Well, I said, I accept my fate. But please let me enjoy thinking about the idea like daydreamers do when they walk alone; before they find any way to make their wishes come true—which they don’t worry about—they don’t want to waste energy thinking about what’s possible. Instead, they act like their wish is already true and happily plan what they will do when it happens. This is a way that doesn’t really help a mind that isn’t good at much. Now I’m starting to lose hope, and if it’s okay with you, I’d like to skip the question of possibility for now. So, assuming the idea can work, I’ll ask how the rulers will make it happen, and I will show that our plan, if done, will be very good for the State and the guardians. First, if you don’t mind, I’ll try with your help to think about the benefits of this idea; then later we can talk about whether it’s possible.

I have no problem with that; go ahead.

First, I think that if our rulers and their helpers want to be worthy of their titles, the people must be willing to obey, and the rulers must have the power to give orders; the guardians themselves must obey the laws, and they must also copy the spirit of the laws in everything they take care of.

That’s right, he said.

You, I said, who make the laws, after you choose the men, will now choose the women for them—and they must be as similar as possible to the men; they will live in shared houses and eat meals together.

None of them will own anything special; they will live and grow up together, and exercise together. So naturally, they will be drawn to be close to each other—it’s not too strong a word to say they will need to be together, right?

Yes, he said; it’s a kind of need not from math, but a different kind of need that lovers know, and it’s much stronger and more convincing for most people.
