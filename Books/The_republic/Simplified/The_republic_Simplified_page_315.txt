 You imply that the two questions must be combined, I replied. Now I meant thatyoushouldadmittheutility;andinthisway,asIthought,Ishouldescape fromoneofthem,andthentherewouldremainonlythepossibility.
 
 Butthatlittleattemptisdetected,andthereforeyouwillpleasetogiveadefence ofboth.
 
 Well, I said, I submit to my fate. Yet grant me a little favour: let me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of feasting themselves when they are walking alone; for before they have discovered any means of effecting their wishes–that is a matter which never troubles them–they would rather not tire themselves by thinking about possibilities; but assuming that whattheydesireisalreadygrantedtothem,theyproceedwiththeirplan,and delightindetailingwhattheymeantodowhentheirwishhascometrue–thatis awaywhichtheyhaveofnotdoingmuchgoodtoacapacitywhichwasnever goodformuch.NowImyselfambeginningtoloseheart,andIshouldlike,with yourpermission,topassoverthequestionofpossibilityatpresent.

 Noneofthemwillhaveanythingspeciallyhisorherown;theywillbetogether, andwillbebroughtuptogether,andwillassociateatgymnasticexercises. And so they will be drawn by a necessity of their natures to have intercourse with eachother–necessityisnottoostrongaword,Ithink?
 
 Yes,hesaid;–necessity,notgeometrical,butanothersortofnecessitywhichlovers know, and which is far more convincing and constraining to the mass of http://www.idph.net 316 IDPH mankind.
