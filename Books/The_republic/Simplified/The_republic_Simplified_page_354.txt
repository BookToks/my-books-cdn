Yes.

Wouldn’t a kid like that, from a young age, be the best at everything, especially if he’s as strong in his body as he is in his mind?

Definitely, he said.

And as he grows up, won’t his friends and people around him want to use him for their own gain?

For sure.

They’ll beg him, honor him, and flatter him because they want to be close to the power he will have one day.

That happens a lot, he said.

So, what will a guy like him do in that situation, especially if he lives in a big, rich city and is tall and handsome? Won’t he start dreaming big, thinking he can control things for everyone, and get full of himself with pride and showy behavior?

Of course he will.

Now, when he’s thinking like this, if someone kindly tells him he’s being foolish and needs to work hard to really understand things, do you think he’ll listen easily?

No way.

And even if someone good or reasonable manages to open his eyes a little and he starts to learn from philosophy, how will his friends act when they think they might lose the benefits they hoped to get from hanging out with him?

Won’t they do everything they can to stop him from getting better and to make his teacher lose power, using secret plans and even public attacks?

There’s no doubt about that.

So how can someone in this kind of situation ever become a true philosopher?

It’s impossible.

So weren’t we right to say that even the very things that make a person a philosopher can, if he’s badly raised, pull him away from philosophy just like money and other so-called good things in life?
