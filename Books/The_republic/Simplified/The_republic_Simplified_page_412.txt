When he has made people calm and obedient, sitting quietly on either side of their ruler, and taught them to know their place, he makes one group focus only on how to turn small amounts of money into bigger amounts. He doesn’t let the other group admire anything except wealth, rich people, or want anything more than getting money and ways to get it.

He said that out of all changes, nothing happens faster or more surely than turning ambitious young people into greedy ones.

I asked, “Is a greedy young person the same as an oligarchical youth?”

“Yes,” he said. “At least, the person they were before is like the State where oligarchy started.”

“Let’s think about whether they are really alike.”

“Good idea.”

“First, do they both care a lot about wealth?”

“Definitely.”

“They also both live cheaply and work hard; the individual only spends on what’s necessary and controls other wants because he thinks they aren’t worth it.”

“True.”

“He’s a stingy guy who saves a bit from everything and builds up his money; ordinary people admire this kind of man. Isn’t he a good example of the State we’re talking about?”

“He seems to be; he values money a lot, just like the State does.”

“You see, he’s not a person who has been well educated,” I said.

“I agree; if he had been educated, he wouldn’t have made money his only goal or given it the highest honor.”

“Exactly! But think about this: because he isn’t educated, he also secretly has low, mean desires like a poor, dishonest person, which he forces himself to control because of his usual way of life.”

“True.”

“Do you know where you have to look if you want to find his dishonest acts?”

“Where should I look?”
