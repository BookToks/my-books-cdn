Shakespeare has taught ushowgreatmenshouldspeakandact;hehasdrawncharactersofawonderfulpurityanddepth;hehasennobledthehumanmind,but,likeHomer(Rep.), he ’has left no way of life.’ The next greatest poet of modern times, Goethe, is concerned with ’a lower degree of truth’; he paints the world as a stage on which’allthemenandwomenaremerelyplayers’;hecultivateslifeasanart, buthefurnishesnoidealsoftruthandaction. Thepoetmayrebelagainstany attempt to set limits to his fancy; and he may argue truly that moralizing in verseisnotpoetry. Possibly,likeMephistophelesinFaust,hemayretaliateon hisadversaries.

 ThevisionofanotherworldisascribedtoEr,thesonofArmenius,whoissaid by Clement of Alexandria to have been Zoroaster. The tale has certainly an oriental character, and may be compared with the pilgrimages of the soul in theZendAvesta(Haug,Avesta). ButnotraceofacquaintancewithZoroasteris found elsewhere in Plato’s writings, and there is no reason for giving him the nameofErthePamphylian.
