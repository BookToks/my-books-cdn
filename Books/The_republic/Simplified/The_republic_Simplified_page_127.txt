Shakespeare has shown us how great people should talk and act. He created characters that are deep and pure. He made the human mind seem noble, but like Homer, he didn’t give us a clear way to live our lives.

The next big poet, Goethe, focuses on a smaller kind of truth. He shows the world like a stage where everyone is just playing a role. He treats life like art, but doesn’t give us clear ideas about what is true or how we should act. 

Poets might fight against anyone trying to limit their imagination. They might say that teaching morals in poems isn’t really poetry. Sometimes, like the character Mephistopheles in Faust, they might fight back against critics. But philosophers still have the right to ask, “How can poetry be used to help people?”

Looking back at Plato, we see a mix of right and wrong ideas in his arguments. He knows it’s silly for people to live their whole lives based on Homer’s stories. He also thinks it’s silly to try to explain myths in a logical way. These ideas were popular in his time, and he made fun of them.

But Plato’s idea that Homer wouldn’t be allowed to wander around begging if he really taught something important is wrong and doesn’t fit with Plato’s own views. This is like some other strange ideas in Plato’s works, such as “No leader was ever unfairly killed by his city” and “No teacher ever cheated their students.”

The idea that the soul lives forever is based on the belief that the soul and body are completely separate. If the soul exists, nothing can destroy it. Bad behavior is the soul’s own problem, and if that can’t destroy the soul, nothing else can either. But Plato admits that the soul can become so covered by the body’s influence that it loses its true shape. In the Timaeus, he even says the body controls the mind so much that people’s actions aren’t really voluntary because they come from physical conditions.

In the Republic and other works, Plato goes back and forth between thinking the soul has to be brought back to its original state and thinking people’s character is shaped by education and training.

The story about another world is told by Er, the son of Armenius, who Clement of Alexandria said was Zoroaster. The story sounds Eastern and is like the soul’s journeys in the Zend Avesta. But there’s no real sign that Plato knew Zoroaster, and there’s no reason to call him Er the Pamphylian. Heracleitus’s philosophy wasn’t taken from Zoroaster, and neither were Plato’s myths.

The way the vision is described is less clear than in Plato’s other works like the Phaedrus and Phaedo.
