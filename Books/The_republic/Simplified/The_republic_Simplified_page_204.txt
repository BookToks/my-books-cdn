We agreed that justice means being good and wise, and injustice means being bad and not knowing better. So, I moved on to another point: Well, I said, Thrasymachus, we’ve settled that part; but didn’t we also say that injustice is strong? Do you remember?

Yes, he said, I remember, but don’t think I agree with what you’re saying or that I don’t have an answer. If I did answer, you’d probably say I was just ranting. So either let me speak freely, or if you want, ask me questions and I’ll answer with a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no.’

Definitely not, I said, if that’s not what you really think.

Okay, he said, I’ll do it to please you since you won’t let me talk. What else do you want?

Nothing at all, I said; if you’re ready, I’ll ask and you can answer.

Go ahead.

Then I’ll repeat the question I asked before, so we can keep talking about whether justice or injustice is stronger.

Someone said injustice is stronger and more powerful than justice, but now that justice is linked to being wise and good, it’s clear justice is stronger than injustice, if injustice means being ignorant. No one can argue with that. But I want to look at this another way, Thrasymachus: You wouldn’t deny that sometimes a country can be unfair and try to control other countries, or already has controlled many of them, right?

True, he said; and I’ll add that the most unfair and powerful country probably does this the most.

I know, I said, that’s what you believe; but I want to think about whether the power held by the stronger country can exist or work without justice, or only with justice.

If you’re right and justice is wisdom, then only with justice; but if I’m right, then it can happen without justice.

I’m happy, Thrasymachus, to see you not just agreeing or disagreeing, but giving really good answers.

That’s just being polite to you, he said.

You’re very kind, I said; and would you also tell me whether you think a country, or an army, or a group of robbers or thieves, or any other group of bad people could work at all if they hurt each other?
