It meant that you should do what is right, help your friends, and hurt your enemies. Every action affects someone, so Socrates asks, what exactly does justice do, and to whom? He answers that justice helps friends and harms enemies. But how does it do this? By making friends through alliances and fighting against enemies in war.

In times of peace, what is the use of justice? Justice helps in making agreements or contracts, like money partnerships. But why is the just person more useful in these deals? Because you want your money kept safe and not stolen. So, justice is helpful when money alone isn’t enough.

There’s another problem: justice, like the skill of war or any other art, has two sides—it must be good at both attacking and defending, stealing as well as protecting.

But if justice involves stealing, doesn’t that make it a thief? Yes, but a heroic one, like Autolycus from Homer’s stories, who was the best thief and liar. Still, the stealing must be for helping friends and hurting enemies.

This raises another question: Are friends and enemies real or just seem to be? Should we only help good friends and harm bad enemies? The answer is that we should help both real and seeming good friends and harm real and seeming bad enemies—in other words, do good to good people and evil to evil people.

But should we ever return evil for evil, if that only makes people worse? Can justice cause injustice any more than horse training can make bad riders, or heat can create cold?

In the end, no wise person or poet ever said that justice means returning evil for evil. This idea came from some powerful men long ago.

So, the first simple idea of morality isn’t enough for today’s needs. Poets’ authority is set aside, and through careful thinking, we get closer to the Christian idea of forgiving those who hurt us. A similar idea comes from a Persian poet who asks, “If you punish me for doing evil by doing evil yourself, what’s the difference between you and me?”

Both Plato and this poet go beyond many Christian teachers. The first idea of justice—“to speak the truth and pay your debts”—easily changes into the more complex idea of “doing good to friends and harm to enemies.” Both ideas give enough guidance for normal people but don’t fully satisfy philosophy.

We also see that moral questions have been around for a long time. They arise because rules can conflict in certain cases, and because people try to understand them better. Questioning moral ideas and referring to Homer’s authority, then deciding that “Do good to friends and harm to enemies” is wrong, are typical of Socrates’ way of thinking.
