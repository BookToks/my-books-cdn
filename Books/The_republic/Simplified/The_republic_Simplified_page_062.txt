People who love wine and people who love power want the things they care about in every way. But what does that really mean? A philosopher is someone who loves knowledge in every form and is always curious. 

But does being curious make someone a philosopher? What about people who love sights and sounds and enjoy music at festivals? Are they philosophers? No, they are just pretending. 

So, how do we describe a true philosopher? A true philosopher understands abstract ideas like justice, beauty, good, and evil. These ideas are one, but they show up in many different ways. People who understand these real ideas are philosophers. Others only hear sounds, see colors, and know how to use them in art, but they don’t understand true justice, beauty, or truth. They only have opinions, not real knowledge, and what they see is like a dream.

Maybe someone who only has opinions will be upset by this. Can we explain it without hurting their feelings? We can say that if they have knowledge, that’s great. But real knowledge is about things that really exist, while ignorance is about things that don’t. There’s also a third thing that both exists and doesn’t exist at the same time, which is just opinion. 

Opinion and knowledge are different because they focus on different things. Knowledge is about what is real and never wrong, while opinion can be mistaken. If real things are what knowledge is about and non-real things are what ignorance is about, opinion is somewhere in the middle. Opinion is sometimes true and sometimes false.

Now, I would ask my friend who says there is no true beauty or justice, only many beautiful or just things, if everything he sees isn’t sometimes different from different points of view—like beautiful and ugly, good and bad, just and unjust. Aren’t these pairs also connected? Heavy and light depend on each other too. Everything both is and isn’t, like in an old riddle—“A man and not a man, shot and didn’t shoot, bird and not a bird, stone and not a stone.” The mind can’t decide between these options. These unclear and mixed things, which move between being and not being, are what opinion deals with. Real knowledge deals with unchanging things. 

Someone who only lives in the world of senses and has only uncertain ideas is not a philosopher but just loves opinions.

The fifth book starts a new part of the Republic, where shared property and family are kept, and we move toward a kingdom ruled by philosophers. Plato had been getting ready for this in some small ideas in Book IV, which the readers might not have noticed at first, just like Glaucon and Adeimantus didn’t.
