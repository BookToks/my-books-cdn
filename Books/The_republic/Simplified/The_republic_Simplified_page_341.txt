That's right.

People who see many beautiful things but don’t understand true beauty, and can’t follow someone who shows the way to it; who see many fair things but not perfect fairness—these people have opinions but not real knowledge.

That’s true.

But those who see what is absolute, eternal, and unchanging can be said to truly know, not just have opinions.

That can’t be denied.

One group loves and focuses on things based on knowledge, while the other loves things based on opinion. The second group, as you might remember, listens to sweet sounds and looks at pretty colors but refuses to believe in true, perfect beauty.

Yes, I remember.

So, is it wrong to call them lovers of opinion instead of lovers of wisdom? Will they get upset if we say that?

I will tell them not to be upset; no one should be angry about the truth.

Those who love the truth in everything should be called lovers of wisdom, not lovers of opinion.

Definitely.
