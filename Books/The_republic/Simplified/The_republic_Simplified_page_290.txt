Also, we said that justice means minding your own business and not getting involved in other people’s stuff. We kept saying this, and many others have said the same to us.

Yes, we did.

So, doing your own business in a certain way can be seen as justice.

Can you tell me how I came to this idea?

I don’t know, but I want to find out.

Because I think this is the only good quality left in the State when you take away the others like self-control, bravery, and wisdom. This one is the main reason all the others exist, and it helps keep them going. We said that if we found the first three, justice would be the fourth one left.

That makes sense.

If we have to decide which of these four qualities helps the State the most—whether it’s the agreement between rulers and people, the soldiers’ respect for the law about dangers, the wisdom and care of the rulers, or the one I’m talking about, which is found in kids and women, slaves and free people, workers, rulers, and subjects—the quality of everyone doing their own job and not interfering—then it’s not easy to say which is the best.

Sure, he said, it would be hard to say.

So, the power of each person in the State to do their own work competes with the other political virtues like wisdom, self-control, and courage.

Yes, he said.

And the virtue that takes part in this competition is justice?

Exactly.

Let’s look at it another way: Aren’t the rulers in a State the ones you trust to decide legal cases?

Yes.

And are cases decided on any other principle than a man not taking what belongs to someone else or losing what is his?

No, that is the basic rule.

Which is a just rule?
