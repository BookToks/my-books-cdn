Well, that’s very likely. But how does this idea apply to philosophy students?

Here’s how: you know there are certain rules about justice and honor that we learn as kids. We grow up following and respecting these rules because our parents taught us to.

That’s true.

There are also other ideas about pleasure that seem fun and attractive, but they don’t affect people who understand what’s right. Those people keep following the rules their parents taught them.

True.

Now, when someone like this is asked what is fair or honorable, they answer based on what they were taught. But then, many different arguments come along and challenge their answers until they start to believe that nothing is honorable or just anymore—that everything is mixed up.

Do you think they will still respect and follow the old rules?

No way.

When they stop believing those rules are honorable and natural, and they can’t find what’s truly right, can they be expected to live any other way than following what feels good to them?

No, they can’t.

And so, they go from being law-abiding to breaking the law?

Absolutely.

This is very natural for philosophy students like I described, and, as I said, it’s mostly understandable.

Yes, he said; and I might add, sad too.

So, to avoid feeling sorry for our citizens who are now thirty years old, we must be very careful when introducing them to philosophical debate.

Definitely.

There’s a risk they might start enjoying it too early; because, as you’ve probably noticed, young people who first get interested in arguing do it just for fun. They always try to contradict and prove others wrong, copying those who challenge them. Like puppies, they enjoy pulling and tearing at anyone who comes near them.
