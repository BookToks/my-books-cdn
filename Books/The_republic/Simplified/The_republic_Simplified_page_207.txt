True.

Can we say that this is the end of a pruning hook?

Maybe.

Now, I think you will understand what I meant when I asked if the end of something is what can’t be done, or can’t be done well, by anything else.

I understand, he said, and I agree.

And the thing that an end fails to reach also has something good about it? Should I ask again if the eye has an end?

It does.

And doesn’t the eye have something good about it?

Yes.

And does the ear have an end and something good too?

True.

And the same is true for everything else; each has an end and a special good quality?

That’s right.

Well, can the eyes do their job if they don’t have their own good quality and have a problem instead?

How can they, he said, if they are blind and can’t see?

You mean if they lost their good quality, which is sight; but I’m not there yet. I want to ask more generally if things that reach their ends do it because of their own good qualities, and fail if they have defects?

Definitely, he replied.

I might say the same about ears; if they lose their good quality, they can’t do their job.

True.

And the same will be true for everything else?

I agree.

Well, doesn’t the soul have an end that nothing else can reach?
