We know that no one is perfect, but that doesn’t mean people always have bad reasons for what they do. Thinking that everyone is as bad as the worst person is a silly and wrong idea. This kind of thinking doesn’t show how a country really works, which is based on a general feeling of what’s right that grows and changes through habits and laws. It also doesn’t explain how society started, which comes from family and people’s social and religious feelings. People aren’t just bad; they also have good sides that balance things out.

As people get better and wiser, they see these negative ideas as less true because they understand that most people aren’t selfish all the time. A little experience might make someone doubt others, but a lot of experience usually helps them see a more honest and kind view of themselves and others.

The two brothers ask Socrates to prove that being fair and just makes someone happy, even if they don’t have the usual things people think bring happiness. It’s not crazy to think about justice without all the usual stuff around it. Perfect ideas about justice might seem strange compared to real life. The Stoics and Christians had ideas like this too—they aren’t exactly true, but they can help teach people and inspire them. Just because no one has ever lived perfectly doesn’t mean the idea is bad.

Some rare people, who are better than most, might find this perfect kind of happiness even in tough times or suffering. This is the kind of life that reason says is best, and even people who care mostly about usefulness or morals might choose it in some cases.

Also, we shouldn’t forget that Plato, while agreeing with the brothers’ thoughts, isn’t giving his final answer. He’s showing one part of the truth about right and wrong. He builds his ideas step by step through different situations.

This is the first time Socrates is shown being questioned in the way he questions others. The word “happiness” can be confusing because today it often means feeling pleasure or satisfaction, but that’s not exactly what Plato meant.

Glaucon described how being just can seem miserable while being unjust can seem happy. Later, in Book IX, this is answered by showing how tyrants are actually miserable too. Still, unjust people try to seem just—that’s how bad behavior “respects” good behavior. Then Adeimantus, following Glaucon’s idea, explains that most people think justice is only important because of rewards and reputation. This helps explain why arguments like those from Thrasymachus and Glaucon seem strong, based on what most people believe about right and wrong.
