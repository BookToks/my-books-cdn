Here is the story Socrates told about what justice really is and where it comes from.

Imagine if both a just person and an unjust person were given the power to do whatever they wanted. Let’s watch what they would do. We would see that both would follow their own desires, which everyone thinks are good for them. They would only act just because the law forces them to. This power we’re talking about is like the one Gyges, a man from old stories, is said to have had.

The story goes that Gyges was a shepherd working for the king of Lydia. One day, there was a big storm and an earthquake made a hole in the ground where he was with his sheep. Curious, he went down into the hole and found amazing things. Inside, he saw a hollow bronze horse with doors. When he looked inside, he saw a dead man who looked more than human. The dead man was wearing only a gold ring. Gyges took the ring and went back up.

Later, when Gyges was with other shepherds, he turned the ring in his hand and suddenly became invisible to everyone else. When he turned the ring the other way, he became visible again. He tried this many times and it always worked. Using this power, he became a messenger to the king’s court. Once there, he tricked the queen, helped kill the king, and took over the kingdom.

Now imagine there were two magic rings like this—one for a just person and one for an unjust person. No one could be so strong in their morals that they would stay just. No one would stop themselves from taking whatever they wanted if they could do it without getting caught. They would do whatever they pleased, like stealing, lying with anyone, or even killing, and feel like a god.

In the end, the actions of the just and unjust people would be the same. This shows that people are just not because they want to be or because they think it’s good for them, but because they have to be. Whenever someone thinks they can get away with being unjust, they will be unjust. Everyone secretly believes being unfair is more profitable than being fair, and that’s why they act the way they do.

If someone had this power to be invisible and never did anything wrong or took what wasn’t theirs, others would think that person was a total fool. Even if they said nice things to his face, they would only do it because they were afraid of being treated unfairly themselves.
