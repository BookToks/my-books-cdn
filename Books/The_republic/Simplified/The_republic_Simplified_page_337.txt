Nothing can be more certain.

Okay. But if there is something that can both exist and not exist, would it be somewhere between pure existence and total non-existence?

Yes, it would be in between.

Since knowing is connected to existing, and not knowing is connected to not existing, there must also be something in between knowledge and ignorance, if such a thing exists?

Definitely.

Do we accept that opinions exist?

Of course.

Are opinions the same as knowledge, or something different?

Something different.

So, opinions and knowledge are connected to different kinds of stuff because they come from different abilities?

Yes.

And knowledge is about existing things and understands them. But before I go on, I will make a division.

What division?

I will start by grouping abilities on their own: they are powers in us and in other things that make us act the way we do. For example, sight and hearing are abilities. Do you understand what kind of group I mean?

Yes, I understand.

Then I will tell you what I think about them. I can’t see these abilities, so things like shape and color, which help me tell things apart, don’t apply to them. When I talk about an ability, I only think about what it does and what it affects; if two abilities do the same thing and affect the same area, I call them the same ability. But if they do different things or affect different areas, I call them different. Would you agree with that?

Yes.

And will you please answer one more question?
