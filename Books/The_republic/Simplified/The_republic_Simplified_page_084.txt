When training young dogs for war, at first they should only taste blood. But after two or three years of exercise and rest, the training of their soul becomes more important.

At twenty years old, the best students are chosen to start a new stage of learning. The subjects they studied before, in bits and pieces, will now be connected to each other and to what is real. Being able to combine these ideas shows how good they are at thinking deeply. Then at thirty, another choice is made to find those who can leave the world of senses and focus on ideas.

But at this point, based on what we see now, there is a risk that thinking too much about ideas can cause problems. Imagine someone who grew up rich and surrounded by people who always praised him. One day he is told he is not really the son of his parents. He used to respect his parents and ignore the flatterers, but now he does the opposite. This is like what happens with a person’s beliefs. There are ideas they learned at home that felt very important. But then someone comes and questions those ideas, asking “What is really good and fair?” or tries to prove that what they thought was good is actually bad, and their mind gets confused. They stop loving and respecting their old beliefs. They might give up and live only for fun, becoming careless and dishonest.

People who get lost like this are sad cases. To protect our students when they are thirty, we must be careful not to let young people study philosophy too early. A young person is like a puppy who just plays with ideas and changes his mind every day. Soon, he stops believing anything and makes both himself and philosophy look bad. But a thirty-year-old won’t do this. He will argue well, not just disagree, and will honor philosophy with how seriously he lives.

How long should this second training of the soul take? Maybe six or five years starting at thirty, twice as long as the body’s training. Then for fifteen years, the student should live in the real world, lead others, and gain life experience.

At fifty, he should come back to thinking about the biggest questions, focusing on what is good, and live his life following those ideas. If needed, he should take part in running the state and teaching others to lead after him. When his time ends, he will leave peacefully and be honored like heroes of old, receiving respect like the great oracles.

“You are like a sculptor, Socrates, making perfect images of our leaders.” Yes, and of our leaders who are women too, because women will share everything with men. You will agree that our state is not just a dream but could really happen when philosopher-kings arise. These rulers will ignore worldly pleasures and serve only justice. “But how will they start their work?”
