To those who aren’t rich and don’t want to wait until they’re old, the same answer applies: old age isn’t a light burden for a poor person, and a rich person who is unhappy will never find peace.

May I ask, Cephalus, did you mostly inherit your wealth or earn it yourself?

I earned it! Socrates, do you want to know how much I earned? When it comes to making money, I’m in between my father and grandfather. My grandfather, whose name I share, doubled and tripled what he inherited, which is about what I have now. But my father, Lysanias, lost some of it. I’ll be happy if I leave my sons a little more than I got.

That’s why I asked you, I said, because you seem not to care much about money. That’s usually true for people who inherit their wealth, not for those who earn it. People who make money often love it like authors love their poems or parents love their kids, besides just wanting it for use or profit like everyone else. That’s why they’re bad company—they only talk about how great money is.

That’s true, he said.

Yes, that’s very true, but can I ask you another question? What do you think is the greatest good your wealth has given you?

One thing, he said, that’s hard to convince others about. Let me tell you, Socrates, when a man thinks he’s close to dying, he feels fears and worries he never had before. The stories about the afterlife and the punishments for wrongs done here used to be jokes to him, but now he’s troubled thinking they might be true. Maybe because of old age or because he’s closer to death, he sees these things more clearly. He starts to worry and think about the wrongs he’s done to others. When he realizes how many mistakes he’s made, he wakes up scared like a child and feels bad about it. But someone who knows they have done no wrong feels a sweet hope, as Pindar beautifully said: ‘Hope takes care of the soul of the just and holy man in his old age, and is the greatest comfort for his restless soul.’ How amazing are his words!
