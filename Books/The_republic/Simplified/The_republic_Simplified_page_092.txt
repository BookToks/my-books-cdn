But corruption has sneaked into philosophy, and being simple and honest, which used to be its main trait, is now mostly found only in the military. Fighting skills are becoming more important than peaceful arts; the leader is no longer a deep thinker. In oligarchies, people care mostly about getting rich—taking from others to save themselves is their rule. They hide their gold and silver in secret places to use for their women and others. They enjoy themselves in secret, like kids running away from their strict dad—the law. Their education isn’t inspired by art or wisdom but forced by those in power. The main thing about this State is that everyone is focused on their own group and wanting power.

What kind of person fits in such a State? Adeimantus said, “He will be like our friend Glaucon, who loves to argue.” Maybe in that way, but not in all ways. He is bossy and badly educated but likes literature, even though he can’t speak well. He is harsh with slaves but listens to rulers. He loves power and honor and hopes to get them by doing farming deeds. He also likes sports and hunting. As he gets older, he becomes greedy because he has lost philosophy, which is the only thing that can save and protect people. Here is where he comes from: his father is a good man living in a bad State who left politics to live quietly. His mother is angry because she has lost respect among other women and complains about her husband’s selfishness. She tells her son that his father is lazy and not manly. The old family servant joins in and tells the boy, “When you grow up, you must be more of a man than your father.” Everyone agrees that minding your own business is stupid, while being involved and busy is respected. The young man thinks about this and compares it with his father’s words and ways. Because he is naturally good, even though he has been influenced badly, he finds a middle way and becomes ambitious and loves honor.

Now let’s look at another city and another kind of man. The next government is an oligarchy, where only the rich rule. It’s easy to see how this kind of State starts. It begins when people get gold and silver; illegal spending appears; they borrow from each other, and many catch the same greed. Riches become more important than goodness. People who love money replace those who love honor. Politicians become greedy. Over time, laws give political rights only to the rich, who don’t hesitate to use violence to get what they want.

That’s the origin of oligarchy. Now let’s think about its problems. Would a man who wants to be safe on a trip pick a bad captain just because he is rich, or refuse a good one just because he is poor? This idea fits even better for a whole country. There are worse problems: two groups fight inside one nation—the rich and the poor. The rich won’t let the poor have weapons, and they don’t want to pay for soldiers to protect themselves with their own money.
