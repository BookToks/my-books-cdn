People have made this question way too important, both a long time ago and today. There is a stage when critics call everything, whether from nature or art, a “design.” In old writings, and in literature in general, there are often parts that didn’t fit the original plan. The story or idea grows while the author is writing; new thoughts come up as he writes; he hasn’t worked out everything before he starts. Readers who want to find one big idea that explains the whole work have to focus on the most vague and general parts. For example, Stallbaum didn’t like the usual ideas about the Republic’s argument, so he thought he found the “true argument” in how it shows human life in a perfect, just State ruled by the idea of good. These broad descriptions can help a little, but they don’t really show the writer’s full plan. The truth is, it’s just as easy to talk about many plans as about one. Nothing has to be left out from a big work’s plan if the ideas naturally connect and don’t mess up the main goal.

The kind and level of unity needed in a building, a sculpture, a poem, or prose depends on the subject. Even Plato himself wouldn’t really understand the question, “What was the writer’s intention?” or “What was the main argument of the Republic?” So it’s better to ignore that question (see the Introduction to the Phaedrus).

Isn’t the Republic a way to share three or four big truths that Plato thought were best shown through the idea of a State? Like Jewish prophets who use images like the Messiah or “the day of the Lord” to share big spiritual ideas, Plato uses the Greek State to show his thoughts about divine perfection, which is the idea of good—like the sun in the visible world—and about human perfection, which is justice. He talks about education starting when we’re young and continuing later, about poets, sophists, and tyrants who are false teachers and bad rulers, about “the world” which shows these ideas, and about a kingdom that doesn’t exist on earth but is kept in heaven as a model for human life. No inspired work is perfectly united, just like clouds are not perfectly clear when the sun shines through them. Every shade of light and dark, truth and fiction, which hides the truth, is allowed in a work of philosophical imagination. It doesn’t stay on the same level; it easily moves from ideas to myths and fantasies, from facts to figures of speech.

The Republic is not just prose but mostly poetry, and shouldn’t be judged by logic or how likely its history is. The writer isn’t shaping his ideas into a perfect artwork; the ideas take over him and are too much for him to control.
