We can’t do that.

The first thing we should do is control the stories written by fiction writers. Let the censors read every story and only approve the good ones, rejecting the bad ones. We want mothers and nurses to tell kids only the approved stories. They should shape children’s minds with these stories, just like they take care of their bodies. But most of the stories people tell now should be thrown away.

“What stories are you talking about?” he asked.

“You can find a smaller version of the bad ones inside the better ones,” I said. “They’re basically the same kind, and have the same spirit.”

“Maybe,” he said, “but I don’t yet know which ones you mean by ‘better.’”

“The better ones are the stories told by Homer and Hesiod, and the other great poets who have always been the best storytellers,” I explained.

“But which stories do you mean, and what’s wrong with them?” he asked.

“The problem is a serious one,” I said. “They tell lies, and bad lies at that.”

“When do they lie?” he asked.

“Whenever they give a wrong picture of what gods and heroes are really like—like when a painter makes a portrait that doesn’t look anything like the person,” I explained.

“Yes, that’s definitely wrong,” he agreed. “But which stories are you talking about?”

“First of all,” I said, “there’s the biggest lie told by the poet about Uranus, and what Hesiod says Uranus did, and how Cronus got back at him. The actions of Cronus and the suffering his son caused him, even if true, shouldn’t be told lightly to young and careless people. If they have to be mentioned, only a few chosen people should hear them, and only in secret. They should sacrifice not a common pig but a huge and rare animal, so very few will hear these stories.”

“Yes,” I said, “those stories are really bad.”

“Exactly, Adeimantus,” he said, “those stories shouldn’t be told in our city. Young people shouldn’t be told that committing the worst crimes isn’t a big deal, or that if they punish their father for doing wrong, they’re just following the example of the greatest god.”
