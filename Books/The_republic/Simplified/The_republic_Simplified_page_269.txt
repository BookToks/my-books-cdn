Yes.

So, do young people need to be smart and careful when it comes to taking care of their country?

True.

And a person will probably care most about what they love, right?

Definitely.

And they will most likely love what they think shares the same interests as them, and what they believe will affect their own good or bad luck the most?

Very true, he answered.

Then we have to choose. Let’s find among the guardians those who, all their lives, are the most eager to do what’s best for their country and the most against doing anything that hurts it.

Those are the right people.

And we have to watch them at every age to make sure they keep their promise and never, because of pressure or tricks, forget or drop their duty to the State.

Drop it? he asked.

I will explain, I said. A promise can leave a person’s mind either by choice or not; by choice when they stop believing something wrong and learn better, or against their will when they lose a truth.

I get the willing loss of a promise; I don’t yet understand the unwilling one.

Well, I said, don’t you see that people lose good things without wanting to, and lose bad things on purpose? Losing the truth is bad, and having the truth is good. And you would agree that to understand things as they really are means to have the truth?

Yes, he answered; I agree that people lose the truth against their will.

And isn’t this unwanted losing caused by theft, force, or trickery?

Still, he said, I don’t get you.

I’m afraid I have been talking too confusingly, like in sad plays.
