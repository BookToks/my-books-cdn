Of course.

And he, the protector we talked about, is not just a big guy taking up space, but someone who has defeated many enemies. He stands in charge, holding all the power, no longer a protector but a total ruler.

No doubt, he said.

Now let’s think about the happiness of this man and also the country where someone like him comes from.

Yes, he said, let’s think about that.

At first, when he just got power, he is happy and friendly. He greets everyone he meets. People call him a tyrant, but he makes promises both in public and in private—freeing people from debt, giving land to followers, and trying to be kind and good to everyone!

Of course, he said.

But after he defeats foreign enemies by war or deals, and there is no fear from them, he always starts some new war. This way, people still need a leader.

To be sure.

Doesn’t he also want to make people poor by making them pay taxes? That way, they have to focus on their daily problems and won’t plan against him.

Clearly.

If he thinks anyone wants freedom and might fight his power, he finds a reason to get rid of them by sending them into danger. So, the tyrant must always start a war.

He must.

Now, people begin to dislike him.

This is normal.

Some of the people who helped him get power and are still in charge start to speak out. The braver ones tell him what they think about what’s happening.

Yes, that’s to be expected.

And the tyrant, if he wants to stay in control, has to get rid of them. He can’t keep friends or enemies who are useful to anyone.
