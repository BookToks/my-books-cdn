They are called ’states,’ but not just one state – they are many in one. In every state, there are two groups that don’t get along: the rich and the poor, and you can set them against each other.

But our State, as long as it stays true to its principles, will actually be the strongest of all the Greek states.

There’s no limit to how big a state can be, as long as it stays united. It shouldn’t be too big or too small to be one. This is less important than the idea that everyone should do what they’re best suited for, like the story about the earthborn men. The message was that if each person does their part and is true to themselves, then the whole city will be united. But all this is secondary compared to education, which is the most important thing.

Once education starts, it keeps getting better. Each generation improves on the last, both in body and mind. Leaders should make sure music and exercise don’t change too much. Damon said, “Change a country’s music, and soon you’ll change its laws.” Changes might seem harmless at first, starting as fun, but they can cause serious problems. They quietly affect people’s characters, then social and business relationships, and finally the whole system of the state. This leads to ruin and confusion everywhere. But if education stays the same, there’s no danger. There will always be a process to fix what falls apart, and the spirit of law and order will rebuild what is broken. Then, there won’t be a need for rules about small things like how people should behave or dress.

Good people attract good people, and bad people attract bad people. Education will fix problems and teach people to govern themselves. We won’t go into the details of making laws; let the leaders focus on education, and education will handle everything else.

Without education, leaders can try to fix things as much as they want, but they won’t make progress—just like a sick person who tries to heal with a favorite remedy but won’t change their bad habits. If you tell those people they need to change, they get angry. They seem nice, but actually, they’re the opposite. These people and states that act like them aren’t on your side. Some states even say that no one can change the constitution under penalty of death, but then they allow themselves to be fooled and changed easily. The person who flatters them becomes their leader and “savior.” The people are just as bad as the states. But do you admire how clever they are? No, some are dumb enough to believe whatever people tell them. If everyone says a man is six feet tall and he has no way to check, how can he believe anything else? But don’t get angry. Watching our leaders try their tricks and think they can quickly solve the many problems of people is like watching a play. Making lots of small rules isn’t needed in good states, and it doesn’t help in bad ones.

And now, what’s left to do in making laws?
