This is the end of his passions and desires.

Exactly.

When these kinds of men are just private people and don’t have power yet, this is how they act. They only hang out with people who flatter them or are useful to them. If they want something from someone, they are ready to bow down to that person. They act like they really like them, but once they get what they want, they forget about them.

Yes, that’s true.

They are always either the boss or the servant, never real friends to anyone. A tyrant never knows true freedom or friendship.

Definitely not.

And can’t we call such men treacherous?

No doubt about it.

They are also totally unfair, if our idea of justice is right?

Yes, that’s correct.

So, to sum it up in one word, I said, the worst man is the real-life version of what we only dreamed about.

Very true.

And this is the kind of person who is naturally a tyrant and the longer he lives, the more like a tyrant he becomes.

That’s for sure, said Glaucon, answering.

And won’t the worst, most wicked man also be the most miserable? The one who has been a tyrant the longest and most truly miserable, even if most people don’t think so?

Yes, he said, definitely.

And shouldn’t the tyrant be like the tyrannical state, and the democratic man like the democratic state; and the same for the others?

Of course.

And just like states differ in virtue and happiness, so do people in relation to other people?

For sure.

Then, when we compare our original city, which was like a kingdom, and the city ruled by a tyrant, how do they compare in virtue?
