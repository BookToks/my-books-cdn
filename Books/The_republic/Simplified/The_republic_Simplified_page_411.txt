Okay, so I asked, in places ruled by a few rich people, don’t you find lots of poor people?

Yes, he said; almost everyone is poor except the rulers.

And can we also say that there are many criminals there, sneaky people who get caught and are kept under control by the authorities?

Definitely, we can say that.

Is the reason for this because people aren’t educated well, trained badly, and because the government is bad?

That’s right.

So, that’s what oligarchy is like and those are some of its problems; there might be even more problems too.

Very likely.

Then, since oligarchy is a government where leaders are chosen for their wealth, let’s stop talking about it now. Let’s move on to talk about the kind of person who lives under this government.

Sure.

Does a person from a timocracy turn into an oligarch like this?

How so?

There comes a time when the son of a man from a timocracy starts out copying his father and following his path. But soon, he sees his father suddenly fail against the government, like a ship hitting a hidden rock, and he loses everything. His father might have been a general or a high officer who gets put on trial because of lies told by others, and he is either killed, sent away, loses his citizenship rights, and has all his money taken.

That sounds very likely.

The son has seen all this and knows what happened. He is ruined and scared. Because of that, he pushes down his ambition and strong feelings. Poor and humble, he focuses on making money by saving carefully and working hard. Isn’t it likely that a person like this will let greed and desire take over inside him and become obsessed with money and power, acting like a king in his mind?

Most true, he answered.
