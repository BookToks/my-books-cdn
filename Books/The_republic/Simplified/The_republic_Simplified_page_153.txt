He has stopped believing that people can’t learn to be good. He also thinks that all virtues, or good qualities, are connected and not separate things. He accepts that the world we see and feel has some truth in it. He doesn’t say that people do bad things without meaning to, which he did say in some other works. He doesn’t believe that ideas come from a past life, but he still thinks that real knowledge comes from inside us, not just from what we see or hear.

He says education helps us think better, like having a superpower better than many eyes. He still believes that all virtues are connected and that knowing what is right is the key to being good. Justice is the most important virtue. He also thinks that the best kind of goodness comes from thinking about what is truly good.

The world we experience with our senses is seen as less real and just opinions, but it is like a shadow of the real world. In his book, The Republic, he believes people do bad things because they don’t know better, and education can fix that. Most people aren’t fully responsible for their actions because they don’t understand them.

There is a small mention of the idea that learning is remembering from before birth, but Plato doesn’t really connect education to past lives. He thinks education is about bringing out what is already inside the mind. He compares education to turning the soul’s eye towards the light, not just filling a bucket with water.

He talks first about music and stories, which can be true or false, then about physical training. In The Republic, he doesn’t talk about babies, but in another work, Laws, he gives advice about caring for babies and mothers, saying education starts even before birth. In The Republic, he starts education when a child can understand ideas. He says, in a way that sounds strange today, that children should learn some false things before they learn the truth.

Modern and ancient thinkers don’t agree on what truth and falsehood mean. Today, we think of truth mostly as facts, but Plato thought of truth as ideas. This is a difference in how we use words. We also know children have to learn things they don’t fully get yet and sometimes hear stories that aren’t completely true. But we try to limit these stories to what’s necessary. Plato would see this differently. For him, early education isn’t about facts but about teaching basic truths. Children should first learn simple religious ideas, then simple moral lessons, and slowly learn good manners and taste.
