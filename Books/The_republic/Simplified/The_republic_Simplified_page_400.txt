You’re like a sculptor, Socrates, and you’ve made statues of our rulers that look perfectly beautiful.

Yes, I said, Glaucon, and of our female rulers too; you shouldn’t think that what I’ve been saying applies only to men and not to women, as far as their nature allows.

You’re right, he said, since we’ve made women share everything just like men.

Well, I said, and you would agree (right?) that what we said about the State and government isn’t just a dream. It’s hard but possible, only if true philosopher kings are born in a State. These kings don’t care about the honors of this world, which they think are low and worthless. They care most about doing what’s right and the honor that comes from being right. They see justice as the most important thing, and they serve it. They will raise the city’s rules when they take charge.

How will they do it?

They will start by sending away all the city’s people who are older than ten years old and take care of their children. These kids won’t be influenced by their parents’ habits. Instead, they will be trained in the city’s rules and ways, the laws we’ve given them. This way, the State and government we talked about will reach happiness fastest. The nation with this kind of government will gain the most.

Yes, that’s the best way. And I think, Socrates, you have explained very well how such a government could ever come true.

Enough about the perfect State and the man who represents it—there’s no problem in describing him.

There’s no problem, he replied; and I agree that nothing more needs to be said.

And so, Glaucon, we’ve reached the idea that in the perfect State, wives and children are shared by everyone; all education and activities of war and peace are shared too, and the best philosophers and bravest warriors will be their kings?
