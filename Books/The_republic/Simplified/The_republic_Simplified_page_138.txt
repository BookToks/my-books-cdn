But these ideas did not match real life. Athenian women were not equal to their husbands. They were not the people who entertained guests or managed the house; they were only the housekeepers and mothers of the children. They did not take part in war or politics. Also, in later Greek times, no woman became famous for writing. The historian said the best woman is “the one who is least known by men.”

Plato had a very different idea of what a woman should be. He thought women should be partners with men, sharing the hard work of war and running the government. Women should train their bodies and minds just like men. They should try to lose the usual traits of motherhood and being female.

People who disagree with equal rights for men and women say the differences are bigger than what Plato thought. They believe women are more sensitive, gentle, and graceful, while men are more energetic, strong, and smarter. This is partly true. The differences affect everything about men and women, not just one part. But we don’t really know how much of these differences come from how people are raised or from biology. Women have always been taught that they are not slaves, but they are in a lower position, which is supposed to have some benefits. They have accepted this. Also, the body can change over generations because of lifestyle; what was once just an idea, like women being weak, can become a real physical fact.

The traits of men and women differ a lot in different countries, social classes, and even at different ages in the same person. Plato might have been right to say the only real difference between men and women is the one animals have. Other differences might disappear in different societies or with different education and experiences.

After the first big idea, we move to the second one—sharing wives and children. Is this possible? Is it a good idea? Glaucon, another thinker, and many others doubt both. It’s hard to talk freely about these questions, and maybe people are right not to question the basic parts of society too much. Most of us can’t safely explore things that nature keeps secret, just like we can’t dissect our own bodies. Still, we should look at how Plato came to his ideas. As Mr. Grote said, it’s strange that one of the wisest men could have moral ideas so different from ours. To understand Plato well, we must carefully study what he suggested.
