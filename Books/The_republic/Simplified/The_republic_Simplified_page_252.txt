That’s totally true, he said.

Don’t the two styles, or even a mix of them, cover all kinds of poetry and ways to express things with words? Nobody can say anything except by using one style, the other, or both together.

They include everything, he said.

So, should we accept all three styles in our State, or only one of the two pure styles? Or maybe the mixed one?

I’d rather only allow the pure imitator of virtue.

Yes, I said, Adeimantus, but the mixed style is also really appealing. Actually, the pantomime style, which is the opposite of the one you like, is the most popular with kids, their caretakers, and most people in general.

I don’t deny that.

But I guess you’d say that style doesn’t fit our State, where people aren’t many things at once, since one person only plays one role?

Yes, that’s totally unsuitable.

And that’s why in our State, and only in our State, a shoemaker will be just a shoemaker and not a ship captain too, a farmer will only be a farmer and not a gambler, a soldier will be only a soldier and not a trader, and this goes for everyone?

True, he said.

So when one of those pantomime performers, who are so good at copying anything, comes to us and wants to show off their poetry, we’ll admire them like they’re amazing and special; but we’ll also tell them that people like that aren’t allowed here; the law forbids them. After we honor them with myrrh and put a wool wreath on their head, we’ll send them to another city. Because for our souls’ health, we want the tougher, stricter poet or storyteller who only copies the style of the virtuous, following the examples we set when we started training our soldiers.

We definitely will, he said, if we can.

Then, my friend, I said, that part of music or literary education that has to do with stories or myths can be considered done; because we have talked about both the content and the way to tell it.
