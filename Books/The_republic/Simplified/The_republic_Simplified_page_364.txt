What do you mean?

We were saying that if someone wants to see things in their perfect beauty, they have to take a longer and more complicated path, and only then will those things appear. But we could also explain them in a simpler way, like we did before. You said that kind of explanation would be enough, so the conversation went on in a way that might not have been very accurate. Whether you were happy with it or not, that’s up to you to decide.

Yes, he said, I thought, and others thought, that you gave us a fair amount of the truth.

But, my friend, I said, any amount of truth that is less than the whole truth is not really fair; because nothing that is incomplete can truly measure anything, even though people often feel lazy and think they don’t need to look any further.

That happens a lot when people are lazy.

Yes, I said; and that’s the worst fault for someone who is supposed to protect the State and its laws.

True.

So, the protector, I said, must be willing to take the longer path and work hard at learning, not just physical training, or they will never reach the highest knowledge, which, as we were just saying, is their real job.

What, he said, is there knowledge even higher than this—higher than justice and other virtues?

Yes, I said, there is. And when it comes to virtues, we should not be satisfied with just a rough idea like we have now—only perfect and complete understanding should satisfy us. When little details are worked on with endless care so they look their best and clearest, how silly would it be not to aim for the highest truths to be perfectly understood?

That’s a great idea; but do you think we won’t ask you what this highest knowledge is?

Go ahead and ask, I said; but I’m sure you’ve heard the answer many times before. Now, either you don’t understand me or, as I think, you just want to cause trouble. You have often been told that the idea of the good is the highest knowledge, and that everything else becomes useful only because of it. You can’t really be unaware of this, and this is what I was about to talk about. As I’ve often said, we know very little about it, and without it, any other knowledge or possession won’t help us at all.
