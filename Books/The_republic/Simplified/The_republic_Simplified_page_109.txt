A man who compares grey to black might call grey white; and someone who compares no pain to pain might call no pain pleasure. Hunger and thirst are needs of the body, while ignorance and foolishness are problems of the soul. Food satisfies the body’s needs, and knowledge satisfies the soul’s. So, which feels better – eating and drinking, or gaining knowledge?

Think about it this way: the thing that is more real gives truer satisfaction than the thing that is less real. The soul is more real and lasts longer than the body, so its pleasure is more natural and true. People who only care about food and drink are like animals; they keep going up and down but never reach true happiness. They are greedy and fight because they don’t have real fulfillment. Their pleasures are just shadows mixed with pain, making them want those things even more. Like the Greeks fighting over Helen at Troy, they fought over something that wasn’t even real because they didn’t know the truth.

The same goes for strong desires like ambition and greed. These desires only feel truly satisfied when reason guides them. If not, they make the soul chase fake pleasures that don’t belong to it.

The further someone is from philosophy and reason, the further they are from law and order, and their pleasures become more fake.

Love and cruelty are the furthest from law, while a good ruler is closest to it. There is one real pleasure and two fake ones. The tyrant goes beyond the fake pleasures and completely ignores law and reason. You can’t really measure how much worse the tyrant’s pleasure is, but it’s like a shadow of a shadow. The tyrant is three steps away from the ruler, and the ruler is three steps away from the king. That means the difference in their happiness is 3 times 3 times 3, which is 27, squared. This number, 729, shows the huge difference between the king’s and the tyrant’s happiness.

Interestingly, 729 is almost the same as the number of days and nights in a year (365 times 2 equals 730), connecting this idea to human life.

This number shows how much happier a good person is compared to a bad one. Imagine how much bigger the difference is in their whole life and character!

Maybe you remember someone saying at the start that an unjust person benefits if people think he’s just. Now that we understand what justice really is, let’s picture the soul to explain what they meant.
