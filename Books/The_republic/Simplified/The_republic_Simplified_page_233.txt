If something doesn’t hurt, then it’s not harmful, right?

Definitely not.

And if it’s not harmful, it can’t do any evil?

No way.

So can something that does no evil come from evil?

That’s impossible.

Good things are helpful, right?

Yes.

So good things make people feel well?

Exactly.

That means good things aren’t the cause of everything, only of good things?

For sure.

So if God is good, he isn’t the cause of everything like some people say, but only some things.

Because there are only a few good things in life, but many bad things, and good things come from God alone; bad things must come from somewhere else, not God.

That sounds right to me, he said.

Then we shouldn’t believe Homer or any other poet who says that two jars stand at Zeus’s door, one with good luck and one with bad luck, and that sometimes people get a mix of both.

Or that Zeus gives pure bad luck to someone and drives them away from the beautiful earth.

Or that Zeus is the one who gives both good and evil.

And if anyone says that breaking oaths and treaties was caused by Athene and Zeus, or that the gods caused fights among themselves, we shouldn’t agree.

We also shouldn’t let young people hear Aeschylus say that “God puts guilt on people when he wants to completely destroy a family.”
