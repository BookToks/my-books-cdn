In the early days of his rule, he smiles and acts friendly to everyone; he isn’t a boss just for power. He only wants to end debt and stop land from being owned by a few people. After getting rid of foreign enemies, he makes himself important by always starting wars. This lets him tax the poor heavily and keep them working hard. He can also get rid of brave people by handing them over to the enemy.

Then, people start to dislike him; some of his old friends even stand up against him. Because of this, he has to clean up the State, but instead of removing the bad things, he gets rid of the smart, brave, and rich people. He has no choice between living with shame or dying. The more people hate him, the more he needs loyal guards. But how will he find them? They will join him for money, like birds flocking. Or better yet, he will take slaves from their owners and make them his bodyguards. These slaves are his trusted friends who look up to him.

Some poets, who write sad stories, praise the tyrant and say he is wise because he hangs out with wise people. But their praise of tyranny is a good reason to keep them out of our State. They can go to other cities, gather crowds with fancy words, and turn governments into tyrannies or democracies, getting rewards for it. But the higher they climb, the less respect they get, and soon they can’t handle the power.

Back to the tyrant—how will he support his small army? First, by stealing treasures from temples, which lets him lower taxes a bit. Then, he will take all his father’s wealth and spend it on his friends, both men and women. His father is the people, and if they get angry and tell the tyrant he is a burden and should leave with his wild gang, the father will realize what a monster he has raised. The son he wants to throw out has become too strong for him. 

“Don’t you mean he will hurt his father?” Yes, he will, but only after taking away his father’s weapons. “Then he is a cruel son who kills his own family.” And people have gone from fearing slavery to being trapped in it, jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.

So, when liberty is out of control and without reason, it turns into the worst kind of slavery.

In earlier books, Plato described the perfect State. Now, he goes back to talk about bad or failing governments, which he only mentioned briefly before. He explains the connections between people and States, showing how one leads to the other. He starts by asking where he left off and quickly reviews the main ideas from the first three books, which also compare the philosopher to the State.

About the first kind of bad government, he doesn’t give a clear explanation. He probably didn’t want to admit the most likely reasons for his perfect State falling apart, which seem to be that sharing everything doesn’t work well and that rulers and people don’t get along naturally.
