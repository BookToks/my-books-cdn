So, if someone is good at taking care of things, does that mean they’re also good at stealing?

I guess that’s what you’re saying.

Then, if a fair person is good at managing money, does that mean they’re good at stealing it?

That’s what the argument suggests.

So, in the end, the fair person turns out to be a thief. And I think you learned this from Homer; he talks about Autolycus, who is Odysseus’s grandfather and a favorite character, saying “He was the best of all men at stealing and lying.” So, you, Homer, and Simonides all agree that justice is a kind of theft, to be used for helping friends and hurting enemies—that’s what you were saying?

No, definitely not that, though I’m not sure what I said before; but I still agree with the last part.

Okay, here’s another question: When we say friends and enemies, do we mean people who really are friends and enemies, or just people who seem to be?

Surely, someone would love those they think are good and hate those they think are bad.

Yes, but don’t people often mistake who’s good and who’s bad? Many people who aren’t actually good seem good, and the opposite is true too.

That’s right.

So, to those people, the good will seem like enemies and the bad will seem like friends?

True.

Then, in that case, is it right to do good to the bad and harm to the good?

Obviously.

But good people are fair and wouldn’t do something unfair, right?

True.

So, by your argument, it’s fair to hurt those who do wrong?

No, Socrates; that idea is wrong.

Then I guess we should do good to the fair and harm to the unfair?

I like that better.

But think about this: Many people who don’t understand human nature have friends who are bad friends, so they should harm them; and they have good enemies whom they should help. But if that’s true, then we’re saying the exact opposite of what Simonides meant.
