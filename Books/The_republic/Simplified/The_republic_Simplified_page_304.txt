"I am following you," he said. "Go ahead."

I said, "The argument has reached a point where, like looking down from a tall tower, you can see that being good is one thing, but bad behavior comes in many different forms. There are four main types worth mentioning."

"What do you mean?" he asked.

"I mean," I replied, "there seem to be as many kinds of souls as there are kinds of governments."

"How many?" he asked.

"There are five types of government and five types of souls," I said.

"What are they?"

"The first," I said, "is what we have been talking about. It has two names: monarchy and aristocracy. Monarchy is when one special person rules, and aristocracy is when many people rule."

"True," he said.

"But I think those two names describe the same kind of government. Whether one person or many rule, if the rulers have been trained the right way, the basic laws of the state will be kept."

"That's true," he agreed.

This is the good and true city or state, and a good and true person is built the same way. If this is right, then every other way is wrong. The bad kinds of government affect not only how the state is run but also how a person's soul is ordered. These bad kinds come in four forms.
