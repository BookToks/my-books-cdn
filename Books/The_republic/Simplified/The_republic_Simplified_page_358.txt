It’s actually the opposite. When kids and teens study and learn philosophy, it should match their age. While they’re growing up, the main focus should be on taking care of their bodies so they can use them well for philosophy later. As they get older and their minds grow stronger, they should work on training their souls. But when people get old and can’t do tough civil or military jobs anymore, they should be free to do whatever they want and avoid hard work. We want them to live happily now and also be happy after this life.

Socrates, you really mean what you say! he said. I believe you. But I think most people listening will be even more sure about disagreeing with you, especially Thrasymachus.

Don’t start a fight, I said, between Thrasymachus and me. We just became friends, and we weren’t enemies before. I’ll keep trying my best to change his mind and others’ too. If I can’t, I hope to help them when they live again and have the same kind of talks in another life.

You’re talking about a time that’s far away.

I replied, it’s a time that’s nothing compared to forever.

Still, I’m not surprised that most people don’t believe this. They’ve never seen what we’re talking about in real life. They’ve only seen fake philosophy, made of words put together in a forced way, not like ours that fit naturally. But a person who is perfectly shaped by words and actions to be like true goodness—ruling a city with the same perfect image—have they ever seen anyone like that, one or many?

No, they haven’t.

No, my friend, and they’ve rarely or never heard honest and noble ideas. These are the kind of ideas people speak when they seriously want to find the truth just for knowledge. They don’t care about arguments that only cause opinions and fights, whether in courts or society.

They don’t understand the kind of words you’re talking about, he said.

That’s exactly what we expected. That’s why we had to admit, even though we were scared and unsure, that cities, states, and people will never be perfect until the small group of philosophers—whom some call useless but not bad—are forced, whether they want to or not, to take care of the State. And until the State has to obey them. Or until kings, or if not kings then their sons or princes, truly love real philosophy.
