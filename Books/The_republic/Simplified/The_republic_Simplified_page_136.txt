He can imagine that in some far-off time or place, and because of someone’s influence, the idea of sharing everything might have become as important to a group of people as owning things privately is to us. He knows that private property is only about four or five thousand years old. Maybe someday things will go back to how they were before. Even today, ideas about perfect societies affect laws, and big ideas can have a strong impact on real politics.

People often argue against Plato’s idea of sharing everything because, like Aristotle said, it might stop people from working hard, and problems would happen since everyone depends on everyone else. People might produce as little as they want but still take as much as they like. So far, history shows that Socialism doesn’t work well in civilized countries. It’s too hard for human nature; people try to share, but personal feelings always get in the way. On the other hand, it’s unclear if our current ideas about property are natural, since they’re different in different countries and societies. We like to think of ourselves as free individuals, but this freedom is often just a result of modern industrial society. People seem free but are actually trapped by money and the need to survive. Even if most people aren’t totally selfless, we see that they can organize in ways nobody expected fifty years ago.

The same forces that changed Europe’s political system might also change how people live and work together. If good and neutral reasons work in the community, it’s not crazy to think that most people, once they have power and understand better ways of living, might work together with intelligence and determination like never before. They might realize there’s much more for everyone to have than just a few lucky people now do.

Now that the world is moving forward and no longer stuck in old traditions and ignorance, and now that people question old ways instead of just accepting them, civilization can grow faster and better than ever before.

Even at the speed we’re moving now, what we can achieve in two or three generations is beyond what we can imagine. There are things in the world that grow not just step by step, but in a way that multiplies faster and faster. Education, as Plato said, rolls like a wheel that speeds up more and more. We can’t even guess how powerful education will be when everyone has it, when it’s passed down through many generations, when it’s free from superstition, and when it’s designed to meet the needs and abilities of all kinds of people.
