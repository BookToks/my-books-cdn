You should see him when he has a big chance to act dishonestly, like when he’s taking care of an orphan.

Yes.

It will become clear then that in his usual actions, which make him seem honest, he controls his bad desires by forcing himself to behave well. He doesn’t stop them because he knows they’re wrong or because he thinks it’s right, but because he’s afraid and feels he must.

That’s true.

Yes, my friend, but you’ll find that the natural urges of a lazy person are still there inside him, especially when he has to spend money that isn’t his.

Yes, and those urges will be strong too.

So, the man will be fighting with himself; he will be like two people instead of one. But usually, his better desires will win over the worse ones.

True.

Because of this, such a person will be more respected than most people; but the real goodness of a soul that is completely in harmony will stay far away from him and never come near.

I would think so.

And surely, the greedy person won’t be a strong competitor in a country for any prize or honor. He won’t spend his money trying to be famous because he’s scared of waking up his expensive wants and letting them join the struggle. Like a real oligarch, he fights with only a small part of what he has, and usually, he loses the prize but saves his money.

That’s very true.

So, can we still doubt that the miser and money-maker represent the oligarchic state?

There is no doubt.

Next comes democracy; we still need to think about where it starts and what it’s really like. Then we will look at how the democratic person acts and decide what to think about him.

That, he said, is our plan.

Well, I said, how does the change from oligarchy to democracy happen?
