Or the job he chooses to do might be completely different, and he might have a different kind of weakness.

Sure, he said.

And about truth, I said, isn’t a person just as weak if they hate lying and get really mad at themselves and others when someone lies on purpose, but don’t care when people lie by accident, and don’t mind being stuck in ignorance like a pig in mud, and aren’t embarrassed when caught?

Definitely.

And again, when we think about self-control, bravery, generosity, and all other good qualities, shouldn’t we be careful to tell the real people from the fake ones? Because without knowing these qualities well, both groups and individuals make mistakes without realizing it; and the state might pick a leader, or a friend might choose someone, who isn’t really good in some way and is kind of weak or fake.

That’s very true, he said.

So, we have to think about all this carefully. If we only teach people who are healthy in body and mind, justice won’t have anything against us, and we’ll save the government and the country. But if our students are different, the opposite will happen, and we’ll make fun of philosophy even more than it already is.

That wouldn’t look good.

No, I said, but maybe I’m being silly by mixing jokes with serious talk.

How so?

I forgot that we weren’t being serious and got too excited. When I saw philosophy getting treated badly by people, I couldn’t help feeling angry at those who made it look bad; and my anger made me too passionate.

Really! I was listening but didn’t think that.

But I, the one talking, felt I was. And now remember, even though we chose old men before, we shouldn’t do that here.

Solon was wrong when he said that an old man can learn many things—because he can’t learn much more than he can run fast; youth is the time for hard work.
