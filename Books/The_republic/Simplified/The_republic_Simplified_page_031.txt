Both gods and people hate lying deep down, or the idea of being false. Sometimes, lying might seem okay for a good reason, but gods don’t need that. They aren’t clueless like old poets, aren’t scared of enemies, and don’t have crazy friends. God is always true and never changes or tricks anyone, anytime. This is an important idea – God is always truthful. So, forget the fake stories like Agamemnon’s lying dream in Homer or Thetis blaming Apollo in Aeschylus.

To explain his idea of the State, Plato starts with a small group of four or five people who depend on each other and share jobs. This group grows bigger, and jobs spread out to different places. Because people trade, they need money, and shops appear in markets to help save time for the workers. These steps show how Plato imagines the first simple State, mixing in ideas about how economies work. Then, he plans to describe a more advanced or civilized State. He first talks about the simple life, like Rousseau did, which has inspired many people’s imagination. But Plato doesn’t say that simple life is better than complex life, and you can’t judge one without the other, unlike what Aristotle seemed to do.

We shouldn’t take Plato’s dialogues too literally, like a poem or a story. But when we compare Plato’s creative ideas with the boring, dry writings of modern philosophers, we agree with Protagoras who said that stories are more interesting. Plato’s works have many useful ideas about Political Economy, like laws, population, free trade, cheating, wills, begging, value and demand, and division of labor. The last two topics, plus how retail trade started, are explained clearly in the second book of the Republic. But Plato never put all his economic ideas together as a system, and he didn’t seem to see that trade is one of the biggest forces that drive the State and the world. He thought retail traders should be lower-class citizens, although he jokingly said it would be nice if the best men and women had to run taverns or shops sometimes, so people could see how fun these jobs are.

There are also funny parts, like Glaucon being disappointed by the “city of pigs,” silly descriptions of luxury ministers in the fancy State, the need for doctors, a guardian compared to a dog, the idea of offering rare animals in secret rituals, and how Zeus treats his father and Hephaestus treats his mother. These jokes also have serious meanings behind them.
