The ‘base’ or ‘fundamental number’ has 1/3 added to it (1 and 1/3), which equals 4/3, also called a musical fourth. In Greek, a ‘proportion’ is a relationship between numbers, like musical notes, applied to parts of a number or how one number relates to another.

The first harmony is called a ‘square’ number in Greek. The second harmony is an ‘oblong’ number, which means a shape where only the opposite sides are equal. Some Greek terms mean ‘numbers squared from diameters’ or ‘rational’ numbers that don’t include fractions, while others mean ‘irrational’ numbers that do include fractions. For example, 49 is a square of a rational diameter for a shape with a side of about 5.50, which is an irrational diameter of the same shape. I learned a lot about this from a great article on the Platonic Number by Dr. Donaldson.

Dr. Donaldson sums up the ideas like this: he believes the number of the perfect or divine cycle is the number of the world, and the number of the imperfect cycle is the number of the state. He says the period of the world is defined by the perfect number 6, and the period of the state by 216, which is 6 cubed. This 216 comes from the last pair of terms in the Platonic Tetractys, a series of seven numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27.

Using this, we get two cube numbers, 8 and 27, and the numbers between them, 12 and 18. These form three intervals and four terms, all related by a ratio of 3/2. Also, 216 = 8 x 27 = 3³ + 4³ + 5³, and 3² + 4² = 5², showing the importance of the numbers 3, 4, and 5, which musicians find important.

If we mix the ratio 4/3 with the number 5, or multiply the sides’ ratios by the hypotenuse, then square and cube the results, we get two expressions. These represent the ratios of the last pairs of terms in the Platonic Tetractys, multiplied by the square and cube of 10, which is the sum of the first four digits in the Tetractys.

Dr. Donaldson explains these two expressions as follows: The first is (4/3 x 5) squared, which equals 100 times 2 squared over 3 squared. The second is a cube of the same root, described as 100 multiplied by a rational diameter of 5 minus one, which is 48; multiplied by two irrational diameters, 2 and 3; and multiplied by 3 cubed, which is 27.

So, (48 + 5 + 27) times 100 equals 1000 times 2 cubed. This second harmony is the cube of the number for which the first harmony is the square. Therefore, it must be divided by 3 cubed. The whole expression is: (1) for the first harmony, 400/9; (2) for the second harmony, 8000/27.

I agree with Dr. Donaldson and Schleiermacher that 216 is the Platonic number of births because it matches the description given earlier in the passage.
