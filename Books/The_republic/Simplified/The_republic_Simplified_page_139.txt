First, we can see that the way he thinks about relationships between men and women is the opposite of being wild or careless; he actually wants things to be super strict.

Second, he thinks the family is the natural enemy of the state. He hopes that everyone could live like brothers and sisters without private interests—an idea that sounds nice but hasn’t really worked out in real life. Also, he doesn’t see any feelings or imagination in the relationships between men and women. People go back to acting like animals, not rising above or misusing natural instincts. All the poetry and stories about love that we have today would not exist in his view. The way marriage works in his ideal society is only about making better people in future generations. Like animals, humans could be improved over time by choosing the best to have babies and not letting others reproduce.

We feel shocked and uncomfortable with this idea because first, human emotions are too strong to be crushed like that. Second, even if this plan worked, the loss of the best parts of life wouldn’t be worth it. Caring for the weakest people—babies, criminals, mentally ill, and disabled—is one of the greatest things Christianity has taught us. We’ve learned, though not perfectly, that each person has endless value in God’s eyes, and we respect God when we respect these people. Jesus taught this in a story when He said, “Their angels always see the face of My Father in heaven.” These lessons only partly happen in any time period and were unknown in Plato’s time. For the Greeks, family was a religious and traditional group that was less important than friendship and not as serious or sacred as loyalty to your country. Plato thought he was making family relationships higher and more natural, but from a modern Christian view, he seemed to support killing and destroy basic morals.

The big mistake in these ideas is forgetting the difference between humans and animals. Humans are seen like pets or slaves, ignoring our higher qualities. Animal breeders mostly want size, speed, strength, courage, or how good the animal is for food.
