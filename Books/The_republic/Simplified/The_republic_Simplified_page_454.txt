True, he said.

The law is made to help the whole city. We see this in how adults control children. Kids aren’t free until they learn rules, kind of like how a country has a constitution. We teach them to have a part inside them that acts like a leader, just like the law. Once they have this, they can live their own way.

Yes, he said, the law’s purpose is clear.

So, how can anyone say that being unfair, selfish, or bad helps a person? Even if they get money or power by doing wrong, it actually makes them worse people.

There’s no way to say that.

What if someone’s bad actions aren’t caught or punished? If they’re not caught, they only get worse. But if they are caught and punished, the worst parts of them get controlled, and the better parts can grow. Their whole soul becomes better because they learn justice, self-control, and wisdom. These things improve a person more than just having a strong or healthy body, because the soul is more important than the body.

Certainly, he said.

A wise person will spend their life working toward this higher goal. First, they will focus on learning things that teach these good qualities for their soul and ignore other things.

Clearly, he said.

Next, they will take care of their body and habits. They won’t give in to wild or silly pleasures. They will see health as less important than controlling the body to keep the soul balanced.

Certainly, he will, if he truly loves music.

When making money, he will follow rules of order and balance too. He won’t get tricked by praise from others or just try to get rich for no good reason.
