The Tenth Book of Plato’s Republic has two parts. First, Socrates criticizes poets because, after understanding the soul better, it’s clear that poets are far from the truth. Second, after showing that just people are truly happy, he wants to fix how things seem and then prove that the soul never dies. This idea, like in Plato’s other works Phaedo and Gorgias, includes a vision of life after death.

Plato was a poet himself, and his writings are like poems and plays. So why did he dislike poets, especially those who wrote plays? Why didn’t he see that truth can be shared through poems as well as normal writing? Why did he think epic poems were tied to the bad parts of old Greek myths? Why did he judge Homer and Hesiod unfairly by only thinking about usefulness? These questions have puzzled students of Plato for a long time. We might not have full answers, but we can see that his ideas came from the time he lived in, and we can find both truth and mistakes in what he said.

Plato didn’t like poets because poetry was losing its power in his day. A “theatrocracy,” or rule by theater, had replaced a rule by smart thinkers, as he says in his Laws. Euripides was the last great tragic playwright, and Plato saw him as a friend of tyrants and a kind of tricky thinker who used plays for his own goals.

Old comedy was almost gone, and new comedy hadn’t really started yet. Drama and lyric poetry, like all Greek writing, were becoming more about fancy speaking than real art. There was no one as good as Aeschylus or Sophocles after them. Aristophanes, in one of his last comedies called Frogs, talked about “thousands of tragedy-making prattlers” whose poetry was like birds chirping—loud but meaningless. These minor poets appeared once on stage and then disappeared. For someone who loved the great Aeschylus and the noble Sophocles, even if he disagreed with some of their ideas about gods, these lesser poets must have seemed annoying and worthless. Plato’s writings show a strong feeling of sadness about how both literature and politics were falling apart in his time. He also probably didn’t like the wild jokes Aristophanes made near the end of his career, like mocking Socrates in Clouds or making fun of ideal communities in Female Parliament.

There were other reasons Plato didn’t like poetry too.
