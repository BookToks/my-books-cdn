That’s what I think.

Gymnastics that is really good is like the simple music we were just talking about.

How do you mean?

I believe there is a kind of gymnastics, like our music, that is simple and good; especially military gymnastics.

What do you mean by that?

You can learn what I mean from Homer. You know, he feeds his heroes simple food when they are on campaigns. They eat soldiers’ food; no fish, even though they are near the sea, and no boiled meat, only roast. Roast is easiest for soldiers because they only need to light a fire and don’t have to carry pots and pans.

That’s true.

And I’m sure I’m right when I say Homer doesn’t mention sweet sauces at all. He doesn’t allow them, and he’s not alone; all professional athletes know that if you want to be in good shape, you shouldn’t eat that stuff.

Yes, that’s right. Knowing this, athletes don’t take sweet sauces.

So, you wouldn’t like the fancy foods from Syracuse or the special cooking from Sicily?

I don’t think so.

And if someone wants to be fit, you wouldn’t let him have a girlfriend from Corinth?

Definitely not.

Nor would you approve of the sweets that people say are the best in Athens?

Certainly not.

All that fancy eating and living can be compared to complicated music with many rhythms and styles.

Exactly.

Complex things cause freedom to do whatever you want, and that can lead to bad habits. But simple music helps control the soul, and simple gymnastics helps keep the body healthy.
