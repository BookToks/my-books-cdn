 Whatdoyoumean?
 
 My meaning may be learned from Homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes at their feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiersâ€™ fare; they have no fish, although they are on the shores of the Hellespont, and they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food most convenient for soldiers, requiring only that they should light a fire, and not involving the trouble of carryingaboutpotsandpans.
 
 True.
