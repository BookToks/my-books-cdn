We were looking at these things to help us understand our own happiness and unhappiness, based on the example they showed and how much we were like them. But we weren’t trying to prove that these things could actually exist.

True, he said.

Would a painter be any worse if, after drawing a perfect picture of a beautiful man, he couldn’t prove that such a man ever lived?

He wouldn’t be any worse.

Well, aren’t we trying to create an idea of a perfect State?

For sure.

And is our idea a worse one because we can’t prove a city could be organized exactly like we said?

Definitely not, he answered.

That’s true, I said. But if you want me to try and show how and when it’s most likely possible, I need you to repeat what you agreed to before.

What did I agree to?

I want to know if ideals are ever fully shown in language. Doesn’t a word mean more than just the fact? And doesn’t the real thing, no matter what anyone thinks, always fall short of the truth? What do you think?

I agree.

Then you can’t demand that I prove the real State will be exactly like the ideal. If we can just find how a city could be governed almost like we said, you’ll agree that we found the possibility you asked for, and you’ll be happy. I’m sure I’ll be happy too—won’t you?

Yes, I will.

Now let me try to explain what’s wrong with States that makes them badly run today, and what’s the smallest change that can make a State better. If possible, let the change be only one thing, or if not, two things; but at least let the changes be as few and small as possible.

Certainly, he said.
