Are doctors and carpenters really different by nature?

Definitely.

And if men and women seem better suited for certain jobs or skills, then those jobs should go to one or the other. But if the only difference is that women have babies and men don’t, that doesn't prove women need a different kind of education. So, we still think that guards and their wives should do the same kinds of things.

That makes sense.

Next, let's ask our opponent how women are different from men when it comes to any job or skill in society.

That’s a fair question.

Maybe, like you, he’ll say it’s hard to answer right away. But after thinking about it, it’s not so difficult.

Yes, maybe.

So, let’s invite him to join our discussion. Then we can try to show him there’s nothing about women’s nature that would stop them from helping run the country.

Sure, let’s do that.

We can say: “When you talk about someone’s nature, do you mean that some people learn things easily, while others struggle? That some people’s bodies help their minds work better, while others’ bodies hold them back? Those are the kinds of differences that show one person is naturally talented and another isn’t, right?”

No one would disagree.

And can you name any job where men don’t have better natural skills than women? I don’t need to mention weaving or cooking pancakes and sweets, where women really are great, and it would be silly for a man to be better.

You’re right, he said, men are generally better overall, even though many women are better than many men at certain things. But overall, what you say is true.
