I thought that Phoebus’ words, which were sacred and full of prophecy, would always be true. Now, the same person who spoke those words, who was at the banquet and said, “He is the one who killed my son,” is causing problems. These kinds of ideas about the gods make us angry. Anyone who says things like that won’t be allowed to join the chorus. We also won’t let teachers use these ideas when teaching young people. We want our guardians, as much as possible, to truly respect the gods and be like them.

I completely agree with these ideas, he said, and I promise to make them our laws.

So, I said, these are our beliefs about the gods. Some stories should be told, but others should not be shared with our students from a young age. This is because we want them to honor the gods and their parents, and to value friendship with each other.
