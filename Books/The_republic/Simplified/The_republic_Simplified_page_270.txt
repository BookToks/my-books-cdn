I only mean that some people change their minds because someone convinces them, and others just forget. Arguments can win over some people’s hearts, while time changes others. I call this stealing. Do you get what I mean?

Yes.

Then, there are people who change because they are forced by pain or sadness.

I understand, he said, and you’re right.

You would also agree that some people change their minds because they feel happy or scared, right?

Yes, he said; anything that tricks someone can be called enchanting.

So, like I was saying, we need to find out who can best protect their own beliefs about what’s best for the State. We have to watch them from when they’re young and make them do things that might make them forget or be tricked. Those who remember and don’t get fooled should be chosen, and those who fail should be rejected. Is that clear?

Yes.

They should also have to go through hard work, pain, and struggles to prove they have these qualities.

Very true, he replied.

Then, I said, we should test them with enchantments—that’s another kind of test—to see how they act. Just like how people test young horses in loud, chaotic places to see if they’re scared, we should put our young people through scary situations and then happy ones. This will test them even more than gold is tested in fire. This way, we can find out if they can resist all tricks and stay strong and steady, which is best for themselves and the State.

Anyone who passes all these tests at every stage—childhood, youth, and adulthood—should become a leader and protector of the State. They will be honored in life and death, with the greatest awards we have. But those who fail must be rejected. I think this is how we should pick our rulers and guardians. I’m speaking generally, not trying to be exact.

And, speaking generally, I agree with you, he said.
