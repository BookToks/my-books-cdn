No one else should mess with things like this. Even though rulers have special rights, it’s a much worse mistake for a regular person to lie to them. It’s like a patient not telling the doctor the truth about their illness, or a student not being honest with their coach, or a sailor hiding what’s going on with the ship and the crew from the captain.

That’s true, he said.

If the ruler finds anyone else lying about the State, whether they are a priest, doctor, or carpenter, he will punish them because it’s harmful and dangerous to the ship or State.

Definitely, he said, if we want our idea of the State to work.

Next, our young people must be temperate, right?

Sure.

Isn’t the main part of temperance, in general, listening to leaders and controlling yourself when it comes to pleasures?

True.

Then we should accept words like Diomede’s in Homer: ‘Friend, sit still and obey my word,’ and the lines that follow, ‘The Greeks marched with pride... silently respecting their leaders,’ and other similar ideas.

We should.

What about this line: ‘O heavy with wine, who has the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag,’ and the words that come after? Would you say these, or any rude things that regular people say to their rulers, in poetry or prose, are polite or rude?

They are rude.

They might be funny sometimes, but they don’t help with self-control.
