I agree with what you're saying, he replied, which might be hard to believe, but from another point of view, it’s even harder to deny. This isn’t something we can just mention quickly; we’ll need to talk about it again and again.

So, whether what we conclude is true or false, let’s just assume it for now and move from the beginning to the main part. Let’s describe it in a similar way. Tell me, what is dialectic, what are its parts, and what paths lead to it? Because these paths will also lead to our final goal.

Dear Glaucon, I said, you might find this hard to follow, but I’ll try my best, and you should see not just a picture but the absolute truth, as I understand it. I can’t say for sure if what I tell you is real, but you would see something close to reality; I’m sure of that.

No doubt about that, he said.

But I have to remind you that only dialectic can show this, and only to someone who has studied the earlier sciences.

You can be as sure of that as the last point.

And no one would argue that there is any other way to truly understand what something really is by its own nature. Most arts focus on what people want or believe, or are made to create and keep things. The math sciences like geometry get close to true being, but they only dream of it and never see the real thing as long as they accept their starting ideas without question and can’t explain them. If a person doesn’t know their own first principle, and the steps they take come from unknown ideas, how can they think such a made-up system can really be science?

That’s impossible, he said.

Then dialectic, and only dialectic, goes straight to the first principle and is the only science that removes guesses to make its foundation safe. It’s like the eye of the soul, which is stuck deep in a strange swamp, is gently lifted up by dialectic. It uses the other sciences we’ve talked about as helpers to turn the mind around.
