In the last part, we see the start of Aristotle’s idea that everything has a goal and a kind of goodness that works toward that goal. This idea is hinted at by the way art works. We also get a hint that justice and happiness can fit together, and that a person and the State are connected. Socrates acts like he doesn’t know much, but he doesn’t seem totally happy with how the argument went. Nothing is decided for sure, but the way of arguing helps us think bigger about ideas and how they relate to life.

In Book II, Thrasymachus calms down, but the brave Glaucon wants to keep arguing. He isn’t happy with how Socrates ended the last debate about whether being just or unjust makes you happier. Glaucon starts by sorting things we want into three groups: first, things we want just because we like them; second, things we want both because we like them and because they bring good results; and third, things we want only because of the results they bring. He asks Socrates which group justice fits into. Socrates says justice belongs in the second group — things we want for themselves and for what they bring. Glaucon says most people think justice is in the third group — something annoying that’s only good because of its results. Socrates says that idea is from Thrasymachus, and he doesn’t agree with it.

Glaucon thinks Thrasymachus was too easily convinced by smooth talkers, so he wants to look at what justice and injustice really are, without thinking about the rewards or punishments people always talk about. First, he’ll talk about what justice really means and where it comes from. Then, he’ll talk about how people see justice as a kind of necessary pain, not something good. Finally, he’ll explain why this way of thinking makes sense.

Glaucon says: Doing wrong is seen as good, and suffering wrong is seen as bad. Because the bad things from suffering are worse than the good things from doing wrong, people who only suffer and don’t do wrong make an agreement that no one will do wrong. This agreement is called justice, but really it just means no one can do wrong anymore. Nobody would agree to this if they didn’t have to. Imagine both just and unjust people have magic rings that make them invisible, like in the story of Gyges. Then it wouldn’t matter if someone was just or not, because everyone would do bad things if they could get away with it. And the person who stays good would look like a fool. People might say nice things about that person to keep themselves safe, but secretly they would laugh at him.

Now let’s imagine the perfect just and unjust person. The unjust person is really good at being bad, rarely making mistakes, and fixing them easily. He has money, good speaking skills, and strength — the worst kind of villain with the best abilities. On the other side, the just person is noble and simple, truly good, with no fame or reward, just his justice. He is the best person but is thought to be the worst and dies the way he lived. I could add (but I’ll leave that to those who praise injustice) that the just person will be punished in terrible ways — beaten, tortured, blinded, and finally killed — all because he chose to be truly good instead of just pretending.
