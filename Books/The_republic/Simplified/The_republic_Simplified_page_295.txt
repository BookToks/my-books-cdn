Yes.

Here’s the main idea: thirst isn’t just the feeling of wanting any drink. It’s not about wanting any specific drink, like something warm or cold, or a lot or a little. Thirst by itself just wants a drink, plain and simple. But if you feel hot, then you want a cold drink. If you feel cold, you want a warm drink. If the thirst is really strong, you want a lot to drink. If it’s not so strong, you want only a little. So, pure thirst just wants drink itself, like hunger just wants food.

Yes, that’s right. Simple desire is for a simple thing, and a special desire is for a special kind of thing.

But here’s where it gets tricky. Someone might say no one wants just any drink, but only good drinks. Because “good” is something everyone wants, thirst must want a good drink. The same goes for any other desire.

Yes, that’s a fair point.

Still, I think some things have qualities connected to them, and some don’t. Some things are simple, and their related things are simple too.

I don’t get what you mean.

Well, you know how “greater” relates to “lesser”?

Yes.

And “much greater” relates to “much less”?

Yes.

And “sometimes greater” relates to “sometimes less,” and “the greater that is, the less the other is”?

Yes, exactly.

It’s the same with “more and less,” and other pairs like “double and half,” “heavier and lighter,” “faster and slower,” or “hot and cold,” and any other related opposites. Isn’t that true?

Yes.

And doesn’t this idea also apply to science? The goal of science is knowledge (if that’s what science really is). But each kind of science focuses on a special kind of knowledge. For example, the science of house-building is a type of knowledge called architecture, which is different from other types of knowledge.
