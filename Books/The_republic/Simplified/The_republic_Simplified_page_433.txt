Yes, he said, that is the only true picture of him.

When his other desires, surrounded by smells like incense and perfumes, flowers, wine, and all the fun of a wild life, come buzzing around him, they make his strong feelings of wanting even stronger. Then, this leader of his soul, with Madness in charge, goes crazy. If he has any good thoughts or wishes growing inside him, and if he still feels any shame, he gets rid of those better parts until only madness is left.

Yes, he said, that’s how a tyrant is made.

And isn’t that why old love has been called a tyrant?

I wouldn’t be surprised.

Also, I asked, doesn’t a drunk person act like a tyrant too?

He does.

You know that a crazy person thinks they can control not just people, but even the gods?

That’s right.

And a tyrant, in the real sense, comes to be when, either by nature or habit, or both, he becomes drunk, full of lust, and passion. My friend, isn’t that true?

Definitely.

That’s what he is and how he starts. So, how does he live next?

Suppose, as people joke, you tell me.

I imagine, I said, that the next step is parties, wild fun, drinking, and hanging out with courtesans. Love is the boss inside him and controls everything in his soul.

That’s sure.

Yes, and every day and night, his desires grow stronger and more demanding.

They really do, he said.

If he has any money, it’s soon gone.
