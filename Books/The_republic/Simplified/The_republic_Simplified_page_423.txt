The last extreme of popular freedom is when a slave bought with money, whether male or female, is just as free as the person who bought them. Also, I must not forget to mention the liberty and equality between men and women in relation to each other.

Why not, as Aeschylus says, say the word that comes to our lips?

That is what I am doing, I replied; and I must add that no one who doesn’t know would believe how much greater the freedom is for animals under the control of humans in a democracy than in any other state. For truly, the female dogs, as the saying goes, are as good as their female owners, and the horses and donkeys walk with all the rights and respect of free men. They will run at anyone who blocks their way if the road isn’t clear for them. Everything seems ready to burst with freedom.

When I take a walk in the country, he said, I often feel what you describe. You and I have dreamed the same thing.

And above all, I said, because of all this, look how sensitive the citizens become. They get impatient with even the smallest bit of authority, and in the end, as you know, they stop caring about laws, whether written or unwritten. They will have no one above them.

Yes, he said, I know that too well.

Such, my friend, I said, is the fair and glorious beginning that eventually leads to tyranny.

Glorious indeed, he said. But what is the next step?

The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; it is the same problem made worse by the freedom in democracy. The truth is that too much of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction. This happens not only in seasons and in the life of plants and animals but especially in forms of government.

True.

Too much freedom, whether in states or individuals, seems to turn into too much slavery.

Yes, the natural order.

And so tyranny naturally comes from democracy, and the worst kind of tyranny and slavery comes from the most extreme kind of freedom?

As we might expect.

That, however, was not your question—I believe you wanted to know what disorder happens the same way in both oligarchy and democracy, and what causes the ruin of both?
