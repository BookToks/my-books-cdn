If a trader goes to get something but doesn’t have what others want, they will come back empty-handed.

That’s for sure.

So, what people make at home must be enough not just for themselves but also in the right amount and quality for those who give them what they need.

Exactly.

So, we will need more farmers and more workers?

Yes, we will.

And what about the importers and exporters, the merchants?

Yes, we will need merchants too.

If goods have to be taken across the sea, skilled sailors will be needed in large numbers, right?

Yes, a lot of sailors will be needed.

Now, inside the city, how will people trade their products? Remember, making sure this trade happens was one of the main reasons we formed a society and a State.

They will buy and sell.

So, they will need a marketplace and some kind of money to trade with.

Definitely.

What if a farmer or worker brings something to the market but no one is there to trade at that time? Should they just stop working and sit in the market?

No way. They will find people who act as sellers. In well-organized states, these sellers are usually the weakest people physically, who can’t do much else. Their job is to stay in the market and give money to those who want to sell goods and take money from those who want to buy.
