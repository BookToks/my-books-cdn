There is no better kind of training than that, he answered.

So, Glaucon, I said, learning music is stronger than any other kind of training because rhythm and harmony reach deep inside the soul. They stick there, making the soul more graceful if someone is taught well, or less graceful if taught badly. Also, someone who truly learns this inner education will quickly notice mistakes in art and nature. They will have a true taste for what is good, and they will feel happy and proud when they see good things. They become noble and good, and even when they are young, before they fully understand why, they will dislike and blame bad things. Later, when they understand more, they will appreciate friends who helped teach them.

Yes, he said, I agree with you that young people should learn music for these reasons.

Just like when we learn to read, I said, we were happy when we knew the letters of the alphabet, which are few, in all their shapes and combinations. We didn’t ignore them, whether they took up a lot or a little space, but always tried hard to recognize them. We didn’t think we were good readers until we could find letters anywhere. True, he said. Or like when we see letters reflected in water or a mirror, we only recognize them if we already know the letters themselves. The same skill helps us understand both.

Exactly. In the same way, I say, neither we nor those who guide us can really learn music until we know the true forms of self-control, courage, generosity, greatness, and related qualities, as well as their opposites, in all their combinations. We must be able to recognize them and their forms wherever they appear, not ignoring them whether they show up in small or big things, but believing they all belong to one study and art.

Most definitely.

And when a beautiful soul matches perfectly with a beautiful body, and they come together as one, won’t that be the most beautiful thing to see for anyone who knows how to look?

The most beautiful, indeed.
