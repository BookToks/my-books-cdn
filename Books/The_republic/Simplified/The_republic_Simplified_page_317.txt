That’s pretty true, he said; but what exactly are you talking about?

I mean, I replied, our leaders will have to use some lies and tricks to help their people: we were saying that using these things like medicines might actually help.

And we were right.

Using these lies in rules about marriage and having children will probably be needed a lot.

How come?

Well, I said, the rule is already set that the best men should marry the best women as much as possible, and the less good should marry the less good, but rarely; and that only the kids from the best couples should be raised, not the others, to keep the group strong.

Now, this plan must be a secret that only the leaders know, or else people might rebel.

That’s true.

Shouldn’t we have festivals where brides and grooms come together, with sacrifices and special songs made by poets? The leaders should decide how many weddings happen, so the population stays balanced. They also have to think about wars, diseases, and other things to keep the state from getting too big or too small.

Definitely, he said.

We’ll need to create some clever way to pick who gets to marry, so the less worthy people think it’s just bad luck, not the leaders’ choice.

For sure, he said.

And I think our bravest and best young men, besides getting honors and rewards, should have more chances to be with women; being brave should be a reason to have as many sons as possible.

True.

And the right officers, whether men or women, will take the kids of the good parents to special places where nurses take care of them; but the kids from less good parents, or if the good ones have deformed babies, those babies will be hidden away somewhere secret, as they should be.
