Can a true philosopher ever love a lie? No, he hates lies completely.

When truth is in charge, can anything bad happen to the group he leads? No, that’s impossible.

Justice and a healthy mind will be part of the group, and self-control will come too? Yes, that’s right.

I don’t need to list the philosopher’s good traits again because you probably remember them—like bravery, generosity, understanding, and memory. But you said that even though these things sound good, many people who are called philosophers are actually useless or even very bad.

So, we started looking into why most of them are bad, which brought us back to the question: what makes a true philosopher?

Exactly.

Next, we have to think about why so many philosophers go wrong and why only a few stay good—especially those who are useless but not evil. After that, we’ll talk about people who pretend to be philosophers but aren’t worthy. These fake philosophers mess up the reputation of philosophy and all philosophers.

What are these problems? he asked.

I’ll try to explain. Everyone agrees that a person with all the qualities a philosopher needs is very rare.

Very rare, indeed.

And there are so many strong reasons why these rare philosophers get ruined.

What causes?

First, their own good traits, like courage and self-control, can actually hurt and distract the philosopher’s soul, even though these qualities are usually praised.
