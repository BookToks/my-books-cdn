A ruler who is good at their job shouldn’t let people who are bad at ruling be in charge. The leaders we have now are different—they’re like rebellious sailors, while the real leaders are called useless and dreamers.

Exactly, he said.

Because of this, and because people are like this, philosophy, which is the highest form of learning, isn’t respected much by those who don’t agree with it. The biggest harm to philosophy doesn’t come from its enemies but from the people who claim to support it. Most of these supporters are troublemakers, and the best ones don’t help much. I agreed with this.

Yes.

And have we explained why the good people don’t help much?

True.

So, shall we now show that most people becoming corrupt is something that can’t be helped, and that it’s not philosophy’s fault any more than the other problems?

Definitely.

Let’s start by talking about a gentle and noble nature. Remember, truth was the leader he always followed; if he didn’t follow truth, he wasn’t a real philosopher.

Yes, that was said.

Well, isn’t this idea very different from what people think of him now?

For sure, he said.

And can’t we say in his defense that a true lover of knowledge is always trying to understand being itself—that’s how they are. They won’t be satisfied with just seeing many separate things, which are only appearances. They will keep going—their sharp desire won’t fade—until they understand the true nature of everything. Through a deep connection in their soul, they get close to and become part of every being. They create mind and truth, gaining knowledge and truly living and growing. Only then will they stop their search.

Nothing, he said, can describe him better than this.
