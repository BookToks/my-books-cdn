People say there have been such unions.

Now imagine a huge monster with many heads, each head like a different animal, both tame and wild, and it can change and shape-shift whenever it wants.

You might think the artist who made this is amazing; but since language is more flexible than wax or anything like that, let’s say there really is a model like you described.

Now, suppose you make a second form like a lion, and a third like a man, with the second smaller than the first, and the third smaller than the second.

That, he said, is easier to do; and I have made them just like you said.

Now put them together and let the three grow into one.

That has been done.

Next, shape the outside of them into a single form, like a man, so that someone who can’t see inside will think the beast is just one human being.

I have done that, he said.

Now, to the person who says it’s good for humans to be unfair and bad to be fair, let’s answer that if they are right, then it is good for this creature to feed the many-headed monster and make the lion and the lion-like parts stronger, but starve and weaken the man, who would then be controlled by the other two; and he shouldn’t try to make them get along but let them fight and hurt each other.

Certainly, he said; that’s what someone who supports unfairness says.

To that person, the supporter of fairness answers that they should always speak and act so the man inside has full control over the whole creature. He should take care of the many-headed monster like a good farmer, encouraging the gentle parts and stopping the wild parts from growing; he should make the lion qualities his friend, and take care to unite all the parts with each other and with himself.

Yes, he said, that is exactly what someone who supports fairness says.

So, from every side—whether thinking about pleasure, respect, or benefit—the person who supports fairness is right and telling the truth, while the one who disagrees is wrong, lying, and ignorant?

Yes, from every side.
