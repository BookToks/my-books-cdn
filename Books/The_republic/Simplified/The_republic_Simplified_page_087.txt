He knows that numbers are useful for learning, but he also thinks they don’t connect to our higher moral and intellectual ideas. When Plato tries to link them, you can see the influence of old Pythagorean ideas. He’s not talking about perfect numbers, but about numbers that are pure ideas. Plato believes these numbers really exist on their own, just like the Pythagoreans said. These numbers can’t be split into smaller parts, and things like one and other numbers are seen as absolute. When numbers are taken away from real-world things, they seem very true and certain, almost sacred, to an ancient thinker. It’s hard to say how much ideas about order and stability helped people improve morally, but as the Timaeus says, people might learn to control their chaotic lives by following these ideas. It’s interesting that old Pythagorean moral symbols still show up as sayings we use today. People today who believe the world follows universal laws might see an early version of this modern idea in Plato’s idea of the good, which is the source and standard of everything, even though it’s just an abstract idea.

There are two parts that need more explanation. The first is about how vision works. This part is hard because ancient and modern people think differently. For us, what we see with our senses is linked to how our mind understands it. We don’t separate the feeling of seeing colors, shapes, and distance from the mind’s awareness. But for Plato, senses are like a constant flow of blurry images, not clear pictures of things as they really look. It’s like how a baby sees, confused and unclear. The mind’s first job is to organize this chaos, and reason is needed to create clear ideas that can sort out these mixed-up senses. That’s why we ask, “What is big, what is small?” and start to separate what we see from what we understand.

The second hard part is about Plato’s idea of harmonics, or the study of sound and music. He talks about three groups of people who study harmony. First are the Pythagoreans, who Plato respects as experts in music but thinks they don’t understand its deeper meaning or how it relates to what is good. Second are the simple experimenters, who Glaucon mixes up with the Pythagoreans. Socrates and Glaucon make fun of these experimenters because they just listen to sound intervals without real knowledge. Both groups don’t fully understand Plato’s idea of harmony, which should be studied in a pure, abstract way, first by solving problems, and second as part of universal knowledge connected to the idea of the good.
