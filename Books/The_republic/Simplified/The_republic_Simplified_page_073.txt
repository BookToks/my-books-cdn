People often ask why citizens of countries are so against philosophy. The answer is that they don’t really know what philosophy is. Still, many people would believe in it if they were taught correctly. So far, they have only seen fake versions of philosophy—just words without real meaning, or systems that don’t feel alive. They have never met a true philosopher, someone who talks about beauty and freedom, cares about people, and tries to shape the state based on those ideas.

There has always been two feelings about most people. One is that people are against truth and what’s right. The other is that this only happens because they are confused and don’t really hate those who want to help them; if they were educated, they would understand and believe.

At the end of the sixth book, three questions need to be looked at: First, the longer, more complicated way of learning compared to the shorter, less perfect way in Book IV; second, the perfect idea or model of the state; third, how different kinds of knowledge connect to each other and to parts of the soul.

We only get a small idea of the better way of knowing from Plato. He doesn’t explain it clearly in this book or in others like Phaedrus or Symposium. He probably thought of his method as taking regular steps to reach universal knowledge, starting from the whole and figuring out the parts, rather than starting from parts to guess the whole. This ideal way of thinking isn’t used when he talks about justice or the soul. There, like Aristotle, he argues from experience and everyday language. But at the end of the sixth book, he imagines a better method where all ideas are connected steps forming a complete system, and being consistent shows what is true.

Plato doesn’t explain how this process works in detail. Like many thinkers, ancient and modern, he seems to have an empty idea in his mind that he can’t fully understand. He assumes sciences have a natural order and connection, even though back then, they didn’t really.

He tries to reach the “end of knowledge” without even starting it properly.

Today, we know that learning mixes two kinds of truths: some come before experience (a priori), and some come after experience (a posteriori). The a priori truths come from what everyone agrees on or from the most basic human experiences, while the a posteriori truths grow out of those and become part of them.

But Plato wrongly thinks that putting knowledge together can be separated from breaking it down, and that the method of science can come before science itself. His idea of knowledge before experience is similar to what later philosophers like Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and Bacon also tried to explain.
