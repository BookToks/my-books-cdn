They wanted to find out the truth about what justice and injustice really are, and also which one is better.

I told them honestly that this would be a serious question and would need careful thinking. Since none of us are super smart, I suggested a way to figure it out. I said, imagine someone who can’t see well being asked to read tiny letters far away. Then someone else suggests they look for the same letters somewhere closer where they are bigger. If they can read the big letters first, then the small ones, that would be really lucky.

“That makes sense,” said Adeimantus. “But how does this relate to what we’re talking about?”

I explained that justice, the thing we want to understand, is sometimes talked about as a quality of a single person, and sometimes as a quality of a whole country or state.

“That’s true,” he said.

“And a state is bigger than one person, right?”

“Yes.”

“Then it’s easier to see justice in a big state than in one person. So, I think we should look at justice and injustice in the state first, and then in the individual, comparing the two.”

“That sounds like a great idea,” he said.

“And if we imagine the state being made from scratch, we can watch how justice and injustice come to be.”

“I guess so.”

“When the state is finished, it might be easier to find what we’re looking for.”

“Yeah, way easier.”

“But should we try to build one ourselves?” I asked, because I thought it would be a really hard job. “Think about it.”

“I have thought about it,” said Adeimantus, “and I’m eager for you to continue.”

I said, “I think a state comes from people’s needs. No one can do everything by themselves; we all need different things. Can you think of any other way a state could start?”

“No, there can’t be any other way.”
