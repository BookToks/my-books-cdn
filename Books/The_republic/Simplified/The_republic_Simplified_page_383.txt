Shouldn't the soul be confused when the senses show something that is both hard and soft? And what does it mean if something is light but also heavy, or heavy but also light?

Yes, he said, these feelings the soul gets are strange and need to be explained.

I agreed, and said that when the soul is confused like this, it naturally uses thinking and reasoning to figure out if what it senses is actually one thing or two.

True.

And if they turn out to be two, isn't each one different from the other?

Certainly.

And if each is one, but both together are two, the soul will see them as separate parts, because if they weren’t divided, they would be seen as one thing.

True.

The eyes saw both small and big things, but in a mixed-up way; they didn’t clearly separate them.

Yes.

But the thinking mind, trying to make sense of the confusion, had to do the opposite and see small and big as separate, not mixed together.

Exactly.

Wasn't this the start of asking, “What is big?” and “What is small?”

Exactly.

And that’s how the difference between what we can see and what we can understand began.

Very true.

This is what I meant when I talked about impressions that make the mind think, or the opposite—those that don’t happen at the same time don’t make us think.

I understand, he said, and I agree with you.

So, which group do unity and number belong to?

I don’t know, he replied.

Think a little and you’ll see that what we talked about before will help answer this; if simple unity could be fully understood by sight or any sense, then like with the finger example, there wouldn’t be anything to push us to understand being. But when there’s always some kind of contradiction, where unity is also the opposite of unity and includes the idea of many, then thinking starts inside us, and the soul gets confused and wants to find an answer to “What is true unity?”
