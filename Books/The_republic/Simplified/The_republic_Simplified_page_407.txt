Good, he said.

So, I said, this is the young man who likes a democratic way of ruling, and he’s like the democratic state.

Exactly.

Here’s where he comes from: He’s usually the son of a brave dad who lives in a city that’s badly run. The dad doesn’t want any honors or jobs, won’t go to court, or fight for his rights—he just wants to avoid trouble.

How does the son grow up?

The son starts to change when he hears his mom complaining that his dad has no place in the government, so she doesn’t have status among other women. She also notices that his dad isn’t very interested in money and doesn’t fight in courts or meetings—instead, he just accepts whatever happens. She sees that his dad thinks a lot about himself and treats her with little care. This annoys her, and she tells her son that his dad is weak and too easy-going. She adds all the usual complaints women like to say about being treated badly.

Yes, said Adeimantus, they give us plenty of those complaints, and they’re just like themselves.

And you know, I said, the old servants who are supposed to be loyal to the family sometimes talk secretly to the son. If they see anyone who owes his dad money or is hurting him and the dad doesn’t fight back, they tell the son that when he grows up, he must stand up to people like that and be stronger than his dad. 

The son only has to go outside and he hears and sees the same things: people who just do their own work are called simpletons and not respected, while those who meddle in others’ business are praised. So, hearing and seeing all this—and hearing his dad’s words and seeing how he lives—he feels pulled in different directions.

While his dad is trying to grow reason and good sense inside him, others are encouraging his feelings and desires. He wasn’t born bad, but being around bad influences, he ends up in the middle—giving up the calm, fair part of himself for arguing and strong feelings—and becomes proud and ambitious.

You seem to have explained where he comes from perfectly.

Then, I said, we now have the second type of government and the second kind of person?
