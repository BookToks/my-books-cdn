There, I said, I think you’re starting to be wrong.

What do you mean?

I don’t think he has reached the worst kind of misery yet.

Then who is more miserable?

Someone I’m about to talk about.

Who is that?

Someone who is a cruel ruler. Instead of living a private life, he is unlucky because he is a public tyrant.

From what you said, I think you’re right.

Yes, I replied, but in this important discussion, you should be more sure and not just guess; because questions about good and evil are the biggest.

Very true, he said.

Let me give you an example that might help explain this.

What is your example?

Rich people in cities who own many slaves: from them, you can get an idea of a tyrant’s situation, because they both have slaves; the only difference is the tyrant has more slaves.

Yes, that is the difference.

You know they live safely and don’t have to worry about their servants?

What should they be afraid of?

Nothing. But do you see why?

Yes; it’s because the whole city works together to protect each person.

Very true, I said. But imagine one of these owners, who has about fifty slaves, and his family and property, taken by a god to a wilderness where there are no free people to help him—won’t he be very scared that his slaves might kill him, his wife, and children?

Yes, he said, he would be very afraid.
