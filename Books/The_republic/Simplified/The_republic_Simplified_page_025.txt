Only poets say they can be happy if they get sacrifices. So why not sin and then pay to get forgiven? Because if good people just don’t get punished, they don’t get any extra reward, while bad people might not get punished and still enjoy doing wrong. But what about the afterlife? The argument says there are powers that will fix this, like poets who say they are the gods’ children, and the government agrees.

How can we argue for justice when faced with these ideas? Add good manners, and as the wise say, we can have the best of both worlds. Anyone who isn’t completely miserable will smile at justice being praised. Even if someone knows what’s right, they won’t be mad at others because they also know that saving a person needs more than just being good, and only people who can’t be unfair really praise justice.

The problem with evil is that from the start, heroes, poets, and teachers have always said justice brings rewards and honors. If we had learned early on about the power of justice and injustice inside a person’s soul, unseen by any god or human, we wouldn’t need others to watch over us; we would watch over ourselves. This is what I want you to show, Socrates. Other people use arguments that make the idea “might makes right” stronger, but I expect better from you. And please, as Glaucon said, pretend that just people are seen as unjust and unjust people as just, and still prove that justice is better.

Glaucon’s idea, argued for the sake of debate, is the opposite of Thrasymachus’s—that right is not the interest of the stronger, but the need of the weaker. Using the same ideas, he goes further: might is still right, but now the might is the many weak people joined together against the few strong ones.

Some old and modern ideas are similar to Glaucon’s, like the belief that power is the base of right, or that kings have a divine right to rule well or badly, or that virtue is just selfishness or wanting power, or that war is natural for humans, or that private bad behavior helps the public. These ideas seem believable because they agree somewhat with real life. Human nature swings between good and evil, and reasons for actions and rules can be explained in different ways depending on a person’s view. The need to keep authority, sometimes in shady ways, is a strong feeling among civilized people.

The idea that kings or governments have a divine right to rule is one way this feeling shows itself. Also, there is no evil without some good or pleasure mixed in, and no good without some bit of evil. No noble or generous thought is free from a little bit of self-interest or selfish love.
