We don’t need to argue about whether the kind of State Plato imagined could really work, or if he thought about its outside structure or inner life first. Whether his ideas are practical doesn’t matter for whether they are true. His highest ideas show a strong sense of design—justice more than just the State’s outer form, and the idea of good more than justice.

The big science of dialectic, or organizing ideas, doesn’t have real content itself. It’s more like a way or spirit for looking for deeper knowledge, something a thinker uses to understand all time and existence. Plato reaches his deepest thoughts in the fifth, sixth, and seventh books. Even though these might not satisfy today’s thinkers, they are the most important and original parts of his work.

We don’t need to spend much time on a small question raised by Boeckh about when the conversation in the book happened (he suggests the year 411 B.C., which works as well as any other). Plato, who often didn’t care much about exact dates (like in his other works), just aimed for general truth. Whether all the people in the Republic could have met at the same time wasn’t a problem for Athenians reading the book forty years later, or for Plato when writing it (just like we don’t worry about Shakespeare’s timing in his plays). 

Still, this question might be one without an answer but is worth asking because it shows we can’t use Plato’s dates to argue history. So, it’s pointless to try to fix these timing problems with strange ideas, like C.F. Hermann’s guess that Glaucon and Adeimantus are Plato’s uncles, not brothers, or Stallbaum’s idea that Plato left mistakes on purpose to show when he wrote some dialogues.

The main characters in the Republic are Cephalus, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus, Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. Cephalus appears only at the start, Polemarchus leaves after the first argument, and Thrasymachus is silenced at the end of the first book. The main talk happens between Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. Others there include Lysias (the speaker), Euthydemus (Cephalus’s son and Polemarchus’s brother), an unknown Charmantides—they don’t say much. Cleitophon also shows up and interrupts once; he is a friend of Thrasymachus.

Cephalus, the head of the family, has just finished a sacrifice. He represents an old man who is almost done with life and feels calm and peaceful with himself and everyone else. He senses he is getting closer to death and seems to hold onto memories of the past.
