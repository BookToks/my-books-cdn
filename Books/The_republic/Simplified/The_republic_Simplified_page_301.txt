I think there’s no difference, he said.

If we still have doubts, some normal examples will prove what I’m saying is true.

What kind of examples do you mean?

If we think about it, wouldn’t a fair state or a person who knows how to be fair be less likely to steal money? Would anyone disagree?

No one, he answered.

Would a fair person ever steal, betray their friends, or cheat their country?

Never.

Would they ever break promises if there were no oaths or agreements?

Impossible.

Would they be more likely to cheat on someone, disrespect their parents, or ignore their religious duties?

No one.

That’s because each part of a person is doing its own job, either leading or following, right?

Exactly.

So, do you believe that the thing that makes people and states like this fair is justice, or do you think there’s something else?

Not me.

Then our idea has come true, and the suspicion we had at the start—that some special power helped us find the first form of justice—has been proven?

Yes, for sure.

And the way different jobs like the carpenter and shoemaker each do their own work was a small example of justice, which is why it was useful?

Clearly.

But real justice isn’t about the outside; it’s about what’s inside a person, their true self. A fair person won’t let the different parts inside them fight or take over each other. They keep their inner life in order, are their own boss, and feel calm inside.

When they bring together all parts of themselves—like different notes in music—and become one balanced and steady person, then they act, whether it’s about money, their body, politics, or private stuff.

They always think about what keeps this balance, and they call that fair and good action, and the smart thinking behind it wisdom. But anything that messes up this balance is unfair, and the thinking behind it is ignorance.
