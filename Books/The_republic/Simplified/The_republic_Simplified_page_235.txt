True.  

I think the same idea applies to all things made of parts—like furniture, houses, clothes. When they are made well and strong, they change the least over time and because of outside conditions.  

That’s right.  

So, everything that is good, whether made by people or by nature, or both, is least likely to be changed by outside forces?  

True.  

But surely God and the things of God are perfect in every way?  

Of course they are.  

Then God can’t be forced by outside things to take on many different shapes?  

He can’t.  

But can’t He change and transform Himself?  

Clearly, if He changes at all, that must be true.  

And if He does change, will it be for the better and more beautiful, or worse and less attractive?  

If He changes at all, it can only be for the worse, because we can’t think of Him as lacking in goodness or beauty.  

That’s very true, Adeimantus. But then, would anyone—God or man—want to make themselves worse?  

Impossible.  

So it’s impossible that God would ever want to change. Since He is the fairest and best thing imaginable, every God stays completely and forever in their own form.  

That follows naturally, I think.  

Then, my dear friend, let none of the poets tell us that "The gods, taking the disguise of strangers from other lands, walk through cities in all sorts of forms;" and let no one slander Proteus and Thetis, nor let anyone, in plays or any other poetry, show Hera disguised as a priestess asking for help—let’s stop these kinds of lies.
