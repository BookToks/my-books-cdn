It’s hard to understand how he came up with the first part of the series because it’s not mentioned anywhere else and doesn’t relate to the rest of his ideas. Also, the way shadows relate to objects isn’t the same as how numbers relate to ideas. Plato probably liked making comparisons (like in Timaeus) and added four parts instead of three, even though the things we see in both parts of the lower world are all things we can sense. He’s also getting ready to talk about shadows of images in the seventh book and copies of copies in the tenth.

The line can be seen as going from one thing (unity) to endless things (infinity). It’s split into two parts that aren’t the same size, and each part is split again. Each lower part is a multiplication of the one before it. Of the four ways we understand things, faith or belief in the lower part is in the middle. It’s different from the unclear way we see shadows and also different from the stronger certainty of understanding and reason.

The difference between understanding and mind or reason is like the difference between learning about parts and thinking about the whole. True knowledge is complete and steady. Truth is tested by being consistent and universal. Mind matches this kind of knowledge of the whole. But understanding can be incomplete and always changing because it can’t settle on the smaller ideas. These smaller ideas are called both images and guesses—images because they come through the senses, guesses because they are only assumptions until connected to the idea of good.

The main idea of the passage, “Noble, then, is the bond which links together sight... And of this kind I spoke as the intelligible...” can be explained like this: There is one true thing, existing on its own, that human intelligence can reach by climbing a ladder from below. This one thing is like the sun in the sky, the light that lets us see everything, and the being that creates and keeps all things alive.

This one true thing is the IDEA of good. The steps on the ladder leading to this highest and most universal thing are the mathematical sciences, which also have something universal inside them. When we connect these sciences to the idea of good, they stop being just guesses or pictures and become important parts of a higher truth, which is both their starting point and their final goal.

We can’t explain this difficult passage much more clearly, but we can find some early ideas in it that we share with Plato: (1) the unity and connection of all sciences, which back then weren’t separated; (2) the idea of a Divine Power or life or cause or reason, not yet thought of as a person like in Timaeus; (3) the idea that math and every science is based on guesses when looked at alone; (4) the belief in a truth we can’t see and a law that affects the mind more than the visible world.
