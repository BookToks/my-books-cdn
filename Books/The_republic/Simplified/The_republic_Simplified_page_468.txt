He said the second statement is the truer one.

Think about it: would someone be more likely to struggle and hold back their sadness when their friends are watching, or when they are alone?

It really changes depending on whether someone is watching.

When he’s by himself, he won’t mind saying or doing things he’d be embarrassed for others to hear or see.

That’s true.

Inside him, there’s a rule of reason telling him to resist feeling sad, but also a feeling of bad luck pushing him to give in to his sorrow.

That’s right.

But when a person feels pulled in two different directions about the same thing, it means there are two different ideas inside them, right?

Definitely.

One of these ideas is ready to listen to reason?

What do you mean?

Reason says it’s best to be patient when we’re suffering and not get impatient, because we don’t know if something is truly good or bad. Getting upset doesn’t help, and nothing important depends on it right now. Sadness only gets in the way of what we really need to do.

What do we really need to do? he asked.

We need to think carefully about what happened, and after things have settled, plan what to do next in the smartest way. We shouldn’t act like kids who got hurt and just keep holding the sore spot and crying. Instead, we should train ourselves to fix what’s wrong, stop the sadness, and heal.

Yes, he said, that’s the right way to handle tough times.

Yes, I said. And this higher idea inside us is ready to listen to reason?

Clearly.

And the other idea, the one that makes us keep thinking about our problems and complaining, which never feels like it’s enough, is something we can call unreasonable, useless, and cowardly?
