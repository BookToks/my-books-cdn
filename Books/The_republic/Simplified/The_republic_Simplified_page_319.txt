The same rule will apply to anyone of the right age who connects with a woman in her prime without the rulers’ permission. We will say that he is creating a child who doesn’t belong to the State and is not recognized.

“Very true,” he replied.

But this only applies to people within the specified age. After that, they can marry whoever they want, except a man cannot marry his daughter, granddaughter, mother, or grandmother. Women are also not allowed to marry their sons, fathers, grandsons, or grandfathers, and so on in either direction.

We allow this but also order strict rules to stop any child from being born from these forbidden unions. If a child is born anyway, the parents must understand that this child cannot be supported, and they should plan for that.

“That also makes sense,” he said. “But how will they know who is whose father or daughter?”

They will never truly know. Here’s how it will work: from the day a couple gets married, the husband will call all the boys born seven to ten months later his sons, and the girls his daughters. These children will call him father, and he will call their kids his grandchildren. The older generation will be called grandfathers and grandmothers.

Anyone born when their parents were together will be called brothers and sisters, and these siblings will not be allowed to marry each other. But this is not an absolute rule—if fate favors them and they get approval from the Pythian oracle, the law will allow their marriage.

“Quite right,” he replied.

This is the plan, Glaucon, where the guardians of our State will share their wives and families. Now you want the argument to show that this community fits with the rest of our State and that nothing could be better—right?

“Yes, certainly.”

Shall we try to find a common ground by asking what the main goal of the lawmaker should be when making laws and organizing a State? What is the greatest good and the worst evil? Then we can think about whether our plan matches the good or the evil.

“By all means.”
