We see Him in a picture, but He isn’t really there. We collect bits of His speeches, but they don’t show who He truly was. He doesn’t live in heaven or on earth, but in the heart of every person.

This is the image that Plato noticed far away. He called it, using Homer’s words, "the likeness of God." It’s the idea of a nature that people have always felt is greater and better than themselves.

No matter how it appears—whether from the Bible, nature, history, or the human heart, whether seen as a person or not, with feelings or without, existing in space or not—this idea will always be the symbol of what is good to all people.
