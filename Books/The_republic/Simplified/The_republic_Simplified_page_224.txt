This creates a group of regular traders in our State. Isn’t a “retailer” the name for people who sit in the market buying and selling, while those who travel from city to city are called merchants?

Yes, he said.

There is also another group of workers who aren’t as smart as the others but are strong and do physical work. They sell their labor and are called hirelings, since “hire” means the price they get for their work.

True.

So, hirelings will help make up our population?

Yes.

Now, Adeimantus, do you think our State is fully developed and complete?

I think so.

Where then is justice and injustice, and where did they start in the State?

Probably in how these citizens treat each other. I don’t think they would be found anywhere else.

I agree with you; we should think about this carefully and not avoid the question.

Let’s first think about their way of life now that we have created them. Won’t they grow crops like corn and grapes, and make clothes, shoes, and build houses for themselves? When they are at home, they will usually work in the summer with little clothes and no shoes, but in winter they will dress warmly.

They will eat barley meal and wheat flour, baking cakes and bread. They will eat these on mats or clean leaves, lying on beds covered with yew or myrtle. They and their children will have feasts, drinking wine they made, wearing flower crowns, singing praises to the gods, and happily talking with each other. They will make sure their families don’t spend more than they have, avoiding poverty or war.

But, said Glaucon, you didn’t say what they will have to make their meals tasty.

True, I replied, I forgot. Of course, they will have things like salt, olives, and cheese. They will also boil roots and herbs like country people do. For dessert, they will have figs, peas, and beans. They will roast myrtle berries and acorns by the fire and drink in moderation.
