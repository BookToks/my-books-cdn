“I can easily see,” Glaucon said, “that a general’s skill will be much better if he knows geometry.” That’s a small thing; what I mean by geometry is that it helps us think about the idea of good and pushes our minds to look at what’s truly real, not just at how things are made or created.

But the way people study geometry now, anyone who knows a little math can tell, is dumb and silly; they focus on small details instead of on big, eternal truths. Geometers always talk about things like squaring and angles, as if they are only thinking about actions. But the real goal should be knowledge. It should lift the soul and create a love for wisdom; it should raise us up, not just help with small things like war tricks or improving skills.

Should we add astronomy as a third part of our education? “Good idea,” Glaucon said. “Knowing about the stars is important for farming, sailing, and war.” I like how you give useful reasons for everything to make friends with the world. It’s hard to prove to people that education isn’t just useful facts but also a way to clear the eye of the soul, which is better than the physical eye because only through it can we see truth. Now, are you talking to everyone or just to philosophers? Or would you rather just focus on yourself? “Everyone is their own best friend.” Then let’s take a step back because we are out of order, and add the third dimension, which is about solids, after the second dimension, which is about flat shapes. Then you can move on to solids that move.

But solid geometry isn’t popular and isn’t supported by the State, and its use isn’t fully understood; it’s hard, and those who study it are often arrogant and impatient. Still, the love of learning wins people over, and if the government helped a bit, we could make great progress. “That’s true,” said Glaucon. “So do I understand that we should start with flat shapes, then move to solid shapes, and third, study astronomy and how solids move?” Yes, I said; I was just rushing and made us confused.

“Good, now let’s talk about astronomy, and I’m happy to speak in your high style. Everyone can see that looking at the stars lifts the soul up.” I’m an exception; astronomy as it is studied now seems to me to pull the soul down, not up.

Star-gazing is just looking at the ceiling—no better than that; a person can lie on their back on land or water and look up or down, but that’s not science. The kind of knowledge I mean is seen not with the eyes but with the mind. All the beauty of the stars is just decoration of a copy that is far from the perfect original and doesn’t teach us about the true harmony or movement of things. Their beauty is like pictures drawn by a great artist, which can be used for examples, but no mathematician would expect to get true ideas of equality or number relations from them.
