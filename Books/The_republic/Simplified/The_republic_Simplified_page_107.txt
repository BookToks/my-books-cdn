Freedom can be bad, and being controlled by what’s good can feel like slavery. This happens to both people and countries. A person’s soul can be full of meanness and feel trapped, with the better part stuck under the worse part. They can’t do what they want, their mind is all mixed up, and they are the opposite of free.

A country that is like this will be poor and full of sadness, and the person’s soul will also be poor and full of pain. They will be very unhappy. But they won’t be the most unhappy person. The most unhappy is the tyrant, the person who is mean and also controls others in a bad way. 

You might think slave owners aren’t scared of their slaves because the whole city protects them. But if one of these owners was taken by a god to a place where no one could help him, he would be terrified. He would have to please his slaves and make promises he didn’t want to keep. If the god put him with neighbors who said no one should own slaves and that slave owners should be punished, it would be even worse.

A tyrant is like a prisoner of his own feelings, always trapped inside and jealous of people who can go outside and enjoy the world. 

With so many problems, the most miserable person will be even more miserable if they are a public leader. They control others but not themselves, like a sick person forced to compete in sports. They are the worst kind of slave and flatterer, always wanting more but never happy, always scared and distracted, just like the country they lead.

Their angry, jealous, and untrustworthy nature gets worse with power. They become more and more unfair, the most miserable person who causes misery to themselves and others. 

So, let’s say this clearly: The best and happiest people are those who have control over themselves. The worst people are those who are tyrants over themselves and their country. This is true whether gods or people watch them or not. This is our first proof. The second proof comes from the three kinds of pleasure that match three parts of the soul—reason, passion, and desire. Desire includes greed and wanting pleasure, while passion includes ambition, loyalty to groups, and wanting to be respected.
