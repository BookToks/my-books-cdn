Astronomy was mixed with symbols and myths. The big sphere of the sky is shown as a cylinder or box that holds the seven paths of the planets and the fixed stars. This cylinder hangs from an axis or spindle that turns on the knees of Necessity. The seven orbits inside the cylinder are controlled by the fates, and their smooth movement makes the music of the spheres. The spindle goes through the innermost or eighth path, which is the moon, but it’s unclear if this is the same as the column of light that pilgrims use to look at the heavens. Plato’s words suggest they are connected but not the same. The column itself is not made of diamond. The spindle (which is made of diamond) is attached to chains that reach the middle of the column of light. This column is said to hold the heavens together, but it’s not clear if it hangs from the spindle or is at a right angle to it.

The cylinder with the stars’ orbits is almost as symbolic as the figure of Necessity turning the spindle. The outer edge is the sphere of the fixed stars, but nothing is said about the spaces between the stars’ paths in the sky. The description is both a picture and a model of the heavens, so it doesn’t always make perfect sense. The column of light is not the Milky Way because the Milky Way is not straight or shaped like a rainbow. Instead, the column is the Earth’s imaginary axis. This is compared to a rainbow in terms of color, not shape, and not to the beams under a ship’s deck but to a straight rope running from the front to the back of the ship where the beams meet.

The model or picture of the heavens in the Republic is shown differently than the circles of the same and other in the Timaeus. In both, the fixed stars are separate from the planets, and the stars move in orbits without the planets, but in the opposite direction. In both the Republic and the Timaeus, everything moves around the world’s axis. But it’s not clear if in the Republic they move around the Earth. The Republic doesn’t clearly mention the circles of the same and other, though both the Timaeus and Republic say the fixed stars move with the whole system. The thickness of the rings might be to show the planets’ distances. Plato probably meant the Earth, where Er and his friends are watching the sky, to be still. It’s unclear if the Earth spins on its own, except maybe suggested by the axis turning (Timaeus). The viewer might look at the stars from above or below. The Earth is kind of both Earth and sky, like the sky in the Phaedrus, where the viewer can go out to see the stars and is carried around as they move. There is no difference between the equator and the ecliptic.

But Plato probably thought the planets move opposite to the fixed stars to explain how they look in the sky.

In the story about the meadow and the rewards or punishments after death, you can see some ideas from Homer.
