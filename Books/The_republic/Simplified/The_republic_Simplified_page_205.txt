No, he said, they couldn’t.

But if they stopped hurting each other, could they work better together?

Yes.

That’s because unfairness causes fights, hate, and problems, while fairness brings peace and friendship. Isn’t that right, Thrasymachus?

I agree, he said, because I don’t want to argue with you.

Good of you, I said. But I also want to know if unfairness, which causes hate wherever it exists—whether among slaves or free people—won’t make them hate each other and stop working together?

Definitely.

And even if only two people are unfair, won’t they fight and become enemies to each other and to fair people?

Yes, they will.

Now, if unfairness lives in just one person, would you say they lose their natural power or keep it?

Let’s say they keep it.

But isn’t unfairness the kind of power that, wherever it happens—in a city, army, family, or any group—it makes that group unable to work together because of chaos and fighting? Doesn’t it turn against itself and those who are fair? Isn’t that true?

Yes, definitely.

And unfairness is just as bad inside one person. First, it makes them unable to act because they are not in harmony with themselves. Second, it makes them their own enemy and an enemy to fair people. Isn’t that true, Thrasymachus?

Yes.

And, my friend, I said, surely the gods are fair?

Yes, they are.

So, if that’s true, unfair people are enemies of the gods, and fair people are their friends?
