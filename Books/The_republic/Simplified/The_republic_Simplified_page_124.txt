If he had understood what a person really is—that mix of general and specific things—or if he had known the difference between opinion and what we actually feel or sense (which can be confusing because of the way words are used), he wouldn’t have denied that the things we sense can be true.

But poets can also spread lies and fake stories in many parts of life and knowledge, just like the tricky speakers and teachers in the stories of Gorgias and Phaedrus. They are like fake priests, false prophets, lying spirits, and people who trick the world. Plato also said poets are friends of tyrants and enjoy the support of these cruel rulers. Tyrants have always used false ideas and teachers to keep their power—this happened in ancient Greece and Rome, and also in modern Europe.

No government can rule just by force alone. To keep control, they need to twist literature and morals, appeal to people’s imagination, pretend they have heaven’s support, and mix good with evil. Greek tyrants knew how important it was to make people feel proud of their culture. They cared about Olympic games, literature, and art. Plato was thinking about Greek poets who worked for rulers like Dionysius or Archelaus, and he got angry when these poets praised tyranny instead of freedom.

But Plato’s vision goes beyond his time. He saw all false teachers as creatures of the governments they lived under, and he compared the corruption of his time to the idea of a perfect society. To him, all the problems of mankind were shown in the speakers, teachers, poets, and rulers who lie and control the world.

Plato also didn’t like poetry and art because they stir up emotions. Today, people might disagree with him here, because emotions aren’t good or bad by themselves. Trying to get rid of emotions doesn’t really work; it’s better to control them by feeling them in a balanced way. Artists show ideas through feelings to help reason, to inspire courage or acceptance, or to suggest something endless and eternal that words alone can’t express.

True, the same artistic power that creates gods and heroes in great works can also be used to show something shallow, like a Corinthian courtesan. This just shows that art, like everything else, can be used for good or bad, and it connects with both the higher and lower parts of the soul. All art that imitates reality has limits and makes compromises. It gives up some truth to create a picture, and it doesn’t always show things exactly to reach an ideal.
