Far away, there is a fire. Between the fire and some prisoners, there is a raised path, and along this path, a low wall is built. It’s like the screen puppeteers use to show their puppets. Behind the wall, there are moving figures holding different kinds of art, like images of people and animals made of wood and stone. Some of the people passing by are talking, while others are quiet.  

“That’s strange,” he said, “and so are the prisoners.” I replied, “They are like us, and all they see are the shadows of the images that the fire throws on the wall of the cave. They give names to these shadows, and if there’s an echo from the wall, the voices they hear will seem to come from the shadows.”  

Now imagine if you suddenly turned the prisoners around and made them look at the real objects causing the shadows. Would they believe those real things were real? Their eyes would be dazzled, and they would try to get away from the bright light to something they can look at without blinking.  

Next, imagine they are dragged up a steep, rough path into the sunlight itself. Their eyes would be hurt by the strong light, and it would take time before they get used to seeing anything. At first, they would only see shadows and reflections in water. Then they would recognize the moon and stars, and finally, they would see the sun in its true place.  

At last, they would understand: “This is the sun that gives us the year and seasons, and it’s the source of everything we see.” They would be so happy to move from darkness into light! The honors and glories of the cave would seem worthless to them.  

But now imagine they go back down to the cave. In that underground place, they won’t see as well as the others and won’t be able to compete with them in judging the shadows on the wall. People will joke about the one who went to see the sun and lost his eyes. If anyone tries to free and teach one of the prisoners, the others will try to kill him if they can catch him.  

The cave or den is like the world we see. The fire is like the sun. The way up is the path to knowledge. In the world of knowledge, the idea of good is the last thing seen and the hardest to understand. But once it’s seen, it’s understood to be the source of goodness and rightness—the parent of light, truth, and understanding.  

Someone who reaches this perfect vision always wants to keep moving upward. He doesn’t want to go back to politics or courts of law because his eyes can’t handle the shadows he sees there. He can’t understand people who never learned the difference between shadows and real things.  

There are two kinds of blindness: one from moving out of darkness into light, and one from moving out of light back into darkness. A wise person will know the difference. He won’t laugh at both the same way. He will see blindness from too much light as a blessing and feel sorry for the other kind. If he laughs at the confused person staring at the sun, he has more reason to laugh than those in the cave who don’t want to leave.
