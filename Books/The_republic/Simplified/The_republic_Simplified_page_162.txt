They were amazed and confused by the old Egyptian monuments, which, as Plato says, were literally ten thousand years old. They compared how ancient Egypt was to how quickly people forget things in their own time.

The early stories of Greece don’t really connect with later history. There’s a gap between them, and no clear path linking one to the other. At the start of Greek history, in front of the temple, stands the figure of the lawmaker, who is both the messenger and helper of the god. The main laws he gives are not supposed to change over time or because of different situations.

Keeping the state safe depends on never breaking these laws. They were believed to be made by heaven, and changing them was seen as disrespectful. This idea explains why Plato was strongly against people changing religion or politics. But he was also okay with learning from other countries’ laws and sharing ideas privately. Any changes made later were still said to come from the original lawmaker. People even argued over whether new laws were really his words. Plato wanted future generations to remember the lawmaker’s ideas and to follow the rules he set. He didn’t want too many detailed rules but did allow some changes, as long as they didn’t change the government’s basic structure, like turning an aristocracy into a democracy.

Looking at real history, we see that progress has been the exception, not the rule. So, it’s not surprising that the idea of progress is actually a modern thought and only about a hundred or two hundred years old.

This idea came from how people saw the Roman Empire and the Christian Church grow, along with the political and social improvements they brought. Even more recently, it grew from the hopes of the French Revolution and American Independence, and from the wealth and population growth in England, its colonies, and America. It’s also linked to studying history more deeply. Some optimistic writers helped create this idea, while others thought the future looked dark. People who watch history from a big perspective see more and more purpose in how things have changed over time. But for someone living in a small part of Greece, their view was limited, like living in a valley.
