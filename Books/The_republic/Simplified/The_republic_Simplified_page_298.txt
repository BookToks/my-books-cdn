Definitely not.

Imagine a guy thinks he has done something wrong to someone else. The more honorable he is, the less likely he is to get angry when that person hurts him, like making him hungry, cold, or causing any other kind of pain. He thinks those things are fair, so his anger doesn’t get fired up by them.

That’s true, he said.

But when he feels he is the one being wronged, he gets really mad and restless. He believes he’s right, and even if he’s hungry, cold, or in pain, it only makes him want to keep fighting harder. His proud spirit won’t calm down until he either wins or loses, or until reason, like a shepherd’s voice, tells him to stop.

That example is perfect, he said. In our State, like we said before, the helpers were like dogs, and the rulers were their shepherds.

I see, I said, you understand me well. But there’s one more thing I want you to think about.

What is it?

You remember that passion or spirit seemed like a kind of desire at first, but now we say the opposite. In the battle inside the soul, spirit sides with reason.

Yes, definitely.

But here’s another question: Is passion different from reason, or is it just a part of reason? Because if it is, then instead of three parts in the soul, there would only be two—the rational and the desire parts. Or, since the State had three groups—traders, helpers, and leaders—maybe the soul also has a third part, passion or spirit, which, when not spoiled by bad teaching, naturally helps reason.

Yes, he said, there must be a third part.

Yes, I answered, if passion, which is already different from desire, is also different from reason.

That’s easy to prove. We can see even in young kids that they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, while some never really learn to use reason well, and most only manage it much later.
