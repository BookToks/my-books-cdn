Plato surprises us by saying that children should learn to lie first and then learn the truth later. But this is really just another way of saying that kids need to learn through imagination as well as logic. Their minds develop slowly, and sometimes they have to learn things without fully understanding them. This idea is part of Plato’s view, though he looked at truth and lies a bit differently from people today. 

Today, we wouldn’t accept lies unless they help people understand something or are needed because of how humans learn. We believe words must match what we mean, and we shouldn’t lie even if it’s to support what’s right. But Plato thought lies could be used carefully, only if they teach a good lesson and only by leaders for important reasons.

In Plato’s time, Greeks didn’t worry if their religion was historically true. They were just starting to realize that the past had a history, but all they really knew were stories from Homer and Hesiod. Whether these stories were true or not didn’t really change how they lived or ran their society. People only began to doubt the stories when they saw that some were bad examples.

This is true for all religions. People think about whether the stories are good or bad first, and only later about whether they are actually true. But today, especially in Protestant countries, many people want religion to be completely historically accurate, or they don’t believe in it at all. History and religion are very important, but the facts are often unclear. We learn the real lessons from religion when we look beyond the exact facts.

This shows that the difference between Plato’s views and ours isn’t as big as it seems. We should agree with him that the moral lessons in religion are more important than whether every detail is historically true. We also understand that old traditions change slowly, so we accept many things that science or critics might not.

A quick note: the idea of interpreting myths as symbols or stories with hidden meanings started as early as the 6th century BC by Theagenes of Rhegium. This idea was common in Plato’s time, but Plato rejected it for different reasons, like in his work called Phaedrus.
