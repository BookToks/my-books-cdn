If a poet writes about the suffering of Niobe—the story told in these iambic verses—or about the house of Pelops, or the Trojan War, or any similar topic, we have to be careful about what they say. They shouldn’t say these things are the work of God. Or, if they do say they come from God, they need to explain it properly. They must say that God does what is just and right, and that the people punished became better because of it. But they can’t say that God causes misery. It’s okay to say that bad people are unhappy because they need to be punished and that punishment from God helps them. But saying God, who is good, causes evil is wrong and should never be allowed to be said or heard in any good society. That idea is harmful and disrespectful.

I agree with you, he replied, and I’m ready to accept this rule.

Then let’s make this one of our rules about the gods: poets and storytellers must follow it — that God is not the cause of everything, but only of good things.

That sounds good, he said.

What about a second rule? Should I ask you if God is like a magician, who changes shape and tricks us by turning into different forms? Or is God always the same, unchanging and true to his own nature?

I can’t answer that without thinking more, he said.

Well, I said, if something changes, that change must be caused either by the thing itself or by something else, right?

Definitely.

And things that are at their best are also the least likely to change or fall apart. For example, when a person is healthiest and strongest, their body isn’t easily affected by food or drink. And a plant that is growing well doesn’t suffer much from wind or heat or other things like that.

Of course.

And wouldn’t the bravest and wisest soul be the least likely to be confused or disturbed by anything outside of it?
