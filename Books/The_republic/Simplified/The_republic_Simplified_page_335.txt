Very true, he said.

So, someone who likes all kinds of knowledge, is curious to learn, and is never satisfied can be called a philosopher. Am I right?

Glaucon said: If being curious makes someone a philosopher, then lots of strange people would have that title. People who love seeing things also enjoy learning, so they should be included. Music fans are also strange among philosophers because they don’t usually join deep discussions. Instead, they run around at festivals, listening to every song, no matter where it is. Should we say all these people and others like them, plus people who teach small skills, are philosophers?

Definitely not, I replied; they just copy real philosophers.

He asked: Then who are the real philosophers?

I said, the real philosophers are those who love searching for the truth.

That sounds good, he said; but what do you mean?

I said, it might be hard to explain to someone else, but I’m sure you’ll agree with what I’m about to say.

What is it?

I said, since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they must be two different things.

Certainly.

And since they are two, each one is just one thing?

True again.

The same goes for just and unjust, good and evil, and other pairs. Each is one thing by itself, but when they mix with actions and other things, they show up in many ways.

Very true.

This is the difference I see between people who just like seeing, art, or practical stuff, and the ones I’m talking about who deserve to be called philosophers.
