When a young man who was raised in a strict and selfish way tastes the sweetness of life and starts hanging out with wild and tricky people who can give him all kinds of fun and pleasures, you can guess what happens next.  

He begins to change from being controlled by strict rules to wanting more freedom and equality inside himself.  

Just like in a city where groups help each other to change things, the young man’s own desires team up with similar new wants from outside him to help this change happen.  

If there is anyone supporting his old strict side, like a father or family member giving advice or scolding him, then his soul becomes divided and he fights with himself.  

Sometimes, the side that wants freedom gives way to the strict side again, some desires fade away, and a feeling of respect comes back into him, bringing order to his life.  

But after those old desires leave, new ones grow that are similar to them, and since his father doesn’t know how to guide these new wants, they become strong and many.  

These new desires pull him back to his old friends, and by secretly meeting with them, they grow and multiply inside him.  

Eventually, they take over the strongest part of his mind, which he sees as empty of good qualities, true interests, and honest thoughts—things that protect the minds of people who are close to the gods.  

Then, false and proud ideas and words rise up and take their place instead.  

They always do that.
