Wouldn’t someone who is meant to be a guardian, besides being brave, need to have the qualities of a thinker?

I don’t quite understand what you mean.

The quality I’m talking about, I said, can also be seen in dogs, and it’s very noticeable in them.

What quality?

Well, a dog gets angry when it sees a stranger, but it welcomes someone it knows, even though the stranger hasn’t hurt it and the friend hasn’t done it any favors. Have you never thought that was strange?

I never thought about it before, but I can see you’re right.

And this natural behavior of the dog is really interesting; your dog is like a true thinker.

Why?

Because it tells friends from enemies just by knowing and not knowing them. And doesn’t an animal have to love learning if it decides what it likes and dislikes based on what it knows or doesn’t know?

Definitely.

And isn’t loving learning the same as loving wisdom, which is what philosophy is?

Yes, they’re the same.

So can we also say for sure that a person who is gentle to friends and people they know must naturally love wisdom and knowledge?

Yes, we can say that.

Then someone who is going to be a really good and noble guardian of the State will need to have philosophy, courage, quickness, and strength all together?

Absolutely.

Now that we know what qualities are needed, how should these people be raised and taught? Isn’t this question important because it can help us understand a bigger question—how do justice and injustice grow in States? We don’t want to leave out what’s important or make the argument too long.

I thought this question would be very helpful to us.
