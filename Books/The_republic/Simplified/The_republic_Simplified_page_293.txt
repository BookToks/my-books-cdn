How else can they get there? Take the quality of passion or spirit – it would be silly to think that this quality, when found in countries, doesn’t come from the people who live there, like the Thracians, Scythians, and other northern groups. The same goes for the love of knowledge, which is typical of our part of the world, or the love of money, which can be said to belong to the Phoenicians and Egyptians.

Exactly, he said.

It’s easy to understand this.

No problem at all.

But the question gets harder when we ask if these qualities are three different things or just one. In other words, do we learn with one part of our nature, get angry with another, and want to satisfy our natural desires with a third? Or does the whole soul take part in every action? That’s the tricky part.

Yes, he said; that’s where the problem is.

So, let’s try to figure out if they are the same or different.

How can we do that? he asked.

I answered like this: The same thing can’t act or be acted on in the same way and about the same thing at the same time if those ways contradict each other. So, whenever this kind of contradiction happens in things that seem the same, we know they are actually different.

Good.

For example, I said, can the same thing be both still and moving at the same time in the same part?

No way.

Still, I said, let’s be more precise with our words so we don’t get mixed up later. Imagine a man who is standing still but moving his hands and head. If someone said that the same person is moving and standing still at the same moment, we should disagree and say that one part is moving while another part is still.

Very true.

And if someone tried to be even more exact and said that whole tops, when they spin around a fixed point, are both still and moving at the same time (and they might say this about anything that spins in one spot), we wouldn’t accept that. Because in these cases, parts of the thing are not both still and moving. Instead, we say they have an axis and a rim, and the axis stays still because it doesn’t lean, while the rim goes around.
