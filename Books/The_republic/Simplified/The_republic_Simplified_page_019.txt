Here, Thrasymachus, who has tried to interrupt a few times but was stopped, takes advantage of a pause and jumps in, roaring like a wild animal. "Socrates," he says, "what nonsense is this? Why do you agree to be beaten by each other in a fake argument?" He then says we can’t use the usual definitions of justice. Socrates answers that he wouldn’t know how to say what twelve is if he couldn’t use things like 2 x 6 or 3 x 4.

At first, Thrasymachus doesn’t want to argue. But finally, when the group promises to pay him and Socrates says he will praise him, Thrasymachus agrees to start. "Listen," he says, "my answer is that power is what’s right, and justice is what’s best for the stronger people. Now praise me." Socrates wants to understand first. He asks, "Do you mean that because Polydamas the wrestler, who is stronger than us, benefits from eating beef, the rest of us should too, even though we aren’t as strong?"

Thrasymachus gets angry at this example and uses fancy words to try to make his point sound more important. He says rulers make laws to help themselves. But Socrates asks, "What if the ruler makes a mistake? Then what’s best for the stronger person isn’t really their interest." Thrasymachus almost loses the argument here, but his student Cleitophon steps in. He changes the point to say it’s not the real interest of the ruler that matters, but what the ruler thinks or seems to think is their interest. This way, they avoid the problem because even if the ruler’s real interest and what they think their interest is are different, the “justice” is based on what the ruler thinks.

Of course, this wasn’t what Thrasymachus said at first, and he doesn’t even agree with this new meaning. But Socrates doesn’t want to fight over words, especially since Thrasymachus seems to have changed his mind. After this, Thrasymachus actually takes back his idea that rulers can make mistakes and says rulers are always right. Socrates is okay with this new idea and uses it against Thrasymachus by comparing it to arts and skills. Every art or science has a goal, which is different from what the artist accidentally wants. Its goal is only about what’s good for the people or things it works with. Justice, Socrates says, is about what’s good for the people under the ruler, not the ruler himself.

Thrasymachus is close to losing the argument when he suddenly changes the subject. "Tell me, Socrates," he asks, "do you have a nurse?" What a strange question! Socrates asks why. Thrasymachus says, "Because if you do, she lets you wander around like a baby and hasn’t even taught you to tell the shepherd from the sheep. You think shepherds and rulers care only about their sheep or subjects, but the truth is they fatten them up for their own use, both sheep and subjects."
