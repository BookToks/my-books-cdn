I have loved Homer since I was a kid, and even now I think he is the best at writing sad and serious poetry. But as much as I love him, I love the truth more, so I have to say something. First, can you explain what imitation means? Because I really don’t get it.  

You might say, “How could I understand?” That could be true, because sometimes people who aren’t smart see things more clearly than those who are. But when you are here, I don’t feel comfortable saying what I really think.  

So let’s start the old way, with the idea of universals. Let’s say beds and tables exist. There is one idea of a bed or a table that the maker had in mind when making them. The maker didn’t create the idea of beds and tables, but made beds and tables based on those ideas.  

Isn’t there a maker of all things, like the earth, sky, plants, and animals? He made the gods too. “He must be a wizard!” But don’t you see you could kind of do the same? You can use a mirror to catch the reflection of the sun, earth, or anything else – and then you’ve made them.  

“Yes, but only as a reflection.” Exactly, and a painter is like that. A painter’s work is less real than a carpenter’s, but neither the carpenter nor any artist makes the perfect bed.  

“Philosophers don’t believe that.” We shouldn’t be surprised their beds aren’t perfect. Think about this: there are three beds – one made by nature or God, one made by a carpenter, and one painted by an artist. God only made one perfect bed, and there can’t be two perfect beds, because if there were, there would always be a third, more perfect idea that includes both.  

So God is the true maker of the bed, the carpenter is a lower-level maker, and the painter just copies what the carpenter made. The painter’s work is three steps away from reality. The tragic poet is also an imitator and is three steps away from the truth and the king.  

The painter doesn’t copy the real bed, but the carpenter’s bed. And even though it’s not really different, it looks different and can be seen from many angles. The painter only shows one angle, a piece of the whole, which is just an image.  

A painter can even paint other artists without knowing anything about their skills, and still trick kids or simple people. Now imagine someone told us they met a man who knew everything better than anyone else. Wouldn’t we think that person is a fool who met a wizard and thought he was all-knowing?  

And when we hear people say Homer and the tragedians know all skills and all good things, shouldn’t we think they are fooled in the same way?
