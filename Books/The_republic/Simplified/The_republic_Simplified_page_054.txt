Isn’t the reason for this that different parts, whether in a country or in a person, each do their own jobs? Justice is what makes people and countries fair and right.  

A long time ago, people dreamed that each person would have one specific job to do. That dream has now come true in justice, which brings together the three parts of the soul and makes them work well together in every part of life.  

Injustice is when the lower parts of the soul don’t listen or obey. It’s the opposite of justice and causes problems, like how sickness harms the body. Just like good or bad actions shape our habits, virtue is like health and beauty for the soul, while vice is like sickness and weakness.  

Now, the old question comes back: Is it better to be just or unjust? That question is silly. Injustice is like a deadly disease that makes life not worth living. Come with me to the hill above the city and look down at true virtue and many kinds of vice. There are four special kinds of vice that show up in both countries and people.  

The country that fits true virtue is the one we’ve been talking about, where reason rules—this can be called either a monarchy or an aristocracy. So, there are five types of countries and souls in total.  

Plato tries to prove that the soul has three separate parts by looking at what makes each part different. He says the parts are different because they do different jobs. The same part can’t do opposite things.  

But early thinkers had a hard time with this idea, so Plato carefully explains what contradiction means. First, a contradiction has to happen at the same time and in the same way. Second, no extra words should be added that change the meaning, like saying thirst is for drink, not warm drink.  

He suggests that if someone doesn’t drink because of reason or anger, it shows thirst is different from anger and reason. But if we say things like “angry thirst” or “revengeful desire,” then the ideas get mixed up and confusing. So, we can’t allow those kinds of mixed terms.  

There’s one exception: the word “good” is always part of what we desire. These talks happened before logic was fully developed, and anyone who finds them boring should remember they were needed to help people understand ideas when the human mind was just starting to grow.  

Plato’s psychology goes no further than dividing the soul into three parts: the rational, the angry, and the wanting parts. As far as we know, he was the first to do this, and Aristotle and later thinkers kept using this idea.
