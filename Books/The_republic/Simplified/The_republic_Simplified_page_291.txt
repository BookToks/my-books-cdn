Yes.

 Verytrue.
 
 Think, now, and say whether you agree with me or not. Suppose a carpenter tobedoingthebusinessofacobbler, oracobblerofacarpenter; andsuppose them to exchange their implements or their duties, or the same person to be doingtheworkofboth,orwhateverbethechange;doyouthinkthatanygreat harmwouldresulttotheState?
 
 Notmuch.
 
 But when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a trader, havinghisheartliftedupbywealthorstrengthorthenumberofhisfollowers, or any like advantage, attempts to force his way into the class of warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators and guardians, for which he is unfitted, and either to take the implements or the duties of the other; or when one man is trader,legislator,andwarriorallinone,thenIthinkyouwillagreewithmein sayingthatthisinterchangeandthismeddlingofonewithanotheristheruin oftheState.
 
 Mosttrue.
 
 Seeing then, I said, that there are three distinct classes, any meddling of one withanother,orthechangeofoneintoanother,isthegreatestharmtotheState, andmaybemostjustlytermedevil-doing?
 
 Precisely.
 
 And the greatest degree of evil-doing to one’s own city would be termed by youinjustice?
 
 Certainly.

 Iagreewithyou.
