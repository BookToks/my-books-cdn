Yes.

Justice means doing what belongs to you and sticking to your own role, right?

That’s true.

Now think about this and tell me if you agree. What if a carpenter started doing a cobbler’s work, or a cobbler did a carpenter’s job? Or if they swapped tools or tasks, or one person did both jobs—do you think the city would suffer a lot from that?

Not really.

But when someone, like a trader, tries to act like a warrior or a lawmaker—even though they’re not meant for that—and tries to take over those roles, that causes big problems. Or if one person tries to be a trader, a lawmaker, and a warrior all at once, that mix-up and messing with other roles ruins the city.

That makes sense.

So, since there are three separate groups, when one messes with another or tries to change into a different group, that’s the worst harm to the city and can be called doing something really wrong?

Exactly.

And the worst kind of wrong-doing to your own city is called injustice?

Yes, definitely.

So, injustice is when people don’t do their own jobs, but when the trader, helper, and guardian each do their own job, that’s justice and it makes the city fair.

I agree with you.

We won’t say this is 100% true yet. But if this idea about justice works for both the city and the individual, then there won’t be any doubt. If it doesn’t work, we’ll have to look into it again. First, let’s finish the investigation we started, remembering that if we understand justice on a big scale, it will be easier to understand it in individuals.
