Sure.

The musician who only practices simple exercises won’t have much to do with medicine unless in a really serious case.

I totally agree.

The exercises and tools he uses are meant to wake up the lively part of his nature, not to make him stronger; he won’t build muscles like regular athletes do with workouts and routines.

Exactly, he said.

Also, music and exercise aren’t really made for what people usually think — one for training the soul, the other for training the body.

Then what is their real purpose?

I think, I said, both teachers mostly want to improve the soul.

How’s that possible? he asked.

Have you ever noticed, I said, how focusing only on exercise affects the mind differently than focusing only on music?

In what way? he said.

Exercise makes people tough and fierce, while music makes them soft and gentle, I answered.

Yeah, he said, I know athletes can become too wild, and musicians can be too soft and weak.

But, I said, this fierceness comes from spirit, which, if taught right, gives courage, but if too strong, can turn cruel and harsh.

I agree with that.

On the other hand, philosophers are gentle. This can become weakness if overdone, but if taught well, they stay kind and balanced.

True.

And don’t you think the guardians should have both these qualities?
