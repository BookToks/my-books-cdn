Ask the question like this: Which is more real – something that cares about things that never change, live forever, and are true, or something that cares about things that change and die, and is itself changing and dying?

The one that cares about things that never change is more real.

Does the part that never changes have knowledge just as much as its real nature?

Yes, it has knowledge just as much.

And does it have truth just as much?

Yes.

And if something has less truth, does it also have less real nature?

Definitely.

So, things that serve the body have less truth and real nature than things that serve the soul?

Much less.

And isn’t the body itself less real and true than the soul?

Yes.

What is filled with more real existence and actually has more real existence is more truly filled than what has less real existence and is less real?

Of course.

And if there’s pleasure in being filled with what fits your true nature, then what is more truly filled with real existence will enjoy true pleasure more; while what has less real existence will feel less true pleasure and only fake, less real pleasure?

Absolutely.

So, people who don’t know wisdom and goodness, and who are always focused on eating and pleasure, go up and down like they’re stuck in the middle. They move around randomly in life, but they never reach the true higher world. They don’t even look for it or find it, and they are never truly filled with real being or taste pure and lasting pleasure.
