 Adeimantus objects first of all to the form of the Socratic reasoning, thus showingthatPlatoisawareoftheimperfectionofhisownmethod. Hebrings the accusation against himself which might be brought against him by a modern logician–that he extracts the answer because he knows how to put the question. In a long argument words are apt to change their meaning slightly, orpremisesmaybeassumedorconclusionsinferredwithrathertoomuchcertainty or universality; the variation at each step may be unobserved, and yet at last the divergence becomes considerable. Hence the failure of attempts to apply arithmetical or algebraic formulae to logic. The imperfection, or rather the higher and more elastic nature of language, does not allow words to have the precision ofnumbers or of symbols. And thisquality in language impairs theforceofanargumentwhichhasmanysteps.
 
 Theobjection,thoughfairlymetbySocratesinthisparticularinstance,maybe regarded as implying a reflection upon the Socratic mode of reasoning. And here,aselsewhere,PlatoseemstointimatethatthetimehadcomewhenthenegativeandinterrogativemethodofSocratesmustbesupersededbyapositive and constructive one, of which examples are given in some of the later dialogues.
