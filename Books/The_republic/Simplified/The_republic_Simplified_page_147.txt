A free person can’t have their feelings controlled by law; and trying to enforce such laws would be impossible because it’s unclear when marriage should be stopped.

Who can judge if being good or lucky is more important than health, or if mental and moral qualities matter more than the body? Who can compare chances against things that are certain? Some suffering has helped people grow kinder, and some illnesses, like consumption, have even made people more gentle. Young people don’t have enough experience to understand these complicated ideas; parents often don’t think about them, or they think about them too late. These problems might be avoided by moving to a new place, starting a new life, or caring about a home. People argue when their minds are already made up and their lives are tied together. Also, there’s no real proof that people think carefully about these things before marrying, because love is a strong feeling that’s hard to resist.

Finally, anyone who has seen how strong feelings start in youth, how hard it is to control them, and how much they affect a person, knows that our way of dealing with them isn’t good enough. It’s strange that such an important part of life is left to chance or kept secret. Instead of being guided or understood, young people are only expected to follow outside rules about what’s proper. Philosophers don’t think this is a safe or good way to live. Still, those who care for young people can help by watching over them, showing love, living honest lives, giving advice, and reminding them to be careful. This can help reduce the terrible problems that hurt individuals and damage the morals of whole nations. It’s important for anyone giving advice not to share secrets too soon, or they might have too much control over someone, or cause lasting bad feelings by forcing them to admit things.

Plato was right when he said that family ties can get in the way of bigger goals. Some people have given up what’s best for all humans to support a group, and others have given up what’s best for mankind or their country to focus on family. Taking care of kids, needing money to support them, rich people flattering poor people, social class divisions, pride in family or wealth, and family life itself can stop people from chasing big dreams or heroic goals. These problems are just as common now as they were in Plato’s time. But if we want to see the good side of family—how it helps love grow, makes society nicer, and how family members care for each other—we shouldn’t argue with Plato. Maybe we should even thank him for showing us the other side.
