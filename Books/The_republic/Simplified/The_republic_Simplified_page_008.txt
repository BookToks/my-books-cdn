Sir G.C. Lewis in the Classical Museum says that this work was probably written after Plato’s time. It is divided into five parts.

The first part includes Book I and the start of Book II, up to the paragraph that begins, “I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus.” This section argues against popular and tricky ideas about justice but doesn’t come to a clear conclusion. It also explains what most people think justice is and asks the question: What is justice when you take away all the appearances?

The second part covers the rest of Book II and all of Books III and IV. These books focus on building the first State and its education system.

The third part includes Books V, VI, and VII. Here, the main topic is philosophy instead of justice. The second State is built on ideas of sharing everything and is ruled by philosophers. Instead of social and political virtues, people focus on the idea of the good.

The fourth part contains Books VIII and IX. These books look at how States and the people in them can become twisted or corrupt. They also study pleasure and tyranny in individuals.

The fifth and final part is Book X. It wraps everything up by looking at how philosophy and poetry relate to each other and talks about the happiness of citizens in this life, which is completed by the hope of another life.

A simpler way to divide the work is into two parts. The first part (Books I-IV) describes a State based on Greek ideas of religion and morals. The second part (Books V-X) changes this Greek State into an ideal kingdom ruled by philosophy, where all other governments are seen as wrong versions.

These two views are really opposite, but Plato hides this conflict with his skill. The Republic, like another work called the Phaedrus, is not perfect. The best ideas of philosophy break through the usual Greek way of thinking but then fade away into something higher.

We don’t know if this imperfection is because the plan got bigger, or because Plato’s own thoughts were still coming together, or maybe because he wrote the work at different times. These questions are like those about the Iliad and the Odyssey—interesting but without clear answers.

In Plato’s time, there was no regular way to publish books. Authors could change or add to their work since only a few friends might read it. It’s possible Plato paused his work sometimes or switched between projects. This would happen more with long works than short ones.

When trying to figure out the order Plato wrote his dialogues by looking at the text, this uncertainty about when each part was written makes things difficult. This problem affects longer works like the Republic and the Laws more than the shorter ones.
