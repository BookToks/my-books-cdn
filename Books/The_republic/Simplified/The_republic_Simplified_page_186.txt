That's true, he said. I think we need to fix a mistake we've made about the words "friend" and "enemy." What mistake, Polemarchus? I asked.

We thought a friend is someone who seems good or is thought to be good.

And how should we fix the mistake?

We should say that a friend is someone who really is good as well as seems good; and someone who only seems good but isn’t, is not really a friend. The same goes for enemies.

You mean the good people are our friends and the bad people are our enemies?

Yes.

So instead of just saying, like we did at first, that it’s right to do good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should say it’s right to do good to our friends only when they are good, and harm our enemies only when they are bad?

Yes, that seems to be the truth.

But should a just person hurt anyone at all?

Definitely, they should hurt those who are both wicked and enemies.

When horses are hurt, do they get better or worse?

Worse.

Worse in their good qualities, right? Not like dogs?

Yes, worse in horses.

And dogs get worse in their good qualities, not horses?

Of course.

And won’t people who are hurt become worse in what makes them truly human?

Certainly.

And that true human quality is justice?

Of course.

Then people who are hurt become unjust?

That’s the result.
