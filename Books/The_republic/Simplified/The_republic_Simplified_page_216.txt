Homer talks about a king who is famous for being fair and just, almost like a god. This king’s land grows plenty of wheat and barley, his trees are full of fruit, his sheep always have babies, and the sea gives him lots of fish.

Even better rewards come from heaven, according to Musaeus and his son. They say the good and fair people get to go to the underworld, where saints lie on couches at a never-ending party, always drunk and wearing flower crowns. They seem to think that being drunk forever is the best reward for being good. Some people say the good deeds of the just live on for three or four generations after them. This is how they praise justice.

But for the bad people, it’s a different story. They get buried in a swamp in the underworld and have to carry water in a sieve, which is impossible. Even while alive, they get a bad reputation and suffer punishments like those described by Glaucon for people who are good but seem bad. That’s all their stories say about the wicked. This is how they praise the good and criticize the bad.

Now, Socrates, I want you to think about another way people talk about justice and injustice. This way is not just from poets but also from writers who use normal speech. Most people agree that being just and good is honorable but hard and tiring. They say doing bad things and being unfair is easier and more fun, and only laws and public opinion stop people from doing wrong.

They also say being honest usually doesn’t make you much money, while being dishonest is more profitable. They often call bad people happy and respect them when they are rich or powerful. At the same time, they ignore or look down on poor or weak people, even if they know they are better.

The strangest thing they say is about virtue and the gods. They believe the gods give bad things to good people and good things to bad people. Some poor prophets go to rich people and convince them that the gods gave them the power to fix sins through sacrifices, charms, parties, and celebrations. They promise to hurt anyone the rich want, whether they are good or bad, using magic and spells that tie up the gods to do their bidding.

These prophets use poets as proof. They quote Hesiod, who says that doing bad things is easy and close by, but being good is hard and takes a long time. They also quote Homer, who says the gods can be influenced by people. Homer says people pray and offer sacrifices to calm the gods’ anger when they have sinned or done wrong.
