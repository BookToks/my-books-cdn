Yes.

So, good actions cause justice, and bad actions cause injustice?

That’s for sure.

And health is like a natural order where the parts of the body work together, while disease happens when something goes wrong with this natural order?

True.

Isn’t justice also a natural order where parts of the soul work together, and injustice is when this order is messed up?

Exactly, he said.

So, virtue is like the health, beauty, and happiness of the soul, and vice is like the sickness, weakness, and ugliness of it?

True.

And don’t good habits lead to virtue, while bad habits lead to vice?

Definitely.

But we still haven’t answered the old question: Which is better—being just and doing good, whether or not anyone sees it, or being unjust and doing wrong if you can get away with it?

I think, Socrates, this question is now silly. We know that if the body is sick, life isn’t good, no matter how much food, money, or power you have. So why would anyone think life is good if the soul itself is corrupted, even if they can do whatever they want, except become just and good or avoid being unjust and bad—assuming justice and virtue are as we said?

Yes, I agree, the question is silly. But since we are in the perfect place to see the truth clearly, let’s not give up now.

Of course not, he replied.
