 BOOK I. The Republic opens with a truly Greek scene–a festival in honour of the goddess Bendis which is held in the Piraeus; to this is added the promise of anequestrian torch-racein theevening. The wholework is supposedto be recited by Socrates on the day after the festival to a small party, consisting of Critias,Timaeus,Hermocrates,andanother;thiswelearnfromthefirstwords oftheTimaeus.
