Plato shows Socrates as someone who doesn’t really belong to this world. This idea fits with the perfect society and other strange ideas in the Republic, even though these might not be exactly what Socrates thought. Like many great teachers, Socrates saw the world as full of mistakes and bad things. Most people don’t agree with this or only believe it a little. Even Socrates sometimes felt people looked at him with a mix of pity or love.

Most people can’t understand deep philosophy and don’t get along with philosophers. But they can’t help but misunderstand them because they never see the real philosopher; they only know fake ideas that don’t really have truth. Their leaders are not like true philosophers and don’t match their level. But these people should be pitied or laughed at, not argued with, because they mean well even if their ideas are wrong and cause more problems. Socrates is kind to those who are wrong, which is one of his main traits in the Republic. No matter who writes about Socrates, he is always shown as someone who never stops looking for the truth, which makes him who he is.

Now, we can look at what the Republic talks about and then think about (1) the main ideas of the Greek perfect state, and (2) how we can understand Plato’s ideas today.

The Republic starts with a very Greek scene – a festival for the goddess Bendis in the port of Piraeus. There is also a promise of a horse torch-race that evening. The whole story is supposed to be told by Socrates the day after the festival to a small group of friends, including Critias, Timaeus, Hermocrates, and another person. We learn this from the beginning of the dialogue called Timaeus.

After this introduction, the story focuses on the conversation itself without mentioning the audience again or how long the talk lasts. Out of the many people there, only three really join the conversation. We don’t know if they went to the torch-race later or stayed up talking all night like in another famous dialogue called the Symposium. The talk starts when Socrates and his friend Glaucon are about to leave the festival but get stopped by a message from Polemarchus. He soon shows up with Adeimantus, Glaucon’s brother, and playfully forces them to stay, promising not just the torch-race but also the fun of talking with young people, which Socrates likes much more.
