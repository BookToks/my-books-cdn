Isn't it true? The main goal of a State is to become as rich as possible, and people always want more and more.

So what happens then?

The rulers know their power depends on their wealth, so they don’t stop young people from spending too much. They actually benefit when these young people go broke because the rulers lend them money and buy their property, making themselves richer and more powerful.

That makes sense.

It’s clear that people can’t both love money and be moderate at the same time. One of those feelings will be ignored.

That’s pretty obvious.

In States ruled by a few rich people, because many are careless and spend too much, families that used to be well-off often end up poor.

Yes, that happens a lot.

But these poor people still live in the city; they’re ready to fight and many owe money or have lost their citizenship. Some are in both situations. They hate the rich people who took their property and want to start a revolution.

That’s true.

Meanwhile, the business people, walking with their heads down and acting like they don’t even see those they’ve ruined, use their money to trick others who aren’t careful. They multiply their wealth many times over, making many people lazy and poor in the State.

Yes, there are definitely a lot of those people.

The problem keeps growing like a fire, and it won’t stop by limiting how people use their property or by other solutions. What else can be done?

The next best thing, which makes citizens responsible, is to have a rule that everyone should make contracts at their own risk. This would reduce the crazy money-making and the problems we talked about in the State.

Yes, that would help a lot.
