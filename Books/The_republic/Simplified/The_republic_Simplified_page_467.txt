Exactly.

The kind of art that just copies others is not very good, like when two people who aren’t very great have kids who aren’t very great either.

Very true.

Is this only about what we see, or does it also include what we hear, like poetry?

It’s probably the same for poetry.

Don’t just guess based on how painting works; let’s look deeper and see if the skill poets use to copy things is good or bad.

Sure, let’s do that.

Here’s the question: Imitation copies what people do, whether they mean to or not, and they react with happiness or sadness depending on whether the result is good or bad. Is that all there is?

Yes, that’s all.

Yes.

But will he feel no sadness at all, or do we say that even if he can’t stop feeling sad, he controls it better?
