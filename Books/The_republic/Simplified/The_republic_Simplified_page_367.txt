Yes, we will take all the care we can: let's continue.

Yes, I said, but first I need to make sure we understand each other, and remind you of something I mentioned before during this talk and many other times.

What is it?

It's the old idea that there are many beautiful things and many good things, and other things too, which we call "many."

That's true, he said.

And there is also an absolute beauty and an absolute good, and for the other things we call "many," there is an absolute idea that covers them all, called the essence of each.

Very true.

The many things we see but don't fully understand, and the ideas we know but can't see.

Exactly.

And what sense do we use to see visible things?

Sight, he said.

And with hearing, we hear, and with the other senses, we notice other things, right?

True.

But have you noticed that sight is by far the most complex and expensive sense that the maker of senses ever created?

No, I never thought about that, he said.

Then think about it: does the ear or voice need anything extra to hear or be heard?

No, nothing like that.

No, I said; and the same goes for most, if not all, other senses—you wouldn’t say any of them need something extra?

Definitely not.

But you see, without adding some other kind of nature, there is no seeing or being seen.
