Socrates often points out his weaknesses, but he won’t let his brother Adeimantus criticize him.

He is a soldier and, like Adeimantus, fought bravely at the battle of Megara around 456 BC. Adeimantus is more serious and thoughtful, often making deeper arguments. Glaucon is more lively and usually starts the conversation. Adeimantus takes the argument further. Glaucon is more energetic and quick to understand, while Adeimantus has the wise judgment of an experienced adult.

In the second book, Glaucon insists that justice and injustice should be discussed without thinking about the results. Adeimantus says that people usually care about justice because of its consequences. Later, in the fourth book, Adeimantus points out that Socrates fails to make his citizens happy. Socrates replies that happiness is not the main goal but a result of good government.

When they talk about religion and myths, Adeimantus answers, but Glaucon jokes and shifts the conversation to music and exercise until the end of the book. Adeimantus also criticizes the common sense way Socrates argues and won’t let Socrates avoid talking about women and children. Adeimantus handles the serious parts of the discussion, while Glaucon takes the lighter, more creative parts.

For example, in the sixth book, Adeimantus talks about why philosophy can go wrong and about the idea of good. Glaucon comes back as the main respondent but struggles to understand Socrates’ higher education and makes some mistakes in the discussion.

Adeimantus mentions his brother Glaucon again, comparing him to a difficult state. In the next book, Glaucon takes over until the end.

Plato uses different characters to show stages of morality. It starts with the old-fashioned Athenian gentleman, then a practical man who lives by common sayings. After that comes the wild ideas of the Sophists, and finally the young students of Socrates who know the Sophists’ tricks but want to understand things more deeply. These characters, like Cephalus, Polemarchus, and Thrasymachus, are all different. In the Republic or any other work by Plato, a character doesn’t appear twice.

The way Socrates is shown in the Republic isn’t always the same. In the first book, he seems more like the real Socrates, as described by Xenophon and in Plato’s early works and the Apology. He is ironic, teasing, questioning, and a strong opponent of the Sophists. He can be both funny and serious.
