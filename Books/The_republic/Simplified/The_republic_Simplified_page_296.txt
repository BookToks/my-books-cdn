Sure.

Does it have a special quality that no other thing has?

Yes.

And it has this special quality because it is about a certain kind of object; is that true for other arts and sciences too?

Yes.

So, if I explained myself well, you will understand what I meant about relatives. I meant that if one part of a relation is looked at alone, the other part is also looked at alone; if one part has a quality, the other part also has a quality. I don’t mean that relatives can’t be different, or that the science of health is healthy, or that the science of disease is sick, or that the sciences of good and evil are themselves good or evil. I only mean that when the word science is not used in a general way but is about a specific object—like the nature of health and disease—it becomes defined, and is then called not just science, but the science of medicine.

I understand completely, and I think the same way you do.

Wouldn’t you say that thirst is one of these relative terms, clearly connected to something else?

Yes, thirst is related to drink.

And a certain kind of thirst is related to a certain kind of drink; but thirst by itself is not more or less, or good or bad, or linked to any specific drink, just to drink in general?

Definitely.

Then the soul of a thirsty person, as long as they are thirsty, only wants to drink; that’s what they long for and try to get?

That’s obvious.

And if you imagine something that pulls a thirsty person away from drinking, that must be different from the thirsty part that drives them like an animal to drink; because, as we said, the same thing can’t at the same time and in the same way act in opposite directions about the same thing.

That’s impossible.

It’s just like you can’t say that the hands of an archer both push and pull the bow at the same time, but you can say one hand pushes and the other pulls.
