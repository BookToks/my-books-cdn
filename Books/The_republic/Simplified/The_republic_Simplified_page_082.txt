Isn’t it silly to try to find these things in the sky, where everything is messy and imperfect? The stars, the sun, the days and nights—they don’t follow perfect patterns. The only way to make astronomy truly scientific is by solving problems. So, forget about the sky for now and use your mind instead.

Math can be used for other things too, like the Pythagoreans said, and I agree. There’s a science about musical harmony that works with the ear, just like astronomy works with the eye. There might be other uses as well. Let’s ask the Pythagoreans about these, but remember, our goal is bigger than theirs—it’s about connecting these sciences to the idea of what’s good. The same mistake made in astronomy happens in music too. Musicians listen with their ears, not their minds. 

“Yes,” said Glaucon, "I like to see them putting their ears next to their neighbors’ faces—some say, ‘That’s a new note,’ others say the two notes are the same.” Yes, I said, but you mean the practical musicians who keep twisting and pulling the strings and arguing about tuning. I’m talking about the Pythagorean musicians, who are also wrong. They only study the numbers of the sounds they hear, and never look for the deeper, true harmony that we can’t hear and that only exists in problems. They don’t even know that exists.

“That last thing must be amazing,” he said. It is, I replied, but it only helps if you use it to aim for what’s good.

All these sciences are just the warm-up, and they are useful if you see how they connect to each other. “I bet, Socrates,” said Glaucon, “but this kind of study would never end.” What study do you mean—the warm-up, or what comes next? Because all these things are just the warm-up, and you don’t really think every mathematician is also a thinker, do you?

“Definitely not. I hardly know any mathematician who can really think well.” And yet, Glaucon, isn’t true thinking like a song of reasoning that’s the music of the mind? It’s like when we stopped looking at shadows on the wall and finally saw the real objects that made those shadows. Thinking like this, using pure intelligence and going beyond what the senses show, leads us to understand the idea of good, and it never stops until it reaches the highest level.

The path out of the cave into the light, blinking in the sun, and learning to see real things, not just shadows, is helped by math and science. This is how the soul rises to see the greatest idea of all—the highest reality.

“So far, I agree with you. But now, leaving the warm-up, let’s get to the main part. What exactly is dialectic, and how do we get there?”
