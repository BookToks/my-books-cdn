Now we have a clear idea of the physical qualities needed in a guardian.

True.

And also the mental ones; their soul should be full of spirit?

Yes.

But aren’t spirited people likely to be wild with each other and everyone else?

That’s a hard problem to solve, he said.

I said, they should be dangerous to their enemies but gentle to their friends; if not, they will destroy themselves before their enemies do.

True, he said.

So what should we do? I asked. How can we find someone gentle but also very brave, since those two qualities seem to be opposite?

True.

He won’t be a good guardian if he lacks either of these qualities; but since it seems impossible to have both, we might think being a good guardian is impossible.

I’m afraid you’re right, he said.

Feeling confused, I started thinking about what we talked about before. “My friend,” I said, “no wonder we are confused; we lost sight of the example we had earlier.”

What do you mean? he asked.

I mean that there are actually beings with these opposite qualities.

Where do you find them?

Many animals, I answered, give examples; our friend the dog is a great example. You know well-bred dogs are very gentle with their owners and friends but the opposite with strangers.

Yes, I know.

So it’s not impossible or unnatural to find a guardian with a similar mix of qualities?

Certainly not.
