Very true.

Will a worker do a better job if he has many different tasks, or just one?

Just one.

Also, isn’t it true that work gets messed up if it’s not done at the right time?

Definitely.

Because business doesn’t wait for the worker to be free; the worker must keep going and make the work the most important thing.

He must.

So, we can say that things are made faster, easier, and better when one person does one natural job at the right time and doesn’t try to do other things.

Absolutely.

That means we need more than four people; a farmer won’t make his own plough or tools if he wants good ones. Builders won’t make their own tools either—they need many things; same for weavers and shoemakers.

True.

So carpenters, blacksmiths, and other skilled workers will also be part of our small community, which is already growing.

True.

Even if we add herders, shepherds, and others to help farmers with oxen for plowing, builders with animals for work, and curriers and weavers with wool and hides—our community still won’t be very big.

That’s true; but it also won’t be very small if it has all these people.

Also, finding a city location where nothing has to be brought in from outside is almost impossible.

Impossible.

So, there must be another group of citizens who bring supplies from other cities?
