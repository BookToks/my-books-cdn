Can there be anything worse than people fighting and being distracted when they should be united? Or anything better than everyone sticking together?

No, there can’t.

Unity happens when people share the same feelings of happiness and sadness—when everyone feels glad or upset about the same things.

Definitely.

If people only care about themselves and don’t share feelings, the State falls apart—when one group is happy but the other is sad about the same events happening to their city or people.

Absolutely.

These problems usually come from disagreements about what belongs to who—like “mine” and “not mine,” or “his” and “not his.”

Exactly.

Isn’t the best State the one where most people agree on what is “mine” and what is “not mine” when it comes to the same things?

That’s true.

Or like a body, where if one finger hurts, the whole body feels it because everything is connected under one control, and we say the person has a pain in their finger. The same goes for any other part that feels pain or relief.

Very true, I agree that the best State is the one where people share feelings like you described.

So, when any citizen experiences something good or bad, the whole State will treat it as their own and either celebrate or feel sad with them?

Yes, that’s what happens in a well-ordered State.

Now, it’s time to go back to our State and see if this idea or another one fits best with these basic principles.

Very good.

Our State, like any other, has leaders and followers?

True.
