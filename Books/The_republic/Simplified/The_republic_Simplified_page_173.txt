After confession, all the people are forgiven together, but no one is named specifically. They also have a practice of constant prayer, done by priests who take turns every hour. Their religion worships God as a Trinity—Wisdom, Love, and Power—but they don’t see these as separate persons. They see God’s glory reflected in the sun and don’t use carved images because they reject idolatry.

There are many details about their eating and drinking habits, how they dress, their jobs, and their wars. Campanella hopes for a new kind of education that focuses on studying nature instead of just Aristotle’s ideas.

He doesn’t want citizens to waste time on what he calls “dead signs of things.” He points out that a person who only knows one subject doesn’t truly understand even that one well and stresses the need to learn many things. The City of the Sun produces more scholars in one year than usual methods do in ten or fifteen.

Campanella clearly believes, like Bacon, that natural science will play a big role in education, a hope that hasn’t really happened yet, neither in his time nor ours. The fulfillment of this hope has been delayed for a long time.

The work shows a lot of clever and original ideas and has a very wise spirit. But its writing style isn’t very appealing and is much less impressive than Bacon’s "New Atlantis" or Sir Thomas More’s "Utopia." It has many contradictions and, though it borrows from Plato, it only understands his work on a surface level. It seems like something written by a smart philosopher who was also a friar and spent 27 years in an Inquisition prison.

The most interesting part, shared with Plato and Sir Thomas More, is how the writer deeply feels the suffering and ignorance of poor people in his time. Campanella mentions Aristotle’s argument against Plato’s idea of shared property—that if everything is common, no one will want to work. He answers that since his citizens are happy and content (they only work four hours a day), they care more about each other than people do now. Like Plato, he thinks if private feelings and interests disappear, a strong sense of public good will take their place.

Other writings about perfect societies, like Harrington’s "Oceana," where Lord Archon (meant to be Cromwell) is shown not as he was but as he should have been, or Barclay’s "Argenis," an allegory of his own time, are very different from Plato and not as important to mention.
