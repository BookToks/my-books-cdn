Music is important because it helps us end things nicely; after all, what should be the end of music if not the love of beauty?

I agree, he said.

After music comes gymnastics, where our young people will be trained next.

Definitely.

Gymnastics, just like music, should start when we are young. The training should be careful and go on throughout life. Now, I believe – and I want to hear if you agree – that having a good body doesn’t make the soul better. Instead, a good soul makes the body better as much as it can. What do you think?

Yes, I agree.

Then, when the mind is trained properly, we can focus more on taking care of the body. To keep things simple, we will just talk about the main points now.

Sounds good.

We already said they must avoid getting drunk because guardians should be the last people to lose control and not know where they are.

Yes, he said; it’s silly to expect another guardian to watch over a guardian who’s drunk.

But what about their food? The men are training for the biggest contest of all, right?

Yes, he said.

Will the body type of regular athletes work for them?

Why not?

I’m worried that the way regular athletes train makes them kind of lazy and could be bad for their health. Don’t you see that these athletes spend a lot of time sleeping and can get very sick if they stop following their usual routine even a little?

Yes, I do.

So, I said, our warrior athletes need better training. They should be like alert dogs, able to see and hear very well. They will have to handle many changes in water, food, hot summers, and cold winters during campaigns, and they must not get sick easily.
