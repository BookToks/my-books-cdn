Maybe we’re wrong, and if we are, you should use your wisdom to show us why justice is better than injustice.

But how can I convince you, he asked, if you’re not already convinced by what I said? What more can I do? Do you want me to put the proof straight into your soul?

No way! I said. I just want you to be honest with yourself. If you change your mind, say it clearly—no tricking anyone. I have to point out, Thrasymachus, that earlier you defined the true doctor very clearly, but you didn’t do the same when talking about the shepherd. You said the shepherd takes care of the sheep not for their own good, but like someone who raises animals just to eat or sell them. But surely the art of being a shepherd is only about helping the sheep, giving them the best care, right? That’s what I was saying about rulers too. The art of ruling, whether in a country or private life, should only care about the good of the people being ruled. But you seem to think rulers want power for themselves.

Think about it! I’m sure of it.

Then why do men never want to take lower jobs unless they get paid? Isn’t it because they believe they’re working to help others, not just themselves? Let me ask: aren’t different skills different because they each do their own job? And, my friend, say what you really think so we can move forward.

Yes, that’s the difference, he said.

And each skill gives a special kind of good, not just a general one—like medicine gives health, navigation gives safety at sea, and so on?

Yes, that’s right.

And the skill of paying people has the special job of giving pay. But we don’t confuse this with other skills, just like we don’t confuse navigation with medicine, even if a sea trip might help a pilot’s health. You wouldn’t say navigation is medicine, right, if we want to use words exactly?

Of course not.

Or because someone is healthy when they get paid, you wouldn’t say the skill of paying is medicine?
