I totally agree.

When I say this, I know I’m going off-topic a bit; but what I want to point out is that in all of us, even good people, there’s a wild, lawless side that shows up when we’re not fully aware. Think about it and see if you agree with me.

Yes, I agree.

Now, remember the kind of person we said a democratic man is.

He was supposed to have been raised by a stingy parent who taught him to save money but didn’t allow spending just for fun or decoration.

True.

Then he started hanging out with a more wild and careless group of people, and because he hated his father’s stinginess, he went to the complete opposite extreme. But since he was a better person than those bad influences, he got pulled in both directions until he stopped in the middle and lived a life that wasn’t wild or over-the-top, but one with what he thought was a reasonable amount of pleasure. That’s how the democratic man came from the rich, powerful class.

Yes, that’s how we saw him and still do.

Now, I said, many years pass, and you have to imagine this man, as he is, has a son who grows up with the same beliefs as his dad.

I can picture him.

Then you have to imagine the same thing happens to the son as happened to the father: he gets pulled into a totally wild life, which those who lead him call “total freedom.” His dad and friends support his moderate choices, and the other group supports the wild ones. When the bad influences see they are losing control over him, they try to plant a strong obsession inside him to take over all his lazy and wasteful desires—a kind of crazy, winged drone—that’s the only way to really describe him.
