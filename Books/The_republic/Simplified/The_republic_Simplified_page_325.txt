If he asked me, I would tell him: Stay where you are when you have the chance to live such a good life.

You agree, then, I said, that men and women should live together in the way we talked about – with the same education, raising children together; and they should watch over the citizens together, whether they are staying in the city or going off to war. They should protect each other, work together like a team, and women should share everything with men as much as they can. By doing this, they will do what is best and keep the natural balance between boys and girls.

I agree with you, he said.

I said we still need to find out if this kind of community can actually work – like it happens with some animals – and if it can, how exactly would it work?

You guessed the question I was about to ask.

It’s easy to see how they will fight in war, I said.

How?

Of course, they will go on missions together; they will bring their strong children along so, like artists’ kids, they can watch the work they will have to do when they grow up. The kids will not only watch but also help in war and take care of their parents. Have you ever seen how the potters’ boys watch and help long before they start working on the wheel?

Yes, I have.

And do you think potters will be more careful in teaching their children and giving them chances to learn than our guardians will be?

That idea is silly, he said.

Also, having their children around will make parents braver, just like with other animals.

That’s true, Socrates; but if they lose, which can happen a lot in war, the danger is huge! The children and parents could both die, and the State will never get better.

That’s true, I said; but would you never let them take any risk?
