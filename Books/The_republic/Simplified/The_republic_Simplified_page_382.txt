I mean that things we see or feel are two types. Some things don’t make us think much because our senses can understand them well. But other things are tricky for our senses, so we need to think more about them.

You’re talking about how things look different because of distance or light and shadow, right?

No, that’s not what I mean at all.

Then what do you mean?

When I say some things don’t make us think, I mean those that don’t change from one feeling to the opposite. Things that do change make us think more. For example, if you see something close or far, your sense doesn’t give a clearer idea of what it is compared to its opposite. Let me explain with an example: here are three fingers—the little finger, the second finger, and the middle finger.

Okay.

Imagine you see them very close. Here’s the point.

What is it?

Each finger looks like a finger, no matter if it’s in the middle or at the end, or if it’s white or black, thick or thin—it’s still a finger. In these cases, we don’t have to ask, “What is a finger?” because our eyes don’t suggest that a finger could be anything else.

That makes sense.

So, as we expect, nothing here makes us think or use our intelligence.

That’s true.

But what about the size of the fingers? Can our eyes really tell the difference between big and small fingers? Does it matter if one finger is in the middle and another is at the end? And what about touch—can it really tell if something is thick or thin, soft or hard? The other senses work the same way. The sense that feels hard things also notices soft things, which only tells us that something can feel both hard and soft.

You’re right.
