Impossible, he said, because they are just normal people, and the rules we set for them are fair. There’s no doubt that each of them will take the job because they have to, not like how our current leaders do it.

Yes, I said, and that’s the important part. You have to create a better life for your future leaders than just being rulers, and then you can have a well-run country. Only in a country that offers this will the leaders be truly rich—not with silver or gold, but with goodness and wisdom, which are the real blessings in life. 

If they rush into running things, poor and only looking out for themselves, thinking that this is how they get the best life, there will never be order. They will fight for power, and the arguments and fights will ruin both the leaders and the whole country.

That’s very true, he replied.

The only way to look down on the life of wanting power is through real philosophy. Do you know any other way?

No, I don’t, he said.

And shouldn’t the people in charge not want the job? Because if they do, they will compete and fight.

No question about it.

So, who should we make the guardians? They should be the wisest people about running a country, the ones who manage it best, and who have other honors and a better life than just politics.

They are the people I will choose, he said.

Now, shall we think about how these guardians will be made and how they will move from ignorance to knowledge—like some are said to have risen from the underworld to the gods?

Yes, definitely, he replied.

The process, I said, isn’t like flipping an oyster shell (a game where two sides chase or run away depending on which side of the shell lands up), but more like turning a soul from a day that’s almost like night to the true day of being—that is, rising up from below, which we say is true.
