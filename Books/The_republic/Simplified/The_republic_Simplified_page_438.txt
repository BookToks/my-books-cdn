If a person is like a State, shouldn’t the same rules apply? His soul is full of meanness and bad behavior – the best parts of him are controlled by the worst, and a small part that rules is the worst and angriest.

That’s just how it is.

Would you say that the soul of someone like this is free, or a slave?

I think he has the soul of a slave.

And a State ruled by a tyrant can’t act freely, right?

Not at all.

And the soul ruled by a tyrant (looking at the whole soul) can’t do what it really wants; it’s bothered and full of trouble and regret?

Definitely.

Is a city under a tyrant rich or poor?

Poor.

And the soul ruled by a tyrant is always poor and never satisfied?

That’s right.

And wouldn’t such a State and person always be full of fear?

Yes, absolutely.

Is there any State with more sadness, pain, and complaints?

No, there isn’t.

And is there any person with more misery than a tyrannical man, who is controlled by wild passions and desires?

No way.

Thinking about all this, you said a tyrannical State is the most unhappy kind of State?

And I was right, he said.

Yes, I said. And when you see the same problems in a tyrannical man, what do you say about him?

I say he is by far the most miserable of all men.
