Adeimantus asked a question: Socrates, what would you say if someone claimed that you are making these people unhappy, and that they are the reason for their own sadness? He said the city actually belongs to them, but they donâ€™t get anything good from it.

He added that other people own land, build big and nice houses, have nice things, make sacrifices to the gods on their own, and are good hosts. Also, like you just said, they have gold and silver, and all the usual things that lucky people have.

But our poor citizens are no better than hired soldiers who live in the city and always keep watch.
