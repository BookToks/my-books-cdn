That’s obvious.

So, instead of fighting for glory and honor, people start caring more about business and money. They respect and look up to rich people, making them leaders, and they look down on poor people.

That’s what happens.

Next, they make a law that says you have to have a certain amount of money to be a citizen. This amount is higher in some places and lower in others, depending on how exclusive the government is. Anyone who doesn’t own enough money can’t take part in running the government. They use force or threats to make these changes if needed.

That’s true.

This is generally how an oligarchy starts.

Yes, he said; but what are the main features of this kind of government, and what problems does it have?

First, think about this rule. Imagine if pilots were chosen by how much money they have, and a poor person, even if better at flying, wasn’t allowed to steer.

You mean the ship would crash?

Yes; and isn’t this true for any kind of government?

I guess so.

Except for a city? Or would you say a city is included?

No, he said, ruling a city is the hardest and most important kind of government.

So, this is the first big problem of oligarchy?

Definitely.

And here’s another problem that’s just as bad.

What problem?

The state gets split into two groups: the poor and the rich. They live in the same place but are always fighting against each other.

That sounds really bad.

Another bad thing is that, for the same reason, they can’t fight any war properly.
