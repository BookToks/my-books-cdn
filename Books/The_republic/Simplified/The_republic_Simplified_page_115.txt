Let me explain what I mean: Objects look different when they are in water and when they are out of water, and also when they are close or far away. Painters and jugglers use this to trick our eyes. The skill of measuring, weighing, and calculating helps us stop getting confused by appearances. Like we said, two opposite opinions about the same thing at the same time can’t both be true. Which one is true is found by careful thinking, which is connected to the better part of our mind, while art copies the weaker part.

The same is true for what we hear as well as what we see, and for poetry as well as painting.

Imitation copies actions that can be done on purpose or by accident, where we expect good or bad results and feel pleasure or pain. But is a person calm when they feel these mixed emotions? Isn’t there some conflict inside them? Also, is it easier to handle sadness when alone or with others?

It’s easier with others. Feelings might make someone want to feel sorry for themselves, but reason and rules tell them to be patient. They don’t know if their pain is good or bad, and no human problem is really that important, while sadness stops good thinking. When we face problems, we shouldn’t act like kids and complain loudly. Instead, we should do what reason says, not cry, but look for a solution. The better part of us wants to follow reason, while the weaker part gets sad and distracted when it remembers troubles. Sadly, this weaker part is what art copies most. Reason is always calm and doesn’t show off easily, especially to people who don’t understand it well. So the poet is like a painter in two ways: first, he shows less truth, and second, he speaks to the weaker part of the mind. He encourages feelings and weakens reason. We shouldn’t let him control our minds because he doesn’t understand what is bigger or smaller and just makes images far from the truth.

But the biggest problem with poetry is that it makes feelings too strong in a bad way. When we hear a hero sad for a long time, we feel sorry for him and praise the poet. But in real life, we think showing sadness like that is weak and unmanly. Should a person enjoy watching someone else do what they hate to do themselves? They are letting their feelings go because it’s someone else’s pain, and they think they can enjoy it without shame, gaining pleasure. But the result is that someone who starts crying over others’ sadness will end up crying over their own. The same goes for comedy—you might laugh at silly jokes you would be embarrassed to say yourself, and loving this kind of fun will eventually make you act silly too.
