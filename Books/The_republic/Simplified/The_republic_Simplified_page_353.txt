He says that what a person likes is good, and what they don’t like is bad. He can’t explain any other way to understand good and evil because he has never seen or understood what justice and nobility really are, and he can’t explain the big difference between them.

Wouldn’t a person like that make a good teacher?

Yes, they would.

Now, how is someone who thinks wisdom means knowing what most people like in art, music, or politics different from the person I just described? When someone shows their work or service to a crowd and lets them judge it, they have to give the people what they want to hear. But the reasons people give to explain what they think is good or honorable are often silly. Have you ever heard any good reasons from them?

No, and I probably never will.

You see that what I’m saying is true? Then think about whether the world will ever believe in one perfect kind of beauty instead of many different kinds, or one perfect kind of anything instead of many kinds.

Definitely not.

So, the world can’t really be a philosopher?

That’s impossible.

Because of that, philosophers will always be criticized by the world?

Yes, they will.

And also by people who just want to please the crowd?

That’s obvious.

So, do you see any way a philosopher can keep doing what they’re meant to do until the end? Remember, we said a true philosopher should have quick thinking, a good memory, courage, and a big heart—these are the real gifts of a true philosopher.
