I agree.

Think about when there’s a fight and a city gets split in two. If both sides start destroying land and burning each other’s homes, how terrible does that fight seem? No true lover of their country would want to hurt their own home and family like that. Maybe the winner has a reason to take the loser’s food and crops, but they would still want peace in their hearts and wouldn’t want to keep fighting forever.

Yes, that’s a better way to act than the other.

And won’t the city you’re building be a Greek city?

It should be, he said.

Then won’t the people living there be good and polite?

Yes, very polite.

And won’t they love Greece, think of it as their own land, and share the same temples?

Definitely.

And if they argue, they’ll see it as just a fight between friends, not a real war?

Of course not.

So they will argue like people who want to make up someday?

Exactly.

They will correct each other kindly, but won’t try to control or destroy their opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies?

That’s right.

And since they’re all Greeks, they won’t destroy Greece, burn houses, or think that every man, woman, and child in a city is their enemy, because they know that only a few people are truly guilty of starting the war, and most are friends.

For all these reasons, they won’t want to waste their land or destroy their homes; their hatred will only last until the innocent people force the guilty ones to make things right.

I agree, he said, our citizens should treat their Greek enemies this way, just like Greeks now treat each other when they fight barbarians.
