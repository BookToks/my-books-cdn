Custom terms like "themes" and "sciences" might not be the best names because they sound clearer than opinions but less clear than science. In our earlier explanation, we called this "understanding." But why argue about names when there are important real things to think about?

"Why indeed," he said, "any name works as long as it clearly shows what you mean."

Anyway, we are happy to keep four groups: two for intellect and two for opinion. Let's call the first two "science" and "understanding," the third "belief," and the fourth "seeing shadows." Opinion is about things changing, and intellect is about things that really exist. To put it simply: just like being relates to becoming, pure intellect relates to opinion. And just like intellect relates to opinion, science relates to belief, and understanding relates to seeing shadows.

But let's wait to talk more about how opinion and intellect connect and break down, because that will take a long time, much longer than this conversation.

As far as I get it, he said, I agree.

Do you also agree when I say that a dialectician is someone who understands the true nature of each thing? And if someone doesn’t have this understanding and can’t explain it, then they’re failing in intelligence to some degree? Will you agree with that?

Yes, he said; how could I say no?

And you would say the same about understanding the idea of good? Unless a person can clearly think about and explain what good really means, and can answer all questions against it, not by just opinions but by absolute truth, without getting confused at any point – unless they can do all this, you would say they don’t really know the idea of good or any other good thing; they only see a shadow of it, if anything at all. They live like they are dreaming and not fully awake in this life, and after death, they settle in the underworld.

I definitely agree with you on all that.

And you wouldn’t want the kids in your perfect State, the ones you’re raising and teaching – if your perfect State ever becomes real – to be like posts (literally “lines,” maybe the start of a race track), with no reason or sense, but still put in charge of the most important things, right?
