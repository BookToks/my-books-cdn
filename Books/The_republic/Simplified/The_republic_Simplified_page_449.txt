Like cows, who always look down and keep their heads close to the ground—that is, to the dining table—they just eat, get fat, and have babies. They love these things so much that they fight and hurt each other with their horns and hooves, which are as hard as iron. They even kill one another because they want more and more without ever being satisfied. They fill themselves with things that don’t really matter, and the part of them that’s full is also weak and uncontrolled.

Socrates, Glaucon said, you describe the life of many people like a prophecy.

Their pleasures come mixed with pain—how could it be any different? These pleasures are just shadows and fake copies of the real thing. They are made stronger by the difference between light and dark, and they make fools want things they shouldn’t. People fight over these fake pleasures, like the Greeks fought over the shadow of Helen during the Trojan War, not knowing the real truth.

Something like that has to happen.

And doesn’t the same thing happen with the fiery, passionate part of a person? Won’t a passionate person who acts on their feelings, whether they are jealous, ambitious, angry, or upset, be in the same situation if they are only looking for honor, victory, or satisfaction of their anger without thinking clearly?

Yes, the same thing will happen with that passionate part too.

So, can’t we say that people who love money and honor, when they follow reason and knowledge, and go after the pleasures that wisdom shows them, will have the truest pleasures possible? And they will enjoy the pleasures that are natural to them if what’s best for each person is also what feels most natural?

Yes, definitely; the best is the most natural.

And when the whole soul follows the ideas of philosophy, and the different parts don’t fight but do their own jobs, they are fair and each part enjoys the best and truest pleasures it can?

Exactly.

But when the other two parts take over, they fail to get their real pleasure and force the rest to chase after fake pleasures that don’t belong to them?

True.

And the farther a person is from philosophy and reason, the stranger and more fake their pleasures will be?
