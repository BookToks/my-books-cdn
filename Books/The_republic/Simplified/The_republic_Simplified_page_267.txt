Sure.

So, should both parts be balanced?

Definitely.

And a balanced person is both calm and brave?

Yes.

And an unbalanced person is scared and rude?

Exactly.

When someone listens to music that’s soft and sad, like we talked about, and spends their life enjoying singing and songs, at first it makes their spirit strong and useful, like iron. But if they keep listening too much, it starts to wear them down until their spirit fades away, and they become weak.

That’s true.

If their spirit is already weak, this happens quickly. But if they have a strong spirit, music makes them easily upset—they get angry fast but calm down just as fast. Instead of being strong, they become moody and hard to deal with.

Right.

Now, with exercise, if a guy works out hard and eats a lot, unlike the music lover, at first his strong body makes him proud and full of energy, and he feels like a better person.

Of course.

But what if he does nothing else and doesn’t learn or think about anything? Won’t his mind get weak, dull, and never improve, while his senses stay cloudy?

True, he said.

In the end, he becomes someone who hates learning, acts wild and violent like an animal, doesn’t know how to talk things out, and lives in ignorance without manners or kindness.
