Sure, he said.

Simple and reasonable desires that follow good thinking and true opinions are only found in a few people, mostly those who are born well and well educated.

That’s true.

You can see that these two types of desires have a place in our society. The less important desires of most people are controlled by the good desires and wisdom of the few.

I see that, he said.

So, if there is any city that can be called the master of its own pleasures and desires, and master of itself, can we say ours is that city?

Definitely, he replied.

It can also be called temperate, for the same reasons?

Yes.

And if there is any state where rulers and subjects agree on who should rule, is that our state?

Without a doubt.

And since the citizens agree among themselves, in which group will temperance be found – the rulers or the subjects?

In both, I think, he replied.

Do you notice that we were pretty close when we guessed that temperance is a kind of harmony?

Why do you say that?

Because temperance is different from courage and wisdom, which only exist in one part. Courage makes the state brave, and wisdom makes it smart. But temperance is found everywhere and connects all parts. It creates harmony between the weaker and stronger groups, whether they are stronger or weaker in wisdom, power, numbers, money, or anything else. So, temperance is the agreement between those who naturally lead and those who follow about who has the right to rule, both in states and in individuals.

I totally agree with you.
