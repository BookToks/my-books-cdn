What if he tried this many times under the hot sun? If he’s not an expert, couldn’t he knock down more than one strong person?

Sure, he said, that wouldn’t be surprising.

Rich men probably know more about boxing than about military stuff.

That makes sense.

So, can we guess our athletes could fight against two or three times their number?

I agree with you, I think you’re right.

Now imagine before the fight, our people send a message to one of the two cities, telling them the truth: We don’t have silver or gold, and we’re not allowed to have any, but you do. So, will you come help us in the war and take the other city’s loot? Who would want to fight against weak, skinny dogs when they could fight with the dogs instead, against fat and soft sheep?

That’s unlikely; but there could be trouble for the poor state if many states’ wealth was combined into one.

But it’s easy for you to call any place a State except our own!

Why?

You should talk about other States in plural because none of them is just one city, but many cities, like in a game. Every city, even small ones, is actually split into two parts: the city of the poor and the city of the rich. These two parts fight each other, and inside each part, there are even smaller groups. So, it’s wrong to treat them all as one single State.

But if you treat them as many and share the wealth, power, and people between them, you’ll have many friends and few enemies. Your State, while the wise way of ruling stays strong, will be the greatest State—not just in name or looks, but truly—though it has no more than a thousand fighters. You won’t find a single State equal to it, whether among Greeks or others, even if many seem bigger.

That’s very true, he said.

So, what do you think is the best limit our rulers should set when deciding how big the State should be and how much land to include, and when to stop expanding?

What limit would you suggest?
