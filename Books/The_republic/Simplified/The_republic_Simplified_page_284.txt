Isn't there a similar way to think about the virtues, which are also four in number?

Definitely.

The first virtue we see in the State is wisdom, and I notice something special about it.

What is it?

The State we talked about is called wise because it gives good advice.

That's true.

Good advice is a kind of knowledge, because people give good advice not by ignorance but by knowing things.

Of course.

There are many kinds of knowledge in a State, right?

Yes.

For example, a carpenter has knowledge, but does that make a city wise and good at giving advice?

No, that would just make the city good at carpentry.

So a city isnâ€™t called wise just because it knows about making wooden tools?

Exactly not.

Nor because it knows about making metal pots, or any other specific skill?

No, not because of any of those.

Nor because it knows about farming; that would just make the city agricultural.

Right.

So, I asked, is there any knowledge in our new State that helps people advise about the whole city, not just one part, and think about how the city can manage itself and deal with other cities?

Yes, there is.

And what kind of knowledge is that, and who has it?
