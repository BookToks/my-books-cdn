That’s true, he said.

If we say the third part of the soul cares about love and pleasure tied to getting things, then we can just call that part loving money or gain.

I agree with you.

Also, isn’t the part that’s all about passion all about ruling, winning, and getting famous?

True.

What if we call it the ambitious or argumentative part—is that a good name?

Yes, that fits perfectly.

On the other hand, everyone knows the part that looks for knowledge only cares about the truth and doesn’t care about money or fame.

Much less.

Can we call that part the lover of wisdom or lover of knowledge?

Definitely.

Different people have different main parts in their souls, right?

Yes.

So we can say there are three kinds of people: lovers of wisdom, lovers of honor, and lovers of money?

Exactly.

And there are three kinds of pleasures that each group likes?

Very true.

Now, if you look at these three groups and ask which life they think is the best, each one will say theirs is the best and put down the others. For example, the money-maker will say honor or learning is useless if they don’t bring money.

True, he said.

And what about the lover of honor? Won’t he think that money is boring, and that learning without respect is all pointless?
