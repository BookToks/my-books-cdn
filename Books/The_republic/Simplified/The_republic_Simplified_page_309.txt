Very true, he replied.

First, we need to figure out if the question is a joke or serious. Let’s try to understand what women are like: Can they do the same things as men, at least sometimes, or not at all? And is war one of those things they can be part of? That’s the best way to start, and it will probably lead to a fair answer.

That sounds like the best idea.

Should we start by arguing against ourselves first? That way, the other side won’t be ignored.

Why not? he said.

Okay, let’s imagine what our opponents would say. They might say: “Socrates and Glaucon, no one can beat you in a debate because you both agreed at the start of the State that everyone should do the work that fits their nature.” And yes, I think we did say that before. “And don’t men and women have very different natures?” they would ask. We would say: Of course. Then they would ask, “Shouldn’t men and women have different jobs that fit those differences?” We would agree. “But if that’s true, isn’t it strange to say men and women, who are so different, should do the same things?” What would you say to defend us against these questions?

That’s a hard question to answer quickly; please help me explain our side.

These are the problems, Glaucon, and many more like them, that I predicted a long time ago. They made me scared and nervous about making any rules about who should own or take care of women and children.

By Zeus, he said, this problem is really hard to solve.

Yes, I said, but the truth is, when a person is in deep water—whether in a small pool or the middle of the ocean—they have to swim anyway.

Very true.

So, we have to keep trying to swim and reach the shore. Maybe Arion’s dolphin or some other miracle will save us.
