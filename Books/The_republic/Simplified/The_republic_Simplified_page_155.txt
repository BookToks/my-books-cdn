Foragesphysicians have been under the dominion of prejudices which have only recently given way; and now there are as many opinions in medicine as in theology, and an equal degree of scepticism and some want of toleration about both. Plato has severalgoodnotionsaboutmedicine; accordingtohim,’theeyecannotbecuredwithouttherestofthebody,northebodywithoutthemind’(Charm.).
