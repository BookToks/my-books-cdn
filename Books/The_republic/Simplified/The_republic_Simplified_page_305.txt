"What are they?" he asked.

I was about to explain the order in which the four bad forms appeared one after another, when Polemarchus, who was sitting a little away, just past Adeimantus, started whispering to him. He reached out, grabbed the top of his coat by the shoulder, pulled him close, leaned in, and said something in his ear. I only caught the words, "Shall we let him off, or what should we do?" "Definitely not," said Adeimantus, speaking louder.

"Who is it," I asked, "that you’re refusing to let off?"

"You," he said.

I asked again, "Why am I especially not to be let off?"

"Because," he said, "we think you’re lazy and trying to trick us out of an important part of the story. You think we won’t notice how casually you’re going through it, acting like it’s obvious to everyone that friends 'have all things in common' when it comes to women and children." "Wasn’t I right, Adeimantus?"

"Yes," he said, "but what’s right in this case, like everything else, needs to be explained. Because community can mean many different things. So please, tell us what kind of community you mean. We’ve been waiting a long time for you to explain the family life of your citizens—how they will have kids and raise them, and, in general, what this community of women and children is really like. We believe that handling these things well or badly will have a huge effect on the whole State, for better or worse."
