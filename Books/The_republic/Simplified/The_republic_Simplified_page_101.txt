The part about the tyrant being someone who kills their own family; the way the tyrant’s life is shown as a terrible, bad dream; the surprise that a tyrant is even more miserable than the worst person in Book IX; the hint to poets that if they support tyrants, there’s no place for them in a fair government, and that they should realize it’s right for them to be kicked out; the ongoing image of lazy men who come in two types, finally turning into a giant lazy man with wings (Book IX) – these are some of Plato’s best ideas.

There is still a big problem to understand in this part of the Republic, called the number of the State. It’s a puzzle almost as hard as the Number of the Beast in the Bible’s Book of Revelation. Aristotle seemed to know about it, but Cicero said it was a confusing saying. Some people think there is no real answer and that Plato was just tricking readers. But this kind of trick wouldn’t fit with how Aristotle talked about the number, and it wouldn’t make sense to anyone who knew Greek math. It’s more likely that the confusion comes from us not being used to this topic.

Plato himself seems to joke a little about the number, calling it a serious joke from the Muses, which might mean he’s making fun of the idea of using numbers symbolically. To understand this part, we need to look carefully at the words Plato uses, and there is a little help from a similar passage later in Book IX. Aristotle also helps by saying the last part of the passage talks about a solid shape. He explains that everything changes in a cycle, and the changes come from numbers in a 4:3 ratio, which combined with the number 5 creates two kinds of harmony. This probably refers to when the number becomes solid.

Another clue comes from the Pythagorean triangle, which uses the numbers 3, 4, and 5. In this triangle, the squares of the two smaller sides add up to the square of the longest side (9 + 16 = 25).

Plato starts by talking about a perfect or cyclical number, which is a number where the sum of its parts equals the whole. This is a divine or perfect number that completes all smaller cycles. He also talks about an imperfect human number, which has four parts and three intervals that relate to each other in certain ways. He turns these into shapes and finds that when raised to the third power, they show parts of numbers that create two kinds of harmony: one square and one oblong. But he doesn’t say if the square number matches the divine number or if the oblong matches the human cycle. There’s no hint that the divine number shows the world’s period or that the second number shows the state or human race cycle, as some have guessed. Also, the divine number is not mentioned again.
