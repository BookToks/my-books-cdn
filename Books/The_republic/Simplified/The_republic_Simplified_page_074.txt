Predictions or guesses about the truth, whether about people or nature, are kind of like old-school philosophy’s way of figuring things out, similar to how modern science uses hypotheses. These “guesses” weren’t random; they came from noticing patterns and basic rules in nature that the smart Greeks saw when they looked at the sky and earth from far away. Also, people back then still learned and thought a lot, even if philosophy wasn’t just based on experience.

Plato thought that if you wiped a tablet clean, the artist would draw the perfect version of a state. But is this perfect version something stored in heaven, or just an empty space that the artist imagines? The answer is that these perfect ideas are made partly by leaving some details out and partly by imagination improving what experience gives us (Phaedo). Plato showed these perfect ideas as coming from another world. Nowadays, sometimes the idea comes first, and sometimes it works together with the artist’s work. Just like in science, art can be made by planning everything first or by thinking and creating at the same time.

It’s easy to see that Plato’s way of dividing knowledge is based on the basic difference between what we can sense and what we understand with our minds. This idea was common in early philosophy. It also involves the difference between things that last forever and things that change, and between general ideas and specific examples. But Plato’s time needed another division—numbers and shapes were starting to be seen differently from ideas. People couldn’t think of justice as a shape anymore, and they started to understand that what we sense and what we think are not the same. Between the true essence of things and the shadows we see, numbers played a role, acting like a bridge, as Aristotle said. So Plato added a third part to his philosophy that hadn’t been there before. He saw how math was used in education and thought it helped prepare for deeper learning. The connection between math and ideas seemed both personal and real, even though the step between them is mostly imagined (Metaphysics).

But in reality, philosophy about being and morals isn’t connected to math. Numbers and shapes come from time and space, not pure ideas. When you take away the metaphors, a straight line or a square has nothing to do with right and justice, and a crooked line doesn’t mean bad behavior. People confused the metaphor for the actual truth, and that’s how Plato’s three-part division was made.
