If someone moves from a lower place to a middle place, wouldn’t they think they are going up? And if someone is standing in the middle and looks back, wouldn’t they think they are already at the top if they have never seen the true highest place?

Sure, how could they think differently?

But if they were taken back down, they would really believe they were going down, right?

Yes, definitely.

All of this happens because they don’t know what the true top, middle, or bottom places really are.

Exactly.

So, isn’t it normal that people who don’t understand the truth also have wrong ideas about pleasure, pain, and the middle state? When they start to feel pain, they really think the pain is real. And when they move away from pain to a neutral or middle feeling, they think they have reached real happiness or satisfaction. They don’t know what true pleasure is, so they mistake the absence of pain for pleasure. It’s like confusing black with gray instead of seeing white. Can you be surprised by this?

No, not at all. I would be more surprised by the opposite.

Think about this: hunger, thirst, and things like that are feelings of the body, right?

Yes.

And ignorance and foolishness are feelings of the soul?

True.

And food and wisdom are the things that satisfy each one?

Certainly.

Is the satisfaction that comes from something with less real existence truer, or the one that comes from something with more real existence?

Clearly, the one that comes from more real existence.

Now, think about this: which has more pure existence — things like food, drink, and all kinds of physical needs, or things like true opinions, knowledge, mind, and all kinds of virtues?
