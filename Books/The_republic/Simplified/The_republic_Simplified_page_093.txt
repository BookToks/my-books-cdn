Haven’t we already said that it’s a problem when the same people are both warriors and shopkeepers? The worst thing is when some people sell their stuff and end up with nothing, while others have tons of money. But notice, these poor people weren’t any better when they were rich—they were always careless with money. They’re like the drones in a beehive; real drones don’t have stingers, but these “two-legged drones” can be harmless or dangerous. That means there are poor people and bad people, and they’re often found together. In cities ruled by a few rich people, almost everyone else is poor, and you’ll find lots of both types. This bad situation starts because of bad education and bad government.

A state is like a person—the change begins with someone who cares about honor. At first, he follows his father’s path, who might have been a leader or soldier. But then he sees his father fall from power, maybe arrested or killed because of enemies. This teaches him to be careful; he stops joining politics, hides his pride, and saves money. Greed takes over his heart and acts like a king. His smart and brave sides sit quietly on either side—one focused on saving money, the other admiring wealth. His love of honor changes into love of money instantly. He becomes stingy, hardworking, and controlled by one passion that rules the rest. Doesn’t he look like the state? If he had a good education, he wouldn’t let money control him. Because he’s uneducated, he has many selfish desires—some cheap, some sneaky. If he’s in charge of someone’s money, he might cheat if he thinks he can get away with it. So, he lives a life torn between good and bad desires. When he competes for prizes, he’s scared to lose money even if it means missing out on honor. In war, he fights with only a little of his resources, keeping most money safe but losing the battle.

Next comes democracy and the democratic person, who comes from oligarchy and the oligarchic person. In oligarchy, greedy desire rules everything. They encourage expensive habits so they can profit when young people waste their money. Families often lose their property or citizenship rights, but they stay in the city full of hate for the new owners of their land, ready to rebel. The moneylender, who walks bent over, pretends not to notice them; he just moves on and lends money to someone else. Many people have to pay back the original loan times a whole family’s worth, and the moneylender controls them like drones.
