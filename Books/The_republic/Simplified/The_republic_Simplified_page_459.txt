I think the painter is kind of like someone who makes things look real, right?

Of course.

But you might say that what the painter makes isn’t real. Still, does the painter also make a bed in some way?

Yes, he said, but it’s not a real bed.

What about the person who actually makes the bed? You said he makes a certain bed, not just the idea of a bed, which is the true form.

Yes, I did.

So if he doesn’t make what really exists, he can’t make true existence, only something that looks like it exists. And if someone said the bed maker’s work is really real, they probably wouldn’t be telling the truth.

At least, philosophers would say he’s not telling the truth.

No wonder then, that the work he does is only a blurry version of the truth.

Exactly.

Now, using these examples, who do you think the imitator is?

If you want.

Well, there are three beds: one that exists in nature, made by God, since no one else could have made it.

No.

There’s another bed made by a carpenter.

Yes.

And the painter’s work is a third kind of bed.

Yes.

So there are three kinds of beds, and three artists who make them: God, the bed maker, and the painter.

Yes, there are three.

God made one perfect bed in nature, either by choice or necessity, and only one; He has never made two or more perfect beds and never will.
