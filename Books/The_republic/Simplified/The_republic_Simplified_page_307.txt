I pray that Nemesis doesn’t punish me for what I’m about to say. I really believe that accidentally killing someone is less bad than lying about what’s beautiful, good, or fair in the laws. I’d rather take that risk with my enemies than with my friends, so you should encourage me to speak up.

Glaucon laughed and said, “Well then, Socrates, if your argument causes any real harm, you’ll be forgiven before the killing happens, and you won’t be called a liar. So be brave and speak.”

I said, “The law says that if a man is found not guilty, he is free from blame, and what the law says should count in arguments.”

“Then why would you worry?”

I replied, “I guess I need to go back and say what I probably should have said earlier. We have talked about the men’s part, and now it’s only right to talk about the women’s part. I’ll talk about them now, especially since you invited me.”

For men born and raised like our citizens, the only way to figure out the right way to have and use women and children is to follow the path we started on, when we said men were the guards and watchdogs of the group.

“That’s true,” he said.

“Let’s say the birth and education of our women are under similar or almost the same rules. Then we can see if the result fits what we planned.”

“What do you mean?”

I asked, “Are dogs divided into males and females, or do both share equally in hunting, guarding, and other dog duties? Or do we let males take full care of the flock while females stay at home, thinking that giving birth and feeding puppies is enough work for them?”

“No,” he said, “they share the work equally. The only difference is that males are stronger and females are weaker.”

“But can you use different animals for the same job if they aren’t raised and fed the same way?”
