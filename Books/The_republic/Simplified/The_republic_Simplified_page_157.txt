The One, the self-proving, the good, which is the highest level of thinking, is the perfect truth that everything moves toward and finally rests in.

This idea of good is hard to explain clearly and is only understood in a certain way in Greek philosophy. It’s an idea that doesn’t include any specific things and has no separate parts (Aristotle talked about this in Nicomachean Ethics). Aristotle noticed that such a form was empty, but Plato didn’t. Also, Aristotle didn’t realize that in the way of thinking called dialectic, there are different methods that don’t always agree with each other. He didn’t see that whether he took the longer or shorter path, no real progress could be made this way.

Still, these big ideas can have a huge impact. Even though science’s method can’t predict future science, the idea of what science will become is inspiring. When we try to learn, we’re always moving toward something beyond what we know now. Just like wrong ideas about knowledge, such as scholastic philosophy, can mislead people for a long time, the true ideal — even if empty — can guide everyone’s thinking in the right way.

It really matters if our general hope for knowledge is based on good thinking. People can often have a true idea of what knowledge should be, even if they only have a little experience with facts. Important parts of higher education include connecting different sciences, understanding that nature is one whole, knowing how to organize things, keeping a sense of balance, and not confusing guesswork with truth.

Although Plato couldn’t tell us the absolute truth — and maybe knew he couldn’t — he still influenced people’s minds in a way that continues today. Political and social issues might even bring Plato’s ideas back for a fresh look.

The Idea of Good is called that only in Plato’s Republic, but hints of it appear in his other writings. It is both a cause and an idea. In this way, it’s like the creator in the Timaeus, who made everything out of goodness. It’s kind of like the modern ideas of laws of nature or final causes (purposes), and is connected to ideas of balance and harmony found in Plato’s Philebus.

In the Symposium, the Idea of Good is shown as beauty, which people reach step by step, like how knowledge grows gradually here. When you think about it personally, it’s the process of dialectic — the science that, according to Plato’s Phaedrus, is the true basis of good speaking and argument.

This science can tell the different kinds of people and things apart, break a whole into natural parts, and put scattered parts back together into a natural, organized whole. It defines the basic ideas of everything and links them together. It sees through assumptions and reaches the final cause or first principle of everything. It understands how the sciences relate to the Idea of Good.
