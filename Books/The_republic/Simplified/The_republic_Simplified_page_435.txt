He is, indeed, here, he replied.

First, he takes other people’s things. When that doesn’t work, and he starts feeling happy inside, he breaks into houses or steals clothes from travelers at night. Then, he even robs temples. At the same time, the old ideas about right and wrong that he had as a kid get replaced by new ones that protect his selfish desires. When he was younger, he only acted this way in his dreams. But now, because of love, he acts like this all the time when he’s awake. He might even do terrible things like murder or eat forbidden food. Love controls him like a cruel ruler, making him do reckless things to stay in charge with his bad friends. These friends might be people who brought bad habits from outside or others inside him who are just as bad. Don’t you see how this shows his way of life?

Yes, indeed, he said.

If there are only a few bad people in the country, and most others are good, the bad ones leave and become soldiers for another cruel leader who might want them for war. If there’s no war, they stay home and cause little problems in the city.

What kind of problems?

For example, they are thieves, burglars, pickpockets, robbers of temples, or kidnappers. If they can talk, they become snitches, lie in court, and take bribes.

That’s a small list of bad things, even if there aren’t many people doing them.

Yes, I said, but “small” and “big” depend on how you look at it. All these bad things hurt a country, but they are nothing compared to a tyrant. When this bad group and their followers grow stronger and realize their power, helped by people’s foolishness, they pick the one who is the worst among them to be their leader.

Yes, he said, and that person will be the best fit to be a tyrant.

If the people agree, fine. But if they resist, just like he started by beating his own parents, if he has the power, he beats them too. He will keep his country under control by putting his young followers in charge as rulers and masters.
