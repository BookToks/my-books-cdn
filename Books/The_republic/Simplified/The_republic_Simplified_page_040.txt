Here’s one big lie we should all believe in, especially if we want to teach our leaders to be better! Even if it’s just a story, like the old legend of Cadmus, we should try telling it to everyone. First, to the rulers, then the soldiers, and finally the people. We’ll say that their youth was like a dream. While they thought they were learning, they were actually being shaped by the earth, which sent them up when they were ready. They have to protect and love the earth, since they came from her, and treat each other like brothers and sisters.

I know it sounds weird to say this, but there’s more. These brothers and sisters are different inside. Some are made to rule and are like gold; some are silver and meant to help; others are brass and iron, made to work as farmers and craftsmen. Even though they all come from the same source, a golden parent might have a silver child, or a silver parent a golden child. That means people can move up or down in society. The rich can become poor, and the workers can rise. A prophecy says the state will fall if it’s ruled by someone made of brass or iron.

Will people believe this now? Probably not, but maybe the next generation will.

Now, let those earth-born people go out under their leaders and set up camp in a high, safe place. They’ll protect the city from enemies outside and from rebellions inside. They should live like soldiers, not shopkeepers, guarding the people like watchdogs. If they become greedy and lazy, they’ll turn into wolves and tyrants. Their lifestyle should match their training. They shouldn’t own property; their pay should only cover their costs, and they should eat together.

We’ll tell the gold and silver people that their talents come from God. They must keep their souls pure and not mix with the bad stuff called gold here on earth. Only these special citizens can’t touch or live with earthly gold or drink from golden cups because it’s cursed. If they ever get houses, land, or money for themselves, they’ll stop being protectors and become selfish rulers. That will bring ruin to both them and the state.

Later, we’ll talk about Plato’s ideas on religion and ethics separately. But here are some smaller points.

First, Plato often uses Homer as proof for his ideas about ethics, psychology, diet, and medicine. Sometimes he changes Homer’s words on purpose, or quotes him wrong, like others did when turning the Iliad into stories. He likes to make strange or funny connections from Homer’s words, even if they don’t always fit.
