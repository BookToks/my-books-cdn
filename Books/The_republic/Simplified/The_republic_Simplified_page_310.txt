I guess so, he said.

Well then, let’s see if we can find any way to get out of this. We agreed, didn’t we, that different kinds of people should do different things, and that men and women are different by nature? And now we’re saying the opposite—that different natures should do the same things. That’s the problem people say we have.

Exactly.

Yes, Glaucon, I said, the power of arguing against yourself is amazing!

Why do you say that?

Because I think a lot of people argue without meaning to. When they think they are being logical, they are just arguing for the sake of arguing because they can’t clearly explain what they mean. They just want to win the argument instead of having a fair talk.

Yes, that happens a lot, he replied. But what does that have to do with us and our argument?

A lot; because we might accidentally be arguing just for the sake of arguing.

How?

Well, we strongly say that different natures should do different things, but we never really thought about what it means for natures to be the same or different, or why we made that difference when we said different natures have different jobs and the same natures have the same jobs.

No, he said, we never thought about that.

I said: Imagine we ask if there is a difference in nature between bald men and men with hair. If we say yes, then if bald men are cobblers, should we stop men with hair from being cobblers, and the other way around?

That would be a joke, he said.

Yes, I said, a joke; and why? Because when we made the State, we didn’t mean that every small difference mattered, but only the differences that affect what job someone does. For example, a doctor and someone who wants to be a doctor can be said to have the same nature.

True.
