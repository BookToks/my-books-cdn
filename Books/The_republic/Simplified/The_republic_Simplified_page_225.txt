With this kind of diet, they can expect to live peacefully and healthily until they are old, and they can pass on a similar life to their children.

Yes, Socrates said, if you were taking care of a city full of pigs, how else would you feed the animals?

But what do you want, Glaucon? I asked.

He said, you should give people the normal comforts of life. People who want to be comfortable are used to lying on sofas and eating at tables, and they should have sauces and sweets like we have today.

Now I get it, I said. The question you want me to think about is not just how to build a city, but how to build a fancy, luxurious city. Maybe there’s no harm in this, because in such a city we can better understand how justice and injustice come about. I think the real, healthy city is the simple one I first described. But if you want to see a city that is full of luxury, I don’t mind. I guess many people won’t be happy with the simple life. They’ll want sofas, tables, and other furniture, plus fancy foods, perfumes, incense, entertainers, and all kinds of cakes. We’ll need more than just the basics like houses, clothes, and shoes. We’ll also need painters, embroiderers, gold and ivory workers, and lots of other craftsmen.

That’s true, he said.

Then we’ll need to make our city bigger because the original simple city won’t be enough. The city will have to have many new jobs that people don’t really need for survival, like hunters, actors, and artists who work with shapes and colors. There will also be musicians, poets, dancers, builders, and makers of all kinds of things, including women’s clothes. We’ll need more servants too. Tutors, nurses, tirewomen, barbers, cooks, and even pig herders will be needed now, even though they weren’t needed in the simple city. We can’t forget about animals too, if people eat them.

Definitely.

And if people live like this, won’t they need a lot more doctors than before?

Much more.
