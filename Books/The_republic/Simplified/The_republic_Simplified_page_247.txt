You probably know that all myths and poems tell stories about things that happened in the past, are happening now, or will happen in the future.

Yes, that’s right.

And these stories can be told in two ways: just plain telling, or acting like someone else, or a mix of both?

I don’t really get that part.

I guess I’m not a very good teacher if I’m so hard to understand. So instead of explaining everything, I’ll just give you an example to show what I mean.

You know the first lines of the Iliad, where it says that Chryses asked Agamemnon to free his daughter, but Agamemnon got really angry? Then Chryses prayed to the god to punish the Greeks. When the poet says, “And he prayed all the Greeks, but especially the two sons of Atreus, the chiefs of the people,” the poet is speaking as himself, not pretending to be anyone else. But right after that, the poet talks as if he is Chryses, the old priest, and tries to make us believe it’s really him talking. The whole story of what happened at Troy and in the Odyssey is told like this—sometimes the poet speaks as himself, sometimes as other characters.

Okay.

And the story stays a story even when the poet talks as different characters and in between those parts?

That’s right.

But when the poet talks as someone else, can we say he changes his style to sound like that person?

Yes.

And when he changes his voice or actions to copy the person he’s pretending to be, that’s called imitation?

Exactly.

So in this case, the poet tells the story by acting like the characters?

Exactly true.

Or if the poet always speaks as himself and never pretends, then there’s no acting, and the poem is just plain telling.
