Glaucon, who always loves to argue, wasn’t happy that Thrasymachus stopped talking. He wanted to keep debating. So he asked me, Socrates, do you really want to convince us, or just make it look like you have convinced us, that being fair is always better than being unfair?

I said, I hope to really convince you if I can.

Then you definitely haven’t done it yet. Let me ask you: How would you group things that are good? Aren’t there some things we like just for themselves, no matter what happens because of them? Like harmless fun and enjoyment that make us happy at the moment, even if nothing else comes from them.

I agree there is a group like that, I said.

Isn’t there also a second group of goods, like knowledge, seeing, and being healthy, which we want not just for themselves but also because of what they lead to?

Yes, I said.

And wouldn’t you say there’s a third group, like exercise, taking care of sick people, doctors’ skills, and ways to make money? These are good, but we think they’re kind of unpleasant. No one would choose them just for themselves but only for the reward or result they bring.

There is a third group, I said. But why do you ask?

Because I want to know which group you would put justice in.

I put justice in the highest group, I said—the kind of good things that someone who wants to be happy wants both for their own sake and for what comes from them.

But most people think differently. They believe justice is in the annoying group, the kind of good things we only do for rewards or to look good, but that are unpleasant and people try to avoid.
