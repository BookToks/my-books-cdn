Human nature is made up of many small parts, and since our leaders already have their own job—protecting freedom—they don’t need to copy others. If they do copy, they should only copy the good things, not bad or mean stuff. Because when actors wear a mask, it can start to feel like their real face.

We can’t let men act like women, especially when they’re arguing, crying, yelling, or bragging against the gods—especially not when they’re making love or working. Men shouldn’t pretend to be slaves, bullies, cowards, drunk people, crazy people, blacksmiths, or even animals like horses or bulls, or things like rivers or the wild sea.

A good or wise person will happily do good and smart actions, but they’ll be embarrassed to act like someone they’ve never been. They’ll prefer to tell stories without too much copying. But someone who doesn’t respect themselves will copy anyone and anything—nature sounds, animal noises, everything. Their whole act will just be copying voices and movements.

When telling stories, there are two main ways: descriptive style, which doesn’t change much, and dramatic style, which changes a lot. Poets and musicians use one or both, and this mix is very popular with young people, their teachers, and ordinary folks. But our State, where one person plays only one role, isn’t made for complicated performances. When one of these fancy performers shows up, we will respect them but also tell them there’s no place for their kind here. We want honest, simple poets and won’t change our original ways.  

Now about music. A song or ode has three parts: the subject, the harmony, and the rhythm. Harmony and rhythm depend on the subject. Since we don’t want sad songs, we will ban the sad-sounding Lydian harmonies. And since our citizens must be moderate, we’ll also ban happy, party-like harmonies like Ionian and pure Lydian.

That leaves two kinds of harmony—Dorian and Phrygian. Dorian is for war and courage, and Phrygian is for peace, obedience, teaching, or religious feelings. Since we reject many kinds of harmony, we’ll also reject many-stringed and oddly shaped instruments that play them, especially the flute, which is the most complicated. But the lyre and harp are okay in the city, and the Pan’s-pipe is fine in the countryside.

So, we have cleaned up music, and now we will clean up the rhythms too. They should be simple and fit the occasion.

There are four notes in a tetrachord (a group of four notes), and three kinds of meter ratios: 3/2, 2/2, and 2/1. Each has its own feel, and the rhythm patterns have different characters too. But about this, we should ask Damon, the great musician, who talks about different types of rhythms like martial, dactylic, trochaic, and iambic, and how to match syllables properly.

We only want to say this general rule: the style should fit the subject, the rhythm should fit the style, and all of them should reflect the simplicity and harmony of the soul.
