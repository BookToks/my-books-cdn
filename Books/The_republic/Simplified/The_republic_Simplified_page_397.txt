Here are the points you need to think about. The people who understand these things best, who are steady in their learning and in their military and other jobs, once they turn thirty, should be chosen by you from this special group and given higher honor. You’ll have to test them using dialectic, to see which ones can give up using their sight and other senses, and, together with truth, reach a perfect understanding. And here, my friend, you have to be very careful.

Why careful?

Don’t you see how much trouble dialectic has caused?

What trouble? he asked.

Students of art are full of chaos.

That’s true, he said.

Do you think their behavior is unnatural or unforgivable? Or will you forgive them?

How would I forgive them?

I want you to imagine, as an example, a boy raised in great wealth. He’s from a big family with many people praising him. When he grows up, he finds out the people he thought were his real parents aren’t actually his parents; but he can’t find out who his real parents are. Can you guess how he will act toward those who praise him and those he thought were his parents, first when he doesn’t know the truth, and then after he finds out? Or should I tell you?

Please tell me.

Well, before he knows the truth, he will probably respect his “parents” and family more than the flatterers. He won’t want to ignore them when they need help or say or do anything bad about them. He will also be less likely to disobey them in important matters.

He will.

But after he finds out, I think he will respect his “parents” less and trust the flatterers more. Their influence will grow a lot. He will live their way and hang out openly with them. Unless he’s a really good person, he won’t care about his “parents” or other family anymore.
