Well, I said, maybe there’s nothing left of our special subjects; so we’ll have to choose something that’s not special but useful for everyone.

What could that be?

Something that all arts, sciences, and smart people use together, and that everyone has to learn first in school.

What is it?

The simple skill of knowing one, two, and three—in other words, numbers and math. Don’t all arts and sciences need math?

Yes.

Does the art of war need it too?

Of course.

Then Palamedes, whenever he shows up in stories, makes Agamemnon look like a terrible general. Didn’t you notice how Palamedes says he invented numbers, counted the ships, and arranged the army ranks at Troy? That means they never counted before, and Agamemnon couldn’t even count his own feet—how could he if he didn’t know numbers? If that’s true, what kind of general was he?

I’d say a very strange one, if what you say is true.

Can we deny that a warrior should know some math?

Definitely, if he wants to understand military plans, or honestly, if he wants to be a man at all.

I’d like to know if you think the same way about this study as I do?

What do you think?

It seems to me that this study is exactly what we’re looking for. It naturally makes you think more but is often not used the right way; its real purpose is to help the soul move toward being better.

Will you explain what you mean? he said.

I’ll try, I said. And I want you to help me figure this out by saying “yes” or “no” when I try to decide which kinds of knowledge have this power to attract the soul. That way, we can prove more clearly that math is one of them.

Explain, he said.
