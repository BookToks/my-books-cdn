So, let’s stop telling these kinds of stories because they can make young people think it’s okay to be bad.

Sure, I agree.

Now, since we’re deciding what topics we should or shouldn’t talk about, let’s check if we missed anything. We’ve already talked about how to handle stories about gods, heroes, and the underworld.

That’s right.

What about people? That’s the part we still need to cover.

Definitely.

But we can’t answer that right now, my friend.

Why not?

Because, if I’m right, we have to say that poets and storytellers often lie when they say bad people are happy and good people are sad; or that cheating pays off if you don’t get caught, and being fair only hurts you and helps others. We should stop them from saying these things and make them tell the opposite.

If you admit that, then you’ve agreed with the main point we’ve been trying to prove.

I see what you mean.

Whether these things about people are true or not depends on us first figuring out what justice really is, and how being just actually benefits someone, no matter how it looks.
