Or maybe he thought that ideas could be built up kind of like how we build shapes and numbers in math. For Plato, the most certain and necessary truth was something universal, and he always tried to connect all knowledge or opinions to that, just like today we try to base things on experience and observation.

Metaphysicians, people who think about big questions, often go beyond what humans can really understand or explain. They seem to be exploring worlds that don’t really exist, and their ideas, while important to them, can be confusing or unclear to others. So, it’s not surprising that Plato himself never clearly explained his theory of ideas. Even his students, like Glaucon and Adeimantus, couldn’t fully follow him when he talked about these deep topics. In the book called the Sophist, Plato argues against people who say that nothing can be clearly described, or that anything can be said about anything. He concludes that some ideas connect with some others, but not all ideas connect with everything.

But Plato only took one or two steps forward here. He never created a full system of ideas or even figured out the basic connections between different sciences.

BOOK V. I was about to list the four types of problems or declines that happen in governments when Polemarchus—he was sitting a little farther from me than Adeimantus—grabbed Adeimantus’s coat and leaned toward him, whispering something. I only caught the words, “Shall we let him off?” “Definitely not,” Adeimantus said loudly. “Who are you not going to let off?” I asked.

“You,” he said. “Why?” “Because we think you’re not being fair to us by leaving out women and children, who you sneaked into the idea that friends share everything together.” “Am I not right?” I asked.

“Yes,” he answered, “but there are many kinds of sharing or community, and we want to know which kind is the right one. The group here has decided to explain this more.” Thrasymachus said, “Do you think we came here to dig for gold, or to listen to what you say?” “Yes,” I said, “but the talk should not be too long.” Glaucon added, “Yes, Socrates, and it’s reasonable to spend your whole life discussing these things, but please, just tell us how this sharing is supposed to work, and what happens between birth and education.”

“Well,” I said, “this topic is tricky—What is possible? That’s the first question. What is desirable? That’s the second.” “Don’t worry,” he answered, “you’re talking among friends.” “That’s not much comfort,” I said, “because I might hurt my friends as well as myself. Not that I mind a little harmless laughter, but anyone who kills the truth is a murderer.” Then Glaucon laughed and said, “If you kill us, we’ll forgive you in advance, and you won’t be guilty of tricking us.”

Socrates goes on: The guardians of our state are going to be like watchdogs, as we said before.
