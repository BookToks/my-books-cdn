First of all, fashion is like a many-headed monster, made up of all kinds of animals, both tame and wild, and it can change and create new forms whenever it wants. Imagine now another kind of lion, and another kind of man; the second lion smaller than the first, and the third smaller than the second. Put them together and cover them with human skin, so you can’t see what’s inside. When this is done, tell someone who supports unfairness that they are feeding the beasts and starving the human inside. The person who supports fairness, on the other hand, tries to make the human stronger; they help the gentle part inside and team it up with the brave lion heart, so together they can control the many-headed monster and bring everything into balance with each other and themselves. So, in every way—whether for pleasure, honor, or benefit—the fair person is right, and the unfair person is wrong.

But now, let’s think about the unfair person who isn’t making a mistake on purpose. Isn’t the noble part the one that keeps the beast under control, or rather, puts the God-like part of the human in charge? And the ignoble part is the one that lets the beast control the human? If this is true, who would accept gold if it meant they had to give up the best part of themselves for the worst? Who would sell their son or daughter to cruel and evil people for any amount of money? And who would give up their best, most divine part without feeling bad, to the most godless and disgusting people? Wouldn’t that be worse than Eriphyle, who traded her husband’s life just for a necklace? Losing self-control is like letting the many-headed monster loose. Pride and bad moods make the lion and serpent parts grow stronger, while being lazy and weak comes from being too relaxed in spirit. Flattery and meanness happen when the brave part is ruled by greed, and the lion acts like a silly monkey. The worst thing about skilled workers is that they have to flatter others instead of controlling their own desires; that’s why we say they should be controlled by better people, not to hurt them, but to help them. When we teach young people, we want to give them self-control; the law wants to raise a higher part inside them, and once they have it, they can live their own lives.

So, what good is it if a person gains the whole world but becomes more and more evil? Or what good is it to hide evil if hiding it stops it from being fixed? If a person had been punished for doing wrong, the beast inside would have been quieted, and the gentle part set free; then they would have joined self-control, fairness, and wisdom in their soul—something much better than any physical gifts. A wise person values knowledge above everything else; next, they keep their body under control, not just to be healthy and strong, but to have perfect harmony between body and soul. When gaining money, they aim for order and balance; they don’t want to keep getting richer without limit, because they know that too much wealth can mess up their own soul.
