Plato and Aristotle might have been more right than we think when they said that some civilizations were found and lost many times. We can’t say that all barbarian cultures are just ruined civilizations, but we also can’t say how low humans might fall because of war, disease, or being alone. If we want to learn about where marriage started by looking at barbarian groups, we should also think about animals. Many birds and animals, especially meat-eaters, have only one mate, and they show love and care for their babies. This doesn’t fit with the idea that marriage started in a very simple or wild way. If we imagine a time when humans were almost like animals, we can try to guess how they moved from being wild to becoming civilized, just like animals changed over time. The history of animal life is incomplete, and the history of social life is even more unclear. Even if our first ancestors didn’t have marriage, we don’t really know how people went from being wild to the civilizations of China, Assyria, Greece, or even the ancient Germans.

These ideas can be a bit upsetting because they make it seem like marriage, which many think is a special gift from above, is actually something that grew out of history and experience. When we ask where marriage came from, we’re told it developed slowly after many fights and was based on selfishness. We face human nature in its most basic form. We have to accept not the best, but the worst explanation for how human society began. But on the other hand, we can say that every step in human progress has been toward something better. Over time, the idea of marriage and family has become clearer and more respected. Civilized Eastern countries are far ahead of savage tribes; Greeks and Romans improved on the East; and Christian nations have been stricter about marriage than ancient people. Instead of looking back and feeling sad about the past, we should look forward with hope. We need to respect what we believe is most important, and what is most important will also be most useful. It makes more sense to protect marriage when we see its benefits, not just because of vague religious feelings. But during times when old beliefs are changing, there is a risk that in moving from old to new, we might lose our morals. We might give in to passion because we are unsure or because opinions keep changing.

Today, many people who study anthropology, and who are interested in new and strange ideas, sometimes worry and sometimes hope that one day, because of women standing up for themselves, rebellious children, new ways of thinking about relationships, or changes in the world, family ties might be broken or weakened a lot.
