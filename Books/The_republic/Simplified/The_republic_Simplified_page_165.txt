’ ThecomparativelyshortworkcalledtheStatesmanorPoliticusinitsstyleand manner is more akin to the Laws, while in its idealism it rather resembles the Republic. As far as we can judge by various indications of language and thought, it must be later than the one and of course earlier than the other. In boththeRepublicandStatesmanacloseconnectionismaintainedbetweenPolitics and Dialectic. In the Statesman, enquiries into the principles of Method are interspersed with discussions about Politics.
