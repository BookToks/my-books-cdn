The Statesman, also called the Politicus, is a shorter work that is written in a style similar to the Laws, but its ideas are more like those in the Republic. Based on the way it’s written and the thoughts it contains, it was probably written after the Laws but before the Republic. Both the Republic and the Statesman link politics closely with dialectic, which is a way of discussing ideas.

In the Statesman, talks about methods are mixed with discussions about politics. It looks at whether it’s better to be ruled by laws or by a person, and it decides that ruling by a person is better. But it also says that a person can rule by following the law, and the law can be like the voice of the lawmaker. Like the Republic, the Statesman has a myth that talks not about the future, but about a past time when humans lived in innocence. It asks whether it’s better to live simply like in the myth or to live a civilized life with art, science, and the ability to tell good from bad. This question about whether simple life or civilized life is happier is left unanswered. Even though the Statesman isn’t as perfect in style as the Republic and doesn’t cover as much, it is still one of Plato’s greatest dialogues.

Others besides Plato have imagined an ideal Republic to share ideas they couldn’t fully express or that went beyond their time. The closest classic work to Plato’s Republic is Cicero’s De Republica, but Cicero’s writing isn’t as good as Plato’s. His style is clumsy, and you can tell he’s trying to persuade like a public speaker. Still, his work is full of proud feelings about Rome, with the idea “We Romans are a great people” repeated throughout.

Like Socrates, Cicero focuses on civil and political life rather than the mysteries of the heavens. He’d rather talk about the two groups in Rome that have been divided since the time of the Gracchi, instead of the “two Suns” everyone was talking about. Speaking as Scipio, Cicero worries about sounding like a teacher instead of an equal friend discussing ideas. He thinks that “King” or “State” should only mean rule by reason and justice, and he doesn’t accept those titles for either democracy or monarchy. But under rule by reason and justice, he includes the natural superior ruling over the natural inferior, like the soul rules the body.

Cicero prefers a mix of government types instead of just one. The ideas about justice and injustice from the second book of the Republic are moved to the state. Philus, one of the speakers, argues that injustice is necessary for government, even though he doesn’t really want to believe it. Another speaker, Laelius, argues the opposite.
