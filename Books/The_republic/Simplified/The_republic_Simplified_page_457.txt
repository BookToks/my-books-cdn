What do you mean?  

I mean the rejection of copycat poetry, which really shouldn’t be accepted; now I understand better how the parts of the soul are different.  

What do you mean by that?  

I’ll tell you in secret because I don’t want the tragedians and other copycat poets to hear me—but I don’t mind saying that all imitated poems confuse the listeners, and the only way to fix that is to know their true nature.  

Can you explain what you mean?  

Sure, I’ll tell you. Even though I’ve admired Homer since I was very young, and his name still makes me nervous because he’s the great leader and teacher of all these charming tragedy writers, a person shouldn’t be respected more than the truth, so I’ll be honest.  

Good, he said.  

Listen to me, or better yet, answer me.  

Ask your question.  

Can you tell me what imitation is? I really don’t know.  

Probably something I should know.  

Why not? Sometimes people with less sharp eyes see things before those with sharper ones.  

True, he said; but with you here, even if I had a small idea, I couldn’t be brave enough to say it. Will you ask yourself?  

Okay, then, shall we start the question like we usually do: When a group of people have the same name, we assume they share a common idea or form—do you get what I mean?
