There are two big ideas that didn’t really show up in Greek Philosophy but are very important to people today. One is clearer now than before, like every generation brings us closer to a big change. The other idea is kind of hiding, almost like it’s pushed back by the laws of nature but still quietly hope-filled, something deep inside people. The first idea is about the future of all humans on Earth, and the second is about what happens to each person after they die.

The first idea is about making life better here and now. The second is about giving up this life for something else. One is based on what we can experience, and the other goes beyond that. Both ideas have inspired people to act, and some people care about these ideas more than anything else. At first, hoping for a better future for everyone seems less selfish than hoping for your own life after death. But when people learn to trust God’s plan — “not my will but Yours” — the difference between these hopes becomes less important. People can choose either hope to guide their lives, depending on who they are. Both require faith in working for a future we can’t see, whether it’s in this world or another.

It’s also possible that some rare people feel just as responsible for future generations as they do for themselves. Or, by living closely with God, they might experience the next world as clearly as this one.

The greatest ideal we can imagine has to be described using human qualities, even if sometimes, like the Jewish prophets, we say what God is not instead of what He is. Over time, these negative descriptions gain positive meaning. It’s good to remember this when thinking about big religious or philosophical truths, so we don’t get stuck on just the words we use.

There’s a third ideal, different but related to these two, that is important to every Christian. It’s about the Divine Man, the Son of Man, the Savior of humanity, who is both God and human at the same time. He is the first and leader of the whole family in heaven and on earth, where what is divine and what is human come together completely.

This divine form of goodness is connected to the Christian Church, which the New Testament calls “His body.” It doesn’t conflict with the good ideals that Plato talked about. We only see Him in symbols, and we choose just a few simple ones to help us understand Him.
