We can’t find any clear explanation in Plato’s own writings for this strange idea.

Discovering a big, deep idea can excite the mind so much that it makes it hard to judge how important it really is. No one who studies big ideas in philosophy ever criticizes their own thoughts properly; they think their ideas are perfect. They don’t realize that what seems like absolute truth to them might later be seen as just a tool for thinking. People in the future sometimes also misunderstand the true value of these ideas and think they didn’t add anything to what we know.

Today, many people think the IDEA of “good” is just a meaningless idea, but they forget that this idea is waiting to be used and will later be explained by different types of knowledge. When people don’t yet understand that the world follows rules, just having the idea of law or purpose is a big step forward. Even a rough idea that everything is connected helps people see the world differently, which can change how they think about life, politics, and how they act. We can imagine how someone smart like Pericles might have felt inspired by talking with thinkers like Anaxagoras. Trying to reach a bigger idea, even if it’s not fully clear, is better for the mind than being happy with only a small part of the truth. Sometimes, the greatest science ideas from the past get forgotten later on. It’s rare to find a modern thinker who, like Plato, looks at all time and existence in a grand way.

It’s also normal for people to quickly try to use these big ideas in real life and politics. When people first get excited about ideas, they want to apply them everywhere, even where they don’t fit. They don’t realize it takes many years of experience to fill in the gaps between big ideas and everyday facts. Plato seemed to think that truths about the mind, like truths about stars or music, could be figured out just by thinking carefully, and that his method of using experience and language was only temporary. But when Plato reached the idea of “good,” which is the goal of his science of reasoning, and was asked what this science really is and how it’s divided, he refused to answer. This seems like he was saying that, at that time, knowledge wasn’t good enough for a philosopher to be completely sure. The earlier sciences needed to be studied first, and they will continue to be studied forever, but in ways Plato couldn’t imagine. Still, even though Plato knew his own ideal wasn’t perfect yet, he was very excited to think about it.
