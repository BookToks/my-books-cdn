And should we ask what kind of knowledge can cause such a big change?

Certainly.

What kind of knowledge can bring the soul from not existing to existing? I just thought of something else: You remember that our young men are going to be warrior athletes?

Yes, that was said.

Then this new kind of knowledge must have another quality?

What quality?

It has to be useful in war.

Yes, if possible.

There were two parts in our old education plan, right?

Exactly.

One was gymnastic, which helped the body grow and stay healthy, so it has to do with life and death?

True.

Then that’s not the kind of knowledge we want to find?

No.

But what about music, which was also part of our old plan?

Music, as you remember, was the opposite of gymnastic. It trained the guardians by forming good habits, making them balanced with harmony and rhythm, but it didn’t teach real knowledge. The words, whether stories or facts, had rhythm and harmony too. But music didn’t lead to the good thing you’re talking about.

You remember well; music didn’t have that. But what kind of knowledge is it, Glaucon, that we want, since we think all the useful skills are bad?

Definitely. But if we take out music, gymnastic, and the arts, what’s left?
