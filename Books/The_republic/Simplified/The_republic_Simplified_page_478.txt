You might think I have told you all the scary parts of your story.

But can I just assume, without going over every detail, that those things really happened?

Sure, he said, what you say is true.

These are the rewards and gifts that good people get from gods and humans in this life, along with other good things that justice gives by itself.

Yes, he said, and they are fair and last a long time.

But I said, all of these are nothing compared to the bigger rewards waiting for both good and bad people after they die. You should hear about them, so both the good and bad will get the full story they deserve.

Go ahead, he said; there are few things I would rather hear.

Okay, I said, I will tell you a story. It’s not like the stories Odysseus tells to the hero Alcinous, but it’s about a hero too—Er, the son of Armenius, who was from Pamphylia. He died in battle, and ten days later, when the dead bodies were already rotting, his body was found fresh and taken home to be buried. On the twelfth day, as he lay on the funeral pyre, he came back to life and told everyone what he had seen in the afterlife.

He said that when his soul left his body, he traveled with a big group and they reached a strange place with two holes in the earth close together. Opposite them were two openings in the sky.

In the space between, judges were sitting. They told the good people, after judging them and writing down their sentences, to go up to heaven on the right side. The bad people were told to go down to the lower world on the left side. They carried symbols of their actions on their backs.

Er got close, and they told him he would be their messenger to bring news from the afterlife to people on earth. They told him to listen and watch everything there.

Then he saw souls leaving through the earth or heaven openings after their sentences were given. Some souls came up from the earth, dusty and tired, while others came down from heaven, clean and bright. They all seemed to have traveled a long way.

When they arrived, they happily went into a meadow where they camped like at a festival. Souls who knew each other hugged and talked. Those coming from earth asked about the things above, and those coming from heaven asked about the things below.
