Then let us make this law for our guardians too: they should not destroy the lands of the Hellenes or burn their houses.

Agreed; and we can also agree that, like all our other rules, this one is very good.

But still, Socrates, if you keep going like this, you will forget the other question we put aside at the start of our talk: Is such a way of life even possible, and if so, how? I am ready to admit that your plan, if it can work, would do a lot of good for the State. I will add something you forgot: your citizens would be the bravest warriors, and they would never leave their ranks because they would all know each other and see each other as family. And if the women join the armies, whether fighting or supporting from behind, they would be unbeatable. There are many other benefits at home too, which I agree with. But even if I accept all these good things, if your State cannot actually exist, then there is no point in talking more about them. So, assuming the State can exist, let's now talk about whether it’s really possible and how it could happen.

If I take a moment to think, you immediately attack me with questions and don’t give me a break; I barely escaped the first two waves, and now you’re bringing up a third, which is the hardest. When you hear this third wave, I think you’ll be more understanding and see that it’s normal to feel some fear and hesitation about such a strange idea.

The more you hesitate, the more determined we are to hear how such a State could be possible. So, speak up now.

Let me start by reminding you that we came here looking for what justice and injustice really are.

True, he said; but what about it?

I just want to ask if, since we have found them, we should expect the perfectly just person to be perfectly just all the time, or if it’s okay to be mostly just, with more justice than most people have?

Being mostly just is enough.

We were trying to understand what perfect justice and perfect injustice are, so we could have an ideal to aim for.
