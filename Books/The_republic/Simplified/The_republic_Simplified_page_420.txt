So, the young man goes back to the land of the lotus-eaters and lives there, ignoring everyone else. If his friends try to help him with his serious side, his silly, proud thoughts block them out. They won’t let the help in, and even if some wise people try to give advice, he won’t listen or accept it.

There’s a fight inside him, and the silly, proud thoughts win. Then, things like modesty, which he thinks is being weak, and self-control, which he calls unmanly, get pushed away and treated badly. He starts to believe that going overboard and spending without thinking is cool, and with a bunch of bad habits, he pushes those good parts out of his mind.

Yes, he really wants this.

After they take over his mind and teach him their strange ways, they bring in arrogance, chaos, wastefulness, and rudeness all dressed up nicely, with followers cheering and calling them good names. Arrogance is called being well-bred, chaos is freedom, waste is grandeur, and rudeness is bravery. So, the young man leaves behind his true self, which was shaped by real needs, and jumps into a life of pointless and unnecessary fun.

Yes, the change in him is easy to see.

After that, he keeps living, spending his money, time, and effort on fun things just as much as on important things. But if he’s lucky and not too crazy, after some years when the wild feelings calm down, he might bring back some of the good habits he kicked out before. If he doesn’t completely give up on them, he balances his pleasures and lives kind of evenly, letting whichever good habit is strongest take control for a while. Then, when he gets tired of that one, he lets another one take over. He doesn’t hate any of them but supports them all the same.

That’s right, he said.

He also doesn’t accept or let in any real advice. If someone tells him that some pleasures satisfy good and noble wants, while others satisfy bad wants, and that he should enjoy and respect some but control the others, he just shakes his head and says they’re all the same, and one is as good as another.

Yes, that’s how he is, he said.

I said, he lives day to day, always chasing whatever feels good at the moment. Sometimes he drinks and listens to music, then he tries to be healthy and drinks only water. Then he works out, then he wastes time doing nothing, then acts like a deep thinker. Often he gets caught up in politics, jumping up and doing whatever he thinks of. If he envies a warrior, he tries that, or if he admires business people, he tries that instead.
