I believe you have a good idea of where the change started.

The new government that comes from this will be something between an oligarchy and an aristocracy.

Yes, that’s right.

After this change happens, what will they do next? The new State will be a mix between oligarchy and the perfect State, so it will follow some parts of both, and also have some unique features.

True, he said.

In the way they honor rulers, in warriors avoiding farming, crafts, and trade, in sharing meals, and in focusing on exercise and military training – the State will be like the old one.

True.

But because they are afraid to let philosophers have power, since philosophers aren’t as simple and honest anymore and have mixed qualities; and because they prefer leaders who are passionate and better suited for war than peace; and because they focus on military tricks and never-ending wars – this State will mostly be different.

Yes.

Yes, I said; these kinds of people will want money badly, like those in oligarchies. They will secretly crave gold and silver, hiding it in secret places, with special storerooms and treasuries just to keep it safe; also, they will build castles like nests for their treasures and spend a lot on their wives or anyone else they want.

That’s very true, he said.

They will be cheap with money because they don’t have a way to openly get the money they want; they will spend other people’s money to satisfy their desires, sneaking away like kids from the law, their “father.” They have been trained not by gentle guidance but by force, because they ignored the true Muse, the friend of reason and philosophy, and cared more about exercise than music.
