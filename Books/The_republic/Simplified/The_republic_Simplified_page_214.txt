Enough of this.

Now, if we want to really judge the lives of good and bad people, we have to look at them separately. There’s no other way. How do we do that? I say: Let the bad person be completely bad, and the good person be completely good. Don’t take anything away from either of them. Both should be fully ready to live their own kind of life.

First, let the bad person be like a skilled expert—like a smart pilot or doctor who knows their limits and can fix mistakes if needed. So, let the bad person do their bad things in the best way possible and stay hidden if they want to be great at being bad. (If they get caught, they’re nobody.) The trick for the worst bad person is to seem good even when they’re not. So, the totally bad person should be the best at being bad but have a great reputation for being good. If they mess up, they need to be able to fix it. They should be good at talking their way out of trouble, strong and brave when needed, and have money and friends to help them.

Next, let’s think about the good person. They should be noble and simple, wanting to be good without showing off. Like Aeschylus said, they want to *be* good, not just *seem* good. They shouldn’t look like they’re good because if they do, they might only be good to get rewards and praise. So, they should wear justice like their only outfit—nothing fake. Imagine they live the opposite life from the bad person. Let them be the best person but be thought of as the worst. This way, we can really test if they care about being bad or just about what others think. Let them stay this way until they die—good but seeming bad.

When both have reached their extremes—the perfectly good and the perfectly bad—then we can judge which one is happier.

Wow! I said, Glaucon, you really make them sound strong and clear, like two statues ready for a decision.

I try my best, he said. Now that we know what they’re like, it’s easy to guess what kind of life each will live. I’ll explain it, but it might sound harsh, so imagine I’m not saying these words myself. Let me speak as if I’m someone who supports bad people: They would say the good person who seems bad will be beaten, tortured, tied up, have their eyes burned, and after suffering all kinds of pain, they will be killed painfully. Then, they will realize that it’s better to only seem good, not actually be good. Maybe Aeschylus was more right about bad people than good ones.
