Yes, he said, let’s agree on that.

And don’t think there will be many people like that; the important qualities we talked about don’t often come together. Usually, people only have bits and pieces of them.

What do you mean? he asked.

You know, I said, that quick thinking, good memory, wisdom, cleverness, and similar traits don’t often appear all at once. And people who have these traits and are also energetic and generous aren’t naturally made to live calm, peaceful lives. They usually act on impulse, and solid principles don’t guide them much.

Very true, he said.

On the other hand, people who are steady and reliable—who don’t get scared in battle and don’t move easily—are also slow to learn new things. They often get bored and sleepy when they have to work hard mentally.

Quite true.

And yet, we said both kinds of qualities are needed in those who get a higher education and will have important jobs or leadership roles.

Certainly, he said.

Will such a group be very rare?

Yes, definitely.

Then someone trying to join must not only be tested in the challenges and pleasures we talked about before, but also in many kinds of knowledge to see if their soul can handle the toughest learning or if they will give up, just like with any other studies or exercises.

Yes, he said, you are right to test them. But what do you mean by the toughest learning?

You might remember, I said, that we divided the soul into three parts and talked about different kinds of justice, self-control, courage, and wisdom?

Indeed, he said, if I had forgotten, I wouldn’t deserve to hear more.

And do you remember the warning we gave before starting that discussion?
