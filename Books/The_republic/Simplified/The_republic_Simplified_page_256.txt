Just so, he said, they should follow the words.

And won’t the words and the style depend on the mood of the soul?

Yes.

And everything else about the style?

Yes.

Then the beauty of style, harmony, grace, and good rhythm depend on simplicity—I mean the true simplicity of a well-ordered and noble mind and character, not the kind of simplicity that just means foolishness?

Very true, he replied.

And if our young people are to do their work in life, shouldn’t they always try to have these graces and harmonies?

They must.

And surely the art of painters and every other creative and building art are full of them—like weaving, embroidery, architecture, and all kinds of making things; also nature, both animals and plants—in all of them there is grace or the lack of it. And ugliness, bad feelings, and bad movement are mostly connected to bad words and bad nature, just like grace and harmony are like sisters of goodness and virtue and show their likeness.

That is quite true, he said.

But should our control stop there? Are poets only to be asked to show the image of good in their work, or should the same control apply to other artists? Should they also be stopped from showing bad things like vice, lack of self-control, meanness, and rudeness in sculpture, buildings, and other arts? And should anyone who can’t follow this rule be stopped from working as an artist here, so they don’t corrupt the taste of our people? We don’t want our guardians to grow up surrounded by ugly and harmful images, like animals grazing in a poisonous field, slowly gathering a sick and rotten soul inside themselves.

Let our artists be those who can see the true nature of beauty and grace; then our young people will live in a healthy place, surrounded by beautiful sights and sounds, and receive the good in everything. Beauty, the glow of fair works, will flow into their eyes and ears like a fresh breeze from a pure place, and quietly pull their souls from early on to be like and understand the beauty of reason.
