It’s clear that he uses Greek and Roman historians and Jewish sacred writings without questioning them much. He treats old myths, Sibylline oracles, Plato’s stories, and Neo-Platonist dreams as if they were true facts. He is a very argumentative writer who always tries to show one side as the best and the other as the worst. He doesn’t feel connected to old Roman life like Plato does with Greek life, and he doesn’t understand the church kingdom that would come after the Roman Empire fell. He sees problems in the Christian Church and thinks that someday both Christians and Pagans will be judged, and the true City of God will appear.

St. Augustine’s work is a strange mix of old knowledge and Christian ideas. It doesn’t show strong reasoning or deep understanding of Greek language and literature. He was very smart and had a good character but couldn’t really understand anything outside his own theology.

Out of all the ancient philosophers, he liked Plato the most, even though he didn’t know much about his writings. He thought Plato’s idea of creation in the Timaeus came from the story in Genesis. He was also amazed that Plato said “the philosopher is the lover of God,” which sounds like what the Book of Exodus says when God reveals himself to Moses. He talked a lot about miracles happening in his time, which he believed were proof that God was real. He also spoke nicely about the beauty and usefulness of nature and the human body, thinking they gave a hint of heaven and resurrection. The book isn’t really what the title makes you expect and comes from a time long gone, but it still has many great ideas that last forever.

Dante’s short work called Monarchia is one of the most important medieval ideas and shows the great mind of the time, reflecting Italy and the Middle Ages. It imagines a Universal Empire that should naturally rule the world, with a divine power separate from but equal to the Pope’s. It isn’t just the old Roman Empire coming back to life but its true heir, supported by Roman virtues and their good rule. Their right to rule the world is also said to be proven by miracles and accepted by St. Paul when he went to Caesar, and even more by Christ, who wouldn’t have saved people if He hadn’t been judged by a divinely ordered court. The need for a Universal Empire is shown by arguments like God being one and families or nations being one, as well as by misused scripture, history, nature examples, quotes from the classics, and simple logic, showing some but not perfect knowledge of Aristotle (he knows nothing of Plato).
