You will remember that in the oligarchy were found two classes–rogues and paupers, whom we compared to drones with and without stings. These twoclassesaretotheStatewhatphlegmandbilearetothehumanbody; and the State-physician, or legislator, must get rid of them, just as the bee-master keeps the drones out of the hive. Now in a democracy, too, there are drones, but they are more numerous and more dangerous than in the oligarchy; there theyareinertandunpractised,heretheyarefulloflifeandanimation;andthe keener sort speak and act, while the others buzz about the bema and prevent theiropponentsfrombeingheard.AndthereisanotherclassindemocraticStates,ofrespectable,thrivingindividuals,whocanbesqueezedwhenthedrones haveneedoftheirpossessions; thereismoreoverathirdclass,whoarethelabourersandtheartisans,andtheymakeupthemassofthepeople.

The natureofthechangeisindicatedintheoldfableofthetempleofZeusLycaeus, which tells how he who tastes human flesh mixed up with the flesh of other victims will turn into a wolf. Even so the protector, who tastes human blood, and slays some and exiles others with or without law, who hints at abolition of debts and division of lands, must either perish or become a wolf–that is, a tyrant.
