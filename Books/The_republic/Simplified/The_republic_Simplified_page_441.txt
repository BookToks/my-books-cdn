No one will disagree with what you said.

Come on, I said, and like a judge in a play contest announces the winner, can you also say who you think is the happiest, who is second, and the order of the rest? There are five kinds: royal, timocratical, oligarchical, democratical, and tyrannical.

The answer will be easy, he said; they will come on stage like groups, and I will judge them in the order they appear, based on how good or bad they are, and how happy or unhappy.

Do we need a messenger, or should I say that the best son of Ariston has decided that the best and fairest person is also the happiest, and that this is the person who rules himself like a king? And that the worst and most unfair person is also the most miserable, and this is the one who is the biggest tyrant over himself and his state?

Make the announcement yourself, he said.

Should I add, "whether seen or unseen by gods and people"?

Let those words be added.

Then, I said, this will be our first proof; and there is another one that might also be important.

What is that?

The second proof comes from the soul itself: since the soul, like the State, has three parts, I think this division can give us another way to show the truth.

What kind?

It seems to me that these three parts of the soul have three kinds of pleasure, three desires, and three powers that control them.

What do you mean? he asked.

One part is the learning part, another is the angry part, and the third, which has many forms, doesnâ€™t have a special name but is called the appetitive part. This part is very strong and full of desires like eating, drinking, and other physical wants. It also includes loving money, because money helps satisfy these desires.
