Reason is all about finding the truth and doesn’t care about money or fame. Different people have different main goals, and they enjoy different kinds of pleasures based on what they value most.

Now, if you ask people about their goals, each one will say their own pleasures are the best and look down on others. The money-lover will say knowledge is useless compared to the solid benefits of wealth. The ambitious person will ignore knowledge that doesn’t bring honor. But the philosopher cares only about finding truth and thinks other pleasures are just necessary, not truly good.

So, how do we choose which is best? Is there a better way than using experience and knowledge? Which of the three knows the most and has tried the most? Young people who love learning understand both kinds of desires, but greedy or ambitious people never really enjoy the pleasures of truth and wisdom. The philosopher has honor just like them, but they don’t understand what true being is. The philosopher uses reason to judge, while the others care only about money and fame. If we judge with reason, the philosopher’s pleasure is the real one. So, the happiest life is the one filled with pleasure from the thinking part of the soul. Next comes the life of ambition, and last is the life of making money.

The just person has defeated the unjust twice, like in a big contest, first praying to Zeus to test them. A wise person quietly says the pleasures of wisdom are real and pure; all others are just shadows. Let’s think about this: isn’t pleasure the opposite of pain? And isn’t there a middle state that’s neither? When someone is sick, health feels amazing, but they don’t notice this when they’re healthy. When in pain, all they want is to stop hurting; but when feeling great pleasure, resting feels bad. So rest or stopping can feel like both pleasure and pain. But how can something that is neither be both? Pleasure and pain are movements, and being without them is rest; so how can rest be either pleasure or pain? This shows the conflict is just an illusion caused by our senses.

Also, there are pleasures that don’t come after pain. True pleasure is not just pain going away, and true pain is not just pleasure ending. Most pleasures we feel through our bodies are just relief from pain, and they come with pain before and after them. Imagine nature has three levels: lower, middle, and upper. Someone moving from lower to middle thinks they’re going up and already in the top world; if they go back down, they truly feel they’re descending. This happens because they don’t really know the real upper, middle, and lower places. The same confusion happens with pleasure and pain and many other things.
