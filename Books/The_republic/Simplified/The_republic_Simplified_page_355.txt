We were pretty much right.  

So, my great friend, all the problems and failures I talked about happen because of the kinds of people best suited for the best work. These people are rare, but they can cause the biggest harm to countries and individuals or bring the greatest good when things go their way. But small-minded people have never done anything great for anyone or any country.  

That’s definitely true, he said.  

Because of this, philosophy is left alone and incomplete. The people who should support it have left and are living fake, bad lives. Meanwhile, others who don’t deserve to protect philosophy come in and disrespect it. They add to the criticism from those who say some philosophers are useless and most deserve harsh punishment.  

That’s what people say for sure.  

Yes, and what else would you expect? Think about the weak people who see philosophy open to them—a field full of fancy names and titles—and like prisoners escaping jail, they jump in from their old jobs. These people might be the smartest at their boring jobs, but they switch to philosophy because it seems more important. Many are drawn to philosophy even though their character is flawed and their souls damaged by their bad habits, just like their bodies are harmed by their trades. Isn’t this unavoidable?  

Yes.  

Aren’t they like a bald little repairman who just got out of prison and suddenly inherited a fortune? He takes a bath, puts on a new coat, and dresses up like a groom about to marry his boss’s daughter, who’s left poor and lonely.  

That’s exactly the same.  

What will come from those kinds of marriages? Won’t the children be ugly and illegitimate?  

There’s no doubt about it.  

And when people who don’t deserve education get involved with philosophy, which is above them, what kind of thoughts and opinions do you think will come out?
