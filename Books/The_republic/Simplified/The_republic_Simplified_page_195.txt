Yes.

And a pilot, in the strict sense, is a leader of sailors, not just a regular sailor?

That has been agreed.

And such a pilot or leader will work for the good of the sailors under him, not for his own or the ruler’s benefit?

He reluctantly said, "Yes." Then I said, "Thrasymachus, no one who rules thinks about their own benefit but always what is best for the people they rule or what fits their skill. That’s what they focus on in everything they say and do."

When we reached this point in the talk, and everyone saw that the idea of justice had been completely challenged, Thrasymachus didn’t answer me. Instead, he said, "Tell me, Socrates, do you have a nurse?"

"Why do you ask that?" I said. "You should be answering me instead."

"Because she lets you cry and never wipes your nose. She hasn’t even taught you to tell the shepherd from the sheep."

"Why do you say that?" I asked.

"Because you believe the shepherd or herdsman takes care of the sheep or oxen for their own good, not for their own or their master’s benefit. And you also think that rulers of states, if they are true rulers, don’t see their subjects as sheep and don’t spend all their time thinking about their own advantage. But you’re completely wrong about justice and injustice. Justice is really about the good of the ruler and stronger person, which means the subjects lose out. Injustice is the opposite—the unjust person is the boss over the truly just and simple. The unjust is stronger, and their subjects do what benefits the boss and makes them happy, which is very different from what helps the subjects. Think about it more, silly Socrates: just people are always losers compared to unjust people. First, in private deals: when a just and unjust person are partners, the unjust one always ends up with more when the partnership ends. Second, with the State: when there is a tax, the just person pays more and the unjust pays less on the same income. And when something is given out, the just person gets nothing and the unjust gets a lot. Also, when they take a public job, the just person works hard but gains nothing and might even lose, while being hated by friends for refusing to do illegal things."
