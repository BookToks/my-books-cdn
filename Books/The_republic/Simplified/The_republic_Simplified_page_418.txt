If a person works hard from when they are young, they can get rid of some desires that don’t help them and sometimes even make things worse. Can we say that these desires are not really needed?

Yes, definitely.

Let’s pick an example to better understand this idea.

Good idea.

Is the desire to eat simple food and seasonings, only as much as needed to stay healthy and strong, one of the necessary desires?

I think so.

The pleasure we get from eating is needed in two ways: it helps us and it’s important for staying alive, right?

Yes.

But seasonings are only necessary if they are good for our health?

Exactly.

And the desire for fancy food or other luxury things, which we could usually give up if we learned self-control when young, and which harms the body and hurts the soul when we want to be wise and good, can be called unnecessary?

That’s right.

Can we say that these unnecessary desires cost money, while the necessary ones help people make money because they lead to producing things?

Yes.

Is the same true for the pleasures of love and other kinds of pleasures?

Yes, it is.

The person we talked about before, the “drone,” was someone who was overloaded with pleasures and unnecessary desires, making them a slave to those wants. But the person who only had the necessary desires was stingy and strict with money?

Exactly.

Now, let’s look at how a democratic person comes from an oligarchic person. I think this is usually how it happens.

What is the process?
