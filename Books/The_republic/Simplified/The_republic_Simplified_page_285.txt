I asked.

It is the knowledge of the guardians, he answered, and you find it in the people we just talked about, the perfect guardians.

And what name does the city get because it has this kind of knowledge?

The name of being wise and giving good advice.

Will there be more true guardians or more smiths in our city?

There will be a lot more smiths, he said.

Won’t the guardians be the smallest group, since they are named after having special knowledge?

Yes, the smallest by far.

So, because the guardians are the smallest group but have the knowledge to lead, the whole city will be wise. This kind of wisdom is the only true wisdom, and nature made sure the wisest group is also the smallest.

That’s right.

So, I said, we’ve figured out where one of the four main virtues of the city comes from.

And I think we did a pretty good job, he replied.

Also, I said, it’s easy to understand what courage is and where it lives in the city.

What do you mean?

Well, I said, anyone who calls a city brave or scared is thinking about the part that fights and goes to war for the city.

No one would think about any other part, he said.

The rest of the people might be brave or scared, but their courage or fear won’t really decide if the city as a whole is brave or not.

Of course not.

The city is brave because of the part of itself that always keeps the right idea about what is scary and what is not, the way the city’s laws taught them. That, you call courage.
