Their ideas might seem weak or negative, but they actually had a lot of power. These ideas became the way people understood everything. There was a deep need or feeling inside humans that these ideas fulfilled. They weren’t just ideas, but like gods. Later generations started to connect the powers and stories of older gods to these new ideas.

The idea of good is one of these important words or ways of thinking that began to replace old myths. It meant unity, bringing together all time and existence. It was the truth of everything and the light that made things clear to both humans and gods. It was the cause of everything and the power that created all things. It was universal reason without a human form. It was the life and light of the world, including all knowledge and power. The way to understand it was through math and science, which depended on it. Asking if God made this idea or if it made God is like asking if God can exist without goodness or goodness without God. The God in the Timaeus isn’t really different from the idea of good; they are two sides of the same thing—one personal, one impersonal, one expressed as myth, the other as philosophy.

This is roughly what Plato meant by the idea of good. Numbers, order, harmony, and growth also fit into this idea. The explanation here goes beyond Plato’s exact words. Maybe we understand what he was aiming for better than he did. We are starting to see what he only understood a little and from far away. If he knew that this, or something like it but even better, was the truth he was reaching for, he would be happy to know that his own thoughts were deeper than he realized. Because Plato’s words are few and careful, the way we explain him must be the same. Trying to define his meaning more might actually take away the spirit of his ancient philosophy. It’s strange that although Plato calls the idea of good the first principle of truth and being, he only mentions it clearly in this one passage. Later students probably didn’t understand it, and Aristotle’s mentions of it don’t seem to connect to this idea.

BOOK VII. Now I will describe with a story the enlightenment or lack of it in human nature: Imagine people living in an underground cave that opens toward the light. They have been there since childhood, with their necks and legs chained so they can only look inside the cave.
