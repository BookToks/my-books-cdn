Can a musician make people musical just by playing music?  
Of course not.  

Can a horse rider make someone a bad rider just by riding horses?  
No way.  

Can a just person make others unfair by being just? Or, in general, can good people make others bad?  
Definitely not.  

Just like heat can’t make something cold,  
or drought can’t make something wet,  
good people can’t hurt others.  
That’s impossible.  

And the just person is the good person, right?  
Yes, for sure.  

So, hurting a friend or anyone else isn’t what a just person would do. It’s the opposite — it’s what an unjust person would do.  
I think what you’re saying makes a lot of sense, Socrates.  

If someone says justice means paying back debts, and that being good means paying what you owe your friends, but being bad means paying back your enemies with harm — that’s not smart.  
Because, as we’ve already seen, hurting someone can never be truly just.  
I agree with you, said Polemarchus.  

So, are you ready to argue against anyone who says that smart people like Simonides, Bias, or Pittacus believed justice is doing good to friends and harm to enemies?  
I’m totally ready to argue with you, he said.  

Want to know who I think really came up with that idea?  
Who?  

I think it was someone like Periander, Perdiccas, Xerxes, Ismenias the Theban, or some other rich and powerful person who thought highly of their own strength.  
They were the first to say that justice is “doing good to your friends and harm to your enemies.”
