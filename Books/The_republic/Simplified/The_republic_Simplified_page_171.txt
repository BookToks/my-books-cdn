He still thinks there might be a better way to live, but no one can really figure it out unless they get some kind of special truth from heaven. His ceremonies before marriage and his idea that wars should be fought by killing only the leaders of the enemy are a bit like some strange ideas from Plato. He has a nice imagination, like how Greeks and non-Greeks were said to be connected in Plato’s Timaeus. He believes Utopians learned Greek easily because they were originally related to the Greeks. He is full of Plato’s spirit and uses many ideas from Plato’s Republic and Timaeus.

He cares more about public duties than personal stuff and doesn’t like being bothered by family or friends too much. His citizens don’t own silver or gold, but they are willing to pay mercenaries with it. He really hates the love of money. Gold is only used to chain up criminals, and diamonds and pearls are just for kids’ necklaces. When ambassadors showed up wearing gold and fancy feathers, most Utopians thought it was ugly and shameful. They respected the poorest people more than those rich ambassadors because wearing gold made the ambassadors look like slaves. You could even see kids throwing away their pearls and pushing their moms, saying, “Look, even though he’s a little kid, he’s still like the ambassadors.” The moms would tell them to be quiet, thinking the ambassadors might be fools.

Like Plato, he often makes fun of governments and rulers, and talks about the problems in the world and knowledge. The main character in his story, Hythloday, really doesn’t want to be a government official because he thinks he would lose his freedom and no one would listen to his advice. He also mocks the new kind of logic his time uses. The Utopians don’t understand complicated ideas like “Second Intentions” because they haven’t made up all those tricky rules learned by children in other places. They can’t even understand the idea of “self” the way others do, even if someone is huge and pointed out with a finger.

He is very harsh about the hobbies of the rich; the Utopians think hunting is the worst, cruelest kind of killing. He quotes Plato’s Republic, where the philosopher is described as standing away from a storm until it passes. This seems to apply to More’s own life, even though he wrote this about 1514, many years before some things actually happened.
