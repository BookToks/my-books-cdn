Dear Glaucon, you can’t understand this part yet. Nobody can find the absolute truth without first learning other subjects. But I believe there is a way to learn the absolute truth that’s very different from what people do now. Most arts or sciences depend on human needs and opinions. Math, for example, is just a guess about true reality and doesn’t question its own basics. Dialectic is different. It goes beyond guesses and helps the soul’s eye move from ignorance to the light of real knowledge. It does this with the help of the sciences we talked about before—sciences that are clearer than opinions but not as clear as full science. We called this understanding.

So, we have four names: two for the mind and two for opinions—reason or mind, understanding, faith, and seeing shadows. These make a pattern: being is to becoming as intellect is to opinion, and science is to belief as understanding is to seeing shadows. Dialectic is the science that explains the true nature of everything, finds what’s good, and fights anyone who disagrees. For someone who isn’t skilled in dialectic, life is like a sleepy dream, and many people are like they’re dead even though they’re awake. Do you want future leaders of your perfect State to be smart or dumb? “Of course smart.” Then you need to train their minds in dialectic. This will teach them to ask and answer questions and is the most important part of all sciences.

I’m sure you remember how we picked our rulers before, and now we can add one more step. Like before, they must be brave, good-looking, and well-mannered. But now, they also need natural talent that education can improve. They must learn fast, work hard mentally, remember things well, and be steady and hardworking. They should have both intellectual and moral virtues. They can’t be lazy in mind but active in body, or the other way around. They can’t be weak or confused souls who hate lies but are stuck in ignorance. They must be strong in body and mind, ready for the tough mental challenges ahead. Justice herself would approve of people like this, and they will save our State. If we pick others, philosophy will only look more ridiculous than it does now. Sorry, I’m getting excited because I hate seeing philosophy treated badly. “I didn’t notice you were so excited,” you say. But I was.

Also, don’t forget another important thing about picking our students—they must be young, not old. Solon was wrong to say old people can always learn. Youth is the best time to study, and the mind then is free and fresh. Unlike the body, the mind shouldn’t be forced to work against its nature. Learning should start as a kind of play, where we can see what natural talents someone has.
