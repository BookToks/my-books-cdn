Very good, he said.

And which way do I understand you like best? I asked.

The one you suggest.

Well, then, Thrasymachus, I said, why don’t you start from the beginning and answer me. You say that being perfectly unfair is better than being perfectly fair?

Yes, that’s what I say, and I’ve given you my reasons.

And what do you think about those reasons? Would you call one good and the other bad?

Sure.

I guess you’d call fairness good and unfairness bad?

What a funny idea! I don’t think that, since I say being unfair is better and fairness is not.

What else would you say then?

The opposite, he replied.

And would you call fairness bad?

No, I’d say it’s super simple.

Then would you call unfairness mean?

No, I’d say it’s smart.

And do unfair people seem wise and good to you?

Yes, he said; at least those who can be perfectly unfair and have the power to control countries and groups. But maybe you think I’m talking about pickpockets. Even that job, if they don’t get caught, has some benefits, though not as good as the ones I just talked about.

I don’t think I misunderstand you, Thrasymachus, I said; but I’m still shocked that you think unfairness is wise and good, and fairness is the opposite.

Yes, I do think that.

Now, I said, you have a stronger and almost unbeatable point; because if the unfairness you say is better was admitted by you or others to be bad and ugly, then someone could argue against you based on normal ideas. But now I see you call unfairness honorable and strong, and you give unfair people all the good qualities we used to give to fair people, since you don’t hesitate to say unfairness has wisdom and goodness.
