Think about this: a good person won’t think death is terrible for another good person who is their friend.

Yes, that’s our belief.

So, they won’t be super sad when their friend dies, like something really awful happened?

They won’t.

A person like that is happy with themselves and doesn’t need other people much.

True, that’s right.

That’s why losing a son or brother, or losing wealth, is the least terrible thing for them.

Definitely.

So, they are least likely to cry about it and will stay calm even if something bad like that happens.

Yes, they will feel that kind of bad luck much less than others.

Then we will stop famous men from crying so much and making women (and not even helpful women) or weaker men do it for them. The people we are teaching to protect their country will think that’s silly.

That would be good.

Then we will ask Homer and other poets not to show Achilles, who is the son of a goddess, lying down and acting crazy—like running wild by the sea, throwing ashes on his head, or crying and wailing like Homer wrote.

They also shouldn’t show Priam, related to the gods, begging and rolling on the ground, calling out names loudly.

We will ask them even more not to have the gods complaining, saying things like, “Oh no! My pain! Oh no! I had the bravest son and now I’m sad.”

But if they must show the gods, at least don’t make them say those things and make them look weak.
