No, he replied, "suppose" isn’t the right word—I know it for sure. But you’ll be found out, and no matter how strong your argument is, you will never win.

I won’t try to argue, my friend. But to avoid any confusion between us later, let me ask: when you talk about a ruler or someone stronger, whose job it is to make the weaker people follow, do you mean a ruler in the common way or in the strictest sense?

In the strictest sense, he said. Now try to trick me or betray me if you can; I won’t go easy on you. But you never will be able to, never.

And do you really think, I said, that I’m crazy enough to try and cheat, Thrasymachus? I might as well face a lion.

Well, he said, you just tried a minute ago and failed.

Enough, I said, let’s stop these polite words. It’s better if I ask you a question: Is a doctor, in the strict sense you mean, someone who heals the sick or someone who just wants to make money? And remember, I’m talking about a real doctor.

A healer of the sick, he answered.

And what about a pilot—the real kind—is he just a sailor or the captain of the sailors?

He is the captain of the sailors.

The fact that he sails the ship doesn’t matter; he shouldn’t be called just a sailor. The word pilot shows his skill and his authority over the sailors.

That’s true, he said.

Now, I said, every skill or art has a goal, right?

Yes.

And what does that skill have to think about and take care of?

Yes, that’s the goal of the skill.

And the goal of any skill is to make it perfect—nothing else?

What do you mean?

I mean, I can explain by talking about the body.
