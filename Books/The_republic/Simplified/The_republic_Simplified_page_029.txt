A city that has all these things will be bigger than just four or five people, but it won’t be very huge. However, it will need to trade with other places, which means it will have to import goods. To bring in imports, it must also export things. This means there needs to be a variety of products to attract buyers, merchants, and ships. The city must also have a market, money, and shops, or else buyers and sellers won’t meet, and the producers will waste their time trying to trade. If we add hired workers, the city will be complete. And we can guess that when people interact, both fairness and unfairness will show up.

Here’s a simple picture of how these people live. They spend their days in houses they built themselves. They make their own clothes and grow their own corn and grapes for wine. Their main food is meal and flour, and they don’t drink too much. They get along well with each other and try not to have too many kids. 

“But,” said Glaucon, jumping in, “don’t they want something tastier?” Of course; they will have salt, olives, cheese, vegetables, fruits, and chestnuts to roast by the fire. “It’s a city of pigs, Socrates!” Why, I asked, what else do you want? “Just the comforts of life—sofas, tables, sauces, and sweets.” I see; you want not just a city but a fancy, luxurious city. And maybe in a more complicated city, we’ll find justice and injustice more clearly. 

Then the arts will be needed—everything that makes life fancy and comfortable. There will be dancers, painters, sculptors, musicians, cooks, barbers, hairdressers, nurses, and artists. There will also be people to take care of animals and doctors to fix health problems caused by luxury. To feed all these extra people, we’ll need some land from our neighbors, and they’ll want some of ours. This is where war starts, caused by the same problems that bring other political troubles. Our city will need a small army, and citizens will become soldiers.

But remember the old idea about dividing jobs. Fighting isn’t something you learn in a day; some people are naturally better at it. Some will be like dogs—quick, strong, and brave. These spirited people, whether human or animal, have lots of energy. But those with too much spirit can hurt each other. Being gentle to friends but fierce to enemies is hard, and a city’s guard needs both qualities. So who can be a guard? Think of a dog. Dogs are gentle with friends and tough with strangers.

Your dog is like a thinker who knows what’s right or wrong. Philosophy, or love of learning, makes both people and animals gentle. Human guards must love learning to be gentle. But how can they learn without education? 

So, what should their education be?
