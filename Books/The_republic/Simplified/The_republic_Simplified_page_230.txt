Then, I said, my good friend, we must not give up on the task, even if it takes a while.

Certainly not.

Come now, let’s spend some free time telling stories, and our stories will teach our heroes.

By all means.

So, what kind of education should they get? Can we do better than the usual kind? It has two parts: exercise for the body and music for the soul.

True.

Should we start with music and then move on to exercise?

By all means.

When you say music, do you mean including books and stories too?

I do.

And stories can be either true or false, right?

Yes.

Should kids learn both kinds, starting with the false ones?

I don’t understand what you mean, he said.

You know, I said, we begin by telling kids stories that are mostly made up but not completely untrue. These stories are told before they’re old enough to do exercise training.

Very true.

That’s what I meant when I said we should teach music before exercise.

Quite right, he said.

You also know that the beginning is the most important part of any work, especially for young and delicate things; that’s when their character is being formed and they are most ready to learn.

Quite true.

So should we just let children hear any random stories made up by anyone, and let their minds take in ideas that are mostly the opposite of what we want them to believe when they grow up?
