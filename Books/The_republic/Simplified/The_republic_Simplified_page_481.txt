People, get ready for a new cycle of life and death. You won’t just be given your talents; you will get to choose them. The person who picks first gets the best choice, and the life they pick will be their fate.

Being good is a choice, and the more you respect goodness, the more you’ll have it. It’s up to you to decide—God’s decisions are fair. After the Interpreter said this, he threw lots to everyone except himself. Each person took the lot closest to them and saw their number.

Then the Interpreter showed them different kinds of lives. There were more lives than souls, and they included all kinds of animals and humans in every situation.

Some lives were full of cruelty and suffering, some ended in poverty and exile. There were lives of famous people, some famous for being strong or beautiful, others famous for their family background. Some were famous for the opposite reasons. The same went for women’s lives, but none had a fixed character because the soul changes when choosing a new life. All kinds of qualities mixed together, including wealth, poverty, health, sickness, and middle conditions.

Here, my friend Glaucon, is the biggest danger for humans, so we must be very careful. Each of us should forget everything else and focus on one thing: learning how to tell good from evil. If we can find someone to teach us, we can always choose the better life whenever we get the chance.

We should think about how all these things affect being good. We need to understand what beauty means when combined with riches or poverty, and what good or bad things come from being born noble or humble, rich or poor, strong or weak, smart or dull. We should learn how these natural and learned traits work together.

Then we can see the soul’s true nature and decide which life is better or worse. We will call a life evil if it makes the soul more unfair, and good if it makes the soul more just. Everything else can be ignored. We know this is the best choice, both in life and after death.

A person must take into the afterlife a strong belief in truth and justice. This way, they won’t be fooled by wanting wealth or other bad things. If they meet cruel rulers or evil acts, they won’t do terrible harm to others or suffer worse themselves. Instead, they will know how to avoid extremes and choose a balanced life, not only now but in what comes next.
