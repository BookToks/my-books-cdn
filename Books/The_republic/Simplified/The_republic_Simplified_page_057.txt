Nowadays, dogs aren’t split into males and females with different jobs – we don’t send only the males out to hunt while the females stay home to take care of puppies. Both males and females do the same jobs. The only difference is that one sex is usually stronger and the other weaker. But if women are going to have the same jobs as men, they need the same education – they must learn music, gymnastics, and how to fight.

I know people will probably laugh at the idea of women riding horses and carrying weapons; seeing old, wrinkled women showing off their skills won’t look beautiful and might even become a joke. But we shouldn’t care about what people laugh at. There was a time when people laughed at the gymnastics we do now. It’s all about getting used to it: people have finally realized it’s better to be open and active than to hide away, and now they don’t laugh anymore. Only bad things should be made fun of.

The first question is whether women can fully or partially do the same jobs as men. Some might say it’s inconsistent to even ask this because we started with the idea that different jobs are based on different natures. But are men and women really that different? Actually, yes, they are quite different, and that’s why I’ve avoided talking about family things. Still, when a man is in danger, like drowning, he just tries to survive, so we have to try to find a way for women to escape hard situations too.

People say different natures mean different jobs, and men and women are different. But this difference might just be in words. For example, a bald man and a man with hair are different in one way, but that doesn’t mean if a bald man is a shoemaker, a hairy man can’t be one too. The difference between men and women is like that – it’s one small part, not a big difference like between a doctor and a carpenter.

If the only real difference between men and women is that one makes children and the other carries them, that doesn’t mean they need different education. Even if women are different in ability, men are different from each other too. People have mixed qualities they need among both men and women. In fact, in some jobs, women can be better than men, and in others, men can be better than women. Women are the same kind of people as men, and they can be good or bad at things like medicine, sports, or war – just like men. One woman might be a good leader, another might not. We should pick the best people to be leaders, no matter if they are men or women. If men and women are the same in nature, then their education should be the same too. It’s not weird or impossible for women to learn music or gymnastics.
