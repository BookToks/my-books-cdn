We also love poetry because the education of good leaders has taught us to, and so we want poetry to be shown in the best and most honest way. But as long as poetry can’t defend itself well, we will keep saying this to ourselves while listening to it, so we don’t fall into the silly kind of love for it that many people have. We know poetry, as we described it, shouldn’t be taken seriously as the truth. Anyone who listens to it and worries about protecting the city inside them should watch out for its tricks and follow our advice.

Yes, he said, I agree with you.

Yes, I said, my friend Glaucon, because this is a big deal, even bigger than it seems—whether someone should be good or bad. What good is it if someone, driven by honor, money, power, or even poetry, ignores what is right and just?

Yes, he said; your argument convinced me, just like I think it would convince anyone else.

But we haven’t even talked about the greatest rewards that come from being good.

Are there even bigger rewards? If there are, they must be unbelievably great.

Well, I said, what big thing ever happens quickly? Living seventy years is really nothing compared to forever.

More like nothing, he replied.

And would an immortal soul seriously care about this short time instead of all time?

It should care about all time, for sure. But why do you ask?

Don’t you know, I said, that the soul of a person never dies and lasts forever?

He looked at me, surprised, and said: No way! Are you really ready to say that?

Yes, I said, I should be, and you should be too—it’s not hard to prove.

I see a big problem with that, but I want to hear your proof since you say it’s easy.

Then listen.

I’m ready.
