Yes.

Isn't it true that the farthest from reason is also the farthest from law and order?

Definitely.

And the lustful and cruel desires are the farthest away, right?

Yes.

And the royal and orderly desires are the closest?

Yes.

So the tyrant lives the farthest from true or natural pleasure, and the king lives the closest?

Exactly.

If that's the case, the tyrant's life is the most unpleasant, and the king's life is the most pleasant?

For sure.

Do you want to know how far apart they are?

Will you tell me?

There seem to be three kinds of pleasures: one real and two fake. The tyrant goes beyond the fake pleasures and lives with some low, slave-like pleasures. The difference between him and the king can be shown with a number.

What do you mean?

I think the tyrant is third in distance from the oligarch, and the democrat is in the middle?

Yes.

If what we said is true, the tyrant believes in a kind of pleasure that is three times farther from the truth than the pleasure of the oligarch?

He does.

And the oligarch is third from the royal, since we count one royal as an aristocrat?

Yes, he's third.

So the tyrant is separated from true pleasure by a distance that is three times three?
