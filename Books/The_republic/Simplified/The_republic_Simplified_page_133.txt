He tries to do something really hard: to connect the past of Greek history with the future of philosophy. This is like another impossible dream—trying to link Europe’s old history with the kingdom of Christ. Nothing in the world is like Plato’s perfect State, and even he didn’t think such a State could actually exist. He says this many times, for example in the Republic and the Laws, where he admits that the perfect state based on communism and philosophy wasn’t possible in his time, though it could still be used as an example to follow.

He also shows doubt by seriously saying in the Republic that ideals aren’t worse just because they can’t be made real. He even expects people to laugh at his ideas, but like a good writer, he tries hard to make his ideas seem real. When asked how the perfect State could happen, he jokes, “When a fake king becomes a philosopher.” He calls the idea of men born on Earth becoming perfect rulers a “noble lie.” When his plan is finished, he honestly says his Republic is only a vision, something that might be real in some way, but not in the common sense of philosophers actually ruling the world. People say Plato both flies and walks, but that’s not true; he does both at once, being in the air and on the ground at the same time.

Niebuhr asked a small question: Was Plato a good citizen? If that means, Was he loyal to Athens’ government? — then no, he wasn’t really a fan of democracy. But he didn’t like any other government either. He thought all governments were just groups fighting for power. None of them matched his idea of people freely ruling over others who agreed to be ruled, which sounds a bit like democracy. The worst government, he said, was tyranny. The question doesn’t really make sense for a great thinker like Plato, whose writings were meant for all times and all people, not just one country or age. Athens was losing its power, and this probably made Plato create his perfect State. The Republic can be seen as a sign of Greece’s fading glory. It would be like complaining about St. Augustine for not being loyal to the Roman Empire, since his big work, The City of God, was written for similar reasons. Or like blaming the early Christians for not being good citizens because they followed higher powers and looked forward to a city in heaven.

The idea of the perfect State is full of contradictions if we judge it by normal human ideas. The strange ideas of one time often become normal in the next time, but Plato’s strange ideas are just as strange to us now as they were to people back then. Today, many people either laugh at them as silly or say they are unnatural and wrong. Some even like Aristotle’s criticism of Plato’s ideas because it fits with their own common sense.
