How does he live, in unhappiness or misery?

Yes, he said, he is the only one left.

But there is an earlier question we still haven’t answered.

What question?

I don’t think we have really figured out what kinds of desires people have and how many there are. Until we do that, everything will stay confusing.

Well, he said, it’s not too late to fix that.

That’s true, I said. Here’s the part I want to understand: Some unnecessary pleasures and desires are actually wrong. Everyone seems to have them, but some people control them with rules and reason. Their better feelings win over those bad desires—they either get rid of them completely or make them weak and few. But for others, those bad desires are stronger and there are more of them.

Which desires do you mean?

I mean the ones that show up when a person’s thinking and self-control are asleep. Then the wild animal inside, stuffed with food or drink, wakes up and tries to satisfy its wants. At that time, without shame or sense, a person might do anything foolish or evil—like incest, murder, or eating forbidden food.

That’s mostly true, he said.

But when a person’s body is healthy and balanced, and before going to sleep they have used their reason and thought about good things, after having just enough pleasure to calm their desires—not too much or too little—then those desires fall asleep. They don’t bother the higher part of the mind, which is free to think deeply and try to understand things unknown, whether from the past, present, or future. When the angry or wild parts are calm, and reason is awake before sleep, a person gets closest to the truth and is least likely to have crazy or lawless dreams.
