Will everyone call each other citizens?  

Of course.  

But do people in other countries use a different name for their rulers?  

Usually, they call them masters, but in democracies, they just call them rulers.  

And in our country, what other names do people use for their rulers besides citizens?  

They call them saviors and helpers, he answered.  

And what do the rulers call the people?  

Their supporters and protectors.  

What about in other countries?  

They call them slaves.  

And what do rulers call each other in other countries?  

Fellow rulers.  

And what about here?  

Fellow guardians.  

Have you ever heard of a ruler in another country calling one of his colleagues a friend and another not a friend?  

Yes, that happens a lot.  

And the friend is someone he cares about, while the other is seen as a stranger he doesn't care about?  

Exactly.  

But would any of your guardians think of another guardian as a stranger?  

No, never; everyone they meet is seen as a brother or sister, father or mother, son or daughter, or as a family member connected to them.  

Great, I said; but let me ask again: will they be a family just in name, or will they act like a real family? For example, when they say "father," will they show the care a father should, and will children show respect and obey him like the law says? And if someone breaks these duties, will they be seen as disrespectful and wicked, unlikely to get much good from God or people?
