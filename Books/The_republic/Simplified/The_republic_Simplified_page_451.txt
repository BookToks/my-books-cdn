Clearly.

The shadow of unfair pleasure, based on how long it lasts, will be a flat shape.

Of course.

And if you increase the power and make that flat shape solid, it’s easy to see how big the gap is between a tyrant and a king.

Yes; a math person can easily add it up.

Or if someone starts from the other side and measures the gap between the king and the tyrant in real pleasure, they will find that when they finish multiplying, the king lives 729 times more happily, and the tyrant suffers just as much more pain.

What an amazing calculation! And how huge is the distance that separates a fair person from a unfair one when it comes to pleasure and pain!

But it’s a true calculation, I said, and the number almost matches the length of a human life, if people think about days, nights, months, and years. (729 is almost the number of days and nights in a year.) Yes, he said, human life definitely involves those.

Then if a good and fair person is so much better in pleasure than a bad and unfair one, their advantage in living rightly, and in beauty and goodness, will be even bigger?

Way bigger.

Alright, I said, now that we’re here, let’s go back to what we were talking about: Didn’t someone say that being unfair is a gain for someone who’s perfectly unfair but is thought to be fair?

Yes, that was said.

Now that we’ve figured out how strong and real justice and injustice are, let’s have a little chat with him.

What should we say to him?

Let’s make a picture of the soul so he can see his own words clearly.

What kind?

An ideal picture of the soul, like the mixed creatures from old myths, like the Chimera, Scylla, or Cerberus—there are lots of these where two or more different parts come together as one.
