Aristotle talks about how two of Plato’s works, the Republic and the Laws, are connected. In the Republic, Socrates answers some big questions like sharing women and children, sharing property, and how the state should be set up. The people are split into two groups: farmers and warriors. From the warriors, a smaller group of rulers and advisors is chosen. But Socrates doesn’t say if farmers and artists should help run the government or fight in wars. He does think women should get the same education as the warriors and fight alongside them. The rest of the Republic talks a lot about how to educate the guardians, but it often goes off topic. 

In the Laws, there are mostly rules and not much about how the government works. Plato planned this state to be more like a normal one but then made it more like the ideal state from the Republic. Except for sharing women and property, everything else is the same in both states. The education is the same, citizens don’t have to do low-status jobs, and there are shared meals. The main difference is that in the Laws, women also join the shared meals, and there are about 5,000 warriors, while in the Republic, there are only 1,000.

Plato says in the Laws that the best kind of state is one where "friends share everything." This means no private property or private families, and everyone shares everything, even things that are usually private like eyes and hands. People feel happy or sad together, praise and blame together, and the laws bring the city together as much as possible. Plato thinks no state based on anything else can be better or more virtuous than this kind. If such a state existed, whether made by gods or their children, it would make people truly happy. We should aim for this perfect state and try to create one like it. The state we have now is close to this perfect one, and with some luck, we will finish building the best state. Next, Plato will explain the second-best state and how it started.
