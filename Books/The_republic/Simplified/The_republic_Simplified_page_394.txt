Definitely not.

Then you will make a rule that they should get an education that helps them become really good at asking and answering questions?

Yes, he said, you and I will make that rule together.

Dialectic, then, as you agree, is the most important part of science, and it stands above all others—no science is higher than this, and knowledge can’t go any further?

I agree, he said.

But we still need to decide who should study this and how they should do it.

Yes, that’s clear.

Remember how we picked the rulers before?

Certainly, he said.

We still need to pick the same kinds of people, giving priority to the most reliable and brave ones, and if possible, the most fair. They should be noble and generous, and also have natural talents that will help them learn.

And what are those talents?

Talents like being sharp and quick to learn; the mind usually struggles more with hard study than the body does with exercise, because the work is mostly mental, not physical.

Very true, he replied.

Also, the person we’re looking for should have a good memory and be strong and hardworking, loving work in any form. Otherwise, they won’t be able to handle the physical activity and all the mental training and study we expect.

Certainly, he said; they must have natural talents.

The problem now is that people who study philosophy don’t really want to do it, and that’s why it has a bad reputation. True followers should support it, not fake or careless ones.

What do you mean?

First, a true follower should not be lazy or only half-working—I mean, they shouldn’t be someone who loves sports and hunting and all kinds of physical activities but hates or avoids studying, listening, or asking questions.
