We will find out if we should follow Thrasymachus’s idea to go after injustice, or if we should choose justice based on what the argument says.

Sure, he replied, we should do what you say.

Should we stick to our old plan to make things clear? First, we’ll look at the State, then the individual. We’ll start with a government based on honor. I don’t know any other name for this kind of government except timocracy, or maybe timarchy. We’ll compare this to the similar kind of person. After that, we’ll think about oligarchy and the oligarchical person. Then, we’ll look at democracy and the democratic person. Finally, we’ll check out tyranny and the tyrant’s soul, and try to make a good decision.

This way of looking at things will work well.

First, let’s ask how timocracy (the government of honor) comes from aristocracy (the government of the best). It’s clear that all political changes start when the ruling power splits up. A government that stays united, no matter how small, can’t be changed.

That’s true, he said.

So, how will our city change, and how will the two groups of helpers and rulers argue with each other or among themselves?

Should we, like Homer, ask the Muses to tell us “how discord first started”? Should we imagine them joking with us like kids, speaking in a serious way but really playing around?

How would they talk to us?

Like this: A city made this way can hardly be shaken; but since everything that starts also ends, your kind of government won’t last forever and will eventually break down. This is how it happens: In plants and animals, fertility and sterility happen when their life cycles finish. Short-lived creatures go through their cycles quickly, and long-lived ones take longer. No matter how smart or well-trained your rulers are, they won’t figure out the rules of human fertility and sterility because these rules are hidden from normal understanding. They’ll have children when they shouldn’t. Things born from a divine source have a life cycle based on a perfect number (like 6, which is the sum of 1, 2, and 3), so when the full cycle is done, all the smaller cycles in it are done too.
