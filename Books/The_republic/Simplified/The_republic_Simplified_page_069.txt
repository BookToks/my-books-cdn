Goodness has to be real; a person might want to look like they’re good, but they won’t want to just seem good without actually being good.

Should our leaders not understand this most important idea, which everyone kind of feels inside, and without which no one truly knows anything? “But Socrates, what is this most important idea? Is it knowledge or pleasure or something else? You might think I’m annoying, but I want you to stop just repeating what others say and tell us your own thoughts.” “Can I say what I don’t know?” “You can give your opinion.” “But will you be happy with a weak opinion when you could have the clear truth of real knowledge?” “I just want you to explain what good means, like you already explained temperance and justice.” I wish I could, but right now I’m not able to fully understand what good really is. I can’t explain it to the grown-ups, but maybe I can explain it to the beginner, like a child learning about money and interest. (Check my explanation carefully, and don’t let me lie about it.)

Remember how we talked about many beautiful things and the one true beauty, the specific things we see and the big ideas we think about? Have you thought that seeing needs the sense of sight, which is the most complicated and expensive of our senses? It needs not just things to look at, but also something called light. Without light, we can’t see colors and everything would be blank. Light is the important connection between what sees and what is seen. The god who gives us light is the sun, which is like the eye of the day—but it’s not the same as the human eye. This eye of the day, or the sun, is what I call the child of the good, and it relates to the visible world the same way the good relates to the world of ideas.

When the sun shines, our eyes can see. In the world of ideas, where truth lives, there is both sight and light too. The sun for intelligent beings is the idea of good, which causes knowledge and truth but is even better and more beautiful than both. It relates to them like the sun relates to light. It’s an amazing kind of beauty that is beyond knowledge and truth. (“You can’t mean pleasure,” he said. “Be quiet,” I answered.) This idea of good, like the sun, also causes things to grow, and it’s the source not only of knowledge but of existence itself—much greater than either in power and importance.

“That’s a deep idea, more than human,” he said, “but please keep going with your example, because I think there’s more.” There is, I said. Keep in mind our two suns or main ideas, and imagine their two worlds—one you can see, and the other you can only understand with your mind. You can picture this like a line divided unevenly into two parts, and then divide each part again to show different steps of knowing in each world.

The lower part of the visible world includes shadows and reflections, and the smaller upper part includes real things in nature or art. The world of ideas also has two parts—one is math, where you don’t move upward by asking questions but only by figuring out conclusions from what you already know.
