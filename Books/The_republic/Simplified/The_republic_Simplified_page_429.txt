Why?  

Because he wrote the famous saying, "Tyrants are smart because they hang out with smart people." He meant that tyrants only choose wise people to be their friends.  

Yes, he said that tyranny is even godlike, and many other poets have said similar things.  

So, I said, since tragic poets are smart, they will forgive us and others who live like we do if we don’t let them into our city, because they praise tyranny.  

Yes, he said, those who are clever will definitely forgive us.  

But they will keep going to other cities, gather crowds, hire loud and convincing speakers, and turn those cities into tyrannies or democracies.  

That’s true.  

Also, they get paid and honored—most by tyrants, and next by democracies. But the higher they climb in our government, the more their reputation drops, and they seem to run out of energy to go further.  

True.  

But we’re getting off topic. Let’s go back and figure out how the tyrant will keep his large, changing army.  

He said, if the city has sacred treasures, the tyrant will take and spend them. He will also use the money from people who lost their wealth to lower taxes he would otherwise charge the people.  

What if that money runs out?  

Clearly, he said, then the tyrant and his close friends, whether men or women, will live off his father’s money.  

You mean the people who gave him life will have to support him and his friends?  

Yes, he said; they can’t help it.  

But what if the people get angry and say grown-ups shouldn’t be supported by their fathers, but the fathers should be supported by their children?
