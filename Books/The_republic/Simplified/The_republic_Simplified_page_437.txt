They are total opposites, he said. One is the very best, and the other is the very worst.

There’s no doubt about which is which, I said. So, I want to ask if you would agree about which one is happier and which one is more miserable. We shouldn’t be scared of the tyrant, who is just one person and maybe a few followers. Instead, we should look carefully all around the city and then give our opinion.

That sounds fair, he replied. I see, like everyone does, that tyranny is the worst kind of government, and the rule of a king is the happiest.

When we judge the people too, can I ask for a judge who really understands human nature? He shouldn’t be like a kid who only sees the outside and is impressed by how powerful the tyrant looks. Instead, he should have good insight. Let’s say the judge lives in the same place, has seen the tyrant’s daily life and family, and has been with him in tough times. He can then tell us about the tyrant’s happiness and misery compared to others.

That’s a very fair idea, he said.

Can we assume that we are good judges and have met such a person before? Then we’ll have someone who can answer our questions.

Of course.

Don’t forget the comparison between the individual and the State. Keeping this in mind, can you tell me about their situations?

What do you mean? he asked.

Starting with the State, I said, would you say a city ruled by a tyrant is free or enslaved?

No city, he said, can be more completely enslaved.

And yet, you see, there are free people as well as rulers in such a State?

Yes, he said, I see that there are a few; but most people, generally speaking, are sadly treated and enslaved.
