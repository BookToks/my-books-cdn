The country that was big enough for the original people living there will be too small now, right?

That’s true.

Then we will need a piece of our neighbors’ land for grazing animals and farming, and they will want some of ours if, like us, they want more than they really need and try to get a lot of wealth.

That, Socrates, will definitely happen.

And so we will go to war, Glaucon. Won’t we?

Most definitely, he answered.

Before we decide if war is good or bad, we can say that war comes from the same reasons that cause almost all problems in both private life and in the government.

Absolutely.

Our state will have to grow again, and this time the growth will be like a whole army that has to fight invaders for everything we own and for the people we talked about earlier.

Why? he asked. Can’t they protect themselves?

No, I said, not if we were right about the rule we all agreed on when we were making the state: that one person can’t do many jobs well.

That’s very true, he said.

But isn’t war a skill or art?

Yes, it is.

And an art that needs as much care as making shoes?

Exactly.

And the shoemaker wasn’t allowed to be a farmer, a weaver, or a builder—so that we would have good shoes; every worker had one job that fit their nature, and they were to do that job all their life and no other. They couldn’t waste chances, and that’s how they would become good at their work.

Now, nothing is more important than the work of soldiers being done well.
