Old customs, whether about religion or law, often get changed or removed as people grow and society changes. This is something that happens everywhere and always.

The main idea of understanding things is that when people find a new way to explain something, they keep using it. If something can’t be changed, they find a way to explain it differently.

So, there were two kinds of religion living side by side without much conflict. One was the traditional religion passed down or made up by poets, with temple worship. The other was the religion of philosophers, who thought about big ideas but still joined in regular prayers and offerings. Over time, the fight between these two types of religion, which was never as strong as it is today, went away. It became more like the difference between what educated and uneducated people believe now.

The gods from old stories, like Zeus, were accepted by great thinkers like Plato. Heroes like Heracles became seen as helpers of humanity. These changes were made by smart groups like the Stoics and neo-Platonists before and after Christ. Greek and Roman religions slowly mixed with philosophy. They lost their old meanings but turned into poetry and moral lessons. They were probably at their best when their influence started to fade.

Near the end of the book, there is a special idea about a “lie in the soul.” This is connected to Plato’s and Socrates’ teaching that not knowing something on purpose is better than being tricked without knowing it. A lie in the soul is a deep, true kind of wrong—when the part of you that knows the highest truth is fooled and you can’t escape it.

For example, saying God is false or bad, or that He tricks people, or claiming things like “knowledge is just what you feel,” or “power is what makes things right,” would be considered big lies by Plato. It’s like someone who can’t see but says “I see.” This kind of lie is like a sin that can’t be forgiven, according to the Bible, though Greek and Christian ideas say it differently.

This is different from lies in words, like in stories, poems, or jokes, which might fool people but can be helpful sometimes. Socrates talks about this when he asks if it’s okay to trick a madman, and he also compares how gods and humans are different.

God is truth, but humans can only be true by sometimes pretending, or even being partly false.
