What do you mean?

I think sight is in the eyes, and people have eyes to see. Colors are also in the eyes, but unless there is something else made for this purpose, the person won’t see anything and colors won’t be visible.

What kind of thing are you talking about?

I mean the thing you call light.

That’s right.

So, light is the important link that connects sight and what can be seen. It’s a very special connection because light is not something bad or low.

No, it’s the opposite of bad.

Then, I asked, which god in the sky would you say is the ruler of this element? Whose light helps the eyes see clearly and makes things visible?

You mean the sun, like everyone else says.

Can we describe the connection between sight and the sun like this?

How?

The sun is not sight, and the eye with sight is not the sun.

No.

But out of all the senses, the eye is the most like the sun?

Yes, by far.

And the eye’s power is kind of like an effect that comes from the sun?

Exactly.

So, the sun is not sight itself, but the source of sight that sight recognizes?

True.

And this is what I call the child of the good, made by the good in its own image. In the visible world, this child relates to sight and things we see just like the good relates to the mind and things we think about in the intellectual world. Can you explain more?
