(4) This part links everything together and gets us ready for kicking the poets out in Book X.

(5) Don’t miss the pictures that go along with the story about the lover of arguing and the sickly guy, the funny joke about Phocylides’ saying, how the idea of rich and poor citizens fits into the topic, and the example about Asclepius.

BOOK IV. Adeimantus said: “Imagine someone arguing, Socrates, that you make your citizens unhappy, and they choose it themselves; they’re supposed to be the bosses of the city, but instead of owning land, houses, or money, they live like soldiers for hire and are always on guard.” I replied, “You can also add that they don’t get paid money, only food, and can’t afford trips or girlfriends.” “So, what do you say to that?” “I say our guardians might or might not be the happiest people—I wouldn’t be surprised if they are—but that’s not the main goal of our city’s setup. It’s made to help the whole city, not just one group. If I blamed a sculptor for painting the eye black instead of purple, he’d say the eye has to look like an eye and that I should look at the whole statue.”

“I can picture a silly paradise where everyone eats and drinks well, wears fancy clothes, potters relax on couches with their wheels nearby so they can work a bit when they want, and shoemakers and others lose their special roles. A city might survive without shoemakers, but if the guardians turn into lazy friends, the city is doomed. Remember, we’re not talking about farmers having holidays, but a city where everyone is expected to do their own job. Happiness isn’t about one group, but the whole city.”

“I have another point: it’s best if workers have enough money to buy tools but not enough to stop working. Won’t the same be true for our citizens? If they’re poor, they’ll be mean; if they’re rich, they’ll be lazy and spoiled; and either way, unhappy.” “But how will our poor city fight a rich enemy?” “It might be hard to fight one, but not two enemies. First, trained warriors will fight rich citizens. Isn’t one athlete easy for two strong opponents? Also, before fighting, we could send messengers to one of the two rich cities and say, ‘We have no money, will you help us and share the loot?’ Who would fight skinny, tough dogs if they could team up to take from fat sheep?”

“But what if many cities join together? Won’t we be in danger?” “I find it funny that you call any city a ‘state’ except our own.”
