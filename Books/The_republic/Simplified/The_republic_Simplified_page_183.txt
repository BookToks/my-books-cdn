Going to war against one group and making friends with another.

But when a person is healthy, my dear Polemarchus, do they need a doctor?

No.

And if someone is not on a ship, do they need a pilot?

No.

So, in peaceful times, is justice useless?

I don’t think so at all.

You think justice can be helpful both in peace and in war?

Yes.

Like farming to get corn?

Yes.

Or like shoemaking to get shoes – is that what you mean?

Yes.

And what kind of use or power does justice have in peaceful times?

Justice is useful in contracts, Socrates.

And by contracts, you mean partnerships?

Exactly.

But is a just person or a skilled player a better partner in a game of checkers?

The skilled player.

And when building with bricks and stones, is the just person a better partner than the builder?

No, it’s the opposite.

Then in what kind of partnership is the just person a better partner than a harp player, since the harp player is a better partner at playing the harp?

In a money partnership.

Yes, Polemarchus, but not in how to use money; you wouldn’t want a just person to advise you on buying or selling a horse. Someone who knows about horses would be better, right?
