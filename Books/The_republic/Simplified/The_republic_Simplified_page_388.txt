But it’s really hard to find a good teacher, and even if you did, the students today are so full of themselves that they wouldn’t listen to him. But things would be different if the whole country took charge of these studies and treated them with respect. Then students would want to learn, people would search seriously, and new discoveries would happen. Right now, even though the world ignores these studies and they’re not fully developed, and even though no one really knows what they’re good for, these studies still attract people naturally. And if the country helped, they might become important someday.

Yes, he said, there is something really interesting about them. But I don’t really get why you changed the order. First, you started with geometry of flat surfaces?

Yes, I said.

Then you put astronomy next, and after that you went backward?

Yes, and I rushed you. The silly way solid geometry is taught, which should come next, made me skip it and go straight to astronomy and the study of solid objects moving.

True, he said.

So, if we assume the missing science would exist if the country supported it, let’s move on to astronomy, which will be fourth.

That’s the right order, he said. Now, Socrates, since you criticized how I praised astronomy before, I’ll praise it in your style. Everyone, I think, can see that astronomy makes the soul look up and leads us from this world to another.

Everyone but me, I said; maybe it’s clear to others, but not to me.

Then what would you say?

I’d say that people who treat astronomy like philosophy seem to make us look down, not up.

What do you mean? he asked.

I said, you have a very noble idea about knowing things above us. And I bet if someone looked up at a fancy ceiling, you’d think their mind was really understanding it, not just their eyes. You’re probably right, and maybe I’m just simple. But I think only knowledge about being and things we can’t see can make the soul look up. Whether a person stares at the sky or looks down at the ground trying to learn about something they can sense, I don’t think they actually learn. That kind of learning isn’t real science. Their soul is looking down, not up, no matter if they’re in water or on land, swimming or lying on their back.
