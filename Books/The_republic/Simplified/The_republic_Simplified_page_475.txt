True, I said; if the natural badness or evil inside the soul can’t kill or destroy her, then hardly anything meant to destroy something else can destroy a soul or anything else except what it was meant to destroy.

Yes, that can hardly happen.

But the soul, which can’t be destroyed by any evil, whether inside or outside, must live forever, and if it lives forever, it must be immortal?

Certainly.

That is the conclusion, I said; and if this is true, then souls must always stay the same, because if none are destroyed, their number won’t get smaller.

Neither will they increase, because any increase in immortal things must come from something mortal, and if that happened, everything would end up immortal.

Very true.

But we can’t believe this—reason won’t let us—just like we can’t believe the soul, in its true nature, is full of variety, differences, and things that don’t match.

What do you mean? he said.

The soul, I said, being immortal as we have proven, must be the purest kind of being and can’t be made of many different parts.

Certainly not.

Her immortality is shown by the earlier argument, and there are many other proofs; but to really see her as she is, not as we see her now, hurt by being mixed with the body and all kinds of problems, you must look at her with reason, in her original pure state.

Then her beauty will be clear, and justice and injustice and all the things we talked about will show themselves more clearly.

So far, we have told the truth about her as she looks now, but we must also remember that we have only seen her in a state like that of the sea-god Glaucus, whose real form is hard to see because his natural parts are broken, crushed, and hurt by the waves in many ways, and seaweed, shells, and stones have grown over him, so he looks more like a monster than like himself.

And the soul we see now is in a similar state, damaged by many troubles.

But not there, Glaucon, not there must we look.
