When Simonides said that paying back a debt is justice, he didn’t mean every situation, right?

Definitely not. He believed that a friend should always do good to a friend and never harm them.

So, you’re saying that giving back a deposit of gold that would hurt the person getting it, if they are friends, isn’t really paying a debt—that’s what you think he meant?

Yes.

Do we also have to give what we owe to our enemies?

Yes, he said we do. An enemy owes an enemy what is proper to them—which means harm.

So, Simonides, like a poet, spoke in a tricky way about justice. He actually meant that justice is giving each person what is right for them, and he called this a debt.

That must be what he meant, yes.

By the way, if we asked him what medicine gives and to whom, what do you think he would say?

He would definitely say that medicine gives drugs, food, and drink to human bodies.

And what about cooking? What does it give and to what?

It gives flavor to food.

So what does justice give, and to whom?

If we follow the examples we just talked about, then justice is the art of giving good things to friends and harm to enemies.

That’s what he meant?

I think so.

Who is best at doing good for friends and harm to enemies when someone is sick?

The doctor.

Or when they are sailing through dangerous seas?

The captain.

And in what kinds of actions, or for what purpose, is a just person best able to harm an enemy and help a friend?
