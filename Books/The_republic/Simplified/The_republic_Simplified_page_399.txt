Yes, he said, there is nothing they like better.

And when they have won many battles and lost many times, they quickly stop believing what they believed before. Because of this, not only they but philosophy itself often gets a bad reputation with most people.

That's true, he said.

But when a person gets older, they don’t act so crazy anymore. They try to be like someone who is looking for the truth, not someone who argues just for fun. Their calm and steady character actually makes their search for truth more respected.

Very true, he said.

Didn't we say before that students of philosophy should be orderly and steady, not just anyone who wants to join or interrupts?

Very true.

Suppose studying philosophy takes the place of exercise and is done seriously and only for twice as many years as were spent doing physical exercise – would that be enough?

Would you say six or four years? he asked.

Say five years, I replied; after that, they must go back into the real world and take on jobs like any other young person. This way, they will get life experience and a chance to see if they can stand strong when tempted or if they will give up.

And how long does this part of their life last?

Fifteen years, I answered; when they reach fifty years old, those who are still alive and have done well in every part of life and knowledge should reach their final stage. Now, they should focus their minds on the universal truth that lights up everything and see the highest good. This is the example they should follow to organize the State and their own lives, making philosophy their main goal.

But when it’s their turn, they should also work in politics and lead for the good of the public – not as a big heroic act, but simply because it’s their duty. When they have raised others like themselves in each new generation and left them to lead, they will then go to the Islands of the Blessed and live there. The city will honor them with public memorials, sacrifices, and praise, if the Pythian oracle agrees, as demigods; if not, they will still be honored and seen as blessed and divine.
