That’s really unusual, he said.

Then there are all the regular good things in life—like beauty, money, strength, status, and important connections in the government—you know, those kinds of things. These can also be harmful and distracting.

I get it, but I want to understand better what you mean about them.

Understand the whole truth properly, I said, and then my earlier points won’t seem strange to you.

How do I do that? he asked.

Well, I said, we know that all seeds or germs, whether from plants or animals, need the right food, climate, or soil to grow. If they don’t get that, the stronger they are, the more they suffer. Bad things hurt good things more than they hurt bad things.

That’s true.

It makes sense to think that the best natures get hurt more when placed in the wrong environment because the difference is bigger.

Definitely.

And can’t we say, Adeimantus, that the smartest people, if they get a bad education, can become really bad? Big crimes and pure evil often come from people with great natural ability ruined by their education, while weaker people don’t usually do great good or great evil.

I think you’re right there.

Our philosopher is like a plant that, if it gets the right care, will grow into all kinds of good virtues. But if it’s planted in bad soil, it becomes the worst kind of weed—unless some divine power protects it. Do you really believe, like many say, that Sophists or private teachers corrupt our youth that much? Isn’t it really the public that acts like the biggest Sophists? Don’t they fail to educate both young and old, men and women, and shape them all to their own liking?

When does that happen? he asked.

When people gather together—at big meetings, courts, theaters, camps, or any popular place—and there’s a lot of noise. They praise and blame things in an exaggerated way, shouting and clapping, and the echoes make the sound even louder. At times like that, won’t a young person’s heart, as they say, jump inside him?
