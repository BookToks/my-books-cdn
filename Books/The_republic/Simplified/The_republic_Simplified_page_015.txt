But in the sixth book, Plato’s dislike for the Sophists cools down; he admits they represent the world rather than ruin it. He also becomes more sure of his ideas and starts building his own thoughts, going beyond what the real Socrates talked about in politics or philosophy. In one part, Plato suggests that Socrates, who spent his whole life thinking about philosophy, should start sharing his own opinions instead of just repeating what others said.

There’s no proof that Socrates taught about the idea of good or a perfect state, though he did think about the nature of the universe and why things happen (like Xenophon’s Memorabilia and Phaedo show). A deep thinker like him, after teaching for 30 or 40 years, probably talked about family relationships too, and there is some proof of this in the Memorabilia.

The Socratic method, where questions are asked to learn, is still used; every conclusion is either said by the person answering or shown as something both Socrates and the person figured out together. But anyone can see this is just a changed form, which starts to feel forced as the work goes on. The method of asking questions turns into a way to teach, where the same idea is looked at from different sides with the help of the people talking with Socrates. Glaucon explains this well when he says he’s not good at discovering things but can understand what’s shown and maybe answer questions better than others.

We can’t be sure that Socrates himself believed in the soul living forever, because his student Glaucon in the Republic doesn’t know about it (see Apology). There’s also no reason to think Socrates used myths or stories about another world to teach, or that he would have banned poetry or condemned Greek myths. He kept his favorite oath and mentioned his “daemonium” or inner voice, which he said was something only he experienced.

A real part of Socrates’ teaching, which shows up more in the Republic than other Plato writings, is using examples and pictures. For example, Socrates says, “Let’s test this idea with common examples.” Adeimantus jokes in the sixth book, “You don’t usually talk in images.” This way of using examples, which started with Socrates, is made bigger by Plato into stories or parables that show an idea in a clear way. For example, the cave story in Book VII sums up ideas about knowledge from Book VI. The “composite animal” in Book IX is a story about parts of the soul.

The noble captain, the ship, and the true pilot in Book VI are symbols of how the people relate to the philosophers in the State.

Other images, like the dog, the marriage of the portionless maiden, or the drones and wasps in Books VIII and IX, also connect long parts of the text or remind us of earlier talks.
