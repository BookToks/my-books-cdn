So, I said, we can say that three out of the four good qualities of a state have been found. The last one, which makes a state truly good, must be justice—if only we knew what justice really was.

The conclusion is clear.

Now is the time, Glaucon, for us to act like hunters. We should surround the area and watch carefully so that justice doesn’t sneak away and disappear. Without a doubt, she is somewhere in this land. So watch closely and try to find her, and if you see her first, tell me.

I wish I could! But you should think of me as someone who just has enough sight to see what you show me—that’s about all I’m good for.

Say a prayer with me and let’s follow.

I will, but you have to show me the way.

There is no clear path, I said, and the forest is dark and confusing, but we still have to keep going.

Let’s keep going.

Look, I see something! Hey! I think I found a trail, and I believe the target won’t get away.

Good news, he said.

Honestly, I said, we’re pretty dumb guys.

Why do you say that?

Because, my friend, at the start of our search, justice was right in front of us, but we never saw her. Nothing could be more ridiculous. It’s like people who go looking for something they are already holding—we were looking not at what we had, but at something far away. That’s probably why we missed her.

What do you mean?

I mean that for a long time we have been talking about justice but didn’t recognize her.

I’m getting tired of your long introduction.

Well then, tell me if I’m right or not: You remember the main idea we always said about how a state should work, that each person should do only the job they are naturally best at? Justice is this idea or part of it.

Yes, we often said that one person should do only one thing.
