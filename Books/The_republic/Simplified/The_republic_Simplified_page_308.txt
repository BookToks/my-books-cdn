You can’t.

If women are going to have the same jobs as men, should they get the same training and education?

Yes.

Men were taught music and gym class.

Right.

So women should also learn music, gym, and even war skills, and practice them like men?

That’s what it sounds like.

I think some of our ideas might seem strange or silly when people hear them.

Probably.

The weirdest thing will be seeing women naked in the gym, working out with men, especially when they’re not young anymore. It won’t look pretty, just like old men with wrinkles still going to the gym.

True, that would seem really strange now.

But since we’re being honest, we shouldn’t be afraid of people making fun of women learning music, gym, or even wearing armor and riding horses!

Exactly.

Still, we have to face the hard parts of the law and ask these people to be serious for once. Not long ago, Greeks thought seeing a naked man was funny and wrong, just like many others still do. When the Cretans and Spartans first started the practice, people probably made fun of it too.

No doubt.

But after people saw that being naked was better than being covered up, and the funny feeling went away, it became clear that anyone making fun of this was just foolish. People learned to judge beauty by what was good and right, not by old silly ideas.
