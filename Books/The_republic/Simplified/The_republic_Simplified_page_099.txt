In ancient Greece, there wasn’t a fixed order for how governments changed. The history was always changing, like the tides in the Euripus Strait. But in the very early times, many places moved from a monarchy (a king) to rule by a few rich people (aristocracy). 

At first, it looks like tyranny (rule by one bad ruler) should come after democracy, but in early Greek history, tyranny actually came before democracy. For example, the rule of Peisistratus and his sons in Athens happened between important reforms by Solon and Cleisthenes. Many Greek cities, like Athens, Argos, Corinth, and Sicyon, went through a period of tyranny before becoming either oligarchies (rule by a few) or democracies. Sparta was the only city that didn’t follow this pattern. But remember, Plato was mostly talking about the governments in Sicily, which switched between democracy and tyranny, not the older history of Athens or Corinth.

The picture of the tyrant (the bad ruler) that Greeks liked to imagine, like Phalaris and Dionysius, was partly made up. It was like stories about saints or heroes, where actions were exaggerated or passed on to others to fill in the story. Greeks believed all kinds of terrible things about tyrants. They saw the tyrant as the opposite of law and order. Killing a tyrant was seen as heroic. Any crime, no matter how awful, was probably blamed on the tyrant. Plato was just repeating what most Greeks thought, but he made it even more dramatic with his talent. There’s no need to think he actually met tyrants like Dionysius or worked with them to fix Sicily, as some letters claim. How he talks about them makes it seem like he probably never met them.

Plato also makes fun of democracy in an extreme and serious way. He sees democracy as a place where everyone just does whatever they want, thinking it’s right. He doesn’t believe in the idea of people coming together with a shared goal, like fighting off the Persians, which was a big part of democracy in the stories of Herodotus and Thucydides. Plato doesn’t really like freedom, but he dislikes tyranny even more. He criticizes tyrants as the worst kind of people—both evil and weak. Tyrants live in fear and loneliness, leading a miserable life without any good qualities. This is very different from the idea some others had, where injustice could be powerful and successful. It’s also the opposite of a king who rules to help his people.
