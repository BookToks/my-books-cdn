Big decisions should be made by lawmakers or special advisors, while smaller issues can be handled by the people themselves. Plato knows that letting people have some freedom is an important part of running a government. Problems in a country are like the heads of a hydra monster—they grow back even stronger if you just cut them off. The real solution isn’t just to get rid of problems, but to stop them from happening in the first place. The best way to do this is through education, and education will take care of everything else.

Today, many people believe that the most important political action is to improve education for the whole country. Especially now, more than ever, we see how important it is to make laws simple and easy to understand.

After learning music and physical training, people start their active public life. But education doesn’t stop there; it begins again in a new way. Between the Fourth and Seventh Books, we talked about what knowledge really means. Plato says true knowledge is about big ideas, not just specific things or people. It’s not about enjoying poetry, but about understanding philosophy. The main goal of education is to get used to thinking about these big ideas. This happens by studying math, because math helps us see how things relate and wakes up our thinking.

In Plato’s time, math was only a small part of what we know today, but back then it was a much bigger part of knowledge. Math was the only way people had to organize their thoughts and make sense of confusing details. The way math trains the mind is very different from poetry or imagination. That’s why Plato, who always looks for big ideas and wants to avoid being tricked by our senses, puts so much emphasis on math in education. Math seemed to have endless uses because people didn’t yet understand its limits. Plato starts to explore these limits himself. He doesn’t realize that numbers and shapes come from what we see and feel, but he knows geometry uses forms from the real world. He tries to find the ultimate source of math ideas in the idea of “good,” though he doesn’t explain how well. Compared to Aristotle, Plato’s ideas about how numbers relate to bigger ideas aren’t very clear. But even if Plato doesn’t see math’s limits, he goes beyond them. He thinks ideas about numbers are less important than a higher kind of knowledge. To him, a dialectician (someone who argues and reasons) is much smarter than a mathematician, just like a mathematician is smarter than an ordinary person.
