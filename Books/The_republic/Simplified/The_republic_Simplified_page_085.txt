Their first step will be to send everyone over ten years old out to the countryside and then deal with the people who remain.

At the start of the sixth book, Plato used a story to explain how philosophers relate to the world. Like in other parts, he followed the way he thought education should go, starting with concrete ideas and moving to abstract ones. At the beginning of Book Seven, he described a cave with an opening that looks toward a fire and up to the real light. This story shows the different kinds of knowledge, making a difficult idea easier to understand. It also hints at the process of thinking deeply, shown by the path from darkness into light.

The shadows, images, reflections of the sun and stars in water, and the stars and sun themselves each represent different levels of understanding. The shadows stand for imagination and poetry, the reflections represent what we can sense around us, the stars and sun are like math and abstract ideas based on sense, and finally, the real sun stands for the highest ideas that give meaning and power. True deep thinking starts by looking at real things, not just their reflections, and ends with understanding the sun or the idea of good, which gives light, warmth, and growth.

Education matches these levels too. First, children learn through stories and the laws and customs of their society. Then, they train their bodies to be strong like warriors and good helpers for the mind. Later in life, they study math and finally philosophy in general.

Plato had two big goals in his philosophy: first, to understand abstract ideas, and second, to connect them. For him, true education helps people move from just becoming something to truly being it and seeing everything as a whole. He wanted the mind to see the universal truth in all things, so that the specific details we sense would fade away, leaving only the universal ideas. Then he tried to link these universal ideas together, but he didn’t realize that this connection mostly comes from how we use language. He didn’t see that abstract ideas, as Hegel said, are just “mere abstractions” – useful when organizing facts, but not adding real knowledge if thought about alone or tied to an imaginary idea of good. Still, practicing thinking about abstract ideas without facts has helped develop minds and played a big role in human education. Plato knew this and saw that studying numbers and relationships can speed up this skill. Anything with opposites or proportions makes us think more. Just sensing things doesn’t make us think deeply, but when we compare and notice differences, that’s when philosophy starts.
