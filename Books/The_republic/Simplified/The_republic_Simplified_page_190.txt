Listen, he said, I’m telling you that justice is just what benefits the stronger people. So why don’t you agree with me? But of course, you won’t.

Let me understand you first, I replied. You say justice is what’s good for the stronger people. What do you mean by that, Thrasymachus? You can’t mean that because Polydamas, who is really strong, likes to eat beef to stay strong, it’s also good and fair for us, who are weaker, to eat beef too, right?

That’s a terrible way to understand it, Socrates; you’re twisting my words in the worst way.

Not at all, I said. I’m just trying to get what you mean, and I wish you’d explain it more clearly.

Well, he said, haven’t you heard that there are different kinds of governments? There are tyrannies, democracies, and aristocracies.

Yes, I know that.

And the government is the one in charge in every country?

Of course.

And different governments make laws that match their own interests, like laws that help tyrants, democrats, or aristocrats; these laws are the justice they give to the people. If someone breaks these laws, they are punished as lawbreakers and called unjust. That’s what I mean when I say that in every country, justice is just what benefits the government in power. Since the government has power, the only reasonable conclusion is that justice is always what’s good for the stronger people.

Now I get what you mean, I said. Whether you’re right or not, I want to find out. But I have to point out that when you defined justice, you used the word “interest,” which you told me not to use. It is true that you added “of the stronger” to it.

It’s a small addition, he said.

Whether it’s small or big doesn’t matter; we first need to figure out if what you’re saying is true. We both agree that justice is some kind of interest, but you say it’s the interest of the stronger people. I’m not sure about this part, so I need to think more about it.
