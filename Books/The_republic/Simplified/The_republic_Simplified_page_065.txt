Someone who joins a mutiny is called a good pilot or something like that, but they don’t understand that a real pilot has to watch the winds and stars and be in control, whether they like it or not. The mutineers would call that person a fool, a prater, or a star-gazer. This story is my example. I want you to explain it to those people who ask why philosophers have such a bad reputation and to tell them it’s not the philosopher’s fault, but the fault of those who don’t use him properly.

A philosopher shouldn’t beg people to be in charge of them. The wise person shouldn’t chase after rich people, like the saying goes. Instead, everyone—rich or poor—should come to the philosopher when they need help. The pilot is like the philosopher, called a star-gazer in the story, and the rebellious sailors are like the politicians who make him useless. But these politicians aren’t the worst enemies of philosophy. The worst enemies are the philosophers themselves when they get corrupted by the world.

Remember what we said about the philosopher? He loves truth and hates lies. He can’t rest just looking at many different things but is drawn by his nature to think about what is absolute and real. All the good qualities and truth live in his soul. But if we look at real life, most people described this way, except for a small useless group, are actually cheats.

The important thing to think about is where this corruption comes from in human nature.

Everyone agrees that the philosopher, as we described, is a rare person. But many things can destroy these rare people! Good things can cause problems too—like health, wealth, strength, rank, and even good qualities can be bad in the wrong situation.

Just like in nature, the strongest seeds need good air and soil to grow well, the best characters can become the worst if they end up in a bad place. Weak people usually don’t do much good or harm; they don’t become great heroes or villains. The philosopher is the same: he can be the best or the worst of all men.

Some say Sophists are the ones who corrupt young people. But isn’t public opinion the real Sophist? Public opinion is everywhere—in people, meetings, courts, armies, and even in the cheers and noises of the theater. Won’t a young person’s heart be moved by all these loud, confusing sounds? Can any education stop them from being swept away by this flood? And if they don’t give in to public opinion, they might face exile or death. What can any rival Sophist or anyone else do against such a one-sided fight? There might be some superhuman characters who can handle it—maybe only God can save a person, not their own strength.

Also, think about this: a hired Sophist only repeats the opinions of the world. He is like a keeper of a monster who knows how to flatter or arrange it and understands its silent grunts.
