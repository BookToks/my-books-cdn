He was one of those who had come down from heaven, and in his past life had lived in a well-organized city, but he only followed habits, not deep thinking. Like many others, he made a bad choice because he didn’t have real experience with life. People who came from earth and had seen problems weren’t in such a rush to decide. But if someone had studied philosophy while alive, and had been somewhat lucky, they might not only be happy here but also have an easy and peaceful journey between this world and the next.

It was really interesting to watch the choices being made—sometimes sad, sometimes funny, and sometimes amazing. Most souls just wanted to avoid the problems they had in their last life. He saw the soul of Orpheus turning into a swan because he didn’t want to be born as a human woman. Thamyras changed into a nightingale; musical birds like the swan chose to become men. The twentieth soul, which was Ajax’s, wanted to live as a lion instead of a man because of the unfair way he had been judged. Agamemnon, who hated human nature, became an eagle. In the middle, Atalanta’s soul picked the life of an athlete, and nearby, Epeus chose to be a worker. Near the end, Thersites changed into a monkey. Last of all came Odysseus, who picked the life of a private man—an overlooked and ignored one—and when he found it, he was happy and said he would have chosen the same even if he had come first. People were also seen turning into animals, and wild and tame animals changing into each other.

After all the souls had made their choices, they went to Lachesis, who sent their guardian spirits to help them live out their lives. First, he took them to Clotho, who spun their life threads. Then they were carried to Atropos, who cut the threads so their fate couldn’t be changed. Without looking back, they passed under the throne of Necessity. When all had passed, they moved under a hot sun to the plain of Forgetfulness and rested in the evening by the river Unmindful, whose water no one could hold in a container. All had to drink some of this water—some drank too much and forgot everything. Even Er was stopped from drinking. After resting, in the middle of the night, there were storms and earthquakes, and suddenly all the souls shot off in different directions like stars to be born again. Er only remembered waking up in the morning lying on a funeral pyre.

So, Glaucon, this story has been saved and will save us too if we believe the soul lives forever and stick to the path of Justice and Knowledge. Then we will cross the river of Forgetfulness without guilt, be loved by ourselves and the gods, and earn a crown of happiness and reward both here and in the long journey ahead.
