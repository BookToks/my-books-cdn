Can a person who loves wisdom also love lying?  

Never.  

So, someone who really loves learning should always want to know the truth from a young age, right?  

Definitely.  

But we know from experience that if someone really wants one thing a lot, they might care less about other things. It’s like a river that gets pulled into a different path.  

True.  

If someone wants to learn about everything, they will enjoy it deeply, and they won’t care much about physical pleasures—if they are a real philosopher, not just pretending.  

That’s for sure.  

This kind of person will be calm and not greedy; the reasons that make other people want to buy and spend won’t affect them.  

Very true.  

There’s another way to tell if someone is truly philosophical.  

What is it?  

They won’t be selfish or stingy. Being stingy is the opposite of having a big, generous mind that wants to understand everything, both spiritual and human.  

That makes a lot of sense.  

So, if someone has a great mind and can see all of time and existence, will they care much about regular human life?  

No, they won’t.  

Can someone like that be afraid of death?  

No way.  

So, people who are scared and selfish can’t really be true philosophers?  

Definitely not.  

Also, can a person who is balanced, not greedy or boastful or scared, ever be unfair or mean to others?
