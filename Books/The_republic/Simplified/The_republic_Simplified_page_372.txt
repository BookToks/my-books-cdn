I get what you mean, he said, not perfectly, because what you’re talking about sounds really huge; but I understand you’re saying that knowledge and being, which dialectic science studies, are clearer than the ideas from the arts, which come only from guesses. These ideas are also understood by the mind, not by the senses. But since they start from guesses and don’t go back to a first principle, the people who think about them don’t seem to use the highest kind of reasoning. However, when a first principle is added, those ideas can be understood by the highest reason. And the skill that deals with geometry and similar subjects, I think you’d call understanding, not reason. It’s kind of in the middle between opinion and reason.

You’ve got my meaning exactly, I said. Now, matching these four groups, let’s say there are four parts in the soul — reason fits the highest part, understanding fits the second, faith or belief fits the third, and seeing shadows fits the last part. Let’s also say there’s a ladder of these parts, and that the clearer each part is, the truer its ideas are.

I understand, he replied, and I agree with how you set it up.

And now, I said, let me show you with a picture how much our nature is either enlightened or not enlightened — look!
