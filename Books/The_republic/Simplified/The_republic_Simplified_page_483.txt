The memory of his past hard work made him want to achieve more, so he spent a long time looking for the life of a private person who had no worries. It was hard to find because no one cared about it. When he finally found it, he said he would have chosen the same life if he had gone first instead of last, and he was happy to have it. Not only did people turn into animals, but some animals, both tame and wild, changed into humans too—good animals became kind people, and bad animals became wild and savage, in all kinds of mixes.

All the souls had now picked their lives. They went one by one to Lachesis, who sent with each soul the spirit they had chosen to protect their life and make sure their choice happened. This spirit took the souls first to Clotho, who spun the thread of their fate, making their destiny real. Then, the spirit took them to Atropos, who cut the threads so their fate couldn’t be changed. Without looking back, they passed under the throne of Necessity. After that, they walked through a hot, empty plain with no trees or plants. In the evening, they camped by the river of Unmindfulness. No boat could hold its water, and all the souls had to drink some of it. Those without wisdom drank too much and forgot everything they had known. After resting, around midnight, there was a thunderstorm and earthquake, and suddenly they were pushed back up to be born again, like shooting stars. He couldn’t drink the water himself. How he came back to his body, he couldn’t say. But in the morning, he woke up suddenly and found himself lying on the funeral pyre.

So, Glaucon, this story has been saved and won’t be lost. It will save us if we listen carefully. We will safely cross the river of Forgetfulness, and our souls won’t be harmed. That’s why I advise us to always follow the right path, justice, and goodness because the soul never dies and can handle all kinds of good and bad things. This way, we will be loved by each other and by the gods, both while we live here and later, like winners in a game who go around collecting prizes. It will be good for us in this life and in the long journey of a thousand years we’ve been talking about.
