But who can go against the strongest feelings people have, especially when these feelings are supported by tradition and religion? Besides education, we seem to need new ideas about what is right and wrong in these cases. There might already be some opinions about this, but they have never really changed how most people think about morals.

We often forget about what is most useful exactly when we need it the most in our lives. The ways we can help with this problem are mostly indirect. In a few generations, things like education, moving to new places, and better farming and factories might fix it. Doctors don’t like to dig too deep into wounds because it’s risky—they just treat the surface. When we see a whole family slowly die from a disease passed down through generations, do we ever think back to the day their parents got married, surrounded by happy friends? Thinking about this is not about choosing feelings over facts, but the other way around. We want to use reason to stop us from being overly emotional and focus on common sense.

Dr. Combe, who lived not long ago, is said to have avoided marriage because he knew he could pass on a deadly disease.

A very smart friend of mine used to wear a black ribbon on his wrist to remind himself not to follow his feelings because he could become mentally ill. He never married and died in a mental hospital. These two stories show that a few people have done what everyone should do in similar situations if they thought about the suffering they might cause. If we could stop these kinds of marriages without hurting anyone’s feelings or breaking rules, we definitely should. Over time, people would naturally feel it’s wrong, just like how most societies have always stopped close relatives from marrying.

People would be happier if some things allowed now had been banned from the start; if religion had stopped harmful practices; if health rules had been treated like sacred laws long ago. But since we live so far along in history, we can’t just add new religious rules to forbid these things right away.
