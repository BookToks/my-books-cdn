We don’t decide on religion ourselves; we leave that to Apollo, the god of Delphi. We trust only our own ancient gods who are believed to be at the center of the earth when it comes to something as important as religion.

No foreign god will be more powerful in our lands.

As Socrates would say, let’s think about what we’ve talked about so far. Up to now, we haven’t discussed the happiness of the people, only the well-being of the State. The people might be happy, but our main goal in creating the State wasn’t to make them happy. They were meant to be protectors, not people who just relax and have fun. This brings up a famous question in both old and modern philosophy about duty and happiness, or what is right versus what is useful.

Duty comes before happiness in our moral beliefs. The idea of usefulness (or utility) helps correct mistakes and reminds us not to ignore ethics. It’s true that what is right and what is useful often go together, and trying to make people happy is one of the noblest reasons to act. But usefulness is not the true foundation of morality. Moral and religious ideas usually don’t come from usefulness.

The greatest happiness for everyone, we believe, comes from the divine control of the universe. The greatest happiness for a person is found in living a good and virtuous life. But we seem more sure that there are laws about what is right than we are about a divine plan that saves all people. We often connect the two ideas. Also, the greatest happiness for one person might be very different from what most people think of as happiness. It could even be found in suffering or choosing to die for a cause.

The word “happiness” can mean many things. It can mean pleasure or an ideal life, happiness based on feelings or on real achievements, happiness in this world or the next, for ourselves or for everyone. The founder of Utilitarianism included both selfish and selfless reasons for acting under the idea of happiness, even though we usually think of these as different.

“Happiness” isn’t as clear or respected as “truth” and “right.” It doesn’t connect as much with our higher nature and hasn’t become a deep part of human conscience. People often link it too much with comfort and convenience, and too little with the deeper “goods of the soul” that we want just because they are good. In big challenges or heroic moments, people hardly think about happiness. For these reasons, the idea of “greatest happiness” isn’t the true base of ethics. But even though it’s not the first rule, it is the second, and it’s often easier to use. Most human actions aren’t purely right or wrong except in how they affect the happiness of people.

This same question comes up in politics, where what is useful or practical seems to have more importance and power.
