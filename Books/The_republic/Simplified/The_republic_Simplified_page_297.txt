Exactly, he replied.

Can a person be thirsty but not want to drink?

Yes, he said, that happens all the time.

So what would you say in that case? Would you not think that something inside the soul wants the person to drink, but something else, stronger, stops him?

I would say so.

And the part that stops him comes from reason, while the part that wants to drink comes from passion and maybe sickness?

Clearly.

Then we can say there are two parts that are different. The part that reasons is the rational part of the soul, and the part that loves, hungers, thirsts, and feels other desires is the irrational or appetitive part, which wants pleasure and satisfaction?

Yes, he said, we can say they are different.

So let’s decide that there are two principles inside the soul.

And what about passion, or spirit? Is it a third part, or similar to one of the two?

I would say it’s like desire.

Well, I said, I remember a story that I believe. The story is about Leontius, the son of Aglaion. One day, coming from the Piraeus, near the north wall outside, he saw some dead bodies at the execution place. He felt both a desire to see them and fear and disgust. For a while, he struggled and covered his eyes, but finally, the desire won. He opened his eyes and ran up to the bodies, saying, “Look, you wretches, take your fill of the sight.”

I have heard that story myself, he said.

The lesson is that sometimes anger fights against desire, as if they are two different things.

Yes, that is the meaning, he said.

And aren’t there many times when a man’s desires are stronger than his reason, and he hates himself for it and gets angry at his own loss of control? In this fight, which is like a battle in a city, his spirit is on the side of reason. But for spirit to join the desires when reason decides not to fight, I believe you have never seen that happen in yourself or anyone else.
