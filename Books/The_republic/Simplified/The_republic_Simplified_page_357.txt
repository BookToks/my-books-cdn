If philosophy ever finds the perfect form in the State, the way philosophy itself is perfect, then we will see that philosophy is truly divine. Everything else, like human nature or laws, is just human-made. Now, I know you’re going to ask, “What kind of State is that?” But no, you’re wrong, because I was actually going to ask something else—whether this perfect State is the one we create, or some other kind?

Yes, I answered, it’s mostly ours. But you might remember I said before that the State will always need a living leader who understands the constitution, just like you did when you made the laws.

That’s true, he said.

Yes, but that’s not a good enough answer; you scared us with your objections, which showed this discussion would be hard. What’s left to figure out is the opposite of easy.

What’s left?

The question is how studying philosophy can be done without ruining the State. Big efforts always come with risks; people say, “Good things are hard.”

Still, he said, let’s clear this up, and then we’ll finish the discussion.

I said, nothing will stop me except maybe my lack of ability. You can see how eager I am. Notice how boldly and clearly I say that States should follow philosophy—not the way they do now, but in a different way.

How?

Right now, I said, philosophy students are very young. They start when they’re just out of childhood and only study philosophy in their free time, after work and chores. Even those who seem most interested in philosophy quit when they realize how hard it is, especially the part about reasoning and argument. Later in life, if someone invites them, they might go to a lecture, and they make a big deal about it, but they don’t see philosophy as their real job. Finally, when they get old, most of them lose interest completely, like Heraclitus’ sun that goes out every night and lights up again every morning. But what should their real path be?
