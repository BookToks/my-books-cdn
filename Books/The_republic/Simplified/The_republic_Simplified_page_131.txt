Sparta kept many old traditions, especially the strict way their leaders controlled music and poetry. Just like in Plato’s Republic, new kinds of poets were not allowed. Only hymns to the gods, the kind of music allowed in the perfect State, were permitted in Sparta. Even though Spartans weren’t very poetic, they still loved poetry. They were moved by the war songs of Tyrtaeus and would gather to listen to Hippias recite Homer. In this, they were more like the citizens of a timocracy than those of the perfect State.

The council of elders in Sparta, called the gerousia, was similar to Plato’s idea. They had the freedom to decide on small details, which fits what we know about them. Also, Sparta had strict military rules, like not messing with the dead or offering weapons at temples. They were careful in chasing enemies, cared a lot about their citizens’ health, and used war mainly for defense, not attack. These ideas probably came from how Sparta lived.

The perfect State idea goes back to the Spartan type when it started to decline, and the character of the individual timocrat was like a Spartan citizen. Many Athenians, even ordinary ones, admired Sparta—not just Plato and Xenophon. They thought Sparta had something missing in their own democracy. What attracted them was not Sparta’s laws but its spirit of order and loyalty. Some Athenians even copied Spartan clothes and habits. Plato’s time people called them “the ones with their ears bruised,” similar to the Roundheads in England.

Loving a faraway place or church, wishing for a simple life that never really existed, or hoping for a perfect past or future—these are feelings people often have, even today. These feelings are part of what you find in Plato’s Republic.

But Plato’s Republic also has things very different from Sparta, like teaching literature and philosophy, and caring about beauty and a joyful life. Plato wanted his citizens to experience both Athenian freedom and Spartan discipline. Even though he admired Sparta, Plato was truly Athenian and had a deep Greek feeling. He wanted to make war among Greeks more peaceful and believed the god of Delphi was the main spiritual guide for all Greece. The state should be harmonious inside and look beautiful outside.

However, Plato hadn’t yet realized the truth he later shared in his Laws: that he was better at making laws to unite people’s minds than at training them for war.
