Definitely not, he said.

He will think about the city inside himself and make sure nothing gets messy, whether from having too much or too little. Based on this, he will manage his stuff and money according to what he has.

That’s true.

Also, for the same reason, he will happily accept and enjoy honors that help him become a better person. But he will avoid any honors, whether private or public, that might mess up his life.

Then, if that’s his goal, he won’t be a politician.

He definitely will! In the city inside him, he certainly will be, though maybe not in the country where he was born, unless he has a special calling.

I get it; you mean he will be a leader in the city we imagine and created in our minds, which isn’t real anywhere on Earth?

I think there is a perfect example of it in heaven. If someone wants to see it, they can use it as a guide to organize their own life. But whether a city like that ever really exists doesn’t matter, because he will live like that city, not like any other.

I think so, he said.
