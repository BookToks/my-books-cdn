Tell me, if you see the bushes move first. ’No, I want you to lead.’ Well then, say a prayer and follow. The path is dark and hard, but we have to keep going. I start to see a trail. ’Good news.’ Why, Glaucon, our bad sense of smell is pretty funny! While we’re staring far ahead, justice is right under our feet. We are like people looking for something they already have in their hands. Have you forgotten our old rule about everyone doing their own job, which we talked about when we started the State – wasn’t that what justice was? Is there any other virtue that can compare to wisdom, self-control, and courage when it comes to being a good citizen?  

Because having everyone do their own job is the main goal of government; and the main goal of trade is that every person should do their own work. It’s not a big deal if a carpenter tries to be a shoemaker, or a shoemaker tries to be a carpenter; but big problems happen when the shoemaker stops making shoes and tries to be a guardian or lawmaker, or when one person is a trainer, warrior, and lawmaker all at once. That problem is injustice – when people do jobs that aren’t theirs. I’m not saying we have all the answers yet. The idea we think is right for states still needs to be tested with individuals. After looking at the big picture, we will now look at the small details. From both, we might find a bright idea...

Socrates started to figure out what justice really is by looking at what’s left behind. Each of the first three virtues matches one of the three parts of the soul and one of the three groups in the State, but the third virtue, self-control, is more like a balance between them than the first two. If there’s a fourth virtue, it can only be found in how the three parts of the soul or groups in the State relate to each other. It’s simple and obvious, so people haven’t really noticed it. Some modern thinkers might say that ideas can’t be separated like chemicals, but flow into each other and are just different names for the same thing, and that seems to be true here. The definition of justice here sounds like one of the definitions of self-control Socrates gave before, but that was only temporary and later rejected.

So, justice doesn’t stay the same if the other virtues disappear. Justice and self-control in the Republic are hard to tell apart.

Self-control seems to be just one part of virtue, one of three, while justice is a virtue for the whole soul. But self-control is also described as a kind of harmony, which makes it similar to justice.

Justice seems different from self-control in how much it is, not in what it is; self-control is the harmony of things that don’t get along, while justice is the perfect order where everyone does their own job, the right person in the right place, with all citizens working together. Justice is also a more abstract idea than the other virtues, and from Plato’s point of view, it’s the foundation for them all, the one they depend on and come before in importance.
