Yes, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus said that it’s fair for people to do what their rulers tell them.

Yes, Cleitophon, but he also said that justice means doing what’s best for the stronger people. He agreed with both ideas, but also said that the stronger can make the weaker do things that aren’t actually good for the stronger. So, justice can sometimes mean harm, just as much as it means helping the stronger.

But, said Cleitophon, he meant by “what’s best for the stronger” what the stronger thought was best. That’s what the weaker had to do, and that’s what he called justice.

Those weren’t exactly his words, replied Polemarchus.

Never mind, I said, if he now says that they are, let’s accept it. Tell me, Thrasymachus, did you mean by justice what the stronger thought was best, whether it really was or not?

Certainly not, he said. Do you think I call someone stronger when they’re actually wrong?

Yes, I said, it seemed like you did, when you admitted rulers can be wrong sometimes.

You argue like someone trying to trap me, Socrates. For example, if a doctor is wrong about a patient, do we say he’s a doctor because he made a mistake? Or if someone messes up math or grammar, are they a mathematician or grammarian while making the mistake? We say they made a mistake, but that’s just a way of speaking. The truth is, a real doctor or expert doesn’t make mistakes while using their skill; if they do, they aren’t really skilled at that moment. No expert or ruler makes mistakes when they’re truly doing their job. Although people say they do, that’s just common talk. To be exact, since you like accuracy, we should say a ruler, as a ruler, doesn’t make mistakes and always commands what’s best for himself. So, as I said before and now again, justice is what’s best for the stronger.

Really, Thrasymachus, do I sound like I’m arguing just to trick you?

Yes, he replied.

And do you think I’m asking these questions to hurt you in the argument?
