But on the other hand, the confusing differences in the Republic might only come from trying to put together different ideas into one whole. The philosopher who wrote it might not have noticed these problems, but we can see them clearly now. 

People who write great things often don’t realize the mistakes or gaps in their own work. These become obvious only to people who come later. In the early days of literature and philosophy, when people were first trying to think and use language, there were more mistakes than now. Today, ideas are clearer and words have more exact meanings. 

Being consistent is something that grows over time. Some of the greatest works of human thought weren’t completely united or perfect. If we judge Plato’s Dialogues by modern standards, some seem to have problems. But this doesn’t mean they were written by different people or at different times. In fact, the Republic seems to have been written all at once because it often refers back to earlier parts of the book.

The second title, “Concerning Justice,” isn’t the one people usually use to talk about the Republic, not even in ancient times by Aristotle. Like other second titles for Plato’s works, it probably came later.

Morgenstern and others have asked if the main point of the Republic is defining justice or building the State. The answer is that both are connected and are really two sides of the same thing. Justice is the order of the State, and the State shows justice in real life. One is like the soul, and the other is like the body. The Greek idea of a perfect State, just like a perfect person, is a fair mind in a fair body.

In Hegel’s words, the State is the reality that justice represents as an idea. Or, in Christian language, the kingdom of God is inside people but also grows into a Church or a kingdom outside. The “house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens” becomes a real building on earth. 

Using a Platonic image, justice and the State are like the threads that run through the whole fabric. When the State’s system is finished, the idea of justice doesn’t disappear. Instead, it comes back under the same or different names throughout the book. Justice appears as the inner law of the soul and, finally, as the rule for rewards and punishments in another life.

The virtues are based on justice. Common honesty in buying and selling is just a small part of it. Justice itself is based on the idea of good, which is the harmony of the world. This harmony shows up both in the laws of States and in the movements of heavenly bodies (like in the book Tim.). 

The Timaeus, which focuses more on the political side than the ethical side of the Republic, and mostly talks about the outside world, also shows that the same law is believed to rule over the State, nature, and humans.
