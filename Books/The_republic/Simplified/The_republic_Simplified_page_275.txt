Yes, I said, and you can also add that they only get fed and don’t get paid money like other people. So, even if they wanted to, they couldn’t go on fun trips or spend money on a girlfriend or any other nice things, which most people think makes life happy. Many other similar complaints could be added too.

But, I said, let’s just imagine all of this was true.

You mean to ask, I said, what should we say in response?

Yes.

If we keep thinking the way we have been, I said, I believe we will find the answer. Our answer will be that even as they are, our guardians might actually be the happiest people. But our goal in creating the State wasn’t to make one group super happy, but to make the whole group as happy as possible. We thought that in a State made for the good of everyone, we would find justice, and in a bad State, injustice. Once we find which is which, we can decide which group is happier.

Right now, I think, we are building the happy State, not just a few happy people, but the whole group. Soon, we will look at the opposite kind of State.

Imagine we are painting a statue, and someone comes up and says, “Why don’t you put the best colors on the most beautiful parts—the eyes should be purple, but you made them black?” We could answer, “Sir, you wouldn’t want us to make the eyes so colorful that they don’t look like eyes anymore. Instead, think about whether all the parts together make the whole statue beautiful.”
