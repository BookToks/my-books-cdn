There is another problem with how some people see things, different from not being able to see far away. These people only care about what is close to them. They have spent their whole lives working in one job or one area. They only care about their own interests or the interests of their group. They don’t have any big ideas except their own opinions or the opinions of people like them. They don’t know much about what is happening outside their small world, only what they hear on the street or at their club.

Imagine if these people were sent into a bigger world to do something more important. Say, if they changed from workers to leaders, or from teachers to philosophers. Or imagine they suddenly had a new idea about God or a spiritual world. Even then, their daily lives would not change much. Many of their old narrow ideas would still stay with them, even after they start to see things in a bigger way. From examples like this, we can understand what Plato meant by two kinds of problems with how people see things.

We can also compare this to a young Athenian in the fifth century BC who got confused by new ideas, and a modern university student who goes through a similar experience. When young people start to question usual beliefs or think about human nature, they often lose hold of solid truths. They are like trees that have been moved many times.

The ground around them is loose, and their roots don’t go deep.

They get excited by every new idea, following their own wishes or just drifting like leaves in the wind. They catch opinions like catching colds, just because they are around. Moving from one idea to the opposite one, they soon believe things very different from what they were taught. They hardly keep the difference between right and wrong. They think all ideas are equal. They think they are searching for truth, but really they are just following a leader.

They fall in love quickly with strange ideas about morality, art, or religion. Like lovers, they get so caught up in new ideas that they can’t think about anything else. Solving some big question about philosophy or religion seems more important to them than learning about literature, science, or even living a good life. Like the young people in Plato’s “Philebus,” they are ready to talk to anyone about a new philosophy. 

Usually, they follow some famous teacher or clever speaker, copying them more than understanding. They are lucky if, as they grow older, they keep some simple truths learned when they were kids, which might be the most valuable things they know. This is the picture Plato paints and which we repeat here, showing the dangers young people face when old ideas are disappearing and new ones are not yet clear.
