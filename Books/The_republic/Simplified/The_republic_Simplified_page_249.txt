You mean, I guess, to ask if we should allow both tragedy and comedy in our State?

Yes, I said; but there might be more to this question: I’m not sure yet, but wherever the argument goes, we’ll follow.

And follow we will, he said.

Then, Adeimantus, let me ask you if our guardians should be imitators; or hasn’t it already been decided that one person can only do one thing well, not many; and if they try many things, they will fail to be good at any?

Definitely.

And this is also true for imitation; no one can imitate many things as well as they can imitate just one?

They can’t.

Then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious role in life and at the same time imitate many other roles too; because even when two types of imitation are very similar, the same people can’t be good at both, like writers of tragedy and comedy – didn’t you just call those imitations?

Yes, I did; and you’re right to think the same person can’t be good at both.

Just like they probably can’t be singers and actors at the same time?

True.

And comic and tragic actors aren’t the same; yet all these things are still imitations.

They are.

And human nature, Adeimantus, seems to be made up of even smaller parts, and people can’t imitate many things well, just like they can’t perform the real actions that these imitations copy.

That’s true.

If we stick to our original idea and remember that our guardians, ignoring everything else, are supposed to focus completely on keeping freedom in the State, making this their job, and not doing anything that doesn’t help with this goal, then they shouldn’t practice or imitate anything else; if they do imitate, they should only imitate from a young age those characters that fit their job – the brave, self-controlled, respectful, free, and similar traits; but they shouldn’t act out or get good at imitating anything bad or dishonorable, because if they do, they might become like what they imitate.
