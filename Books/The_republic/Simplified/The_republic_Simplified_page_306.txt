So, since the question isn’t decided yet, and you’re taking charge of another State, we’ve decided—not to let you go until you explain everything.

Glaucon said, “You can count me as agreeing with that.”

Without any more delay, Thrasymachus said, “You can consider all of us agreed.”

I said, “You don’t know what you’re doing by attacking me like this. What kind of argument are you making about the State? I thought I was done and happy that you accepted what I said, but now you want me to start all over again. You don’t realize how many problems you’re causing. I saw this trouble coming and tried to avoid it.”

Thrasymachus asked, “Why do you think we’re here—to look for gold or to have a conversation?”

I replied, “Yes, but conversations should have limits.”

Glaucon said, “True, Socrates, and wise people think life is the only limit for such talks. But don’t worry about us; just focus on yourself and answer the question your own way: What kind of community of women and children will live with our guardians? And how will we handle the time between birth and education, which needs the most care? Tell us how it will work.”

I said, “My friend, that’s not an easy question. Many more doubts come up here than before. People might wonder if what we say can really work, and even if it can, whether it’s the best idea. So, I’m a bit scared to start because I don’t want what we hope for to turn out to be just a dream.”

He said, “Don’t worry. Your listeners won’t be hard on you; they aren’t doubtful or mean.”

I answered, “My friend, I guess you’re trying to encourage me.”

He said, “Yes.”

I said, “Actually, you’re doing the opposite. Your encouragement would be good if I believed I knew what I was talking about. When someone wants to tell the truth about important things—things that wise people respect and love—there’s no reason to be afraid or unsure. But to argue when you’re still unsure yourself, like me, is risky. The danger isn’t that people will laugh at me—that would be childish to worry about—but that I’ll miss the truth when I most need to be sure, and then lead my friends the wrong way.”
