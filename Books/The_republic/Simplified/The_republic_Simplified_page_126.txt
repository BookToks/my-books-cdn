Nature is like a kind of art. A breath of fresh air or just looking at different landscapes can instantly bring back the feeling of poetry inside us. In early human history, imagination, more than logic, made humans different from animals. If we got rid of art, we would also lose thinking, language, and the way we express truth. No religion is without some kind of outward form. Even Muslims, who avoid pictures and images, have temples that are as beautiful and serious as any Greek or Christian church. Feelings and thoughts aren’t really opposite; to think, you have to feel first. And the best thoughts, when we get used to them, often turn into feelings.

Plato didn’t really want to get rid of poets from life and society. But he felt that their writing wasn’t real or true enough. He was criticizing how poetry had become weaker in his time, like how we might complain today about modern fiction lacking serious purpose or some poets and writers being too extreme or dishonest. We also have reasons to complain that many poets and novelists show only the lower parts of the soul and that readers become affected in negative ways by what they read. We hope for a kind of healthy atmosphere, like what Plato described—a beauty that gently touches the senses and quietly brings the soul, even in childhood, into harmony with the beauty of reason.

There could be a kind of poetry that praises perfect goodness and truth among people. This poetry would feel like a song that renews the world’s youth and brings back times when poets were the best teachers and friends to people. It could find inspiration in both the present and the past. It could use the best types of speech and verse to shape the tough and complicated parts of modern life. It might help us find simple truths about justice and fairness in today’s many opinions and complex society. It would keep all the good things from every generation and leave out the bad. This poetry wouldn’t be about empty dreams or weak ideas but would come from a clear understanding of human nature.

Then, stories about love could start again in poetry or prose, mixed together and working toward knowledge and helping God and people. Feelings of love could still inspire big ideas and brave actions like in the days of Dante or Petrarch. Many kinds of beauty, both strong and gentle, might appear among us, rising above ordinary human life. Many lives could be like poems—not just written but truly lived. Some of these ideas have been seen in the tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles, whom Plato respected deeply, not like Homer whom he quoted with irony. They are also found in the poetry of Milton and Wordsworth, and in parts of other English poets’ work—most importantly, in the Hebrew prophets and psalmists.
