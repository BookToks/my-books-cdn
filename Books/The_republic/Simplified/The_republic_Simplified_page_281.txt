I think there is only a little wisdom in making laws about these things—I'm not sure it’s ever done, and any exact written laws about them probably won’t last.

It seems impossible.

Adeimantus, it looks like the way a person’s education begins will shape their whole future. Don’t people usually hang out with others like themselves?

That’s true.

Unless someone rare and amazing comes along who might do something good—or maybe the opposite of good?

That can’t be denied.

So, that’s why I said I won’t try to make more laws about these things.

Of course, he replied.

Well, what about the marketplace, and the usual dealings between people? Or agreements with workers? What about insults, injuries, starting legal actions, and picking juries? There might also be questions about taxes or fees for markets and harbors, and rules for markets, police, harbors, and similar things. But should we really bother making laws about all these details?

I think, he said, there’s no need to make laws for good people; they will figure out the rules they need on their own.

Yes, I said, my friend, if only God helps keep the laws we already gave them.

Without help from above, said Adeimantus, they will keep making and changing their laws and lives forever, hoping to become perfect.

You mean they are like sick people who can’t control themselves and won’t stop their bad habits?

Exactly.

Yes, I said; and what a sad life they have! They keep messing with their problems, making them worse and more complicated, always thinking some cure someone suggests will fix them.

This happens a lot, he said, with people like that.

Yes, I replied; and the sad part is they see the person who tells them the truth as their worst enemy. The truth is, unless they stop eating, drinking, partying, and wasting time, no medicine, treatment, magic spell, or charm will help them.
