So, should these people be our leaders when there are others who have just as much experience and are just as good, but also really understand the truth about everything?

He said there’s no reason to reject those who have this amazing quality; they should always come first unless they mess up in some other way.

I said, okay, let’s figure out how well they can combine this quality with other good traits.

Sure, let’s do that.

First, like we said before, we need to understand what a philosopher is really like. When we do that, I think we’ll see that it’s possible for someone to have all these good qualities together, and only those people should be leaders.

What do you mean?

Let’s say that people with a philosophical mind always love knowledge that shows them the eternal, unchanging nature of things—things that don’t change over time.

Agreed.

And also, let’s agree that they love all true things; there’s nothing, big or small, more or less honorable, that they would give up—unlike lovers or ambitious people.

True.

If they are going to be like that, don’t they need to have another quality?

What quality?

Truthfulness: they will never purposely accept lies, which they hate, and they will love the truth.

Yes, that’s definitely true about them.

I said, don’t say “maybe” — say “definitely:” because anyone who loves something can’t help but love everything related to it.

Right, he said.

And what’s closer to wisdom than truth?

How could there be anything closer?
