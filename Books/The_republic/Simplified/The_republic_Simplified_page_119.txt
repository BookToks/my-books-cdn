The whorl looked like a bunch of boxes stacked inside each other, with their edges turned up. Together, they formed one big whorl with a spindle going through the middle. The outermost box had the widest edge, and the inner ones got smaller and smaller with narrower edges. The biggest one (the fixed stars) sparkled. The seventh one (the sun) was the brightest. The eighth one (the moon) shined using the sun’s light. The second and fifth (Saturn and Mercury) looked alike and were yellower than the eighth. The third (Jupiter) had the whitest light. The fourth (Mars) was red. The sixth (Venus) was the second whitest.

The whole whorl moved, but while it spun one way, the seven inner circles moved the opposite way at different speeds. The spindle turned on the knees of Necessity, and a Siren sang on each circle. Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos, who were Necessity’s daughters, sat on thrones spaced evenly around, singing about the past, present, and future, matching the Sirens’ music. Clotho sometimes guided the outer circle with her right hand. Atropos guided the inner circles with her left hand. Lachesis guided both circles from time to time.

When pilgrims arrived, they went to Lachesis. An interpreter organized them and took lots and samples of lives from her knees. Then he stood on a platform and said: “Mortal souls, listen to Lachesis, daughter of Necessity. A new period of mortal life has started, and you can choose any god you want. The choice is yours—God is not to blame.”

After saying this, he threw lots among them, and each soul picked the lot that landed near them. Then he put many life samples on the ground—more than the souls present. There were all kinds of lives, of men and animals. Some were tyrannies ending in misery and exile. Some were lives famous for different qualities. Others were mixed, with wealth and poverty, sickness and health.

Glaucon, this shows how risky human life is. That’s why education should teach people to say no to evil and choose what’s good. People should understand all the different combinations in life—beauty with poverty or wealth, knowledge with material things—and finally choose based on the soul’s nature, because a better soul means a better life. People should take some sense of truth and right into the world below so they don’t get dazzled by wealth or tempted by evil. They should avoid extremes and choose the middle path.

According to the messenger, this is true happiness. Anyone who chooses wisely can have a good life, even if they come last. “Let the first not be careless in their choice, and the last not lose hope.” 

He finished speaking, and the one who drew the first lot chose a tyranny. He didn’t realize he was doomed to destroy his own children. When he found out how bad his fate was, he cried and beat his chest, blaming chance, the gods, and everyone but himself.
