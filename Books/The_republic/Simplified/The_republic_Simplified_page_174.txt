Even more interesting than these, and much more like Plato’s style and ideas, is Sir John Eliot’s ‘Monarchy of Man.’ He was a prisoner in the Tower and felt he could no longer be a politician in his own country. So, he stopped focusing on politics and looked inside himself, discovering that the secret to happiness is controlling yourself. The change in government during the English Commonwealth made people think about basic ideas and led to many works like this.

Swift, a great writer, didn’t get his ideas from Plato. Neither did Dr. Johnson. Swift probably would have disagreed with Plato even without reading him, just like he thought he disagreed with Bishop Berkeley’s idea that matter doesn’t exist. Except for some so-called English Platonists who didn’t really understand Plato, and Coleridge who was a bit similar in spirit, Plato didn’t really influence English literature in a lasting way.

Human life and behavior are influenced by ideals just like they are by the examples of great people. Neither ideals nor examples can be used directly in everyday life, but they have a power that helps people rise above normal society or business and makes countries act beyond just trade or defense. Like art ideals, they are partly made by leaving out details. You have to look at them from a distance, or they lose their meaning. When put into a country or philosophy, they become clearer but still remain visions of a “world not yet real.”

More obvious to most people are the examples of great men who helped their generation and are remembered by others. Even in our own families, there might be a woman, man, or child whose face showed a kindness beyond normal. These examples bring the ideal closer to us, and we hold onto it. Many people are fascinated by the ideal of the past, whether from their own life or old societies. But we learn too late that we can’t go back to those ideals, though remembering them can make other times more humane.

Philosophy’s abstract ideas often feel cold and empty to most people; they give light but no warmth, like a full moon in a sky with no stars. People can’t live on ideas alone; the real world always interrupts them. Most people only see a little beyond their own home or town; they don’t look up “to the hills” or awaken when a new day begins. But with Plato, we reach a high point where a person can look far into the future for the world and philosophy.

Plato’s ideas about the perfect state, the life of a philosopher, lifelong education for both men and women, the unity of knowledge, belief in good, and immortality are like empty lights he wants humanity to focus on and understand.
