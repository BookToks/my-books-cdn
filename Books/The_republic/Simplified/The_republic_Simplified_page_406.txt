He said that the type of government you described is a mix of good and bad.

I agreed there is a mix, but I think one thing stands out the most – a spirit of fighting and wanting power. This happens because many people in the government are passionate and full of energy.

He agreed with me.

This is how this kind of government started and what it is like. I only gave a rough idea because a simple description is enough to show what the most fair and the most unfair governments look like. Talking about every type of government and every kind of person would take forever.

He agreed again.

Now, what kind of person fits this government? How did he come to be, and what is he like?

Adeimantus said he thinks this person, with his fighting spirit, is a bit like our friend Glaucon.

I said maybe in that way, but he is different in other ways.

Adeimantus asked, “In what ways?”

I said he would be more confident and less educated but still like culture. He would be a good listener but not a good speaker. This person might be rough with slaves because he’s not educated and proud like others. But he would be polite to free people and follow rules carefully. He loves power and respect. He wants to be a leader, not because he talks well, but because he is a soldier who has done brave things. He also loves sports and hunting.

“Yes, that’s the kind of person who fits a timocracy,” Adeimantus said.

This person won’t hate money when he is young, but as he grows older, he will want more and more money. That’s because he has a greedy side and doesn’t focus only on being good, losing the best part of himself.

“Who was that best part?” asked Adeimantus.

I said it was philosophy mixed with music, which comes to live inside a person and is the only thing that saves his goodness throughout his life.
