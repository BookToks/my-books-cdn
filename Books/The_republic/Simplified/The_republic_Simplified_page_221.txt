We all want many things, and we need many people to help get them. So, one person helps with one thing, and another helps with something else. When these helpers live together, the group is called a State.

True, he said.

They trade with each other—one gives, another takes—because they believe trading will help everyone.

Very true.

So, I said, let’s try to imagine creating a State. But really, the reason we create it is because we need things—need is the mother of invention.

Of course, he replied.

The first and most important need is food, because without it, we can’t live.

Certainly.

The second need is a place to live, and the third is clothes and other similar things.

True.

Now, let’s see how our city can handle these big needs: we can imagine one man is a farmer, another a builder, and someone else a weaver. Should we add a shoemaker or someone else who provides what our bodies need?

Quite right.

The simplest idea of a State must have at least four or five people.

Clearly.

How will they work? Will each person put what they make into a shared pool? For example, the farmer might work four times as much as he needs to make food for himself and three others. Or will he only make enough food for himself, using the rest of his time to make a house, clothes, or shoes, without sharing with others?

Adeimantus thought he should focus only on growing food, not making everything.

Probably, I replied, that would be the better way. Also, I remembered that we are all different; people have different skills suited to different jobs.
