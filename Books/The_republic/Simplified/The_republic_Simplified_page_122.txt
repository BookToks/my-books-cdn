Plato thought being an actor was bad for a person’s true self because one person can’t really be many different characters. When actors play different roles, it feels like they lose their own identity. Also, no one can live their real life while pretending to be someone else. Actors don’t control their art; their art controls them. Because of this, Plato wanted to get rid of plays more than epic poems, even though Greek plays taught important lessons about bravery and love for country, which Homer’s stories didn’t do as well. But Plato believed that being really good at drama or public speaking didn’t usually go with having a strong or steady mind. Sometimes, people with talent for acting might have weak or bad character.

In the Tenth Book, Plato gave more reasons against art. He said poets and painters only copy reality, and their work is far from the truth. They don’t follow real rules; their work is just appearances. Today, we might say art isn’t just copying but showing the ideal side of things we sense. Even if we agree with Plato’s idea, we’d say artists can make simple things look noble by how they paint them or the feelings they add. Some modern painters have made a blacksmith’s or carpenter’s shop look meaningful. People who can really see or feel can make a broken mill or a small shed look important and sad, like Rembrandt or Turner did. This is even more true for great art that seems like a visible form of something divine. If Plato was asked about the statues of Zeus or Athene by Pheidias, he’d have to admit they were more than just copies of real people. Their perfect proportions were beyond any math or geometry. Plato also said that art shows emotions instead of reason. He didn’t agree with Aristotle’s idea that tragedy helps clear out feelings like pity and fear; instead, Plato thought it just lets people enjoy those emotions too much.

Still, we can agree that sometimes expressing strong feelings can help us feel better, especially when those feelings are kept inside. It’s not always bad to feel emotions. Sometimes, art can satisfy both deep and simple feelings—thoughts that are too hard or sad for us to say can be shared through poetry. Everyone knows that beautiful music, amazing buildings, or peaceful nature can comfort and inspire people. Plato himself said earlier in the Republic that art could make the mind feel balanced as well as weak, but in the Tenth Book, he looked at art from a stricter, more serious point of view.
