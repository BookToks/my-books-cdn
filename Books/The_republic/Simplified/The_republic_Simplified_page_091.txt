We need to compare this last type of government with the perfectly just one, which is the fifth, to figure out which is happier. Then, we can decide if Thrasymachus’s argument or our own is more convincing. Just like before, we started with the State and then looked at the individual. Now, starting with timocracy, let’s look at the timocratic man and then move on to other types of government and the people who fit them.

So, how did timocracy come from the perfect State? It happened because the rulers started to disagree, which is how all governments change. But why did they disagree? “Sing, heavenly Muses,” like Homer says—let them come down and explain to us like we’re kids, pretending to be serious but joking. What will they say? They will say that everything made by humans is meant to break down eventually, and even the perfect State can’t escape this fate when the cycle completes itself, whether quickly or slowly.

Plants and animals have times when they can reproduce and times when they can’t. Because rulers are influenced by their feelings, they don’t always understand this. So, children will be born at the wrong times. While divine creations follow a perfect cycle, human life follows a cycle that gets worse over time. It has four parts and three gaps, growing and shrinking, fitting together but not perfect.

There’s a special number with a fourth added (3:4), multiplied by five and then cubed, which creates two types of harmony. The first is a square number, which is a hundred times the base. The second is a rectangular shape made of hundreds of squares based on a figure with a side of five, with some adjustments, plus a hundred cubes of three. This number is geometric and shows the law of how things are created.

When this law is ignored, marriages go wrong, and weaker children are born who will eventually become rulers. The State will fall apart, education will decline, gymnastic exercises will be more popular than music, and metals like gold, silver, brass, and iron will mix in chaos. This causes division. That’s what the Muses say in answer to our question. And it’s a true answer.

But what else do they say? They say that two groups—the iron and brass people, and the silver and gold people—will pull the State in different directions. One group will focus on trade and making money, while the other, who have real wealth and don’t care about money, will resist them. The fight will end in a compromise: they will allow private property and enslave the people who were once their friends and caretakers.

However, they will keep their love for war and will mostly focus on fighting and ruling. This is how timocracy starts, which is between aristocracy and oligarchy.

This new government is like the ideal one because its people obey rulers, dislike trade, eat together, and focus on war and gymnastic exercises.
