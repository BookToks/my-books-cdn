You’re right, he said.

There are two important qualities left to find in the State—first, temperance, and then justice, which is what we’re really looking for.

That’s true.

So, can we find justice without thinking about temperance first?

I don’t know how we could do that, he said. I also don’t want justice to be found if temperance is ignored. So, please do me a favor and think about temperance first.

Of course, I said. I wouldn’t refuse your request.

Then think about it, he said.

Okay, I said. From what I can see right now, temperance is more about harmony and balance than the other qualities we talked about.

How do you mean? he asked.

Temperance, I said, is about controlling certain pleasures and desires. This idea is kind of shown in the saying ‘a man being his own master.’ You can see similar ideas in the way people talk.

That makes sense, he said.

The phrase ‘master of himself’ sounds a bit funny because the master is also the servant, and the servant is also the master. It’s all talking about the same person.

Exactly.

What it means, I think, is that inside a person there is a better side and a worse side. When the better side controls the worse side, then the person is called master of himself. This is a good thing. But if, because of bad habits or bad friends, the worse side, which is bigger, takes over, then the person is blamed and called a slave to himself and without principles.

That makes sense.

Now, I said, look at our newly created State. You’ll see one of these two situations there. The State can be called master of itself if the words ‘temperance’ and ‘self-mastery’ really mean that the better part rules over the worse.

Yes, he said, I see that what you say is true.

Let me also add that the many and complicated pleasures, desires, and pains are usually found in children, women, servants, and the lowest and largest group of free men.
