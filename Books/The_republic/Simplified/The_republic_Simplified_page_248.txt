Okay, to make things really clear so you don’t say, “I don’t get it,” I’ll show you how the change could happen.

If Homer had said, “The priest came, holding his daughter’s ransom in his hands, begging the Achaeans and all the kings,” and then instead of speaking as Chryses, he spoke in his own voice, the words wouldn’t be acting out a story, but just telling it plainly.

It would go like this (I’m not a poet, so I’ll drop the fancy rhythm): “The priest came and prayed to the gods for the Greeks to win the war and come home safe, but he also begged them to give his daughter back, take the ransom he brought, and respect the God. The other Greeks respected the priest and agreed. But Agamemnon was angry and told him to leave and never come back, warning that no god’s power would help him. He said his daughter wouldn’t be freed and that she’d grow old with him in Argos. Then he told the priest to go away and not cause trouble if he wanted to get home safe. The old man left quietly and scared, and after leaving the camp, he prayed to Apollo, reminding him of all the good things he had done, like building temples and offering sacrifices, and asked that the gods punish the Greeks soon with Apollo’s arrows. That’s how it would sound if it was just simple storytelling.”

I understand, he said.

Or you could think about it the other way — that the middle parts are left out and only the conversation stays.

That too, he said, I get it; you mean like in a play.

You’ve got it exactly. If I’m not wrong, what you didn’t understand before is now clear — poetry and stories sometimes copy real life exactly. Tragedies and comedies show this well. There’s also the opposite style where the poet is the only one talking — a good example is a dithyramb. And sometimes, both ways are mixed, like in epic poems and some other types of poetry. Do you follow me?

Yes, he said; now I see what you mean.

Also, remember when I said we were done with this topic and ready to talk about style?

Yes, I remember.

By that, I meant we need to understand how imitation works in art — whether poets should be allowed to copy real life when telling their stories, and if so, should they copy everything or just some parts? Or should imitation be banned altogether?
