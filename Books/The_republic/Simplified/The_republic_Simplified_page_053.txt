For example, the word ‘greater’ just means ‘more than,’ and knowledge means knowing about a certain subject. But specific knowledge is about a specific subject. Every science is different because it studies a different thing; for example, medicine is the science of health, but it is not the same as health itself.

Now that we understand this, let’s go back to the idea of thirst, which has a clear goal – to drink. When someone is thirsty, they might feel two different urges; one is animal-like, saying ‘Drink,’ and the other is reasoning, saying ‘Don’t drink.’ These two urges are opposite, so we can guess they come from different parts of the soul. But is there a third feeling called passion, or is it just like desire?

There is a story about a man named Leontius that helps explain this. He was walking near the city walls and saw dead bodies by the executioner. He wanted to look at them but also felt disgusted. At first, he looked away and closed his eyes, but then suddenly opened them and said, “Look all you want, you miserable people.” This shows there might be a third part of the soul that helps reason fight against desire, but never the other way around. This is passion or spirit.

We can see that passion is separate when a person suffers unfairly. If he is a good person, he won’t get angry at hard times, but if the suffering is unfair, his anger helps him keep going. Hunger and thirst won’t stop him; his spirit inside won’t give up until reason tells it to calm down. This shows passion works with reason.

Is passion the same as reason? No, because passion exists even in children and animals. Homer even shows the difference when he says someone “hit his chest and scolded his soul.” Now we can understand that the virtues of a country and a person are the same. Wisdom, courage, and justice in a country are just the wisdom, courage, and justice in the people who live there.

Each group in a country does its own job, just like parts of the soul do their own job in a person. Reason is the boss, and passion is the part that follows. They work together, balanced by things like music and exercise. The leader and the fighter, the head and the arms, work as one in the soul’s city and keep desires under control.

The courage of the warrior is the strength to keep the right idea about danger, even when feeling pain or pleasure. The wisdom of the leader is the small part of the soul that has power and thinks clearly. Temperance, or self-control, is the friendship between the rulers and those who are ruled, both in the country and in the person. We have already talked about justice, which means fairness, and we can see from real life that a just country or person won’t steal, lie, cheat, or disrespect gods or people.
