We can see that some kinds of greatness come from a special kind of personality. This is especially true for people who are creative and imaginative, like poets, who often rely on feelings and need a certain environment to thrive.

A genius feels things more deeply—they have bigger troubles and joys, stronger abilities and weaknesses, and a more complex personality than most people. They might pretend to be good or fair without really being so, or hide personal hate behind words about love for their country or ideas. They can say what everyone else is thinking, and they understand the mistakes and faults of others in a powerful way.

People like Alcibiades, Mirabeau, or Napoleon the First were born to either cause great harm or great good to their countries, depending on the direction they take. But the idea that the worst corruption comes from the best people isn’t always true, because what ruins one person might help another grow.

Usually, a person can only become their best self in a place or group that fits them well, like with family, friends, or coworkers. But sometimes, tough situations push someone so much that they fight back, change things, and grow stronger. While weaker or less sensitive people might accept bad things in the church or society and live on without changing them, stronger or more sensitive people might be crushed or spoiled by their surroundings. They might become someone who hates people but also loves helping them, or like the founders of religious groups or reformers, break away completely from the world or the church, sometimes doing great good, sometimes great harm, or both. This can happen in smaller groups too, like in a convent, school, or family.

Plato wanted us to think about how easily the best people are controlled by what others think, and how much others try to take over their minds. The world, the church, their jobs, or political groups often push them around and teach them to call their own opinions by fancy, holy names. The big group they belong to decides what is right and true based on what most people want. The person becomes part of the group, and if they try to resist, the world is too strong and will get back at them sooner or later. This might be a one-sided view, but it’s not completely wrong about how people act when they meet together, whether in ancient or modern times.

When the best people are ruined by politics, the less thoughtful people take over the role of guiding ideas and beliefs. This is shown in a repeated idea where the argument hides itself and then comes back again.
