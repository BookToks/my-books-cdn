Sure, we can.

And doesn’t the rebellious side give us lots of ideas to copy? The calm and wise side is almost always steady, so it’s hard to copy or enjoy when copied—especially in a noisy place like a theater. People don’t really understand that feeling.

Definitely.

So, a poet who wants to be popular isn’t made to please the smart part of the mind. Instead, they like to focus on wild and strong feelings because those are easier to copy.

Exactly.

Now, we can compare that poet to a painter in two ways: first, their work isn’t as true or real. Second, they both deal with the less important part of the mind. That’s why we shouldn’t let poets have power in a good society, because they stir up feelings and weaken reason. It’s like when bad people run a city and good people are pushed away. The poet messes up the mind by feeding the part that can’t tell what’s really important. They just make fake images and are far from the truth.

Right.

But the worst part is this: poetry can even hurt good people—and almost everyone gets hurt. Isn’t that a terrible thing?

Yes, if it really does that.

Listen and decide: The best of us, when we hear a part of Homer or a tragedy where a sad hero is complaining or crying and beating his chest, we feel sympathy and love how the poet makes us feel so much.

Of course, I understand.

But when something sad happens to us personally, we try to be calm and patient. That strong feeling that we liked in the poem now seems weak or like something for girls, not for the brave part of us.
