That, he said, is something more than just normal knowledge.

I replied, it’s something useful, but only if you’re looking for what’s beautiful and good. If you’re after something else, it’s not useful.

He agreed, saying that’s true.

Now, when all these studies connect and work together, and we see how they relate, then, I think, they become valuable for what we want. Otherwise, they’re pointless.

I guessed that’s right, but said, Socrates, you’re talking about a huge task.

What do you mean? I asked. The beginning, or what? Don’t you know all this is just the start of the real challenge we have to learn? Surely, you wouldn’t call a math expert a good reasoner.

Definitely not, he said. I’ve hardly ever met a math expert who could argue well.

But do you think people who can’t argue well will have the kind of knowledge we need?

No, that can’t be.

So, Glaucon, I said, we’ve finally reached the part about dialectic. This is all about the mind, but our sense of sight tries to copy it. Remember, we imagined sight as seeing real animals and stars, and last of all the sun itself. Dialectic is like that; when someone uses only reason, without senses, and keeps going until they reach understanding of the absolute good, they end up at the highest point of the mind, just like sight reaches the sun.

Exactly, he said.

So this is what you call dialectic?

Yes.

But freeing prisoners from chains, moving them from shadows to real images and to the light, and climbing from the underground cave to the sun — while they’re there, they try to look at animals and plants and the sun’s light, but with their weak eyes they can only see reflections in water (which are like true images), and these reflections are the shadows of real things (not just shadows made by firelight, which is only a copy of the sun)—this ability to lift the highest part of the soul to see the best things that exist, like how the eye sees the brightest things in the visible world—this power comes from all the study and practice of arts that we just talked about.
