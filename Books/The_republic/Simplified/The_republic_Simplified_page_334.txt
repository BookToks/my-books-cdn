Go ahead.

I guess you remember already, so I don’t have to remind you, that a real lover should show love not just to one part of what they love, but to all of it.

I don’t really get it, so please help me remember.

Someone else might answer like you did; but a fun-loving person like you should know that everyone young and full of life makes a lover feel something special, and the lover thinks they all deserve their love. Isn’t that how you are with the beautiful people? One has a flat nose, and you call their face charming; another has a hooked nose, and you say it looks royal; while someone with a normal nose is just perfectly graceful. The dark-skinned ones seem strong, the fair-skinned ones look like kids of the gods; and the pale ones, called ‘honey pale,’ get that name from a lover who loves to use cute words and doesn’t mind paleness if it’s on young cheeks. In short, you’ll find any excuse and say anything so you don’t miss out on anyone beautiful in the springtime of youth.

If you want me to be an expert about love, just for this talk, I agree.

What about people who love wine? Don’t you see them doing the same thing?

They’re happy to drink any kind of wine if they get a chance.

Good point.

And it’s the same with people who want power; if they can’t lead a big army, they’re okay leading a small group; if they can’t be respected by really important people, they’re happy to be respected by less important ones – but they always want some kind of honor.

Exactly.

Let me ask again: Does someone who wants something want the whole thing or just part of it?

The whole thing.

And can we not say a philosopher loves all wisdom, not just a part of it?

Yes, all of it.

And someone who hates learning, especially when they’re young and don’t know what’s good or bad, is not really a philosopher or a lover of knowledge, just like someone who refuses food is not really hungry and probably has a bad appetite, not a good one?
