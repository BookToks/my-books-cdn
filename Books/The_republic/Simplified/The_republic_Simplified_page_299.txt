Great, I said, and you can see strong feelings even in animals, which proves what you’re saying is true. We can also look at Homer’s words, which we talked about before: 'He smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul.' In this line, Homer shows that the part of us that thinks about what’s better and worse is different from the angry feelings it controls.

That’s right, he said.

So, after a lot of discussion, we’ve agreed that the same ideas that make up a State also exist inside a person, and there are three parts.

Exactly.

Does that mean a person is wise in the same way a State is wise, because of the same reason?

Of course.

Also, the same thing that makes a State brave also makes a person brave, and both the State and the person are connected to all the other good traits?

Definitely.

And we can say a person is just in the same way a State is just?

That makes sense.

We must remember that the justice of the State was about each of the three groups doing their own job?

We haven’t forgotten that, he said.

We should also remember that a person will be just if the different parts of their nature do their own jobs?

Yes, we must remember that too.

And shouldn’t the thinking part, which is wise and takes care of the whole soul, be in charge, while the passionate or brave part should listen and help?

Of course.
