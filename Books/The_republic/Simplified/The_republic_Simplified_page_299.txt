Excellent, I said, and you may see passion equally in brute animals, which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying. And we may once more appealtothewordsofHomer,whichhavebeenalreadyquotedbyus, ’Hesmotehisbreast,andthusrebukedhissoul,’ forinthisverseHomerhasclearlysupposedthepowerwhichreasonsaboutthe betterandworsetobedifferentfromtheunreasoningangerwhichisrebuked byit.
 
 Verytrue,hesaid.
 
 And so, after much tossing, we have reached land, and are fairly agreed that thesameprincipleswhichexistintheStateexistalsointheindividual,andthat theyarethreeinnumber.
 
 Exactly.
 
 Mustwenottheninferthattheindividualiswiseinthesameway,andinvirtue ofthesamequalitywhichmakestheStatewise?
 
 Certainly.
 
 Also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the State constitutes courage in the individual, and that both the State and the individual bear the samerelationtoalltheothervirtues?
 
 Assuredly.
 
 And the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way in whichtheStateisjust?
 
 Thatfollows,ofcourse.
 
 We cannot but remember that the justice of the State consisted in each of the threeclassesdoingtheworkofitsownclass?
 
 Wearenotverylikelytohaveforgotten,hesaid.
 
 Wemustrecollectthattheindividualinwhomtheseveralqualitiesofhisnature dotheirownworkwillbejust,andwilldohisownwork?
 
 Yes,hesaid,wemustrememberthattoo.
 
 And ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care of the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to be the subject andally?
