Socrates says: But where is justice in all this? Son of Ariston, tell me where it is. Light a candle and look all over the city, and get your brother and our friends to help find her. 

“That won’t work,” Glaucon said, “You promised to lead the search and said it’s wrong to give up on justice.” 

“Well,” I said, “I’ll lead, but you have to follow. I think our perfect State will have all four virtues—wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice. If we take away the first three, what’s left will be justice.”

First, wisdom: the State we made will be wise because it’s smart in its decisions. This kind of skill isn’t like a carpenter’s or a farmer’s skill. It’s the skill of the people who advise the whole State. The guardians, a small group, have this wisdom. If they are wise, the whole State will be wise.

Our second virtue is courage, which we find in soldiers. Courage means sticking to the right beliefs about danger, no matter what. Think of how dyers prepare white cloth before adding color so the dye stays forever. The cloth is like education, and the color is like laws. If the education is good, nothing like pleasure or fear will change those beliefs. This kind of courage is “political” or “civilized,” different from animal courage or other types.

Two virtues are left: temperance and justice. Temperance means harmony. People say a man who has temperance is a “master of himself,” but that sounds strange because a master is also a servant in some ways. In cities, some groups like women and slaves follow others. The better people control the others. So, who has temperance?

“To both groups,” I said. Our State will be full of temperance. This virtue is like harmony that spreads through the whole city, making everyone agree and work together, like the strings on a musical instrument, even if they are different in wisdom, strength, or wealth.

Now we are close to finding justice. Let’s carefully watch so justice doesn’t slip away and escape.
