So, I’m telling you, don’t force us to give the guardians a kind of happiness that would stop them from being real guardians. We could also dress farmers in fancy clothes and put gold crowns on their heads, letting them work the land only as much as they want. Our potters could relax on couches, enjoy parties by the fire, drink wine, and work on pottery whenever they feel like it. That way, every group would be happy—and you might think the whole State would be happy too.

But don’t put that idea in our heads. If we listen to you, the farmer won’t really be a farmer anymore, and the potter won’t be a real potter. Then, no one in the State would have a clear role or job. This might not matter much when only cobblers act like this, but when the guardians of laws and government are just pretending to be guardians, they mess everything up. And these guardians are the only ones who can bring order and happiness to the State.

We want our guardians to truly protect and save the State, not destroy it. But our opponent is thinking about peasants at a party, having fun, not citizens doing their duty for the State. If that’s the case, we are talking about different things, and he’s not really talking about a real State. So, we need to think about whether, when choosing our guardians, we should focus on their own personal happiness or on the happiness of the whole State.

If it’s the happiness of the whole State, then the guardians, helpers, and everyone else must be pushed or encouraged to do their own jobs well. This way, the whole State will grow in a good order, and each group will get the kind of happiness that nature gives them.

I think you’re pretty right.

I wonder if you’ll agree with another thought I have.

What is it?

There seem to be two reasons why people’s hearts go bad.

What are they?

Wealth and poverty.

How do they work?

Here’s what happens: When a potter becomes rich, do you think he’ll keep working as hard as before?
