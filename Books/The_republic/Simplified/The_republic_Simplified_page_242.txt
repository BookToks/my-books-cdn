I see a close friend of mine being chased all around the city, and it makes me really sad. Or again, I feel terrible that Sarpedon, my favorite, was defeated by Patroclus, the son of Menoetius.

If young people like you, Adeimantus, take stories about the gods seriously instead of just laughing at them, they might think that since they are only human, they can be dishonored in the same way. They won’t stop themselves from acting badly, and instead of feeling ashamed or controlling themselves, they will always complain and cry over little things.

Yes, that’s very true, he said.

I replied, but that shouldn’t happen, as we just proved. We have to accept this until someone proves it wrong.

It shouldn’t happen.

Neither should our leaders be made fun of. Laughing too much often causes a strong bad reaction.

I agree.

So, important people, even if they are just human, shouldn’t be shown as laughing too much. And it’s even worse to show the gods like that.

Even worse for the gods, you’re right, he said.

Then we shouldn’t allow such descriptions about the gods, like when Homer says, “Endless laughter came from the gods when they saw Hephaestus moving about.”

If you think so, we can blame Homer; we shouldn’t allow it.

On my view, if you want to blame me, I definitely think we shouldn’t allow it.

Also, telling the truth is very important. If lies don’t help the gods and only help people like medicine does, then lying should be left to doctors. Regular people shouldn’t lie.

Clearly not, he said.

Then if anyone can lie, it should be the rulers of the State. They can lie to enemies or their own people if it helps the public.
