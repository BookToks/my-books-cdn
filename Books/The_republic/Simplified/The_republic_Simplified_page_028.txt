Let a person do their duty first, without worrying about whether they will be happy or not, and happiness will come naturally as a result. "Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you."  

Also, Plato shows the true way Greek thinkers thought by starting with the State before focusing on the individual. First comes ethics, then politics—that’s the order of ideas for us. But history shows the opposite order. After a lot of thinking and struggle, the individual finally claims their rights as a moral being. In early times, a person was not seen as one individual, but as one of many, a citizen of a State that came before them. They had no idea of good or evil outside the laws of their country or church. People like this tend to go back to old ways whenever customs, group feelings, or memories of the past feel too strong.  

We can also see how early Greek thinkers mixed up the individual and the State, and ethics and politics. This confusion still affects us today. Early thinkers missed the small but important difference between what people do together and what they do alone. We also sometimes forget this when we either make politics into ethics or make ethics just about politics. A good person and a good citizen only match perfectly in the perfect State. But this perfect State can’t be made by laws forced on people from outside. Instead, it has to be made by education shaping people from inside.  

Socrates praises the sons of Ariston, calling them “inspired children of a famous hero,” as a poet does. But he doesn’t understand how they can argue so strongly for justice when their actions don’t show they believe in what they say. He doesn’t know how to answer them, but he is afraid to give up on justice in a difficult time. So, he makes a rule for himself: since his eyes are weak, he will first look at the big ideas and then the smaller ones—that is, he will look for justice in the State first, then in the individual. So, he begins to build the idea of the State.  

Society starts because people have needs. The first need is food; the second is a house; the third is clothes. Knowing these needs and how they can be met by trading with each other brings people together in one place. This is the start of a State, which we can say was invented, although really necessity invented it. There must first be a farmer, then a builder, then a weaver, and maybe a shoemaker too. At least four or five people are needed to make a city.  

People are different by nature, and one person will be better at some jobs than others. Work can’t wait for anyone. So, jobs must be divided into different kinds of work: selling goods in large or small amounts, working with tools, and taking care of animals or farming.
