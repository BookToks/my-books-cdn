He asked.

I answered, imagine a good and fair person telling a story about another good person. I think he would want to act like that person and wouldn’t be embarrassed to do so. He would be happy to play the part of the good person when that person is strong and wise. But if that person is sick, in love, drunk, or going through something bad, he might not act like him as much. 

If the character is bad or unworthy, he won’t focus on studying or copying that person. He would look down on them and only pretend to be like them for a short time, maybe when they do something good. Most of the time, he wouldn’t want to act like someone bad because he never behaved that way and wouldn’t like to copy bad examples. He would feel that pretending to be bad, unless it’s just for fun, is beneath him and his mind would reject it.

So, I expect that, he said.

Then this person would tell stories like we see in Homer’s work. His style would be a mix of copying and just telling the story. But he would do more telling than copying. Do you agree?

Yes, he said, that’s exactly how a good speaker should do it.

But there is another kind of person who will tell any story, no matter how bad. The worse he is, the more willing he is to do this. Nothing is too bad for him. He will copy everything, not as a joke, but seriously and in front of a big group of people. Like I said, he might try to copy the sound of thunder, wind, hail, creaking wheels, or different musical instruments. He might bark like a dog, bleat like a sheep, or crow like a rooster. His whole skill is just copying voices and actions, and he won’t tell much of the story.

That, he said, is how he would speak.

So there are two kinds of style?

Yes.

And you would agree with me that one style is simple and doesn’t change much? If the sounds and rhythm are also simple, then a good speaker will always sound pretty much the same. He will stay within one kind of sound pattern because it doesn’t change much, and he will use nearly the same rhythm too?

That’s true, he said.

But the other style needs all kinds of sounds and rhythms if the music and style are to match, because that style changes a lot.
