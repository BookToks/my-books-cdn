He wanted to completely change the old stories about gods. Like Xenophanes and Heraclitus, he knew that his time was very different from the time of Homer and Hesiod, who he quoted and used only for his own ideas. The bad behavior and lies of the gods had to be stopped. The scary stories about the underworld had to be cleared up. The bad actions of Homer’s heroes were not to be followed by young people. But there was also a positive side in Homer’s stories that could teach young people to be strong and patient. We can also learn some simple medical ideas from the way people lived in Homer’s time. The main ideas for religion are only two: first, that God is real; second, that God is good. Many writers, even modern and Christian ones, have not fully understood these ideas or gone beyond them.

Young people should grow up in happy places, away from sights or sounds that might harm their character or taste. They should live in a healthy environment where the air always brings feelings of truth and goodness. If this kind of education could really happen, or if modern religious education could be mixed with truth, virtue, good manners, and good taste, it would be the best hope for making people better.

Plato, like us, looked forward to changes in morals and religion and was getting ready for them. He knew it was dangerous to suddenly change laws and ideas for young people, especially if the old beliefs were treated like something very sacred but nothing new was ready to replace them. He was afraid of the power of plays because they could make people feel fake emotions, so he didn’t want children to go to the theater. He thought plays were bad for both the audience and the actors. Plato believed that education should help people grow smoothly, learning self-control and patience without noticing it, so the body and mind develop equally. The most important rule in all art and nature is simplicity, and this should also be the rule for life.

The second part of education is gymnastic training, which is for growing muscles and strength. The simplicity taught in music should also be part of gymnastic training. Plato knew that training the body might sometimes clash with training the mind and that exercising too much could be harmful. Too much exercise could cause headaches or make people sleepy during philosophy lessons, and they might blame the subject instead of the real cause. Two things stand out in Plato’s ideas about gymnastic training: first, the time for physical training is completely separate from the time for learning books. He thought that two very different things couldn’t be learned at the same time.

We don’t really agree with him here. From what we see today, spending three years, from ages fourteen to seventeen, only on physical exercise would not help the mind at all. Second, he said that music and gymnastic training are not for mind and body separately, as many people think, but both are meant to improve the mind equally.
