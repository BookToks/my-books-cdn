The citizens, like in other Greek states, are mostly from the upper class. Even though slaves aren’t mentioned, the lower classes are pushed aside and only shown through people’s emotions. Plato doesn’t have a clear idea of a society where all classes work together or a group of Greek states or countries living in peace. His city is built more for war than for peace, which makes sense because that was how most Greek states were back then.

The story about men born from the earth is a traditional Greek idea, and the mention of the four ages of the world comes from famous poets like Hesiod. So, Plato’s Republic is partly based on the old Greek city idea and partly on what was actually happening in Greece at the time. Like old artists, Plato keeps the traditional style but also imagines a city that isn’t real, like a dream.

There’s another important idea mixed into the Republic. It’s not just a Dorian state but also connected to the Pythagorean group. Pythagoras and his followers had a special way of life, kind of like monks, showing how one person’s ideas can influence many others. This probably made Plato think about bringing back similar “medieval” groups. The Pythagoreans, like Plato, had strict rules for living and learning. They also thought music was super important, even more than we might think today. The Pythagorean group was an aristocracy, meaning they ruled based on their virtue and wisdom. For a while, they managed public affairs until about 500 BC. Such a group probably could only exist in states with Dorian traditions.

The rulers, like Plato’s guardians, had to go through tough training to prepare to educate others. Even after the Pythagorean group ended, some of its leaders, like Archytas of Tarentum, stayed powerful in southern Italy’s Greek cities. Plato was likely inspired by the Pythagoreans’ way of life. You can see small signs of their influence in Plato’s ideas, like in the importance of certain numbers, the difference between a king and a tyrant, the idea of souls moving from one body to another, the “music of the spheres,” and the big role math plays in education.

But just like in his philosophy, Plato takes the ideas of the Pythagoreans much further in his vision of the perfect state.
