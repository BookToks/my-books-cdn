Morgenstern calls these ideas in the Republic "paradoxes," but those will be talked about somewhere else. Here, a few quick notes about the style and some tricky parts can be added.

First, there’s the picture of waves, which acts like a plan for the book. The first wave, the second wave, and the third biggest wave come in, and we hear them crash. Plato already knows his ideas sound wild. It’s really cool how he hesitates when he says serious things like "Until kings are philosophers," and how Glaucon talks about how people will react to these new ideas, from being amazed to thinking they’re ridiculous.

There are some problems with how the plan for sharing everything is explained. We don’t hear about how communism would work for the lower classes. Also, the list of forbidden relationships is confusing. A child born at one festival might marry a brother, sister, or even a parent born at another festival. Plato worries about incest but doesn’t want to say that the city would be split into families born around the same time. If we wanted to argue about it, we’d say the new rules about who can’t marry don’t make sense naturally or logically; they’re just based on when kids were born. Plato also doesn’t explain how the government could pick the fairest and best people by drawing lots. A strange phrase used to describe the age "five-and-twenty" might come from a poet.

When Plato describes a philosopher, his examples about philosophy being like love make more sense to Glaucon, who enjoys life, than to people today. Some examples are joking, but they still have some truth. The idea that science is a whole thing is still true today, both for learning by experience and for deep thinking. Loving universal knowledge is still what makes a philosopher, back then and now.

At the end of the fifth book, Plato introduces the idea of "contingent matter," which has had a big impact on modern ethics and religion. This idea shows up for the first time in philosophy here. Plato didn’t notice that different levels of knowledge don’t match up with things in the real world. For him, every word had to match an idea, and he couldn’t imagine an opinion about nothing. Using analogies made him create "parallels and conjugates" and miss some facts.
