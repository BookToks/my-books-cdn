I will; first, tell me, do you agree that it is right for people to obey their rulers?

I do.

But are rulers always right, or do they sometimes make mistakes?

They can make mistakes.

So, when they make laws, sometimes the laws are good, and sometimes they are not?

True.

When the laws are good, they match the rulers’ interests; when they are wrong, they go against their interests. You agree with that?

Yes.

And the people must obey these laws, and that is what you call justice?

Of course.

So, according to you, justice is not just doing what benefits the stronger people, but also the opposite?

What do you mean? he asked.

I’m just repeating what you said. But think about it: we agreed that rulers can be wrong about what is good for them, and that obeying them is justice. Isn’t that right?

Yes.

Then you must admit that sometimes justice is not about doing what’s best for the stronger people, because the rulers might accidentally order things that hurt themselves. So, if justice means obeying the rulers, doesn’t that mean the weaker people have to do things that harm the stronger people?

Nothing is clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus.

Yes, said Cleitophon, if you agree to be his witness.

But there’s no need for a witness, said Polemarchus, because Thrasymachus himself admits that rulers sometimes order things that are not good for themselves, and when people obey those orders, it is injustice.
