This is how studying the number one helps the mind think about real truth.

And it’s clear that one thing can be both a single thing and unlimited at the same time.

Yes, I said. If that’s true for one, it must be true for all numbers.

Definitely.

And all math and calculations deal with numbers?

Yes.

And they seem to help the mind find truth?

Yes, in a very impressive way.

So this kind of knowledge is what we need. It has two uses: for war and for philosophy. A soldier must learn about numbers to organize his troops, and a philosopher must learn them to understand true reality. So, he must know arithmetic.

That’s true.

And our guardian is both a soldier and a philosopher?

Yes.

Then this kind of knowledge should be required by law. We should make sure the important people in our state learn arithmetic, not just a little, but deeply until they understand numbers with their minds alone. Not like merchants who study to buy and sell, but for war and the soul itself. Because this is the easiest way for the soul to move from change to true being.

That’s great, he said.

Yes, I said, and now that I’ve talked about it, I must add how amazing this science is! It helps us reach our goal in many ways if it’s studied like a philosopher, not like a shopkeeper!

How do you mean?
