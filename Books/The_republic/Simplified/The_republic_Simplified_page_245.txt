We won't believe that Achilles loved money so much that he took gifts from Agamemnon or that he only gave back Hector’s dead body because he got paid. He wouldn’t do it just for money.

Sure, these ideas don’t sound right.

I really like Homer, so I don’t want to say that he was disrespectful by making Achilles seem like that. I also don’t believe the story where Achilles is rude to Apollo, saying, “You’ve wronged me, terrible god. I wish I could get back at you.” Or the story where he fights the river-god, or that he cut his hair for Patroclus after already offering it to another river-god. I don’t believe he dragged Hector around Patroclus’ tomb or killed prisoners at the funeral. Achilles was smart, calm, and the son of a goddess and Peleus, who was humble. He wasn’t crazy or full of both greed and disrespect for gods and people.

You’re right, someone replied.

Let’s also refuse to believe or spread stories about Theseus, son of Poseidon, or Peirithous, son of Zeus, doing terrible crimes like rape. We shouldn’t say any hero or god’s child did such awful things unless the poets admit those acts weren’t done by them or that they weren’t really gods’ children. They can’t say both. We don’t want to teach young people that gods cause evil or that heroes are just like normal people. These ideas aren’t respectful or true because we already know evil doesn’t come from gods.

Definitely not.

These stories can also make people act worse because when they hear that gods or heroes do bad things, they start to excuse their own bad actions. They think, “If gods and their families do these things, it’s okay for me too,” since gods are supposed to be powerful and pure.
