I don’t see any reason to say that one or both of these ideas are impossible. If they were, people might call us dreamers and visionaries. Am I right?

Absolutely right.

So, if in the many ages of the past, or even right now in some faraway place we don’t know about, a perfect philosopher has been or will be put in charge of the State by a higher power, we are ready to say that our government has been, is, and will be like this whenever Philosophy is in charge. It’s not impossible; we admit it’s difficult.

I agree with you, he said.

But do you mean that most people don’t think this way?

I don’t think so, he replied.

Oh my friend, I said, don’t be hard on the crowd. They will change their minds if you gently explain things to them without being aggressive. If you show them who philosophers really are and describe their character and job like you just did, people will see that philosophers aren’t what they thought before. If they understand this new view, they will change their opinion and respond differently. Who could be enemies with someone who loves them, is kind, and doesn’t feel jealous? Let me tell you, only a few people might be harsh, but not most.

I totally agree with you, he said.

And don’t you also think, like I do, that the reason many people don’t like philosophy is because of fake philosophers? They jump in where they’re not wanted, always criticizing and attacking others, and they focus on people instead of ideas. That’s the worst thing a philosopher can do.

It really is.

Because someone like me, Adeimantus, who cares about what is truly real, doesn’t waste time hating others or feeling jealous. I always look at things that don’t change and aren’t hurt or hurtful to each other, but all work together in a logical way. I try to copy that, and I will do my best to live like that.
