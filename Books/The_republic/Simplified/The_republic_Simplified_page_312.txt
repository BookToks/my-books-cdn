If a woman has the ability to lead, it’s not just because she’s a woman, and a man doesn’t have it just because he’s a man. Both men and women can have the same gifts from nature. Women want the same things men do, but in many ways, women are not as strong as men.

That’s true.

So, should we make all the rules for men but not for women?

That wouldn’t work.

Some women can heal people, and some can’t. Some are good at music, and some don’t like music.

That’s true.

Some women are good at sports or fighting, while others don’t like those things.

Definitely.

Some women love thinking deeply like philosophers, and others don’t. Some have strong spirits, and others don’t.

That’s true too.

So, some women will have the qualities of a guardian, and some won’t. Weren’t male guardians chosen based on these kinds of differences?

Yes.

Both men and women can have the qualities needed to be guardians; they just differ in how strong or weak those qualities are.

Of course.

Women who have these qualities should be chosen to work alongside men who have similar qualities and abilities.

That’s right.

And shouldn’t people with the same nature want the same things?

They should.

So, like we said before, it’s not strange to have the wives of the guardians learn music and sports.

Definitely not.
