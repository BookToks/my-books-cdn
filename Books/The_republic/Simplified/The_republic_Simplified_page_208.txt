For example, things like managing, leading, and thinking carefully—aren’t these jobs meant for the soul? Can they be given to anything else?

No, they can’t.

And isn’t life one of the main goals of the soul?

Definitely, he said.

Does the soul also have something like being excellent or good?

Yes.

Can the soul reach its goals if it doesn’t have this excellence?

No, it can’t.

So, a bad soul has to be a bad leader and manager, and a good soul has to be a good leader?

Yes, that’s true.

We said that justice is the excellence of the soul, and injustice is its flaw, right?

Yes, that’s right.

So, a just soul and a just person will live well, and an unjust person will live badly?

That’s what your point shows.

And someone who lives well is happy and lucky, while someone who lives badly is unhappy?

Of course.

So, the just person is happy, and the unjust person is miserable?

Yes.

But happiness is better and more useful than misery.

Of course.

Then, my dear Thrasymachus, injustice can never bring more benefits than justice.

Let’s leave it at that, Socrates, he said, and thanks for stopping your teasing and being nice.
