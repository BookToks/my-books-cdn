Isn’t stealing from an enemy a way for people to avoid fighting? Cowards hide around the dead bodies, pretending they’re doing their duty, and many armies have lost battles because they wanted to take stuff instead of fighting.

That’s true.

Also, isn’t it kind of greedy and disrespectful to rob a dead body? It’s like being mean and weak, making an enemy out of someone who’s already dead, while the real enemy has run away and left their gear behind. Isn’t that like a dog that can’t reach the person who attacked it, so it fights with the stones instead?

Exactly like a dog, he said.

So, should we stop stealing from the dead or stopping their burial?

Yes, definitely, he replied.

And we shouldn’t offer weapons taken from other Greeks to the gods, especially if we want to keep peace with other Greeks. In fact, offering stolen stuff from family members might even be an insult, unless a god asks for it.

That makes sense.

Now, about destroying Greek land or burning houses, what should we do?

Can I hear your opinion on that?

Both should be banned, I think. We should only take the yearly crops and nothing more. Want to know why?

Yes, please.

Well, there’s a difference between ‘discord’ and ‘war,’ and I think they are different in meaning too. Discord is about fights inside a group or family, while war is between outsiders. Discord is internal, and war is external.

That’s a good point, he said.

And can I also say that all Greeks are connected by family and friendship, and they are different from barbarians?

Very true, he said.

So, when Greeks fight barbarians, that’s real war because they’re natural enemies. But when Greeks fight each other, it’s not true war but disorder and fighting among friends, which we should call discord.
