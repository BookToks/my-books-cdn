Freedom, I said. People in a democracy always say freedom is the best thing about their country. They believe only in a democracy can a free person live.

Yes, everyone talks about that, he said.

I was going to say that wanting too much freedom and ignoring other important things can cause problems in a democracy. This can lead to people wanting a tyrant to take control.

How does that happen?

When a democracy wants freedom too much but has bad leaders in charge, and people get tired of too much freedom, they get angry at the rulers. They call them bad names like “oligarchs” and punish them if the rulers don’t listen and share power.

Yes, that happens a lot, he said.

I said loyal citizens get called slaves who love their chains and useless people. The people want rulers and subjects to be the same, both acting like rulers and subjects at the same time. Those are the people she likes and praises. In this kind of state, can freedom have any limits?

Definitely not, he said.

Slowly, chaos starts in homes and even spreads to animals.

What do you mean?

I mean dads start acting like their kids and even fear them. Sons treat their dads like equals and don’t respect their parents. This is what they call freedom. Even servants are as good as citizens, and strangers are treated just as well.

Yes, that’s how it is, he agreed.

And there are more problems. Masters are afraid of their students and try to please them, but the students look down on their teachers. Young and old act the same. Young people compete with older ones in talking and actions. Old people act like young people and joke around instead of being serious and strict.

That’s true, he said.
