That’s mostly true, he said.

But when people drink too much and get sick a lot in a place, courts and hospitals keep opening. Doctors and lawyers start acting important because they know how much both slaves and free people care about their work.

Of course.

Still, what shows bad education more than this? Not only regular workers but also those who say they are well-educated need top doctors and lawyers. Isn’t it shameful that a man has to go somewhere else for his law and medicine because he doesn’t have any good ones at home? Then he has to put himself in the hands of others who become like lords and judges over him.

Of all things, he said, that’s the most shameful.

Would you really say that’s the worst? I asked, when you think about the next problem. Some men spend their whole lives fighting in court, either suing or being sued. They even get proud of being so argumentative! They think they’re clever by cheating and twisting the law to escape justice. And why? Just to win small points that don’t matter. They don’t realize it’s better and more honorable to live so well that they don’t need a judge at all. Isn’t that even more shameful?

Yes, he said, that is even worse.

Well, I said, needing doctors not just when you’re hurt or during a big sickness, but because you’re lazy and live like we described, filling your body with bad stuff like water and gas, like it’s a swamp. That forces smart doctors to keep making up new names for diseases like flatulence and colds. Isn’t that a disgrace too?

Yes, he said, they do give very strange and made-up names to diseases.

Yes, I said, and I don’t think those diseases existed back in the days of Asclepius, the god of healing. I guess this because in Homer’s story, the hero Eurypylus, after being wounded, drinks a mix of wine, barley, and cheese—which should cause inflammation. But the sons of Asclepius who were at the Trojan war don’t blame the woman who gave him the drink or scold Patroclus, who was helping him.
