But everything is the opposite when we talk about an unfair person. I mean big injustice, where the unfair person clearly benefits the most. You’ll understand this best if we think about the worst kind of injustice—tyranny. A tyrant uses tricks and force to take away other people’s stuff, not just a little bit at a time, but a lot all at once. This includes both important things and everyday things, private and public.

If someone was caught doing any one of these bad things alone, they would be punished and looked down on. People who do these things are called robbers, kidnappers, burglars, cheaters, and thieves. But if a person steals from everyone and also makes people slaves, instead of being called bad names, people say he is happy and lucky. Everyone hears about how he has done the worst kind of injustice and thinks he is powerful.

People criticize injustice because they are afraid they might be the victims, not because they don’t want to do wrong themselves. So, as I explained, Socrates, big injustice is stronger, freer, and more powerful than justice. Like I said before, justice benefits the stronger people, but injustice benefits the person who does it.

After Thrasymachus said all this, he wanted to leave because he had talked so much. But the others wouldn’t let him go. They wanted him to stay and explain his ideas more. I also asked him nicely to stay. I said, “Thrasymachus, your ideas are interesting! Are you going to leave before you prove if they’re true or not? Isn’t figuring out the best way to live really important?”

He asked if I cared about that question. I said it seemed like he didn’t care if we lived better or worse depending on what he said. I asked him not to keep his knowledge to himself because we were many people and would appreciate his help. I said I wasn’t convinced that injustice is more profitable than justice, even if a person could get away with it. Even if an unfair person can cheat or use force, I don’t think that proves injustice is better, and maybe others feel the same way as me.
