The law we made back then was natural and possible, not just a dream. The way things are done now actually goes against nature.

That seems true.

First, we had to think about whether our ideas could work, and then if they were the best for everyone.

Yes.

And it’s been agreed that they can work?

Yes.

Next, we need to prove that they are really helpful.

Definitely.

You’ll admit that the same education that makes a man a good guardian will also make a woman a good guardian, since men and women are basically the same by nature?

Yes.

I want to ask you a question.

What is it?

Would you say all men are equally good, or is one better than another?

The second one.

And in the country we are creating, do you think the guardians trained by our system will be better people than the cobblers who got a poor education?

What a silly question!

You answered me, I said. So, can we also say that our guardians are the best citizens?

By far the best.

And won’t their wives be the best women too?

Yes, definitely the best.

Is there anything better for the country than having both men and women be as good as they can be?

Nothing could be better.
