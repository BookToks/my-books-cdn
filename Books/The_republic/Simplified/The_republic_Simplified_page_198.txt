I shouldn’t.

Would you say that medicine is all about getting paid just because a doctor charges fees when helping someone?

Of course not.

And we agreed that the good of each skill belongs especially to that skill?

Yes.

So, if there’s any good thing all artists have in common, it must come from something they all use together?

True, he said.

And when an artist gets paid, that payment comes from another skill, the skill of getting paid, which isn’t the artist’s own skill?

He agreed, but wasn’t very sure.

So, the money artists get doesn’t come from their own skills. The truth is, while the skill of medicine gives health, and the skill of building makes houses, another skill takes care of payment. Different artists do their own work and benefit from it, but would they get anything if they weren’t paid?

I guess not.

But does that mean they don’t do good when they work for free?

No, they still do good.

So now, Thrasymachus, it’s clear that neither skills nor governments work just for themselves. Like we said before, they rule and take care of the weaker people, not the stronger ones — they focus on the good of those they lead, not themselves.

And this is why, Thrasymachus, no one really wants to be a ruler. Because no one likes to fix problems that aren’t theirs without getting paid. A true leader doesn’t think about themselves, but always about the people they lead. So, rulers have to be paid in one of three ways: money, honor, or punishment for refusing.

What do you mean, Socrates? asked Glaucon. The first two ways to pay make sense, but I don’t understand how a punishment can be a kind of payment.
