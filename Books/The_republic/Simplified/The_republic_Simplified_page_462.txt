Would Homer want copying to be the main goal of his life, like he had nothing better inside him?

I don’t think so.

A real artist, who understands what he’s copying, cares about real things, not just copies. He wants to leave behind many good works that show who he really is. Instead of writing praise for himself, he’d rather be the reason people admire and talk about him.

Yes, he said, that would bring him much more honor and benefit.

Then I said, we should ask Homer some questions—not about medicine or other skills his poems mention by chance. We’re not asking if he healed people like the doctors of his time, or started a school for medicine. But since his poems focus a lot on war, politics, and education—the most important topics—we have a right to ask him about those.

“Friend Homer,” we say to him, “if what you say about being a good person is mostly true, and you’re not just making up stories, and if you know what makes people better or worse in private life or public life, tell us: did any city become better because of your advice? The good order of Sparta is thanks to Lycurgus, and many other cities were helped by their leaders. But who says you helped govern any city? Italy and Sicily talk about Charondas, and we know Solon among us; but what city can say it owes anything to you? Is there any city you could name?”

I think not, said Glaucon; not even Homer’s own family claims he was a lawgiver.

Well, but was there any war he helped win, or gave advice for, while he was alive?

There wasn’t.

Or did he invent anything useful for the arts or life, like Thales from Miletus or Anacharsis the Scythian, or other smart people did, that is linked to him?

Absolutely nothing.

But if Homer didn’t do any public service, was he a private teacher or guide? Did he have friends who loved to be around him and passed down a special way of life like Pythagoras did? Pythagoras was famous for his wisdom, and his followers are still known today for the order named after him.
