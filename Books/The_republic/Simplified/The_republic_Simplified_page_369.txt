He said,

"You know, when a person looks at things in the dark, where only the moon and stars are shining, their eyes see dimly and almost can’t see clearly. They don’t seem to have clear vision.

That’s true.

But when their eyes look at things in the sunlight, they see clearly and can see well?

Definitely.

The soul is like the eye: when it focuses on what is true and real, it understands and shines with intelligence. But when it looks at things that are always changing and disappearing, it only has opinions and goes back and forth, not really understanding.

Exactly.

Now, the thing that gives truth to what we know and the power to know it is what I want you to call the idea of good. You should think of this as the cause of knowledge and truth, as far as truth can be known. It is also beautiful, just like truth and knowledge are beautiful, but you should think of this as more beautiful than either one. And just like light and sight are like the sun but are not the sun itself, knowledge and truth are like the good, but not the good itself. The good is even more important and honored.

What a wonderful kind of beauty that must be, he said, if it creates knowledge and truth but is even more beautiful than them. You surely don’t mean that pleasure is the good?

God forbid, I replied. But may I ask you to think about the idea in a different way?

In what way?

You would agree, wouldn’t you, that the sun is not only the source of light for all visible things, but also the source of growth and life, even though the sun itself doesn’t grow?

Certainly.

In the same way, the good may be said to be not only the source of knowledge for all things known, but also the source of their existence and essence, yet the good is not the essence itself. It is far above essence in importance and power.
