How can someone be both wise and innocent? When a person is young, they often get tricked by bad people because they don’t know much about evil. That’s why a judge should be older; they should have been innocent when they were young but learned about evil by watching others, not by doing bad things themselves. This is the best kind of judge. A criminal who becomes a detective is very suspicious, but when they’re with good people who have experience, they make mistakes because they think everyone is as bad as they are. Bad people can understand good people, but good people can’t understand bad people.

In our State, medicine and law will work like healing arts to help good people. But bad bodies will be left to die by medicine, and bad souls will be punished by law. The need for medicine and law will be much less because good music will bring peace to the soul, and good exercise will keep the body healthy. Music and exercise don’t just help the body and soul separately; both are important for the soul. Music calms the soul, and exercise wakes it up and keeps it strong. Together, they help our guardians balance their two sides. If someone does too much exercise, they become rough and mean. If they do too much music, they become weak.

When a person listens to music all the time, the strong part of their soul slowly disappears, and they lose their passion. Too little passion makes someone tired quickly; too much passion makes them nervous and angry. Exercise makes an athlete brave, but if they do only exercise, they get dumb and act like wild animals, ready to fight but not to think. People have two sides: reason and passion. Music and exercise match these two sides. The person who mixes them perfectly is the true musician and will be the wise leader of our State.

The next question is, who should be the rulers? Older people must lead younger people, and the best elders should be the best guardians. The best guardians are those who love their people the most and believe their happiness is connected to the State’s welfare. We must carefully choose these guardians. They must be watched all their lives to make sure they don’t change their minds because of pleasure or pain. Time, persuasion, and love of fun might make someone give up their beliefs, and sadness or suffering might force them to change. That’s why our guardians must be tested many times, like gold is tested in fire. They must face danger and pleasure and come through all tests strong and pure, fully in control of themselves and their beliefs, ready to serve their country. These guardians will earn the highest respect in life and death. (It might be better to call only this special group "guardians," and the young men "auxiliaries.")
