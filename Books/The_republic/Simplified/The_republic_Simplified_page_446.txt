Yes.

But just now, we saw that what is neither moving nor resting is something in between.

Yes.

So how can we be right in thinking that when pain stops, that’s pleasure, or when pleasure stops, that’s pain?

That can’t be true.

This is just how things seem, not how they really are. Rest feels like pleasure compared to pain, and pain feels bad compared to pleasure. But when you check carefully, these feelings aren’t real pleasure—they’re kind of tricks.

That makes sense.

Look at other kinds of pleasures that don’t come after any pain. Then you won’t think, like you might now, that pleasure is only when pain ends, or that pain is just the opposite of pleasure.

What kind are those? And where can I find them?

There are many. For example, the pleasure of nice smells is very strong but doesn’t come after any pain. They happen quickly and don’t leave pain behind when they go.

That’s mostly true.

So, let’s not believe that real pleasure is just when pain stops or that pain is just the opposite of pleasure.

No.

Still, most of the stronger pleasures we feel through our bodies usually happen because they relieve pain.

That’s true.

And the way we expect future pleasures or pains works the same way?

Yes.

Can I give you an example?

Let me hear it.

You’d agree that in nature there’s an upper, lower, and middle region?
