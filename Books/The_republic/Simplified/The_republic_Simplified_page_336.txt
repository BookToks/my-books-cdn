How do you tell them apart? he asked.

The people who love sounds and sights, I said, like beautiful tones, colors, shapes, and all the things made from them, but they can’t see or love true, perfect beauty.

That’s true, he said.

Only a few people can see that.

Very true.

And what about someone who likes beautiful things but doesn’t understand true beauty, or someone who is shown true beauty but can’t really follow it? I wonder, are they awake or just dreaming? Think about it: isn’t a dreamer, whether asleep or awake, someone who mixes up things and mistakes copies for the real thing?

I’d definitely say that person is dreaming.

But what about someone who knows true beauty exists and can tell the difference between the idea of beauty and the things that show it? They don’t mix the idea with the objects or the objects with the idea. Is that person dreaming, or awake?

They are wide awake.

Can we say that the person who truly knows has knowledge, and the other person only has opinions?

Definitely.

But what if the person with just opinions argues with us and disagrees? Can we give them any advice without making them realize that their thinking is confused?

We should definitely give them some good advice, he said.

Okay, let’s think of what to say to them. Should we start by telling them they are welcome to whatever knowledge they have, and that we’re happy they have it? But then we should ask them a question: Does someone who has knowledge actually know something or nothing? (You have to answer for them.) I say they know something.

Something that is or isn’t?

Something that is; because how can you know something that doesn’t exist?

And after thinking about it from many angles, are we sure that true being can be known for sure, but something that doesn’t exist at all can’t be known at all?
