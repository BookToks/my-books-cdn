Our argument shows that the ability to learn is already in the soul. Just like the eye can’t see light without the whole body turning, the part of us that understands can only move from the changing world to the world of true being by the whole soul turning. Learning happens step by step until we can see the brightest and best things, which means understanding what is good.

That’s true.

So, isn’t there some skill or method that can help this turning happen in the easiest and fastest way? Not creating the ability to see, because it’s already there, but turning it back toward the truth instead of away from it?

Yes, he said, that kind of skill probably exists.

Other qualities of the soul are like things in the body. Even if they aren’t there at first, they can be built up by practice and habit. But wisdom is different—it has a divine part that always stays. When the soul turns the right way, wisdom becomes useful and helpful; if not, it can be harmful and useless. Haven’t you noticed how a clever criminal has sharp intelligence? He sees clearly how to get what he wants. He’s not blind at all, but his sharp mind is used for bad things, and the worse he is, the smarter he seems.

That’s true, he said.

But what if, when they were young, people like that were cut off from pleasures like eating and drinking, which weigh them down like heavy weights and make their souls look only at low things? What if they were freed from those things and turned the other way? Then, the same ability in them would see the truth as clearly as their eyes now see what they look at.

Very likely.

Yes, I said. And there’s another thing that probably must be true based on what we just talked about: neither people who don’t know the truth nor those who never finish learning will be good leaders. The first group has no clear purpose for their actions, both private and public. The second group won’t act at all unless forced, thinking they are already living in a perfect place.

That’s true, he replied.

Then I said, our job as the founders of the State is to make sure the best minds reach the knowledge we’ve shown to be the greatest of all. They must keep climbing higher until they reach the ultimate good. But once they get there and see enough, we can’t let them act like they do now.
