Right now, the governors treat the people badly because of reasons I already mentioned. The governors and their friends, especially the young men in charge, live a life of luxury and laziness. They don’t do anything and can’t handle pleasure or pain well.

That’s true.

They only care about making money and don’t care at all about being good or virtuous.

Yes, they really don’t care.

This is how things are with them. Often, rulers and their people get in each other’s way, like when traveling, on a pilgrimage, or during a march. Sometimes they fight together as soldiers or sailors. They even see how each other acts in dangerous moments. When there’s danger, the poor are scared and look down on the rich. The tough, sunburned poor man might fight next to a rich man who’s never worked hard and looks soft. When the poor man sees the rich man struggling, he might think that rich people are only rich because no one dares to challenge them. And when these people meet in private, won’t they say, “Our fighters aren’t really that good”?

Yes, I know that’s what they say.

Just like when a sick body can get worse from a small touch, or even get sick inside without any outside cause, a weak State can get into trouble easily. Sometimes one side brings in their powerful friends, and the other side brings in theirs, and then the State starts fighting itself. Sometimes it even gets upset without any clear reason.

Yes, definitely.

Then democracy happens after the poor win against their enemies, killing some and sending some away. They give the rest equal freedom and power. In this kind of government, leaders are often chosen by lottery.

Yes, that’s how democracy works, whether it happens because of fighting or because the other side gave up out of fear.

And now, what kind of life do they live, and what kind of government do they have?
