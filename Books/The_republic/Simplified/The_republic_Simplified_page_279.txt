I would let the State grow only as much as it can stay united; I think that’s the right limit.  

Very good, he said.  

Now, I said, here’s another rule we need to tell our leaders: Our city should not be too big or too small, but just right and able to take care of itself.  

And really, I said, this isn’t a hard rule to follow.  

The other rule we talked about before is even easier—the idea that if the children of the guardians aren’t as good, they should move down, and if the children of regular people are better, they should move up to be guardians. The goal is for everyone to do the job they’re naturally best at, so each person focuses on their own work, and the whole city works as one team.  

Yes, he said, that’s not too hard.  

The rules we’re making, my friend Adeimantus, aren’t big or complicated ideas, but small things that are really important if we pay attention—things that might seem small but are enough for what we need.  

What are those? he asked.  

Education and how people are raised, I said. If our citizens get good education and grow up to be smart and sensible, they will understand these rules easily, along with other things I didn’t mention, like marriage, sharing women, and having children. All these will follow the main idea that friends share everything.  

That sounds like the best way to handle these things.  

Also, I said, once the State starts off well, it will keep getting stronger, like a wheel rolling faster. Good education and upbringing create good habits, and these habits get better over time and even affect how people’s children turn out.  

That’s very possible, he said.  

So to sum up: this is what our leaders should focus on most—keeping music and gym class (gymnastics) exactly as they are, without changing anything. They must work hard to keep them perfect. And if anyone says people should listen to the newest songs, they should be careful because that might mean a new kind of music, which is dangerous for the whole State and should not be allowed.
