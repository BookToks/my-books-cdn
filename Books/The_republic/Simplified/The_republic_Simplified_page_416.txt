The government is like the person who lives in it.

He said it clearly.

First, aren’t people free? And isn’t the city full of freedom where anyone can say and do what they want?

“Yes, that’s true,” he answered.

And if there is freedom, then each person can live their own life however they want?

Definitely.

So in this kind of country, there will be many different kinds of people?

Yes, there will.

This kind of State seems like the most beautiful, like a fancy robe covered with all kinds of flowers. Just like how girls and kids love lots of colors, many people will think this State, full of different kinds of people, is the most beautiful.

Yes.

Yes, my friend, and there is no better place to find a government.

Why?

Because there is so much freedom there – they have every kind of government you can imagine. If someone wants to start a State, like we have been talking about, they should go to a democracy like going to a market where all the options are sold. Then they can pick the kind they like and build their State.

They will have plenty of choices.

And since no one has to be a leader if they don’t want to, no one has to be ruled if they don’t want to, no one has to fight in a war if they don’t want to, or make peace if they don’t want to – and since no law forces you to hold office or be a judge if you don't want to – isn’t this kind of life really enjoyable, at least for now?

For now, yes.

And isn’t it kind how they treat people who are punished sometimes?

Have you noticed how in a democracy, some people are sentenced to death or exile but still stay where they are, walking around like nothing happened – acting like heroes – and nobody cares or stops them?
