When we talk about political decisions, the main question is: How will they affect people’s happiness?

We can see that what we call “expediency” is really just doing what’s right based on the way society works. Right and truth are the highest goals for both governments and individuals. We shouldn’t forget about them just because we can’t always make people follow them. These ideas appeal to the better judgment of nations, even though sometimes they’re ignored for short-term gain. They are important words everyone uses when dealing with public issues or personal matters. You could say that the peace in Europe depends on these ideas.

Even in the most business-focused societies, ideas still matter. Great leaders often have some idealism, like Pericles learned from Anaxagoras. They know a true leader should care about more than just ambition, and that a country’s character is more important than just money and comfort. This way of thinking comes from Plato: first, citizens should do their duty, and then, if the state is well-run, their happiness will be guaranteed. Plato didn’t ignore the idea of usefulness in politics, as shown when he said “the most useful is the most honorable” and “the most sacred.”

We can notice these things: (1) The way Adeimantus’ question helps Socrates explain his ideas more deeply.

(2) The idea that a whole, complete system is the base for both politics and art. In art, this idea guides how people judge works by looking for harmony, balance, and unity, which the Greeks used a lot.

(3) The rule that a state should be small, like the traditional Greek city-states. Aristotle pointed out that Greek cities were small, and this became an important idea.

(4) The funny pictures of skinny dogs and fat sheep, or a quick boxer knocking down two big men, and patients who keep making themselves worse. Also, the joke that there’s no state except your own, or the serious joke about a leader who thinks he is six feet tall just because he’s told so, and since he can’t measure himself, we forgive his mistake because he’s too funny to be angry with.

(5) The way religion is treated lightly after making sure of two big ideas: first, that religion should be based on the highest idea of the gods, and second, that the true national or Greek character should be kept strong.
