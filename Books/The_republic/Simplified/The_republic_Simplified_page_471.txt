If you let sweet-talking poets into your poems, whether in epic or lyric style, then instead of law and reason—things everyone agrees are best—pleasure and pain will control our society.

That’s definitely true, he said.

Now that we’re back to talking about poetry, let’s explain why we decided to send away any kind of art that has the problems we mentioned before. Reason made us do it. But so she doesn’t think we’re being rude or unfriendly, let’s say there’s a long history of fights between philosophy and poetry. There are lots of examples, like sayings about “the yelping dog howling at her master,” or “a fool who talks too much,” and “wise people tricking Zeus,” and “smart thinkers who are still beggars.” There are many other signs that show they’ve hated each other for a long time.

Still, let’s promise our lovely friend and the sister arts of imitation that if she can prove she belongs in a well-run society, we’ll be happy to have her. We really like her, but we won’t ignore the truth because of that. I bet, Glaucon, you like her just as much as I do, especially when she shows up in Homer’s work?

Yes, I really do like her.

So, should I suggest that she can come back from being banished, but only if she defends herself by writing in lyric or some other kind of poetry?

Definitely.

And we can also let her supporters, who love poetry but aren’t poets themselves, speak for her in regular speech. They should show not only that poetry is enjoyable but also that it’s helpful for societies and people’s lives. We’ll listen carefully because if this is true, we all benefit—meaning, if poetry is useful as well as fun.

Absolutely, he said, we all benefit.

If her defense doesn’t work, then, my dear friend, just like anyone who loves something but holds back when it’s bad for them, we too must give her up, even though it will be hard.
