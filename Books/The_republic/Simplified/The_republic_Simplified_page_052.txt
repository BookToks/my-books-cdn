The idea to leave out temperance is just a style trick to keep things from getting boring.

There is a famous question in one of Plato’s early talks: “Are the virtues one thing or many?” The answer is that there are four main virtues, and one is the most important. This is different from Aristotle’s idea of justice, which is about fairness between people. Instead, this top virtue is about the whole idea of virtue compared to its parts. First, there’s the idea of justice or order in how people learn and behave. Then, there’s an even bigger idea of what is good when it comes to knowledge and thinking. Both ideas can be called “law,” “order,” or “harmony,” but the idea of good covers everything in time and existence, while justice only applies to humans.

Now, Socrates wants to show that a person and a state (a country) are the same. But first, he has to prove that a person’s soul has three parts. His point is that size doesn’t change what something really is. The word “just” means the same whether it’s about a person or a state. Justice means that the same three parts in a state and a person are each doing their own job. But are these parts really three or just one? This is a hard question that we can’t easily answer right now, and a better answer would take too much time.

If you want a shorter explanation, you might agree that the qualities of a state come from the qualities of the people in it. For example, the Scythians and Thracians are passionate, our people are smart, and the Egyptians and Phoenicians want a lot of stuff. This is because the individuals in each group have these traits. The hard part is figuring out if these parts are one or three—like if reason, desire, and anger are separate parts or if the whole soul works together in every action. To understand this, we need to be very clear about what words mean. The same thing can’t be affected in two opposite ways at the same time. But it’s possible for a person to stand still but move their arms, or for a spinning top to stay in one spot while turning. We don’t need to list every exception; for now, let’s say opposites can’t happen in the same way at the same time. Opposites include things like agreeing and disagreeing, wanting and avoiding. One kind of desire is thirst and hunger: thirst is wanting a drink, hunger is wanting food—not a special kind of food or drink. Also, whenever we want something, it means we think it’s good. When things are related but don’t have qualities, their opposites don’t have qualities either; when they do have qualities, their opposites have them too.
