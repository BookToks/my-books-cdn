Yes, one ruler is enough.

The ruler can make the laws and set up the rules we have been talking about, and people might be willing to follow them?

Definitely.

And it’s not impossible or surprising that others should agree with what we agree on?

I don’t think so.

But we have already shown that all this, if it can happen, is definitely the best.

We have.

Now we say not only that our laws, if they could be made, would be the best, but also that making these laws, even though hard, is not impossible.

Very good.

So after a lot of effort, we have finished one topic, but there are more to talk about – like how the protectors of the government will be trained, and at what ages they should start their training.

Sure.

I didn’t talk about the tricky issues like control over women and having children, and choosing the rulers, because I knew the perfect State would be hard to accept and hard to create; but that didn’t help me much because I had to discuss all of it anyway. The women and children are already arranged, but the question about the rulers must be looked at from the very start. We said, as you remember, that the rulers should love their country, be tested by pleasure and pain, and never lose their loyalty even in hard times or danger. Anyone who failed this test would be rejected, but those who always stayed true, like pure gold tested by fire, would become rulers and get rewards in life and after death. This was what was being said, but then the conversation stopped and avoided the question because it was uncomfortable.

I remember perfectly, he said.

Yes, my friend, I said, and I was afraid to say something bold; but now I will say it – the perfect guardian must be a philosopher.
