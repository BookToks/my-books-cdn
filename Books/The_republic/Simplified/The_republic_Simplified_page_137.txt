We don’t really know how much more people working together, either with their minds or their hands, can achieve—whether in work or in learning. Science hasn’t even reached half of its potential yet. The earth’s soil, instead of getting worse, might actually become way more fertile than it is now. Machines could be much more useful and detailed than they are today. We might discover new things about how our bodies work that could change us deeply. Health could improve, and people could live longer thanks to better medicine and cleanliness. There might be peace, free time, and fun activities for everyone. Faster travel could connect far-away places on Earth. There might be amazing mental abilities that only show up during big moments in history. The East and West could come together, and all countries might share their ideas and experiences with each other. There are many other ideas like this, but it’s better to stop here.

Most people think ideas like these are too unrealistic, and scientists see them as normal.

Neither Plato nor Aristotle found the idea of sharing property hard to understand or against Greek feelings, unlike the idea of sharing wives and children.

Plato introduces a strange idea that men and women should have the same jobs and should be trained and educated the same way. Since male and female animals do the same things, why shouldn’t men and women?

But isn’t this a contradiction? We said different people have different roles, so how can men and women have the same? Doesn’t this go against the idea of dividing work? These questions come up but Plato answers them quickly. He says there is no natural difference between men and women except that men have babies and women carry them. Like with animals, talents are spread out among both sexes, even if men might be a bit stronger. The idea that it’s inappropriate for women to do the same physical exercises as men is just a habit we get used to, Plato says.

Plato breaking away from the usual ideas of his time and the East shows he thought independently.

He knows women are half of humanity and in some ways more important. For both men and women, he wants to raise women to a better status. He uses philosophy, not just feelings or tradition, to talk about this issue. In ancient Greece, the idea of womanhood was often shown in goddesses like Athene and Artemis, and in heroines like Antigone and Andromache.
