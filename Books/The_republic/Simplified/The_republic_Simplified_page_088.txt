The story has both political and philosophical meanings. The den or cave stands for the limited world of politics or law. The light of the eternal ideas is supposed to shake up the minds of those who come back to this lower world. This means their ideas are too broad to be used in real life; they think about the past and future when they need to focus on the present. The ideal cannot easily fit real life and often conflicts with it.

At first, people who return from the light can’t compete with those still living in the cave when it comes to understanding the shadows. They are laughed at and treated badly. But after some time, they see things below more clearly than those who never left the cave. The difference between a politician who becomes a philosopher and a philosopher who becomes a politician is shown by two types of bad eyesight. One is the captive who moves from darkness to light, and the other is the messenger who chooses to go down into the cave to help others. Plato doesn’t explain how the brighter light will change the people in the lower world or how the idea of good should guide politics. Like dialectic, which Glaucon asked about, Plato might say this explanation can only be given to students who understand earlier lessons.

We can see examples of this part of the story in modern politics and daily life. Among us, there have been two kinds of politicians whose vision has become flawed in two different ways.

First, there have been great men who, in Burke’s words, cared too much about big ideas. Like J.S. Mill or Burke himself, they were thinkers or philosophers before they were politicians. They studied history and used events like the English Revolution of 1688, Athenian democracy, or Roman Empire as a lens to see current events. Or maybe the lasting influence of some institution shaped how they saw things. The future Church, Commonwealth, or Society took up so much of their minds that they couldn’t see today’s politics clearly. They got caught up in big ideas like liberty, equality, the greatest happiness for the most people, or brotherhood. They stopped thinking about how these ideas must be limited in real life or balanced with human nature. They are full of light, but to them, the light is like a blurry mist or blindness. Almost everyone has met an excited but half-educated person who sees everything in the wrong way and wrong size.
