The only way to reduce the bad stuff is either to limit how much a person can use their property, or to make them take risks when they lend it out. But the rich people in charge don’t want solutions; they only care about money and don’t care about being good, just like the poorest people.

Sometimes, the rulers and the regular people come together—at festivals, trips, or battles. The poor person sees that in times of danger, they aren’t looked down on. They watch the rich person struggling and think, “Our people aren’t really strong.” Just like a sick body can get worse from a small touch or no reason at all, a city can get sick and fight hard to survive. Democracy happens when the poor win, killing some, sending some away, and giving everyone else an equal share in running the government.

Life in a democracy is like that of the democrats themselves. There is freedom and people speak their minds. Everyone does what they think is right and lives their own way. This makes lots of different kinds of people. The state is like a colorful piece of embroidery, full of different styles. Many people, like kids or women, like this mix more than real beauty or greatness. The state is not one thing but many, like a market where you can buy anything. The best part is you can do whatever you want—you can lead, ignore things, go to war, or make peace whenever you like, without caring about others.

When people are sentenced to death, they all stay alive the same; a noble person is sent away but walks the streets like a hero, and no one sees or cares about him. Also, notice how democracy ignores all our fancy ideas about education—it doesn’t care much about training leaders! The only thing it asks for is claiming to love your country. That’s democracy—a fun, wild, mixed kind of government that gives equality to everyone, whether they deserve it or not.

Now, let’s look at the individual democrat. Like the state, we’ll look at where he comes from. He is the son of a stingy rich man, who taught him to avoid unnecessary pleasures. I should explain: necessary pleasures are good things we need and can’t live without. Unnecessary pleasures don’t help us and we could stop wanting them if we learned early. For example, eating and drinking are good and needed up to a point, but too much is bad for the body and mind, and should be avoided. Too much enjoyment is called expensive pleasures, unlike the useful ones. The lazy person is a slave to these unnecessary pleasures, while the stingy rich man only cares about the necessary ones.

The stingy rich man changes into a democrat like this: the young man, raised to be careful, tries the fun things the lazy person enjoys. He meets wild friends who show him every new pleasure.
