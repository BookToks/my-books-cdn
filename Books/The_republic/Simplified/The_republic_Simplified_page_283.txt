Nothing matters to us, I said; but to Apollo, the god of Delphi, there is the order of the biggest and most important things.

Which things? he asked.

The building of temples and making sacrifices, and all the worship of gods, demigods, and heroes; also the care of the places where the dead are kept, and the rituals that must be followed by anyone who wants to please the spirits of the underworld. We don’t really know much about these things ourselves, and since we are starting a city, it would be foolish to trust anyone but our ancestor god. He is the god who sits at the center of the earth and explains religion to all people.

You’re right, and we will do what you suggest.

But where, in all this, is justice? son of Ariston, tell me where. Now that our city is ready to live in, light a candle and look closely. Bring your brother, Polemarchus, and our other friends to help us, and let’s find out where justice and injustice are, how they are different, and which one a happy person should have, whether gods and people can see it or not.

That’s nonsense, said Glaucon: Didn’t you promise to look for justice yourself because not helping justice would be wrong?

I did say that, and since you remind me, I will keep my promise; but you have to help too.

We will, he replied.

Okay, then I hope to find the answer this way: I will start by assuming that our city, if it is well ordered, is perfect.

That makes sense.

And if it is perfect, it must be wise, brave, self-controlled, and just.

That sounds clear.

And if we find some of these qualities in the city, the one we don’t find will be the leftover one?

Very good.

If there are four things, and we are looking for one, we might know the one from the start, and it would be easy; or we might know three first, and then the fourth would be the one left over.

That’s very true, he said.
