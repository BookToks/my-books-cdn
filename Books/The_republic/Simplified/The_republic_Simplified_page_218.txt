Let’s be clear and believe one thing or the other. If the poets are telling the truth, then maybe it’s better to be unfair and enjoy the benefits of being unfair. Because if we are fair, we might avoid punishment from the gods, but we won’t get the rewards that come from being unfair. But if we are unfair, and keep praying and doing bad things, the gods might forgive us, and we won’t get punished.

But there is another world below, where either we or our children will suffer for the bad things we do. Yes, my friend, that makes sense, but there are mysteries and powerful gods who can make up for wrongs. That’s what great cities believe, and the children of the gods, who were their poets and prophets, also tell us this.

So why should we choose to be fair instead of doing the worst kind of unfairness? If we can just pretend to be fair and trick people, we will do better in life and even after death, as many important people say. Knowing all this, Socrates, how can anyone who thinks they are smart or rich or important want to be fair? Or not laugh when they hear fairness being praised? And even if someone can prove fairness is best, they don’t get angry at unfair people. Instead, they forgive them because they know people aren’t fair by their own choice—unless maybe someone is inspired by a god or truly understands the truth, but no one else.

Only people who are scared, old, or weak blame unfairness. And this is proved because when they get power, they immediately become as unfair as they can.

The reason for all this, Socrates, was something we talked about at the start, when my brother and I told you how surprised we were to find that all the people who praise fairness—starting with the old heroes and going to people today—never blame unfairness or praise fairness except for the honor and rewards they bring. No one has ever explained the true nature of fairness or unfairness inside a person’s soul, where no one else can see it, or shown that fairness is the greatest good and unfairness the greatest evil inside a person. If everyone had truly believed this from when they were young, we wouldn’t have to watch each other to stop doing wrong. Instead, everyone would watch themselves, afraid to have the worst evil inside them.

I think Thrasymachus and others would seriously say, like I have, even stronger things about fairness and unfairness, but they are wrong about what fairness really is. I speak strongly like this because I want to hear your side. Please show me not just why fairness is better than unfairness, but also what fairness and unfairness do to the people who have them that make one good and the other bad.
