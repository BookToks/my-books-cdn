The time when a human is born can be understood through numbers that grow by multiplying themselves, like squared and cubed numbers. This creates three parts and four types of numbers that work well together, going up and down. These numbers are probably 3, 4, 5, and 6, where the first three are the sides of a special triangle called the Pythagorean triangle. The numbers 3 cubed, 4 cubed, and 5 cubed add up to 6 cubed, which is 216.

Starting with 3, adding a third makes 4. When combined with 5 (which is 20) and raised to the third power, this gives two kinds of harmony. The first is a square that is 400 times bigger (4 times 100) or maybe even 10,000 (100 times 100). The whole number then is 17,500, which can be seen as a square of 100, or a rectangle of 100 by 75. The other shape has one side equal to the first but is a rectangle made of a hundred numbers squared on rational lengths of a square (ignoring fractions). The side here is 5 (7 times 7 equals 49 times 100 equals 4900), and each number is one less than the perfect square that includes fractions, or less by some amount.

There are also two perfect squares with irrational lengths (the side of which is 5, so 50 plus 50 equals 100) and a hundred cubes of three (27 times 100 equals 2700 plus 4900 plus 400 equals 8000). This number represents a shape that controls the good and bad of births. When the people in charge don’t understand the law of births and marry couples at the wrong time, their children won’t be good or lucky.

Even if the best children are chosen by their parents, they won’t be worthy to take their fathers’ places. When these children become the new leaders, they will fail to care for the Muses, starting by ignoring music. This neglect will spread to physical training, so the young people in your state will not be well educated.

In the next generation, rulers will be chosen who can’t properly judge the qualities of different groups of people, which like in Hesiod’s story, are made of gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Iron will mix with silver, and bronze will mix with gold, causing differences, unfairness, and chaos. These problems always cause hate and war everywhere. The Muses say this is the root of all conflict, and this is their answer to us.

Yes, and we can trust that their answer is true.

Of course, I said, how could the Muses lie?

So, what did the Muses say next?

When conflict started, the two groups went different ways: the iron and bronze people wanted money, land, houses, gold, and silver. But the gold and silver people didn’t want money; they cared more about being good and following the old ways.

There was a battle between them, and in the end, they decided to divide their land and houses among individuals. They also made their friends and helpers, who used to be free, into slaves. Then they fought wars and kept watch against each other.
