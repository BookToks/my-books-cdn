We agree on everything except one thing, which we haven’t decided yet. You might remember us saying that there needs to be someone alive or a witness of the lawmaker in states. But we were scared to talk about something so hard, and now the question comes up again and it’s still not easier: How can philosophy be studied safely? Let’s bring it out into the open and finish this question.

First, I’ll say boldly that nothing is worse than how people study philosophy now. Usually, people learn a little philosophy when they are young and only during free time, but they never really understand the true challenge, which is dialectic (the art of discussion and reasoning).

Later on, maybe they go to some philosophy lectures. Years pass, and the light of philosophy, unlike the sun in Heracleitus’s story, goes down and never comes back up.

This way of learning should be changed; it should start with physical exercise when young, and as a person grows stronger, they should train their soul more. Then, when active life is over, they can finally return to philosophy.

“You are serious, Socrates, but the world will fight you just as hard as Thrasymachus did.” Don’t make a fight between Thrasymachus and me—he was always my enemy but now we’re good friends. I will do my best to convince him and everyone else about the truth of what I say, or at least prepare for the future when, in another life, we can have similar talks again.

“That will be a long time from now.” Not long compared to forever. Most people probably won’t believe it because they have never seen ideas come together naturally, only fake combinations; not free and kind thoughts, but tricks and arguments about laws. They have never known a perfect person ruling a perfect state, not even one.

We expected that no perfect state or person could exist until philosophers— not bad ones, but those we called the useless class—were forced to hold office; or until the children of kings truly loved philosophy. Whether in the endless past, some faraway place, or in the future, we strongly believe there has been, is, and will be a state ruled by the spirit of philosophy.

Will you say the world thinks differently? Oh, friend, don’t hate the world! People will soon change their minds if they are treated kindly and taught what a true philosopher really is. Who can hate someone who loves them? Or be jealous of someone who feels no jealousy?

Remember, most people hate not the true philosophers but the fake ones—those who push their way in without being invited and always talk about people, not ideas, which is against the spirit of philosophy. True philosophers hate fights and focus on the eternal order, shaping themselves into the Divine image (not just themselves but others too), creating both private and public virtues.

When people see that the happiness of states comes only from that image, will they be mad at us for trying to describe it? “Certainly not. But how will you describe it?”

The artist does nothing until they wipe the slate clean; then they write the constitution of a state on it, often looking at the divine truth of nature. From that, they find the godlike qualities among people, mix these two parts, erase and paint again, until there is perfect balance between the divine and human.
