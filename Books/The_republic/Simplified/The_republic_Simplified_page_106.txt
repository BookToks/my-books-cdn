Love pushes them forward; they have to get what they want by force or lying, or else they become painful and annoying. As new pleasures take over old ones, the son will take his parents’ stuff. If they try to say no, he will cheat and trick them. And if they fight back openly, what then? I can only say, I wouldn’t want to be in their place.  

But wow, Adeimantus, to think that for some new, pointless love, he will give up his own father and mother, the best and closest friends, or make them slaves to his latest wishes! A son like that is a real nightmare for his parents! When he can’t get anything more from them, he turns into a thief or even robs a temple. Love controls his youth’s thoughts, and he becomes the monster he sometimes is in dreams. He grows strong in violence and lawbreaking and is ready to do anything bold to get what his gang needs.  

In a well-ordered country, there are only a few like this, and during war, they become soldiers for a tyrant. But in peace, they stay home and cause trouble; they are the thieves, muggers, pickpockets, kidnappers of the community. Or if they can talk well, they lie in court and snitch on people.  

“That’s a long list of crimes, even if only a few do them.” Yes, I said, but small and big are relative words, and none of their crimes compare to the tyrant’s crimes. This group grows strong and many, and they create the tyrant from among themselves. If the people give in, fine, but if they fight back, then just like the son beat his parents, he beats his country and puts his soldiers over it.  

These men start by hanging out with flatterers, and they flatter others to get what they want; but once they don’t need their followers, they ditch them. They are always either bosses or servants—true friendship is unknown to them. They are very dishonest and unfair, if we really understand what justice means. They make our worst nightmares real; and the one who is the most tyrant by nature, living the longest as a tyrant, will be the worst of all—and the most miserable.  

Like a person, like a country—the tyrant’s personality matches tyranny, which is the complete opposite of a perfect country; one is the best, the other the worst.  

But which one is happier? Even though the tyrant looks powerful and scary, sitting on his throne with his followers, let’s not be afraid to ask; the answer is that kingship is the happiest, and tyranny is the most miserable kind of country.  

And can’t we ask the same about the people themselves? We need someone who really understands people, and isn’t scared by the fake confidence of a tyrant. I’ll assume it’s someone who has lived with a tyrant and seen him at home or in times of trouble and danger.  

Assuming we judge fairly, let’s start by comparing an individual and a country, and ask first if the country will be free or enslaved—won’t there be a little freedom and a lot of slavery?
