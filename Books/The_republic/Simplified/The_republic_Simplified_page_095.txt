Just like a country, a person has friends and enemies inside and outside themselves. There are temptations from the world and feelings inside. There’s also reason and influence from parents and friends, which try to keep things in order. These two sides fight hard against each other.

Sometimes, the side that wants order wins. But then new wants and problems come up, and all the wild feelings take over the mind, which is left empty and unprotected by true thoughts and actions. Lies and fake ideas take control. The person goes back to a lazy, careless way of living and stays there openly.

If older, wiser people try to help, these fake feelings shut the door and won’t let them in. A battle happens, and the fake feelings win. Then they team up with desires, pushing out modesty, which they call foolish, and send self-control away.

When the mind is cleaned out, the bad habits come back dressed up differently. Rudeness is called being well-mannered, chaos is freedom, wastefulness is fancy, and being bold is courage. This is how young people move from necessary pleasures to unnecessary ones.

After some time, they spend equal time on both kinds of pleasures. Maybe when they get older and their strong feelings calm down, they bring back some self-control and live in balance, switching between pleasures. If reason tells them that some pleasures are good and honorable while others are bad, they just shake their heads and say they can’t tell the difference.

So they live in the moment—sometimes drinking, then stopping; sometimes exercising, then doing nothing; sometimes wanting to be a thinker or leader, then wanting to be a fighter or businessman. They try everything but never stick to one thing.

The last and worst fall for people and countries is tyranny and the tyrant. Tyranny comes from democracy just like democracy comes from oligarchy. Both happen because of too much of something—too much wealth or too much freedom.

Democrats say, "The best thing in life is freedom." Loving freedom too much, while ignoring everything else, causes democracy to turn into tyranny.

The country wants lots of freedom, and if its rulers don’t give enough, the people punish and insult them. Equality and friendship between rulers and people are the rules.

Anarchy becomes the law, not just for the country but inside homes, even affecting animals. Fathers and sons, citizens and strangers, teachers and students, old and young are all equal. Fathers and teachers are afraid of their sons and students, and young people’s ideas compete with older people’s. The old copy the young’s cool style because they don’t want to seem boring.
