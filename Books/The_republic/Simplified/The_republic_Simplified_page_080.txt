All we have left is the basic science that everything else depends on, which is numbers or math. ‘That’s true.’ Even the art of war? ‘Yes, definitely.’ So it’s kind of funny that in the play, Palamedes comes in and says he invented numbers and counted the soldiers. Because if Agamemnon couldn’t count his troops (and how could he without numbers?), he wouldn’t be a very good leader. No one should be a soldier if they can’t count, and honestly, they’re hardly even human. But I’m not just talking about using math in real life. I think numbers help us think and understand the world.

Let me explain what I mean: There are two kinds of things we can see. One kind makes our mind active and curious, while the other kind just lets our mind accept what it sees. The things that make us think are those that show differences and relationships. For example, if I hold up three fingers—a pointer, a middle finger, and a pinky—our eyes see all three, but without numbers, we can’t tell them apart properly. Or if we see two things, one big and one small, the ideas of big and small don’t come from our senses but from our minds. Seeing these differences makes our mind work harder because our senses give us confusing signals, and then we use numbers to figure out if there is one thing or more than one. Numbers tell us there are two, not one, so we can see they’re different.

Also, when we look around, we see big and small things in a messy jumble, and only when we separate them do we start to ask about what they really are. This leads us to understand the difference between what we see and what we understand. That’s what I meant when I talked about things that make the mind think: it’s about the contradictions we notice when we look at things. For example, the idea of ‘one,’ like a finger, doesn’t make us think unless we also think about ‘more than one.’ When one is also the opposite of one, the contradiction makes us reflect. This happens with anything we see.

Numbers also lift our mind up; they help us move past the changing world and think about something real and steady. Numbers have smaller uses, like in the military or business, but we don’t need those here. Still, since our protector should be both a soldier and a thinker, the military use can stay. For our higher goals, no science fits better, but we have to study it like a philosopher, not like a shopkeeper.

Numbers aren’t about things we can see but about pure ideas. Real math people even get upset if you try to divide a number because their idea of ‘one’ can’t be split. When you divide, they say you’re just multiplying. Their ‘one’ isn’t a thing you can break into parts but a perfect and always equal idea. This shows that math is all about the mind.

Math is also great for sharpening your brain. No other subject is as tough or tests your general ability as well, or helps a slow thinker improve so much.

Now let’s move on to our second subject: geometry.
