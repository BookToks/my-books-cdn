And the most beautiful is also the loveliest?  

That seems right.  

A person who loves harmony will love the loveliest, but would he love someone with a messy soul?  

That’s true, he answered, if the problem is in the soul; but if someone just has a physical flaw, he will be patient and love them anyway.  

I see, I said, you’ve experienced this, and I agree.  

But let me ask you another question: Does having too much pleasure fit with self-control?  

How could it? he replied; pleasure can stop a person from thinking clearly, just like pain can.  

Does it have anything to do with being a good person?  

Not at all.  

Does it relate to being wild and careless?  

Yes, very much.  

Is there any stronger or more exciting pleasure than love based on attraction?  

No, nothing is stronger or crazier.  

But true love is about beauty and order—self-controlled and balanced?  

Exactly, he said.  

So no wildness or craziness should be allowed near true love?  

Definitely not.  

Then wild or uncontrolled pleasure must never come near the lover and the one they love; neither of them can be part of it if their love is the right kind?  

No, Socrates, it must never come near them.  

Then I think that in the city we are building, there should be a rule that a friend treats their love only as a father treats his son, and only for a good reason, and only if the other person agrees first. This rule should limit how they act, and if someone goes too far, they should be seen as rude and having bad taste.  

I totally agree, he said.
