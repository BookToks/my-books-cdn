Glaucon agreed with that.

Yes, I said. We also agreed that when the leaders are chosen, they will take their soldiers and put them in houses like the ones we talked about. These houses are shared by everyone and don’t have any private or personal stuff. And remember what we agreed about their property?

Yes, I remember. No one was supposed to have normal possessions like other people. They were going to be warrior athletes and protectors, and instead of getting paid every year, they would only get what they needed to live from the other citizens. They had to take care of themselves and the whole State.

That’s right, I said. Now that we finished this part, let’s find where we got off track so we can go back.

It’s easy to go back. You said before, just like now, that you finished describing the State. You said that State was good, and the person who fits it was good too. But you also said there were even better things to talk about about the State and people. You said if this State was the true kind, then the others were false. You mentioned there were four main false types, and their problems, along with the problems of the people who fit them, were worth looking at. After we saw all the people and agreed on who was best and who was worst, we were going to think about whether the best person was also the happiest, and the worst the most unhappy. I asked you about the four types of government you talked about, and then Polemarchus and Adeimantus joined in. You started again and got to where we are now.

Your memory is very accurate, I said.
