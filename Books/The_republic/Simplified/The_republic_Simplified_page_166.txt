His ideas about language and numbers come from Plato; like Plato, he criticizes drama. He also says that even if he lived twice as long, he still wouldn’t have enough time to read all the lyric poets.

He translates Plato’s description of democracy exactly, even though he hadn’t really shown he could understand Plato’s humor. He changes a funny story about animals who are so full of the spirit of democracy that they make people move out of their way into a serious sentence. His description of a tyrant copies Plato’s but is much worse. The second book is about history and praises the Roman constitution, which he sees as perfect. He uses facts to support this, similar to what Plato probably wanted to do in his own work.

His best copy of Plato is the vision of Er, which Cicero turned into the 'Somnium Scipionis' (Scipio’s Dream). He made the story more Roman and added an argument for the soul living forever, taken from other works by Plato. Although it’s a beautiful story with great parts, the 'Somnium Scipionis' is much weaker than Plato’s vision of Er. It’s just a dream and doesn’t really seem like the writer truly believes in it. Whether his dialogues were based on lost works by Aristotle, as he says, or on Plato’s, which they look like on the surface, he is still a Roman speaker. He isn’t having a real conversation but giving speeches and never makes Latin sound as smooth and natural as Greek in Plato’s dialogues. If his style is weak, his ideas are even weaker; he never seems like a deep thinker in his philosophy.

People say Plato’s Republic is more like a church than a real state. This perfect city in the sky has always been an idea in the Christian world, shown in St. Augustine’s 'City of God.' This book came after the Roman Empire fell, just like we can imagine Plato’s Republic was influenced by the decline of Greek politics back then. The difference is that Plato’s time saw a slow and steady fall, while Rome’s fall felt like an earthquake to St. Augustine’s world. People then thought Rome fell because the old Roman gods were angry that people stopped worshiping them.

But St. Augustine disagrees. He says Rome fell not because Christianity rose, but because of the bad behavior of paganism. He looks at Roman history and Greek myths and finds crime, disrespect, and lies everywhere. He compares the worst parts of pagan religions to the best parts of Christian faith. He doesn’t show the kind of spirit that made other early Christian writers see divine truth in Greek philosophers’ works. He studies the history of God’s kingdom (the Jewish story in their scriptures) and the kingdoms of the world (found in non-Jewish writers) and follows both into an ideal future.
