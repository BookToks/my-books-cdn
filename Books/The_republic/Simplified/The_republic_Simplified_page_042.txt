They are not examples we should copy exactly because language should get clearer with each generation. Like Shakespeare, they were great even though their way of expressing things wasn’t perfect. But there’s no reason to go back to the confusing style that was common when literature was just starting out. The English poets from the last century were clear, and we shouldn’t lose what they achieved or go back to the older, less clear times before them. Our ideas today haven’t gotten ahead of language; the problem is that we don’t have Plato’s skill in balancing ideas and words.

In the third book of the Republic, Plato comes closest to explaining his thoughts about art. He says true art isn’t about fancy copying or imagination, but about being simple and ideal, showing the highest moral energy, whether in action or calm moments. Living with or listening to this kind of art is the best influence—it creates a good environment, like the true Greek one, where young people should grow up. This helps them develop a natural good taste that feels truth and beauty in everything. Even though poets are to be kicked out, art is still seen as part of reason—like love in the Symposium—and helps with early education by shaping habits. This idea of art isn’t just about music or sculpture but is found everywhere in nature and connected to many things. Plato’s Republic, like Athens under Pericles, focuses on both art and politics.

Plato hardly talks about creative arts. Only a few times does he mention them. He wasn’t amazed by the great works of Phidias, the Parthenon, the Propylea, or statues of Zeus or Athena. He probably thought abstract ideas about numbers or shapes were more important than any artwork. Still, it’s hard to believe he wasn’t influenced by the art around him and that this helped shape his ideas. We only have pieces of that art now, but even broken parts show us what truth and beauty mean. However, Plato never says beauty is the goal of art; he seems to think wisdom can’t be shown in physical form and doesn’t separate fine arts from practical skills. Whether or not he felt more than he said, it’s strange that the highest achievements in fine arts happened while he barely talked about them. In one important part, he says a work of art, like a state, is a whole thing. This idea of seeing things as complete and his love for new math sciences helped guide Greek art.

Plato also makes a smart point that a doctor shouldn’t be in perfect health but should understand sickness by experience. But a judge shouldn’t have the same experience with evil; instead, he should be a good person who, after growing up innocent, learns about bad behavior later by seeing others.
