Would you say that knowledge is a skill, or what group would you put it in?

Definitely, knowledge is a skill, and the strongest skill of all.

Is opinion also a skill?

Yes, he said; because opinion is what lets us form an idea or belief.

But earlier you said knowledge is not the same as opinion?

Yes, he said: how can anyone reasonable mix up something that is always right with something that can be wrong?

That’s a great answer, showing we clearly understand the difference between them.

Yes.

So if knowledge and opinion are different skills, do they also deal with different topics?

That’s right.

The topic of knowledge is “being,” and knowledge is about understanding what “being” is?

Yes.

And opinion is about having an idea or belief?

Yes.

Do we really know what we have an opinion about? Or is the topic of opinion the same as the topic of knowledge?

No, he answered, that has already been proven wrong; if different skills mean different topics, and if opinion and knowledge are different skills, then their topics can’t be the same.

So if “being” is the topic of knowledge, then opinion must be about something else?

Yes, something else.

Well then, isn’t “being” the topic of opinion? Or how can someone have an opinion about something that doesn’t exist? Think about it: when someone has an opinion, isn’t it always about something? Can someone have an opinion about nothing?

Impossible.
