So, because of the dog of Egypt, we have been getting rid of bad stuff in the State without even realizing it, even though we used to call the State fancy and spoiled.

And we did a smart thing, he said.

Then let’s finish cleaning it up, I said. Next, we should deal with rhythms, which come after harmonies. They should follow the same rules. We shouldn’t try to make things too complicated with different meters, but instead find rhythms that show a brave and balanced life. When we find those rhythms, the rhythm and melody should match the words' feeling, not the other way around.

You need to tell me what these rhythms are because you already taught me about harmonies.

But he said, I can’t really tell you. I only know there are about three main rhythm types that make up meters, just like there are four notes that make up harmonies. That’s what I noticed. But I don’t know what kinds of lives each rhythm copies.

Then I said, we should ask Damon about this. He can tell us which rhythms show bad feelings like meanness or anger, and which ones show good feelings. I think I remember he talked about a tricky Cretic rhythm, also dactylic or heroic rhythms, and he arranged them in a way I don’t fully get, making the rhythm balanced with long and short beats alternating. And if I’m right, he also mentioned iambic and trochaic rhythms with short and long beats.

Sometimes, he seemed to care just as much about how the foot moves as about the rhythm itself, or maybe both together. But I’m not sure what he meant. So, like I was saying, it’s better to ask Damon, because explaining all this is hard, you know?

But it’s easy to see that having good rhythm or bad rhythm affects whether something feels graceful or not.

Exactly.

And good or bad rhythm naturally fits with good or bad style, just like harmony and discord follow style. The main rule is that rhythm and harmony should follow the words, not the words follow them.
