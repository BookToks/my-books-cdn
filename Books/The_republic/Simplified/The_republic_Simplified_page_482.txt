This is the way to find happiness.

According to a message from another world, the prophets once said: "Even if you come last, if you choose wisely and live carefully, you can have a happy life. So, the one who chooses first shouldn’t be careless, and the one who chooses last shouldn’t give up."

When the first person stepped forward to choose, he quickly picked the worst life. His mind was clouded by foolishness and selfishness, so he didn’t think carefully. He didn’t realize that his choice would bring many troubles, including hurting his own children. Later, when he understood what he had chosen, he was very upset and regretted his decision. Instead of blaming himself, he blamed luck, the gods, and everything else.

This person had come from heaven and in a past life had lived in a good society, but his goodness was just a habit, and he didn’t really understand philosophy. Many others who came from heaven were like this—they had never faced hard times, unlike those coming from Earth, who had suffered and seen others suffer, so they were more careful when choosing.

Because of this, and since the choices were left to chance, many souls swapped good lives for bad ones, or bad lives for good ones.

If someone, as soon as they arrived in this world, had dedicated themselves to true philosophy and had been lucky with their choice, they could be happy here and in their next life. Their journey would be smooth and peaceful instead of rough and difficult.

The messenger said it was very interesting, and a little sad and funny, to watch the souls choose their next lives based on what they had experienced before.

He saw the soul of Orpheus choosing to be a swan because he hated women, who had caused his death. He saw the soul of Thamyras choosing to be a nightingale. Birds like the swan and other musicians wanted to be humans.

The soul who got the twentieth choice picked to be a lion—this was the soul of Ajax, who didn’t want to be a man because of the unfair treatment he had received. Next was Agamemnon’s soul, which chose to be an eagle because, like Ajax, he hated human nature due to his suffering.

In the middle of the choices was Atalanta’s soul; she couldn’t resist becoming an athlete again after seeing the fame that came with it. After her came the soul of Epeus, who became a clever woman. Far down the list was the soul of the jester Thersites, who became a monkey.

The soul of Odysseus still had to choose, and his lot was the very last one.
