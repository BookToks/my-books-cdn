Glaucon said, with a funny seriousness: Wow, that’s really amazing!

Yes, I said, and you can blame yourself for making me say those ideas.

Please keep going and tell us if there’s more to say about the sun comparison.

Yes, I said, there’s a lot more.

Then don’t leave anything out, even if it’s small.

I’ll try my best, I said, but I think I’ll have to leave out a lot.

I hope not, he said.

You have to imagine two main powers: one rules the world of ideas, and the other rules the world we can see. I won’t say “heaven” because I don’t want you to think I’m just playing with words. Do you understand the difference between what we can see and what we can understand with our minds?

I do.

Now imagine a line cut into two parts, one bigger than the other, and each part is divided again the same way. Let’s say the bigger part is the visible world and the smaller part is the world of ideas. If you compare the smaller parts, the first part in the visible world is made up of images.

By images, I mean shadows first, and then reflections in water or shiny surfaces. Do you get it?

Yes, I get it.

Now imagine the other part, which is only a copy of this, includes animals we see and everything that grows or is made.

Very good.

Wouldn’t you say both parts have different levels of truth, like a copy is less real than the original, just like opinion is less real than knowledge?

Definitely.

Next, think about how the world of ideas is divided.
