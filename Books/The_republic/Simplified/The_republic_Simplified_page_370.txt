Glaucon said, with a ludicrous earnestness: By the light of heaven, how amazing!
 
 Yes, I said, and the exaggeration may be set down to you; for you made me uttermyfancies.

 I will do my best, I said; but I should think that a great deal will have to be omitted.

 You have to imagine, then, that there are two ruling powers, and that one of them is set over the intellectual world, the other over the visible. I do not say heaven, lest you should fancy that I am playing upon the name (’ourhanoz, orhatoz’). MayIsupposethatyouhavethisdistinctionofthevisibleandintelligiblefixedinyourmind?
 
 Ihave.
 
 Now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts, and divide each of them again in the same proportion, and suppose the two main divisions to answer, one to the visible and the other to the intelligible, and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want of clearness, and you will find that the first section in the sphere of the visible consists of images.
 
 And by images I mean, in the first place, shadows, and in the second place, reflectionsinwaterandinsolid,smoothandpolishedbodiesandthelike: Do youunderstand?
 
 Yes,Iunderstand.
 
 Imagine,now,theothersection,ofwhichthisisonlytheresemblance,toinclude theanimalswhichwesee,andeverythingthatgrowsorismade.
 
 Verygood.
 
 Would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different degreesoftruth,andthatthecopyistotheoriginalasthesphereofopinionisto thesphereofknowledge?
 
 Mostundoubtedly.
