Damon tells me, and I really believe him, that when music styles change, the basic rules of the country always change with them.

Yes, said Adeimantus; and I agree with Damon and you.

Then, I said, our leaders should build their strong foundation on music?

Yes, he said; because the lack of rules you talked about can easily sneak in.

Yes, I answered, in the form of fun; and at first, it seems harmless.

Why, yes, he said, and it wouldn’t be harmful; if not for the fact that little by little, this freedom, finding a place, quietly spreads into habits and traditions; then, growing stronger, it breaks the agreements between people, and from agreements, it goes on to laws and governments, wildly destroying everything, Socrates, knocking down all rights, private and public.

Is that true? I asked.

That’s what I believe, he replied.

Then, as I was saying, our young people should be trained from the start with strict rules, because if fun becomes wild and the youth become wild, they can never grow up to be well-behaved and good citizens.

Very true, he said.

And when they start well in play, and with the help of music get used to good order, then this habit of order, so different from wild play, will stay with them in everything they do and help them grow, and if there are any weak spots in the country, it will help fix them.

Very true, he said.

Once educated like this, they will create new smaller rules that their teachers missed.

What do you mean?

I mean things like these: when young people should be silent before their elders; how to show respect by standing and letting them sit; what honor is owed to parents; what clothes or shoes to wear; how to style hair; behavior and manners in general. You agree with me?

Yes.
