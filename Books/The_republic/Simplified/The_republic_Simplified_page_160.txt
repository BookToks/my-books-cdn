This is the best way to think about life as a whole. But Plato’s idea is not easy to put into practice. Learning for life after school is something each person has to do for themselves. People can’t be brought together in schools or colleges when they are forty or fifty years old; and even if they could, it wouldn’t work well. Most people spend their whole lives in what Plato would call "the Den," and they are okay with that.

They don’t have teachers or advisors to guide them when they get older. There is no “schoolmaster” who will point out their mistakes or inspire them to work harder or aim higher. No one like Socrates to show them what they don’t know, and no one like Christ or his followers to correct their wrongdoings. Because of this, they find it hard to improve themselves, especially to understand themselves better. The hopes they had when they were young don’t motivate them anymore; they would rather rest than chase big goals. Only a few people who have met great teachers or religious leaders get a new chance at life and find inspiration from them.

One big reason why so few people keep improving as they get older is lack of energy. They don’t have the will or don’t know how to continue learning. They never try new things or look up interesting facts by themselves. They don’t make sacrifices to gain knowledge. Their minds, like their bodies, become set in their ways at a certain age. Genius means "the power to work hard," but hardly anyone stays interested in learning for their whole life. Family problems, work, and the need to earn money make the mind less flexible. The memory, which once could hold clear thoughts and ideas, becomes crowded and less able to take in new things.

As people get older, they tend to exchange what they know rather than learn new things. They don’t feel they need to learn more; what they learned at twenty-five seems enough at fifty. It’s also hard to say exactly how someone can improve themselves. Self-education is made up of many small things — adding new ideas to what we naturally are, learning to see ourselves as others see us, judging based on facts, seeking out smarter people, studying the lives and writings of great people, watching how the world and people act, accepting the natural changes in life, thinking beyond common opinions, pursuing new questions, and trying mental challenges that bring out hidden strength.

If someone really wants to follow Plato’s idea of education for life, here is some advice: they should pick the subject they like best and enjoy the most. It can be something connected to their daily work or something very different from it.
