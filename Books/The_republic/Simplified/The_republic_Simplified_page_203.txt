Let’s talk about knowledge and ignorance in general. Do you think someone who knows a lot would want to say or do more than another person who also knows a lot? Wouldn’t they just want to say or do the same things as their equal in the same situation?

That’s hard to deny.

Now, what about someone who doesn’t know much? Wouldn’t they want to have more than both the knowledgeable and the ignorant?

I think so.

Is the person who knows a lot also wise?

Yes.

And is the wise person good?

True.

So, the wise and good person wouldn’t want to get more than someone like them, but more than someone who is different or opposite?

I guess so.

But the bad and ignorant person would want to get more than both groups?

Yes.

But didn’t we say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust person goes beyond both their own kind and others? Weren’t those your words?

They were.

And you also said that the just person wouldn’t go beyond their own kind but only their opposite?

Yes.

So, the just person is like the wise and good one, and the unjust person is like the evil and ignorant one?

That’s the conclusion.

And each person misses what belongs to their own kind?

That was agreed on.

So, the just person turns out to be wise and good, and the unjust one is evil and ignorant.

Thrasymachus agreed to all this, but not easily. It was a really hot summer day, and he was sweating a lot. Then I saw something I never saw before—Thrasymachus blushing.
