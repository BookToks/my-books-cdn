Either they give weapons to the many people, and then they are more afraid of their own people than the enemy; or, if they don’t bring them out to fight, they are really rulers of only a few, because they are too few to rule.

At the same time, they love money so much that they don’t want to pay taxes.

How shameful!

And, like we said before, in this kind of government, the same people have too many jobs – they are farmers, workers, and soldiers all at once. Does that look good?

Definitely not.

There is another problem, maybe the worst one, that this kind of State starts to have first.

What problem?

A man can sell everything he owns, and someone else can take his property; but after selling, he still lives in the city where he no longer belongs. He is not a trader, worker, soldier, or fighter anymore – just a poor, helpless person.

Yes, that is a big problem that starts in this kind of State.

This problem is not stopped there because oligarchies have both very rich people and very poor people.

True.

But think again: When a man was rich and spent his money, was he any more useful to the State as a citizen?

Or did he just seem like a ruler, but really he was neither a ruler nor a subject, just someone who wasted money?

As you said, he looked like a ruler, but was only wasting money.

Can we say that this person is like a drone in a beehive, and that he is a disaster to the city just like the drone is to the hive?

Exactly, Socrates.

And God made flying drones, Adeimantus, all without stings, but the walking drones have some without stings and others with dangerous stings; the stingless ones become poor in old age; the stingers are the criminals.

That’s very true, he said.

So, whenever you see poor people in a State, there are probably thieves, pickpockets, temple robbers, and all kinds of bad people hiding nearby.
