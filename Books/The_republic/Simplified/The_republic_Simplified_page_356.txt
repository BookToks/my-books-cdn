Won’t those ideas just sound fancy but actually mean nothing true or real?

No doubt, he said.

Then, Adeimantus, I said, the true students of philosophy will be very few: maybe some smart and well-educated person stuck away from home who stays loyal to philosophy because they aren’t influenced by bad things. Or maybe someone with a great spirit born in a bad city who ignores its politics. There might be a few talented people who give up other skills they don’t respect and come to philosophy. Or maybe some are held back by our friend Theages’ situation—everything in Theages’ life tried to stop him from loving philosophy, but being sick kept him away from politics. My own inner voice isn’t worth mentioning because almost no one else has one like it. Those few people have experienced how wonderful philosophy is, and they’ve also seen how crazy most people are. They know no politician is honest and no true champion of justice exists to follow and be saved by. 

Such a person is like someone surrounded by wild animals—they won’t join the bad behavior of the others, but they can’t fight them all alone either. So, knowing they can’t help the country or their friends and that they’d just waste their life without doing good, they stay quiet and go their own way. It’s like standing under a wall during a dust and sleet storm. Seeing everyone else full of evil, they’re happy just to live their own life, stay pure and good, and leave peacefully with hope.

Yes, he said, and that person will have done something important before they leave.

An important thing, yes; but not the most important, unless they find a country that fits them. In a country like that, they will grow bigger and save both their country and themselves.

We have now explained why philosophy has such a bad reputation: the false accusations against it have been shown. Is there anything else you want to say?

Nothing else about that, he replied; but I’d like to know which government you think fits philosophy best.

None of them, I said; and that’s exactly what I blame them for—not one is worthy of philosophy, so philosophy itself gets twisted and changed. Just like a foreign seed planted in strange soil loses its nature and changes, philosophy also loses its true form and becomes something different.
