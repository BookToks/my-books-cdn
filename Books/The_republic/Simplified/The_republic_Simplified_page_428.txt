He can’t.

So, he has to look around and find who is brave, who is proud, who is smart, who is rich; happy people are his enemies, and he has to find chances to go against them whether he wants to or not, until he cleans up the State.

Yes, he said, and it’s a harsh cleaning.

Yes, I said, not like the cleaning doctors do to the body; doctors take away the bad parts and keep the good parts, but he does the opposite.

If he is going to rule, I guess he can’t help himself.

What a terrible choice, I said: to have to live only with the many bad people and be hated by them, or not live at all!

Yes, that’s the choice.

And the worse his actions are to the citizens, the more followers and loyalty will he need?

Definitely.

And who are these loyal followers, and where will he find them?

They will come to him on their own, he said, if he pays them.

Wow! I said, here come more lazy people, from everywhere.

Yes, he said, there are.

But won’t he want the best spot?

What do you mean?

He will steal slaves from the citizens; then he will free them and make them his bodyguards.

Exactly, he said; and he will be able to trust them the most.

What a lucky guy, I said, this tyrant must be; he killed the others and has these as his trusted friends.

Yes, he said; they are just like him.

Yes, I said, and these are the new citizens he created, who like him and are his friends, while the good people hate and avoid him.

Of course.

Tragedy is really smart and Euripides was a great writer.
