I'm not saying that at all.

But if they ever have to face danger, shouldn't they do it early, so if they survive, they'll be stronger for it?

Definitely.

Whether young soldiers fight in wars or not is really important, and some risk is okay for that.

Yes, very important.

So, the first thing we should do is let kids watch war happen, but we must also make sure they are safe; then everything will be fine.

That's true.

Parents probably know war is risky, but how can anyone really tell which missions are safe and which are dangerous?

That makes sense.

And they'll choose the safer missions and be careful with the risky ones?

Exactly.

And they'll put the kids under the command of experienced veterans who will lead and teach them?

That's the right thing to do.

Still, war can be unpredictable and dangerous sometimes, right?

Yes, that's true.

So, kids need to be ready to escape quickly if things get bad.

What do you mean? he asked.

I mean we should teach kids to ride horses early, and once they can ride, take them to war on horseback. The horses shouldn't be wild or aggressive but easy to control and fast. That way, kids can see what war is like, and if there's danger, they can just follow the older soldiers and get away.

I think you're right, he said.
