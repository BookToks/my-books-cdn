I don’t think, he said, that the way could have been made shorter.

I guess not, I said; but I still think we could have understood both better if the talk had focused on just this one topic and if there weren’t a lot of other questions waiting for us. The person who wants to see how the life of a just person is different from that of an unjust person needs to think about this.

So, what’s the next question? he asked.

Surely, I said, the one that comes next in order. Since only philosophers can truly understand what is eternal and unchanging, and those who get lost in the many changing things are not philosophers, I have to ask you which of these two groups should be the rulers of our State?

But how can we answer that question correctly?

Whoever is best able to protect the laws and rules of our State—let them be our guardians.

Very good.

Also, I said, there is no doubt that the guardian who protects anything should have eyes rather than no eyes.

There is no doubt about that.

And aren’t those who truly lack knowledge about the real nature of things, who have no clear understanding in their souls, and who can’t see the absolute truth like a painter sees their model, and don’t have a perfect vision of the other world to make laws about beauty, goodness, and justice, if these laws aren’t already made, and to guard and keep order—aren’t such people simply blind?

Truly, he replied, they are very much like that.
