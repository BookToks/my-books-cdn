The great good thing about being rich, I don’t say for everyone but for a good person, is that they don’t have to lie or cheat others on purpose or by accident. When they die, they don’t worry about owing anything to the gods or other people. Having money helps a lot with this peace of mind. So, I think this is the best benefit wealth can give to a smart person.

“Good point, Cephalus,” I said. “But what is justice? Is it just telling the truth and paying your debts? Is it nothing more than that? And even this has exceptions, right? Like if a friend gives me weapons when he’s sane, but asks for them back when he’s not sane, should I give them back? Nobody would say I should, just like nobody would say I should always tell the truth to someone who’s not in their right mind.”

“You’re right,” he said.

“But then,” I said, “just telling the truth and paying debts isn’t a good enough definition of justice.”

“Exactly, Socrates,” said Polemarchus, jumping in, “if we trust Simonides.”

“I’m afraid I have to go now to take care of the sacrifices,” said Cephalus, “so I’ll leave the argument to Polemarchus and the rest.”

“Isn’t Polemarchus your son?” I asked.

“Yes,” he answered and left laughing as he went to the sacrifices.

“Okay then, Polemarchus, the new leader of this talk, what did Simonides say about justice, and what do you think really is justice?”

“He said that paying back a debt is justice, and I think he’s right.”

“I wouldn’t want to doubt such a wise man, but even if his meaning is clear to you, it’s not clear to me. Because he definitely doesn’t mean, like we just said, that I should give back a weapon to someone who asks for it when they’re not in their right mind. But a deposit is definitely a debt.”

“True.”

“So when the person who asks me is not sane, I am not supposed to give it back?”

“Of course not.”
