Just so, he replied.

Well, I said, I meant the group of lazy and wasteful people, where the braver ones are the leaders and the shy ones follow. These are the same people we compared to drones, some with stingers and some without.

That’s a fair comparison.

These two groups cause big problems in every city where they live, like sickness in a body. A good doctor or lawmaker should, like a smart bee keeper, keep them away and stop them from coming in. And if they do get in, they should be removed quickly.

Yes, definitely, he said.

Now, to understand better what we are talking about, let’s imagine democracy is split into three groups, because it really is. First, freedom creates more lazy people, or drones, in a democracy than there were in an oligarchy.

That’s true.

And in a democracy, they are even more powerful.

How come?

Because in an oligarchy they are not allowed to hold office and can’t get stronger. But in a democracy, they almost run everything. While the smarter people speak and act, the rest just make noise and don’t let others have a say. So, drones control almost everything in democracies.

Very true, he said.

Then, there is another group that is always separated from the rest.

What group is that?

They are the organized people, who in a trading nation are usually the richest.

Of course.

They can be squeezed the most and give the largest amount of “honey” to the drones.

Why? he said, not much can be squeezed from poor people.

Right, and this group is called the wealthy class, and the drones feed off them.
