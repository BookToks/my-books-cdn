The bigger example seemed to be the State, so we made the best example we could, knowing that in a good State, justice would be found. Now, let's try to apply what we learned to a person—if they agree, we'll be happy; if there’s a difference, we’ll go back to the State and rethink the idea. When we compare the two, we might find a spark that shows what justice really is, and we’ll keep that idea in our hearts.

That sounds good; let’s do it your way.

I asked: When two things, one bigger and one smaller, have the same name, are they alike because they share that name?

They are alike, he answered.

So, if we think about justice, would a just person be like a just State?

Yes, he said.

We thought a State was just when its three groups each did their own job; and it was also temperate, brave, and wise because of certain feelings and qualities in those groups?

True, he said.

And a person might have the same three parts in their soul that are in the State; and we can describe the person the same way because they have similar feelings?

Certainly, he said.

So, my friend, the easy question is: Does the soul have these three parts or not?

Easy question! No, Socrates, there’s a saying that the good is hard to find.

That’s true, I said; and I don’t think the way we’re trying now will fully answer this question; the real way is different and longer. Still, we might get an answer that’s as good as the last one.

Isn’t that enough? he said; under the circumstances, I’m happy.

Me too, I said, I’ll be very satisfied.

Then don’t give up on this idea, he said.

Shouldn’t we admit, I said, that in each of us there are the same parts and habits that are in the State; and that from a person, they pass into the State?
