Socrates’ way of teaching is slow and careful, waiting to explain more about what “good” really means and how talking things through works, which he does more in the seventh book.

Glaucon doesn’t fully understand, and Socrates is a bit hesitant to start, showing how hard the topic is. There’s a mention of Theages’ bridle and Socrates’ inner sign that stops him from doing certain things. This sign, in Plato’s works, always tells Socrates what not to do. It’s also said that only God can save any bit of good in the world’s current bad state. There’s talk of a future life that Glaucon doesn’t know about yet, where Socrates and his students will continue their discussions. The answers surprise them sometimes. Socrates jokes around, saying he can only explain the strange role of the philosopher with a figure of speech. He points out that Sophists just follow public opinion instead of leading it. There’s a picture of a philosopher standing alone in the cold rain by a wall, and a “great beast” symbol. Despite this, Socrates shows kindness toward regular people who wouldn’t have rejected him if they had really known him. The idea that the biggest truths need the most exact thinking is called a “right noble thought.” Socrates hesitates again to talk about the idea of good, Glaucon takes things very seriously, and philosophy is compared to a lonely girl marrying below her status. These are some of the most interesting parts of the sixth book.

Still, a few more thoughts can be added about this old topic that Socrates and his friends talked about a lot. Like Glaucon and Adeimantus, we want to understand better. We don’t like being told that only students of math can understand the idea of good, and we think neither they nor we could reach a satisfying answer that way. We’ve learned that differences in quantity (like numbers) don’t turn into differences in quality (like goodness), and math can’t fully reach higher thoughts, even if it can sometimes represent or help us think about them. Math also helps train the mind to focus.

The old idea that math leads to understanding good might have made sense to ancient philosophers but doesn’t anymore. But if the way we’re supposed to find the idea of good is just imaginary, maybe the idea itself is just an abstract thought? We notice that in every time period, especially early philosophy, words like being, essence, unity, and good have had a huge impact on how people think.
