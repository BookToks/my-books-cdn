“Stop, that’s enough,” he said. “If that’s true, then only the Dorian and Phrygian modes are left for you.”

I answered, “I don’t know much about harmonies, but I want one that sounds brave, like a warrior facing danger or fighting for a cause, even if he’s about to get hurt or die. This music should show someone standing strong and ready to face whatever comes.

And I want another harmony for peaceful times, when there’s no danger. This one would be for when someone is praying, teaching, or asking for help, or when they’re willing to listen and change. It should show someone acting wisely and calmly, not getting carried away by success but accepting what happens.

I ask you to keep these two harmonies: the one for hard times and the one for peaceful times, the one for courage and the one for self-control.”

He replied, “Those are exactly the Dorian and Phrygian harmonies I was just talking about.”

Then I said, “If only these two are used in our songs and music, won’t we need fewer notes or a simpler musical scale?”

“I guess not,” he said.

“Then we won’t need makers of complicated lyres with three corners or other tricky string instruments?”

“Definitely not.”

“But what about flute makers and players? Would you allow them in our city, knowing that the flute is actually worse than all string instruments together, and even the panharmonic music is just copying the flute?”

“Obviously not.”

“So, the only instruments left for the city are the lyre and the harp, and shepherds can have pipes in the countryside.”

“That’s the right conclusion,” he agreed.

Choosing Apollo and his instruments over Marsyas and his is not strange at all, I said.

“Not at all,” he answered.
