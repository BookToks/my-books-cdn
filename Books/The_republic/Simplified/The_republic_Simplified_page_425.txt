That’s pretty much how it is, he said.

People are in a third class, made up of those who work with their hands. They aren’t politicians and don’t have much to live on. When these people come together, they make up the biggest and strongest group in a democracy.

True, he said, but usually the crowd won’t gather unless they get a little reward.

And don’t they share? I asked. Don’t their leaders take land from the rich and give it to the people, while also keeping most of it for themselves?

Yes, he said, to some extent the people do share.

And the people who lose their property have to defend themselves in front of the others as best they can?

What else can they do?

And even if these rich people don’t want change, the others accuse them of plotting against the people and being friends of the ruling few?

True.

In the end, when these rich people see the crowd, not because they want to but because they are tricked by liars trying to hurt them, they are forced to become rulers in reality. They don’t want to, but the pain from the rest of the people pushes them into it and causes revolts.

That’s exactly right.

Then come impeachments, judgments, and trials against one another.

True.

The people always have a hero they choose to lead them and help them grow strong.

Yes, that’s how they do it.

This is where tyrants come from; when they first show up, they are protectors.

Yes, that’s clear.

So how does a protector change into a tyrant? Clearly, it happens when he does what the man said in the story about the Arcadian temple of Lycaean Zeus.

What story?
