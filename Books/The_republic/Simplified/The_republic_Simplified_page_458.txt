Ido.

Let’s take a simple example: there are lots of beds and tables in the world, right?

Yes.

But there are only two ideas or forms of them – the idea of a bed and the idea of a table.

True.

And the person who makes either one makes a bed or a table for us, following that idea – that’s how we usually talk about it – but no maker creates the ideas themselves: how could they?

Impossible.

And there is another maker – I want to know what you’d say about him.

Who is he?

He is the maker of all the work done by other makers.

What an amazing person!

Wait a bit, and you’ll have more reason to say that. This is someone who can make not only all kinds of containers, but plants and animals, himself and everything else – the earth and sky, and everything in the sky or under the earth; he even makes the gods.

He must be a wizard for sure.

Oh! You don’t believe it, do you? Do you mean there is no such creator, or that there might be a maker of all these things but not in the way you think? Do you see that there is a way you could make them all yourself?

What way?

An easy way; actually, many ways to do it quickly and easily. One way is by turning a mirror around and around – you would soon make the sun and the sky, the earth and yourself, animals and plants, and all the other things we just talked about, but in the mirror.

Yes, he said; but they would only be reflections.

Very good, I said, you’re getting to the point now.
