He doesn’t get angry at Homer and Archilochus like Heracleitus does. Instead, he uses their words and phrases to explain bigger ideas. He doesn’t follow a strict system like Theagenes or the Stoics, but uses them in creative ways. Even though some ideas are made up, the conclusions still make sense. These imaginative references to Homer make Plato’s writing interesting and also poke fun at how people misunderstand Homer’s work. To us (and probably to Plato himself), these aren’t really arguments but more like figures of speech. It’s like how people today quote the Bible for effect, even if they don’t exactly remember what the original words meant. The real Socrates, as we learn from Xenophon’s Memorabilia, liked to do similar things. In every time and place, whether in religion, law, or literature, interpretation has always been an important skill.

2. “The style should fit the subject, and the meter should fit the style.” Even though we are drawn to the idea of “classical” art, this rule isn’t always followed in the old Greek poetry we have. Sometimes, the ideas are too big or complicated to be clearly expressed in works by Aeschylus and Pindar. Or, in Euripides’ plays, the fancy language sometimes overshadows the ideas. Maybe only Sophocles shows a perfect balance between meaning and style. His language is as beautiful and flawless as a Greek statue, where nothing needs to be added or taken away—at least in individual plays or big parts of them. 

In the tragic choruses and Greek lyric poems, the thoughts are often mixed up and tangled, like a thread the poet couldn’t straighten out. Back then, before logic was developed, poets didn’t have the skill to separate or organize their ideas clearly. There is a subtle influence of logic that needs to move from prose to poetry, just like music and perfect language move from poetry to prose. Poets have always been bad judges of what they really mean. They don’t realize that words full of meaning to themselves can be confusing or meaningless to others. Also, what makes sense to the poet might puzzle the audience. Many passages in even the greatest modern poets are too hard to understand. There, style and subject don’t match, and unclear images, awkward wording, strange word order, or weird idea jumps are allowed. There is no smooth “voice coming sweetly from nature,” or music adding feeling to the thought. It’s like there can’t be poetry without beauty, or beauty without ease and clarity. The confusing parts of early Greek poets happened because of the way language and logic were back then.
