In the house of Hades, there are souls and ghostly forms, but no mind at all! Tiresias said that even after death, Persephone gave mind to one soul so it could be wise, but the other souls are just fading shadows.

The soul flying from the body went to Hades, crying about its fate, leaving behind youth and manhood. Another soul passed by with a shrill cry, like smoke under the earth.

Like bats in a dark cave, when one drops from the string and falls from the rock, they fly around shrieking and stick together. The souls did the same, crying out as they moved.

We should ask Homer and other poets not to be angry if we leave out these kinds of passages. It’s not because they aren’t poetic or interesting, but because the more beautiful they are, the less they are suitable for boys and men who are meant to be free and should fear slavery more than death.

Definitely.

We also have to stop using terrible and scary names for the underworld—like Cocytus and Styx, ghosts under the earth, and lifeless shades. Just hearing these names makes people shudder deep inside. I’m not saying these scary stories don’t have some use, but they can make the nerves of those who protect us too sensitive and weak.

There is a real danger, he said.

Then we must stop telling those stories.

True.

We need to create and sing a better, nobler kind of story.

Of course.

And should we get rid of the crying and wailing of famous men too?

They will go along with the rest.

But are we sure it’s right to get rid of them?
