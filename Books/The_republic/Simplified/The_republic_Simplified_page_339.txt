If someone has an opinion, do they have an opinion about something?  
Yes.  

Not-being isn’t really a thing; it’s actually nothing, right?  
True.  

When it comes to not-being, ignorance is linked to it; and for being, there is knowledge?  
True, he said.  

So, opinion isn’t about being or not-being?  
Not about either one.  

Does that mean opinion is neither ignorance nor knowledge?  
That seems right.  

Should we look for opinion outside and beyond both ignorance and knowledge, in something clearer than knowledge or darker than ignorance?  
No, neither.  

So, do you think opinion is darker than knowledge but lighter than ignorance?  
Yes, both; and not by a small amount.  

Is opinion also found between and within knowledge and ignorance?  
Yes.  

So, can we say opinion is in the middle?  
Definitely.  

But didn’t we say before that if something seems to be both true and not true at the same time, it would lie between pure being and pure not-being, and the ability related to it is neither knowledge nor ignorance but somewhere between?  
True.  

And in that space between, we found something called opinion?  
Yes, we did.  

What’s left to find is something that has both being and not-being, and can’t be called just one or the other; when we find it, we can call it the subject of opinion, giving the extremes to knowledge and ignorance, and the middle part to opinion’s ability.
