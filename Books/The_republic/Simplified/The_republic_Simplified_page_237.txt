That's true, he said.

But can any of these reasons apply to God? Can we think that He doesn’t know old things and so has to make stuff up?

That would be silly, he said.

So, the lying poet doesn’t fit with our idea of God?

Definitely not.

Or maybe he lies because he’s scared of enemies?

That’s impossible.

But maybe he has friends who are crazy or don’t think straight?

No crazy or foolish person can be God’s friend.

Then there’s no reason to think God would lie?

None at all.

So, the superhuman and divine can’t ever lie?

Exactly.

Then God is completely simple and truthful in what He says and does; He doesn’t change or trick anyone, whether by signs, words, dreams, or visions.

Your thoughts, he said, are just like mine.

You agree with me then, I said, that this is the right way to talk and write about divine things. The gods aren’t magicians who change themselves, and they don’t trick people.

I agree with that.

So, even though we like Homer, we don’t like the lying dream Zeus sent to Agamemnon. We also won’t praise the lines by Aeschylus where Thetis sings at the wedding about her beautiful children who will live long and never get sick. And when he said my life would be blessed in every way, I felt happy and hopeful.
