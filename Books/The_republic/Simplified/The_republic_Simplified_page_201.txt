You guessed right, he answered.

Then I definitely shouldn’t stop arguing as long as I think you, Thrasymachus, are being honest; I believe you’re serious now and not just joking.

I might be serious or not, but that’s not your problem — it’s your job to argue against me.

That’s true, I said; that’s what I have to do. But can you answer one more question? Does a just person try to get ahead of another just person?

Not at all; if he did, he wouldn’t be the simple and honest person he is.

Would he try to do more than what’s just?

No, he wouldn’t.

And what about trying to get ahead of an unjust person? Would the just person think that’s fair or unfair?

He would think it’s fair and try to get ahead, but he wouldn’t be able to.

Whether he could or not doesn’t matter, I said. My question is just if the just person, while refusing to have more than another just person, would want and claim to have more than the unjust person?

Yes, he would.

And what about the unjust person — does he claim to have more than the just person and do more than what’s fair?

Of course, he said, because he claims to have more than everyone else.

And will the unjust person work hard to get more than other unjust people or do more than what’s unfair, so he can have more than everyone?

True.

We can say it like this, I said — the just person doesn’t want more than other just people but more than unfair people, while the unjust person wants more than both just and unfair people.
