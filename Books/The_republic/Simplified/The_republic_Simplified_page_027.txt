He seems to find it hard to explain God’s ways to people. Both brothers talk about whether what makes actions right or wrong depends on their results. They go further than Socrates, who said justice is good not just for itself but also for what it leads to. They try to see justice as something inside a person and criticize poets, which is something Socrates also started. They want to understand things deeper than everyday Greek life.

Some people say justice means being honest like Glaucon and Adeimantus think, but Socrates uses it to mean all virtues. Maybe it’s better to say Socrates made the old idea of justice bigger, making it about order and well-being, first in the State and then in the individual. He found a new answer to whether virtues are one or many: one virtue controls the other three. He tries to show justice is inside a person but also knows people live in society, so he tries to balance these ideas. This wasn’t unusual for his time, and we shouldn’t judge him by modern ideas. Plato doesn’t give the final answers to philosophy, and we can’t judge him by today’s standards.

The rest of the Republic comes from the question Ariston’s sons ask. Three things are important: First, Socrates answers in a roundabout way. He doesn’t say happiness is just thinking about justice, and he definitely doesn’t agree that a just person can be happy while suffering. Instead, he talks about how hard the problem is and says we need to get back to natural human life before answering.

He also has an ideal, but it’s not just about justice as a concept; it’s about all human relationships. Using the example of big letters, he shows he’ll look for justice in society first, then in individuals. His main point is that in the perfect State, justice and happiness happen together, and once justice is found, happiness will take care of itself. He might seem a bit inconsistent when he says in the tenth book that justice doesn’t need rewards or honors, but he means those things exist in the perfect State. Also, a philosopher who hides behind a wall probably wouldn’t be happy in this world. Still, Socrates keeps the right attitude about doing what’s morally right.
