How does it work?

There are two parts. In the lower part, the soul uses the shapes from the first part as pictures. The search here is just a guess, and instead of moving up to a basic truth, it goes down the other way. In the higher part, the soul leaves guesses behind and moves up to a principle that is above guesses. It doesn’t use pictures like before, but goes straight through the ideas themselves.

I don’t really get what you mean, he said.

Okay, I’ll try again. You’ll understand better after some basic points. You know that students of geometry, math, and similar subjects start with things like odd and even numbers, shapes, and different kinds of angles. These are their starting points, or guesses, which everyone is supposed to know, so they don’t explain them. They just begin with these and keep going until they reach a clear conclusion.

Yes, he said, I know.

And don’t you also know that even though they use visible shapes and think about them, they are actually thinking about the perfect versions of these shapes? Not the drawings they make, but the absolute square or perfect diameter. The shapes they draw are just copies, like shadows or reflections, but what they really want to see are the real things, which you can only see with your mind.

That’s true.

This is what I meant by “intelligible.” When searching for it, the soul has to use guesses; it can’t go above the level of guesses. So it uses objects that are clearer versions of shadows and reflections as pictures, because they are more real and important.

I get it, he said. You’re talking about subjects like geometry and other similar arts.

And when I talk about the other kind of intelligible, I mean the kind of knowledge that reason gets by using dialectic. Here, guesses are not the first principles, but just steps or starting points to reach a world above guesses. The soul rises above them to the first principle of everything. Then, by holding onto this and what depends on it, it follows steps back down again, without using any physical things, moving from ideas to ideas until it ends.
