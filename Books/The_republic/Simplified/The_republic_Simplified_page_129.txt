The description of the axis as a spindle, and of the heavenly bodies as forming a whole, partly comes from trying to connect the movements of the stars and planets with the myth of the Fates weaving a web. The giving out of lots, the weaving of them, and making them unchangeable are linked to the three Fates—Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos—who are named after these actions. The element of chance in human life is shown by the order in which the lots are given. But even if chance is against someone, they can overcome it with wisdom if they know how to make the right choices. There is a worse enemy than chance though; and that enemy is a person’s own self.

Someone who is only somewhat lucky, even if they get the last lot, can still have a good life if they choose wisely. Plato doesn’t like to say something without proof, so he supports this idea by using the example of Odysseus, who chose last but still succeeded. But just good habits aren’t enough to help someone choose well; they also need knowledge, so they can act correctly in new situations. Doing good things out of habit is a weaker kind of goodness; as Coleridge said, “Common sense is useless if it’s not based on deeper understanding,” and Plato might have said, “Habit means nothing without philosophy.” People have the freedom to reject bad choices and pick good ones. “Virtue is free, and how much a person respects it affects how much they have.” A person’s life is shaped by necessity; things before birth affect them. But inside these limits, a person can be their own master, learn how nature and luck affect their soul, and act accordingly. Not everyone can always have the first pick, but everyone’s lot is good enough if they choose wisely and work hard.

The story feels real because of details like Ardiaeus living a thousand years before; Er coming back to life on the twelfth day after he was thought dead, matching the pilgrims’ seven days in the meadow and four days traveling to the column of light; the exact mention of the soul who picked the twentieth lot; small comments that souls didn’t have fixed characters, and those who made bad choices blamed others instead of themselves; or that some souls drank too much from the waters of Forgetfulness while Er couldn’t drink at all; Odysseus wanting to finally rest, which is different from how Dante and Tennyson imagined him; and the fake ignorance about how Er returned to his body while the other souls shot like stars to be born again.

All these little natural details add to how believable the story is. They’re like the kind of realistic touches Daniel Defoe might have added when trying to make his stories about miracles and ghosts seem true.
