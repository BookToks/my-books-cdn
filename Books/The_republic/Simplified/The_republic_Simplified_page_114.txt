People don’t realize that poets just copy things and their work is only an imitation. That’s true. But if someone could create something new instead of just copying, they would rather make something that lasts forever, not just a copy. They would want to be praised for creating, not just for copying. Yes, because then they would get more respect and benefits.

Now, let’s ask Homer and other poets some questions. Homer, I’m not going to ask you about medicine or other skills you mention in your poems, but about the main topics—war, fighting strategies, and politics. If you are only one step away from the truth, not just copying or making images, please tell us what good you have done for people?

Is there any city that says they got their laws from you, like Sicily and Italy got theirs from Charondas, Sparta from Lycurgus, or Athens from Solon? Did any war ever happen because of your advice? Did you invent anything, like Thales or Anacharsis? Or is there a way of life called “Homeric,” like the Pythagorean way, that you taught people? No, of course not. And Creophylus (which means “Flesh-child”) was even worse off than his name suggests, because, according to stories, Homer and his friends let him starve while Homer was still alive.

But could that have happened if Homer really taught Greece? Wouldn’t he have had many followers? If Protagoras and Prodicus can convince people that no one can run a home or a state without their help, is it likely that Homer and Hesiod would have been allowed to wander around begging—if they really helped the world? Wouldn’t people have made them stay or followed them to learn? But they didn’t. So we can guess that Homer and all poets are just imitators, who only copy how things look.

Just like a painter can paint a cobbler without knowing how to cobble, a poet can describe any skill using fancy language and rhythm, making the cobbler or the general sound interesting. But plain storytelling without rhythm is like a face that lost its youth and never had any beauty to begin with. The imitator doesn’t really know the truth, only how things seem.

A painter paints, and a craftsman makes a bridle and reins, but neither really knows how to use them—that’s the horseman’s skill. The same goes for other things. So there are three skills: one for using things, one for inventing things, and one for copying things. The user tells the other two what is right. The flute player knows a good or bad flute, so the flute maker trusts him; but the imitator doesn’t really know or trust. Imitation has no real knowledge; it’s just a kind of fun or game. The poets who write tragedies and epics are the biggest imitators.

Now let’s ask, what part of a person is responsible for imitation?
