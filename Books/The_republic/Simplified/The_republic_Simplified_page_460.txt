Why is that?

Because even if God had made only two beds, a third bed would still come after them, which both of the first two beds would copy. That third bed would be the perfect bed, not the first two.

That's true, he said.

God knew this, and He wanted to be the real creator of a real bed, not just the maker of one specific bed. So, He made a bed that is the one true bed by nature.

So, we believe that.

Shall we talk about God as the natural creator or maker of the bed?

Yes, he replied; since by the natural process of making, He is the creator of this bed and everything else.

And what about the carpenter—isn’t he also the maker of the bed?

Yes.

But would you call the painter a creator or maker?

Definitely not.

If he’s not the maker, then what is he in relation to the bed?

I think, he said, we can call him an imitator of what the others make.

Good, I said; so you call the person who is third in this chain an imitator?

Certainly, he said.

And the tragic poet is an imitator, so like all imitators, he is three steps away from the king and from the truth?

That seems to be the case.

Then we agree about the imitator. And what about the painter? I want to know if he imitates what really exists in nature or only what artists create.

The latter.

Are they as they really are or just how they look? You still need to figure that out.

What do you mean?
