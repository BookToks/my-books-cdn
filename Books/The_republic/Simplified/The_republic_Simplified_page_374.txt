No question, he replied.

I told them that the truth would be nothing but shadows of the images.

That’s for sure.

Now, imagine what would happen if the prisoners were set free and realized they were wrong. At first, if one of them is suddenly made to stand up, turn around, walk, and look toward the light, he will feel pain; the bright light will hurt his eyes, and he won’t be able to see the real things that he only saw as shadows before. Then, if someone told him that what he saw before was fake, but now, as he looks closer to the real world, he can see better—what would he say? And if his teacher pointed to real objects and asked him to name them, wouldn’t he be confused? Wouldn’t he think that the shadows he saw before were more real than these objects?

Much more real.

If he’s forced to look directly at the light, won’t his eyes hurt so much that he’ll want to look away and go back to the shadows he can see, thinking those shadows are clearer and more real than the new things shown to him?

True, he said.

Now, imagine he’s dragged up a steep, rough path and held there until he faces the sun itself. Won’t he feel pain and irritation? When he gets close to the light, his eyes will be dazzled, and he won’t be able to see any of what we call reality.

Not right away, he said.

He’ll need time to get used to seeing in the upper world. First, he’ll see shadows best, then reflections of people and objects in water, then the objects themselves. After that, he’ll look at the light of the moon and stars in the night sky. He will see the stars and sky better at night than he will see the sun during the day.

Definitely.

Finally, he will be able to look at the sun itself—not just its reflection in the water, but see it in its real place. And he will understand the sun as it really is.
