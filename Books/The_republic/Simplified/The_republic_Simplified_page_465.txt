True.

The instrument is the same, but only the person who makes it can really understand if it’s good or bad. He learns this by talking to someone who knows and has to listen carefully to what they say. But what about the person who just uses it? Will they really understand?

True.

But what about someone who just copies? Will they know if their drawing is right or looks good? Or will they just have an opinion because they are forced to hang out with someone who knows and tells them what to draw?

Neither.

So, they won’t have a true opinion or real knowledge about whether their copies are good or bad?

I don’t think so.

Will the artist who copies be really smart about their own work?

No, actually the opposite.

And still, they will keep copying without knowing what makes something good or bad. So, they will probably just copy what looks good to people who don’t know much?

Exactly.

So far, we agree that the copier doesn’t really know much about what they copy. Copying is like a game or fun activity. Even poets who write serious or funny poems are just copying in the highest way?

Very true.

Now, tell me, haven’t we shown that copying is about something far removed from the real truth?

Yes, definitely.

And what part of a person is copying aimed at?

What do you mean?

I will explain: something big looks small when you see it from far away, right?
