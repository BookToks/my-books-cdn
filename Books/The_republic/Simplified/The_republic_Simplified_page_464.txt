Exactly.

Here’s another point: The person who copies or makes an image doesn’t really understand what’s real; they only know what things look like. Am I right?

Yes.

So let’s be clear and not settle for half-explanations.

Go ahead.

We say a painter will paint reins and a bit, right?

Yes.

And a leather and brass worker will make them?

Definitely.

But does the painter know the correct shape of the bit and reins? No, not even the leather and brass workers really know; only the horse rider who uses them knows their proper form.

That’s true.

Can’t we say the same about everything?

What do you mean?

That there are three skills involved with all things: one that uses them, one that makes them, and one that copies them.

Yes.

And the quality, beauty, or truth of every object or action depends on how well it serves the purpose nature or the artist intended.

True.

So, the person who uses them must have the most experience and must tell the maker what’s good or bad about them when used. For example, a flute player will tell the flute maker which flutes work well for playing and how they should be made, and the maker will listen.

Of course.

The user knows and speaks with authority about what makes a flute good or bad, and the maker trusts and follows their advice.
