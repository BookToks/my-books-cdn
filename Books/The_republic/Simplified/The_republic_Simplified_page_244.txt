So, these stories might actually be bad for young guys—you agree with me, right?

Yes.

Also, when smart people say that nothing is better than when the table is full of bread and meat, and someone is pouring wine from a bowl, do you think hearing this helps young people stay disciplined? Or what about the line, "The saddest fate is to die from hunger"? What do you think about the story of Zeus, who was the only god awake while everyone else was asleep, making plans but then forgetting them because he got distracted by his desire? He was so caught up that he didn’t even go inside but wanted to lie on the ground with Hera, saying he’d never felt like that before—even when they first met. And what about the story where Hephaestus trapped Ares and Aphrodite in chains because of something similar?

He said, I strongly believe they shouldn’t hear stories like that.

But any stories about famous people showing courage and endurance, those they should see and hear. Like the lines, "He hit his chest and told his heart, ‘Endure, my heart; you’ve been through worse!’" Definitely, he said.

Next, we shouldn’t let young people be greedy or love money.

Definitely not.

We also shouldn’t sing songs about “gifts persuading gods and kings.” Phoenix, who taught Achilles, wasn’t giving good advice when he told Achilles to accept gifts from the Greeks and help them, but not to stop being angry without a gift.
