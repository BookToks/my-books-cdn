Aristotle got really annoyed when I told him about Scotus and Ramus the way I did. He asked if all the people like them were just as clueless.

But there is a difference between them. Hegel thinks of all human minds as one big mind that grows ideas over time and in different places. Plato, on the other hand, sees these steps as just different stages of thinking, not real history of the mind.

People have a lot of criticisms about Plato’s ideas on education. Sometimes he misses the mark compared to modern thinkers, but other times he is actually ahead of them. He didn’t like the way education worked in his time, but he didn’t really come up with new methods either.

Plato didn’t understand that education needs to fit different people’s personalities. He wanted everyone to learn the same way, like the state shaping their minds all the same. He didn’t realize how much literature shapes the mind, and he made math seem way more important than it is.

His goal was mostly to train people’s reasoning skills, to help them think in abstract ways, explain big ideas, and connect them. It’s not surprising that sometimes he and his followers drifted away from his big ideas and focused more on numbers, where the idea of “one and many” can be understood clearly.

If we talk about his teaching style, he was very strict and wanted everyone to be the same, like in Sparta. He didn’t think some freedom or a little bit of ignoring rules was good to help people grow and be themselves. His citizens wouldn’t get the kind of knowledge that comes from learning from bad experiences, like in the story of Er.

On the other hand, Plato was way ahead of modern thinkers by saying education should never stop and will even start again after death. He believed you should keep learning your whole life, even if you get older and can’t learn as much as you used to.

He loved thinking about the idea of good and enjoyed studying geometry. He imagined a happy life could be spent doing these kinds of things.

But people today know that most people are busy with work and don’t spend their time studying or thinking deeply. Plato’s idea of education is really meant for philosophers or geniuses, not for most people.

Still, Plato’s thoughts might help us today. Even if we can’t make his perfect education happen, it can inspire people to be better and rise above just doing the same old job every day.
