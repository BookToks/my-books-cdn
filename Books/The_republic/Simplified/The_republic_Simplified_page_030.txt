 And our first principle is, that God must be represented as he is; not as the authorofallthings,butofgoodonly. Wewillnotsufferthepoetstosaythathe isthestewardofgoodandevil,orthathehastwocasksfullofdestinies;–orthat AtheneandZeusincitedPandarustobreakthetreaty; orthatGodcausedthe sufferings of Niobe, or of Pelops, or the Trojan war; or that he makes men sin whenhewishestodestroythem.

Butthatthedeed wasevil,andGodtheauthor,isawicked,suicidalfictionwhichwewillallow no one, old or young, to utter. This is our first and great principle–God is the authorofgoodonly.
 
 Andthesecondprincipleislikeuntoit:–WithGodisnovariablenessorchange of form. Reason teaches us this; for if we suppose a change in God, he must bechangedeitherbyanotherorbyhimself. Byanother?–butthebestworksof nature and art and the noblest qualities of mind are least liable to be changed byanyexternalforce. Byhimself?–buthecannotchangeforthebetter;hewill hardly change for the worse. He remains for ever fairest and best in his own image. Therefore we refuse to listen to the poets who tell us of Here begging in the likeness of a priestess or of other deities who prowl about at night in strangedisguises; allthatblasphemousnonsensewithwhichmothersfoolthe manhoodoutoftheirchildrenmustbesuppressed. Butsomeonewillsaythat God, who is himself unchangeable, may take a form in relation to us. Why http://www.idph.net IDPH 31 should he?
