Is anything better than the old-fashioned kind of music and gymnastics? Music includes stories and books, and there are two kinds of stories: true and false. “What do you mean?” he asked. I mean that kids hear stories before they learn gymnastics, and those stories are either not true or only a little bit true mixed with a lot of lies. When kids are young, they believe things easily, so they shouldn’t learn stuff they’ll have to forget when they grow up. That’s why we need to check nursery tales carefully, keep some, and get rid of others.

Some stories are really bad, like the ones from Homer and Hesiod. They don’t just tell lies, but bad lies. Stories about Uranus and Saturn are wrong and teach bad ideas, so kids should never hear them. If they do, it should be in secret, and only after a special ceremony, not like a normal story. Should kids be told to fight their parents because Zeus did, or watch gods argue and fight? Should they hear about Hephaestus tying up his mother or Zeus sending him away for helping her? These stories might have hidden meanings, but young kids can’t understand those. If anyone asks which stories are okay, we’ll say we make the rules, not the books; others write the books following our rules.

Our first rule is that God must be shown as He really is — not the creator of everything, but only of good things. We won’t let poets say God is in charge of both good and evil, or that He has two jars of fate, or that Athena and Zeus made Pandarus break a treaty. We won’t say God caused the suffering of Niobe, Pelops, or the Trojan War, or that He makes people do bad things just to punish them. Either the gods didn’t do those things, or God is fair and people learn from punishment. Saying God does evil is a bad, crazy idea, and no one, young or old, should say it. This is our first big rule — God only makes good.

The second rule is similar: God never changes or looks different. Reason tells us this. If God changed, it would be because something else changed Him or He changed Himself. Could something else change God? No, the best things in nature and mind don’t change because of outside forces. Could God change Himself? No, He can’t get better or worse. He always stays perfect and the best He can be. So we don’t listen to poets who say Hera pretended to be a priestess or gods changed into strange shapes at night. All that nonsense that some moms tell kids to scare them has to stop. Someone might say God can take different forms to connect with us. But why should He?
