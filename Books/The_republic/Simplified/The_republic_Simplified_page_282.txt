"Charming!" he said. "I don't see anything charming about getting angry with someone who tells you what's right."

I said, "These gentlemen don’t seem to like you very much."

"Definitely not."

"Would you praise countries that act like the men I was just talking about? Some countries don’t let people change their laws, even under threat of death. But the person who flatters the people living there and gives them what they want is seen as a great leader. Don’t those countries act like those men I described?"

"Yes," he said, "those countries are as bad as those men, and I don’t praise them at all."

"But don’t you admire how calm and clever these corrupt politicians are?"

"Yes, I do; but not all of them. Some people clap for them and think they’re real leaders, but they’re not really that impressive."

"What do you mean?" I asked. "You should feel more for them. If a man can’t measure something and lots of others say he’s four cubits high, can he help but believe it?"

"No," he said, "he definitely can’t."

"Then don’t be mad at them. Aren’t they trying their best to fix small problems with laws, like I was talking about? They always think making new laws will stop cheating in contracts and other bad stuff, not realizing they’re actually cutting off the heads of a many-headed monster."

"Yes," he said, "that’s exactly what they’re doing."

"I think," I said, "that a real lawmaker won’t waste time on these kinds of laws or the constitution, whether the country is badly ruled or well ruled. In a bad country, these laws don’t work, and in a good one, they are easy to make and come naturally from other rules we already have."

He asked, "What’s left for us to do with making laws, then?"
