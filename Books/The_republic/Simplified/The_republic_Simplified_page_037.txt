Everyone needs to learn the idea of keeping things simple when they are young. You can see this in art, nature, plants, and animals.

Artists and poets should be careful not to make their work ugly or mean. Sculpture, painting, and music all need to follow the rule of simplicity. If someone breaks this rule, they shouldn’t be allowed to create art in our city because it can harm the taste of the people living here. Our guardians should grow up surrounded by things that are healthy and beautiful, not ugly things that can hurt their souls. Of all the things that influence them, music is the most powerful. It reaches deep inside and teaches them what beauty and ugliness are. At first, they might not notice it, but when they grow up and start thinking clearly, they will understand and appreciate it. Just like when we learn to read, we first learn letters and then how to put them together. In the same way, we must learn the basic parts of good behavior before understanding how they fit into life. There is a music in the soul that matches the harmony of the world, and the most beautiful thing is a fair mind in a healthy body. Small problems with the body can be forgiven, but not with the mind. True love comes from self-control, and self-control is the opposite of being crazy about physical pleasure. We have said enough about music, which ends nicely with love.

Now, let’s talk about exercise. The soul causes the body to act, so if we educate the mind well, we can leave the body’s training mostly to someone else, only giving a general plan. First, our guardians must avoid strong alcohol because they should be the last people to lose their minds.

It’s not clear if regular gym workouts are right for them because usual exercise can be boring and stopping suddenly can hurt health. Our warrior athletes need to be alert and ready for any change in food or weather. So, they need simple exercise, like simple music. Their diet can be based on what Homer wrote: heroes eat only roasted meat, no fish even if they live near the sea, and no boiled food that needs pots and pans. Also, they don’t eat sweet sauces. Fancy cooking and desserts, and flirtatious behavior, which are like complicated music to simple songs, must be banned. When people eat too much and lose control, the town fills with doctors and lawyers. Law and medicine become important only when people care about them.
