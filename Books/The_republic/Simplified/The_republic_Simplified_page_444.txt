Is the wise person the only one who has both knowledge and experience?

Definitely.

Also, the ability to make good decisions isn’t owned by greedy or ambitious people, but only by philosophers?

What ability?

Reason, which, as we said, should be the one to decide.

Yes.

And reasoning is especially their tool?

For sure.

If money and gain were what mattered most, then the opinion of someone who loves getting rich would be the most trustworthy?

Of course.

Or if honor, winning, or bravery were most important, then the judgment of someone who is ambitious or loves fighting would be the truest?

Clearly.

But since experience, wisdom, and reason are the real judges— the only conclusion is that the pleasures approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.

So, we find that the pleasure of the smart part of the soul is the best of the three, and the person who lives by this principle has the happiest life.

No doubt about it, the wise person speaks confidently when he says he approves of his own life.

And what does the judge say is the next best life and pleasure?

Obviously, that of the soldier and lover of honor; who is closer to himself than the money-lover.

Is the lover of money last?

Exactly.

So, the just person has beaten the unjust twice in this fight; now comes a third test, dedicated to Zeus the protector: a wise voice tells me that only the pleasure of the wise is truly real and pure— all others are just shadows; and this will surely be the biggest and most important test?
