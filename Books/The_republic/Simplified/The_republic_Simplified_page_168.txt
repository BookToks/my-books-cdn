The most convincing point he makes is about how bad the world is, which he describes in a touching way. He believes there won’t be any real happiness or peace for people until all countries are united under one empire. His whole book shows how much people back then believed in the idea of the Roman Empire. It didn’t take much to convince them because this idea felt natural and familiar.

He talks, or rather preaches, from the view of a regular person, not a church leader. But as a good Catholic, he admits that in some ways, the Empire must listen to the Church. The main goal of all his thoughts and arguments, good or bad, is the hope that on this small part of Earth where humans live, life can be free and peaceful. His vision of the future is closely tied to the beliefs and times he lived in.

Sir Thomas More’s book "Utopia" is an amazing example of his smart thinking, showing ideas way ahead of his time. He wrote it when he was about 34 or 35, full of youthful hope. He uses Plato’s ideas to talk about the bad state of his country. Living soon after the Wars of the Roses and during a troubled time for the Catholic Church in England, More is angry about how corrupt the church leaders are, how rich people live in luxury, the suffering of poor people, and the damage caused by war.

To More, the whole world seemed to be falling apart. In the first part of "Utopia," he describes all this misery and unfairness. In the second part, he imagines a perfect society based on Plato’s ideas. Those were exciting times full of new ideas. People were starting to hear about the Reformation, and Greek writings were becoming important. The New Testament was beginning to be understood in a new way, closer to its original meaning.

The life More describes in "Utopia" seems very different from Christian societies he knew, where he saw only rich people looking out for themselves while pretending to care about everyone. He believed that Christ, like Plato, wanted everyone to share everything. Because of this, the people in Utopia accepted Christ’s teachings more easily. More thought sharing property was very important, even though he knew some people would argue against it. He agreed with Plato that there should be laws making sure everyone has an equal share of wealth and goods.
