That’s totally true, he said.

People have two sides: one is about feelings and energy, and the other is about thinking. It’s like some kind of gift that humans have two skills to match these sides, so they can balance each other out, kind of like tuning a guitar.

That seems to be the point.

And the person who mixes music and exercise in the right way, and balances them for the soul, can be called a true musician and someone who makes things harmonious, way more than someone who just tunes strings.

You’re right, Socrates.

We’ll always need someone like that in charge if our government is going to last.

Yes, that kind of leader is totally necessary.

So, these are the basics for how we raise and teach people. Why bother going into details about the dances, hunting, running, or horse riding contests? They all follow the same basic idea, and once we get that, we can figure them out easily.

I think that won’t be hard at all.

Good, I said; so what’s the next question? Shouldn’t we ask who will be the rulers and who will be the followers?

Definitely.

There’s no doubt that the older people should rule over the younger ones.

Obviously.

And the very best among them should be the rulers.

That’s clear too.

Now, aren’t the best farmers the ones who really care about farming?

Yes.

And since we want the best guardians for our city, shouldn’t they be the ones who have the most qualities of guardians?
