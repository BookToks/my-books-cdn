Hethrowssome mystery over why societies start to fall apart, blaming it on not understanding how populations grow. He uses a famous math idea to explain it. Like many people back then, he didn’t know that people and education could slowly get better over time. He thought the perfect society wouldn’t happen slowly but would appear all at once from a wise lawmaker. Once good laws were made, he only worried about how they might be changed or fixed to keep their original meaning. He didn’t seem to think about what he said himself, like when he said, “In a short human life, nothing great can be done,” or later, “It takes forever to build cities.” The way he orders types of governments shows his way of thinking, not history in real time, and can be seen as the first try to make a history philosophy.

The first type of declining government he talks about is timocracy, which means soldiers and people who love honor rule. This is like the Spartan government. It’s a government based on force where education isn’t inspired by art or music but forced by law. All the good parts of how a society should be organized are gone. The philosopher himself no longer loves truth, and instead, a simpler and more honest soldier rules. The person who fits this timocracy has some clear traits. He isn’t well educated but, like Spartans, loves literature. He’s tough on his servants but doesn’t feel naturally better than them. His personality comes from reacting to his dad, who left politics in a troubled city, and his mom, who’s unhappy with her life and pushes him to seek power. This might explain why this kind of person exists, and an old writer named Livy even said some laws came from a jealous woman. But really, there’s no real connection between how timocracy starts and the fact that the timocratic man’s dad left politics.

The next two stages of government decline don’t have much basis in real history. There’s no evidence in Greek history of a Spartan-like state turning into a government ruled by rich people, or that rich people’s rule then turning into democracy. History seems different. In Homer’s time, governments were ruled by kings or family heads. Later, these were replaced by a government ruled by birthright, not wealth, where wealth came from owning land and power. Sometimes this government changed to one based on property, which Aristotle called timocracy. In some cities, like Athens, this led to democracy.
