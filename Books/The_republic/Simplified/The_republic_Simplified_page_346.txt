Impossible.

Soon you will see if a person is fair and kind, or rude and unfriendly. These are the signs that show if someone is thoughtful or not, even when they are young.

True.

There is another important thing to notice.

What is it?

Whether they enjoy learning or not. No one likes something that hurts them and is hard, especially if they don’t get better at it after trying a lot.

Certainly not.

Also, if someone forgets everything they learn, won’t they be like an empty container?

That’s true.

If they keep working but get nothing out of it, they will end up hating themselves and what they do.

Yes.

So a person who forgets can’t really be called a true thinker. We must say that good thinkers have a good memory.

Certainly.

And again, a person who is out of balance and awkward will only become more uneven.

Undoubtedly.

Do you think truth fits with balance or imbalance?

Balance.

Then, besides other qualities, we need to find a mind that is naturally balanced and kind, which will naturally want to understand the true nature of everything.

Certainly.

Well, don’t all these qualities come together? Aren’t they all needed for a soul to fully share in being?

They are absolutely needed, he answered.

And shouldn’t the study that a person with a good memory and quick learning can do be perfect? This person is noble, kind, and a friend to truth, justice, courage, and self-control—they are like family to him.
