We have.

Next, let’s talk about another kind of government, which Aeschylus says is one group set against another. Or, as we planned, let’s start with the State.

Sure.

I think oligarchy comes next.

What kind of government is oligarchy?

It’s a government based on owning property, where rich people have power and poor people don’t.

I get it.

Should I start by explaining how a timocracy turns into an oligarchy?

Yes, please.

Well, I said, you don’t need special insight to see how one changes into the other.

How?

When private people collect a lot of gold, it ruins the timocracy. They spend money in illegal ways because they and their wives don’t care about the law.

That makes sense.

Then, when one person sees another getting richer, they try to get rich too. So most citizens become obsessed with money.

That sounds right.

They get richer and richer, and the more they want money, the less they care about being good. When you put money and goodness on a scale, as one goes up, the other goes down.

True.

As rich people and money are respected by the State, good people and goodness are ignored.

Clearly.

And what gets respected is what people work on, while what isn’t respected is ignored.
