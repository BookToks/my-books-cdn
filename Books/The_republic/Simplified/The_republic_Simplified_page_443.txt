That's true.

So, are we supposed to think that a philosopher cares about other kinds of pleasure as much as the pleasure of knowing the truth? And that by always learning and seeking truth, they are close to the highest kind of pleasure?

Doesn't the philosopher call other pleasures necessary only because we need them, but if we didn't, he would rather not have them?

There’s no doubt about that, he said.

Since the pleasures and ways of life are different, and the question isn’t about which life is more honorable or better, but which one is more enjoyable or less painful—how can we know who is right?

I can’t really tell, he said.

But what should we use to decide? Is anything better than experience, wisdom, and reason?

There can’t be anything better, he said.

Then think about it. Of the three people, who has the most experience with all the pleasures we talked about? Does the money lover, when learning the truth, have more experience of the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gaining money?

The philosopher, he said, has a big advantage because he has known all the other pleasures since he was a kid. But the money lover, even if he wanted to, probably hasn’t felt the sweetness of learning and knowing the truth.

So the lover of wisdom has a big advantage over the lover of money because he has double the experience?

Yes, a very big one.

Also, does the philosopher have more experience of honor’s pleasures than the lover of honor?

No, he said, all three—rich man, brave man, and wise man—are honored based on what they do. They all have fans and get honor, so they all know the pleasure of honor. But the special joy of knowing real truth is only known by the philosopher.

So the philosopher’s experience helps him judge better than anyone else?

Far better.
