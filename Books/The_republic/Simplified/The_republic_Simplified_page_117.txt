If someone dares to say the opposite, the answer is – then why do criminals need to be executed instead of just dying naturally? He said, "Really, injustice wouldn’t be so terrible if it stopped evil; but I believe that injustice, which kills others, actually makes the life of the unjust stronger and more active."

You’re right. If sin, which is naturally bad, can’t destroy the soul, then nothing else can. But a soul that can’t be destroyed by anything inside or outside must be immortal and last forever.

If that’s true, souls will always stay the same in number. They can’t get fewer because they can’t be destroyed; they can’t increase either, because new immortal souls can’t come from mortal things. So, everything ends with immortality. The soul isn’t changing or mixed up; what is immortal must be simple and perfect.

If we want to truly understand the soul, and see justice and injustice clearly, we have to look at them with pure reason, like at birth, or through philosophy when talking with the divine, immortal, and eternal.

Right now, we see the soul like the sea-god Glaucus, hurt and damaged by the sea, which is the world, and covered with shells and stones that have stuck to her from earth’s distractions.

So far, we haven’t talked about the rewards and honors poets say justice brings; we’ve just shown that justice itself is best for the soul, even if a person had a magic ring like Gyges or the helmet of Hades.

Now, you owe me what you borrowed, and I will list the rewards of justice in life and after death. I agreed, just for argument’s sake, that evil might escape the notice of gods and humans, though that’s really impossible. Since I’ve shown that justice is real, you must also admit it has the power to seem real.

First, the just person is known by the gods, so he is their friend and will get all good things from them, except for some bad things that come as a result of past sins. Everything works out well for him, in life or after death, even what looks like bad, because the gods care for those who want to be like them.

What about people? Isn’t honesty the best way? The smart cheat starts well but fails before he finishes and runs away in shame; but the honest person keeps going and wins the prize.

Let me repeat all the good things you said lucky unjust people have — they get to rule the city, marry whoever they want; and the bad things you said unlucky just people face really do happen to the unjust in the end, though, as you said, their suffering is more hidden.

But all the good things in this life are nothing compared to what good people get after death.

"I’d like to hear about those," you say.

Come, then, and I will tell you the story of Er, the son of Armenius, a brave man.
