I answered, “There’s nothing I like better, Cephalus, than talking with older men. I see them as travelers who have been on a journey that I might take someday. I want to ask them if the road is easy or hard. That’s why I want to ask you, since you’ve reached what poets call the ‘threshold of old age’—is life harder as you get older, or what do you think about it?”

Cephalus said, “I’ll tell you how I feel, Socrates. Men my age stick together; we’re like birds of a feather, as the saying goes. At our meetings, we usually talk about how we can’t eat or drink much anymore, and how the fun times of youth and love are gone. Life used to be good, but now it isn’t the same. Some complain about how their family treats them badly and tell sad stories about how hard old age is because of that. But to me, Socrates, those people blame something that isn’t really the problem. Old age is the reason—they are old, and anyone would feel the same way. But that’s not how I feel, nor others I know. I remember the old poet Sophocles, who once answered a question about love and age by saying, ‘Peace.’ He was happy to be free from love’s troubles, like escaping a crazy master. I’ve thought about that a lot, and it still feels true. Old age brings calm and freedom; when strong feelings loosen their grip, as Sophocles said, we are free from many mad masters. The truth, Socrates, is that complaints about family and regrets come from people’s characters and moods, not from old age itself. Someone calm and happy won’t feel old age as a burden, but for someone else, youth and age are both hard.”

I listened closely, wanting him to say more. “Yes, Cephalus,” I said, “but I think most people don’t believe you. They think old age feels better to you not because you’re happy, but because you’re rich—and we all know money makes things easier.”

“You’re right,” he said. “People don’t believe me, and there’s some truth in what they say—but not as much as they think. I could answer them like Themistocles did when someone said he was famous only because he was Athenian. He said, ‘If you were from my country or I from yours, neither of us would be famous.’”
