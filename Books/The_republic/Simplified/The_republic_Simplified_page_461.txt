I mean, you can look at a bed from different angles—sideways, straight on, or any other way—and it will look different, but the bed itself doesn’t actually change. The same goes for everything else.

Yes, he said, the difference is only how things seem, not how they really are.

Now let me ask you another question: What is painting supposed to be—copying things as they really are, or copying how they look?

How they look.

Then the painter is far from the truth and can do anything because he only copies a small part of things, and that part is just an image. For example, a painter can paint a cobbler, carpenter, or any other worker even if he doesn’t know their job. If he’s good, he might even fool kids or simple people when they see his picture of a carpenter from far away, making them think it’s a real carpenter.

Definitely.

And when someone tells us they found a person who knows everything about all jobs and all other things better than anyone else, I think we can only imagine that person is simple and was probably tricked by some magician or actor. They thought this person knew everything because they didn’t understand what real knowledge or copying is.

That’s true.

So, when people say that tragic poets, like Homer who is the best, know all arts and all human things, both good and bad, and even about gods—because a good poet can’t write well unless he knows his topic—we should think about whether this might be another mistake. Maybe they met imitators and got fooled. Maybe they forgot that the works they saw were just copies three times removed from the truth, and anyone could make them without really knowing the truth, since they are only appearances, not real things. Or maybe they are right, and poets do really know what they seem to know.

The question, he said, should definitely be thought about.

Now do you think if someone could make the real thing as well as the copy, they would spend their time making copies?
