Are the questions about whether the kids will hear the same stories and ideas from everyone in the city, especially about who their parents and family are?

He said yes, and nothing else. Because what’s more silly than just saying you’re family but not acting like it?

In our city, people will talk a lot about getting along and being peaceful more than anywhere else. Like I said before, when someone is feeling good or bad, everyone will say “I feel good” or “I feel bad.” That’s true.

And don’t you think this way of thinking and talking means they’ll share their happiness and sadness?

Yes, they will.

They’ll all care about the same things and call them “mine,” sharing the same feelings of joy and pain?

Yes, much more than in other places.

And the main reason for this, besides how the city is set up, is that the guardians will share wives and children?

That’s the main reason.

We agreed that this feeling of being united is the best thing, like how a body and its parts feel pleasure or pain together?

Yes, we agreed and it makes sense.

So, sharing wives and children among the citizens is clearly the best thing for the city?

Definitely.

This also fits with the rule that guardians won’t own houses, land, or anything else. They’ll get food from others as pay and won’t have private expenses because they need to stay true guardians.

Right, he said.

Both sharing property and sharing families help make the guardians better. They won’t break the city apart by arguing over “mine” and “not mine,” or by keeping their own homes with private families and feelings. Instead, they’ll all share the same joys and pains because they agree on what matters most, and so they all work toward the same goal.
