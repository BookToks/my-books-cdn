The education we give them will be the best, much better than what cobblers get, and it will train the best women. This will be very good for the State. So, let them be brave and pure, and help fight and protect their country. Anyone who laughs at them is just foolish.

The first idea is done, and we see that men and women have the same duties and goals. Now, a bigger idea is coming—sharing wives and children. Is this a good and possible idea? I know it’s a good idea, but I’m not sure if it can really happen. Others also doubt both parts. I wanted to avoid proving the first part, but since you noticed, I will try. Let me imagine what could be, and then I will talk about what really can be.

First, our rulers will make and enforce laws, and their helpers will follow them. As a lawmaker, you have already picked the men; now you will pick the women. After choosing, they will live in shared houses, eat together, and be brought together by a rule stronger than math. But they can’t live in wild freedom; that is bad, and the rulers want to stop it. So, special marriage festivals will be made, and their importance will match how useful they are. Here, Glaucon, I want to ask you (since you breed birds and animals), don’t you take great care in how they mate? “Yes, I do.” Then it makes sense that we should be just as careful with human marriages.

Our rulers must be smart doctors for the State. Sometimes they will need to tell lies to make good matches happen. The good people will marry the good, and the bad with the bad. The children of the good will be raised, and the others destroyed. This way, the community stays strong. Marriage festivals will happen at set times based on population, and brides and grooms will meet there. The rulers will use a clever system of lots to make sure brave and good-looking people marry each other, and the less good marry among themselves. The unlucky will think it’s chance, but it’s really the rulers’ plan.

When children are born, the children of the brave and good will be taken to a special place in the city and cared for by nurses. The others will be taken away to unknown places. Mothers will nurse the children, but no one will know their own babies. If needed, other nurses can be hired too.
