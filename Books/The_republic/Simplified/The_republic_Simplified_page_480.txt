From these ends, the spindle of Necessity stretches out, and all the spinning parts turn around it. The pole and hook of this spindle are made of steel, and the round parts called whorls are made partly of steel and partly of other materials.

The whorl looks like the ones used on Earth. There is one big hollow whorl that is scooped out, and inside it fit seven smaller whorls, making eight in total. They are like bowls that fit inside each other. You can see their edges on the top side, and on the bottom, all the whorls together make one smooth whorl. The spindle goes through the center of the eighth whorl. The biggest whorl on the outside has the widest edge, and the seven inside whorls get narrower in this order: the sixth is next biggest, then the fourth, then the eighth, then the seventh, the fifth, the third, and finally the second.

The largest whorl, which holds the fixed stars, shines with many little lights. The seventh whorl, which is the sun, is the brightest. The eighth whorl, or moon, gets its color from the light of the sun. The second and fifth whorls (Saturn and Mercury) look similar in color and are yellower than the others. The third whorl (Venus) shines the whitest. The fourth (Mars) is reddish, and the sixth (Jupiter) is the second whitest.

The whole spindle spins the same way, but as it turns, the seven inner circles move slowly in the opposite direction. The fastest of these is the eighth whorl; next fastest are the seventh, sixth, and fifth, which move together. The third moves next, then the fourth, and finally the second moves the slowest.

The spindle turns on the knees of Necessity. On the top of each circle, there is a siren who goes around singing a single note. Together, the eight sirens make one harmony. Around them, at equal spaces, is another band of three figures sitting on their thrones. These are the Fates, daughters of Necessity, dressed in white robes with wreaths on their heads. Their names are Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos, and their voices join the harmony of the sirens.

Lachesis sings about the past, Clotho about the present, and Atropos about the future. Clotho sometimes helps by touching the outer circle of the spindle with her right hand, and Atropos guides the inner circles with her left hand. Lachesis holds onto either hand in turn.

When Er and the spirits arrived, their first job was to go straight to Lachesis. But before that, a prophet came to organize them. Then he took lots and samples of lives from Lachesisâ€™s knees, climbed a high pulpit, and spoke these words: "Hear the word of Lachesis, daughter of Necessity."
