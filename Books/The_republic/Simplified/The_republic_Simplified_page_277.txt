No way.

Will he get lazier and more careless?

Yes, definitely.

And does that mean he becomes a worse potter?

Yes, he gets much worse.

No, that's not true.

That's clear.

Wealth and poverty, I said. Wealth causes luxury and laziness, while poverty causes cheapness and bad behavior, and both make people unhappy.

That's very true, he said. But I still want to know, Socrates, how can our city fight wars, especially against a rich and powerful enemy, if we don't have new soldiers?

It would be hard to fight one such enemy, I answered, but it’s not hard if there are two enemies.

How is that? he asked.

First, I said, if we have to fight, our side will have trained warriors fighting against an army of rich men.

That's true, he said.

Probably not if both attacked him at the same time.

What if, I said, he could run away and then turn and hit the one who came first?
