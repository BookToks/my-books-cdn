Have you ever noticed how copying things from a young age, and doing it for a long time, can turn into habits that affect how you act, talk, and think?

Yes, definitely, he said.

So, I said, we shouldn’t let the people we care about—especially young people who should grow up to be good—copy a woman who is fighting with her husband, or showing off to the gods because she thinks she’s happy, or when she is sad, crying, or sick, or in love, or giving birth.

That’s right, he said.

They also shouldn’t copy slaves, whether they are men or women, doing slave tasks.

They must not.

And of course, they shouldn’t copy bad people, like cowards or anyone who does the opposite of what we just said—people who insult or make fun of each other when drunk or sober, or who treat themselves and others badly with words or actions. Madness, like bad behavior, should be known about but never copied or practiced.

Very true, he said.

They also can’t copy blacksmiths, craftsmen, sailors, or similar workers.

How could they, he said, if they aren’t allowed to think about those jobs?

Nor can they copy sounds like horses neighing, bulls bellowing, rivers flowing, the ocean rolling, thunder, or things like that?

No, he said, if madness is forbidden, they can’t copy mad behavior.

You mean, I said, if I understand you right, that a truly good person uses one way of telling stories when they have something to say, and a person with a different character and background uses another way.

And what are those two ways?
