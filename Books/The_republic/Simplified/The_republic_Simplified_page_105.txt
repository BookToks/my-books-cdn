It’s not surprising that people who wanted to find order in nature and numbers thought one could explain the other. Plato believed numbers had a power way beyond what he could see in the world around him. He also knew how important the simple numbers 1, 2, and 3 are in learning.

He might have even guessed some ideas that Quetelet and others later discovered—that numbers depend on other numbers. For example, in a population, the number of births depends on the number of children born of each sex and the ages of the parents, which are also numbers.

BOOK IX. Last of all comes the tyrant, and we have to ask where he comes from and if he lives happily or sadly. But first, I want to think about the kinds and amounts of desires people have. Some desires are wrong, but they can be controlled or weakened by reason and law. “What desires do you mean?” I mean the ones that show up when we’re not thinking clearly, the ones that act without respect or shame. These desires can cause people to imagine and do crazy or cruel things. “True,” he said, “very true.” But when a person’s feelings are calm, and they’ve fed their mind with reason and understand themselves before resting, and have satisfied their wants just enough so they don’t disturb their clear thinking, then their thoughts before sleep are the least wild and strange. Even good people have a wild, animal side that comes out in sleep.

To go back: you remember what was said about the democrat. He was the son of a stingy father who encouraged saving money and stopped expensive or fancy spending. The young man later met better people and started to dislike his father’s tight ways. Being better than the bad influences around him, he chose a middle path, living not wildly or without rules, but enjoying regular, controlled pleasures. Now imagine this young man has become a father and has a son who faces the same temptations, with friends pushing him toward bad choices and family trying to keep him on the right path. The bad influences realize their only chance to control him is to plant a monster inside him—love. While other desires buzz around confusing him with sweet feelings and smells, this monster love takes over and stops any honest or simple thoughts or wishes. Love, like drunkenness or madness, is a kind of tyranny. The tyrant inside a person, whether made by nature or habit, is just a crazy, wild animal.

And how does this person live? “You have to tell me that.” Well, I think he lives in wild parties and bad behavior, with love as the boss of his life. Many desires need lots of money, so he spends all he has and borrows more. And when he has nothing left, his young children are still in the nest, crying for food.
