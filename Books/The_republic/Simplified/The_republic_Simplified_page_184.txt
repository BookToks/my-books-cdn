Sure.

If you want to buy a ship, who’s better—the shipbuilder or the pilot?

True.

So, what about using silver or gold? When is a fair person better?

When you want to keep a deposit safe.

You mean when you don’t want to spend money, just keep it safe?

Exactly.

So, justice is useful when money can’t be used?

That’s right.

And when you want to keep pruning hooks safe, justice helps both the person and the community; but when you want to use the hooks, then the vine-dresser’s skill is needed?

Of course.

And when you want to keep a shield or a lyre safe without using them, justice is useful; but when you want to use them, then the soldier’s or musician’s skill is needed?

Definitely.

So, for all things: justice is helpful when you don’t use them, but useless when you do?

That’s the idea.

So justice isn’t very useful then. But here’s another thought: isn’t the best boxer also the best at blocking punches?

Yes.

And the person who’s best at avoiding or escaping sickness is also best at causing it?

True.

And the best camp guard is also the best at sneaking into the enemy’s camp?

Yes.
