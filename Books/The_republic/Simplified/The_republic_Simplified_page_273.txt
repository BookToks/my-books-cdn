Yes, we need to be very careful.

Wouldn’t a really good education be the best way to keep them safe?

But they are already well-educated, he said.

I’m not so sure, my dear Glaucon, I replied. I’m much more certain about how they should be, and that real education, whatever that is, will help make them more kind and respectful to each other and to the people they protect.

That’s true, he said.

And not only their education, but also where they live and everything they have should be set up so they don’t lose their good character as guardians or get tempted to take advantage of other citizens. Anyone with sense would agree with that.

They must.

Now, let’s think about how they should live if they are going to be what we want. First, none of them should own anything beyond what they really need. They should not have private houses or shops that are closed off to others. Their food should be only enough for trained warriors who are self-controlled and brave. They should agree to get a fixed pay from the citizens, just enough for the year and no more. They will eat and live together like soldiers in a camp.

We will tell them that gold and silver belong to the gods; it is a special metal inside them. So, they don’t need the common metals people use, and they shouldn’t mix with those earthly metals. Common metals have caused many bad things, but their own metals are pure. Only they, out of all citizens, may not touch or use silver or gold, live under the same roof as those who do, wear them, or drink from them.

This will save them, and they will save the State. But if they ever get homes, lands, or money of their own, they will become housekeepers and farmers instead of guardians. They will become enemies instead of friends of the citizens. They will hate and be hated, plan against others and be planned against, living in more fear from inside the State than from outside enemies. The time of destruction for themselves and the State will come quickly.

For all these reasons, can we say that this is how our State should be organized? And that these should be the rules for guardians about their houses and everything else?

Yes, said Glaucon.
