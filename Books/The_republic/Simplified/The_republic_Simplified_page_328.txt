That’s great, he said.

Yes, I said; and when a man dies gloriously in war, shouldn’t we first say that he is part of a special, golden group?

Of course.

Don’t we have Hesiod’s authority to say that when they are dead, ‘They are holy angels on earth, doers of good, keepers of evil away, and protectors of those who can speak’?

Yes; and we accept that.

We need to learn from the gods how to honor these divine and heroic people, and what makes them special; and we must follow what the gods say?

Absolutely.

In the future, we will respect them and kneel at their graves like heroes. Not just them, but anyone who is very good, whether they die of old age or in any other way, should get the same honors.

That’s exactly right, he said.

Next, how should our soldiers treat their enemies? What about this?

What do you mean?

First, about slavery? Do you think it’s right for Greeks to enslave other Greek states, or let others enslave them if they can? Shouldn’t they spare each other, because there’s a risk that all of us might one day be controlled by barbarians?

It’s much better to spare them.

Then no Greek should be owned as a slave by another; that should be a rule they follow and advise other Greeks to follow.

Certainly, he said; this way they will be united against the barbarians and won’t fight each other.

Next, about the dead; I asked, should the winners take anything except their armor?
