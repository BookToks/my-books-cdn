Every Greek city had its own story about how it began. Plato’s idea of a perfect city might also have a story about people born from the earth. The way this story is told makes it seem serious and believable, just like other Greek traditions. Ancient poets talked about different ages of people made of gold, silver, bronze, and iron, one after another. But Plato thinks these different types of people all live together in one city.

Myths help teach lessons in a way that’s easier to understand and more interesting, like Protagoras says, “the myth is more interesting.” Myths also let Plato mention new ideas without explaining everything in detail. In this part, he hints at a general truth but doesn’t explain exactly how people’s social ranks change. Throughout the Republic, Plato lets the lower classes fade into the background. We don’t know if they are allowed to carry weapons or if they have to follow the same rules about sharing property and marriage. It doesn’t make sense to argue too much based on a few random words or because Plato doesn’t mention something. Aristotle criticized Plato’s view of the lower classes but didn’t realize that this story is like air—untouchable and can’t be fully explained by logic.

Two ideas in the third book of the Republic seem very strange and perfect to modern readers, and they make us think a lot. First is the great power of music, which Plato says is much stronger than what we experience today, even though art and science have improved. Second is the almost total control the soul is supposed to have over the body.

About the first idea, we might think Plato is exaggerating, like some modern artists sometimes do. Along with this strong feeling, Plato also shows respect for numbers and math, like the Pythagoreans did. Aristotle didn’t share this idea. Plato thought musical notes and numbers were sacred and had their own rules, not just based on what we hear. They connected to bigger ideas beyond our senses. Plato believed this was true. The effect of a simple, powerful melody on the Greek mind is stronger than we can easily understand. The feeling from a country’s national songs is a bit like this. Also, Plato mixes the idea of musical harmony with the harmony between soul and body, which music strongly inspires.

The second strange idea raises some interesting questions: How much control can the mind have over the body? Are the mind and body enemies or friends? Are they two separate things or one? And does one cause the other?
