But humans are not made to be eaten, nor just because they are better at fighting, running, or pulling carts. Improving humans isn’t just about making their bodies bigger or stronger, but about growing and opening up their minds. So, true marriage should be about connecting minds as well as bodies, combining imagination and reason along with feelings and instincts. People without feelings or imagination are rightly called animals; yet Plato took away these qualities and didn’t replace them with anything, not even the desire to have good children, since parents wouldn’t even know their own kids. The most important part of social life, which is marriage, Plato turned into something very harsh. Couples would only meet at the wedding, their children would belong to the state, and there would be no love or connection between them. 

Still, the way animals behave could have saved Plato from a huge mistake if he had only paid attention to his own example. Because the nobler kinds of birds and animals take care of their babies and stay loyal to each other.

A famous scientist thinks it’s worth trying to explain life based on the body. But shouldn’t life be based on morals instead of just the body?

The higher part comes first, then the lower; first the human and reason, then the animal. But they aren’t completely separate. When people are sick or lazy, these parts just look like different sides of the same human nature that includes both. Morality isn’t the limit of the body but its growth and improvement—the best form the body can have. As Plato said, the body doesn’t take care of itself or the mind, but the mind takes care of both.

In everything people do, what makes us different from animals is not what we share with them, but what sets us apart. Even if we accept that virtue is just about having a healthy body, we still have to think about ideas. Mind, reason, duty, and conscience always come back. You can’t have a healthy body without a healthy mind, or a healthy mind without a sense of duty and love for truth.

It’s surprising that the greatest ancient philosopher made the mistake of separating body and mind in his ideas about marriage. But what’s even more surprising is that Plato, who was so idealistic, contradicted himself so much and suddenly fell from his high ideas into the most basic animal thinking. He enjoyed his new ability to think deeply but didn’t follow the good feelings of his own time on this subject. Most people in ancient Greece didn’t agree with his strange ideas. The old poets and later the playwrights showed respect for the family, which was very important to their religion.
