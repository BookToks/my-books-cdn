Yes, and I think our ideas are right, he said.

But if people are going to be brave, don’t they need to learn other things too? Like lessons that help them stop being scared of death? Can anyone be brave if they are afraid of dying?

Definitely not, he said.

And can someone not be afraid of death, or choose to die in battle instead of being defeated and made a slave, if they believe the afterlife is real and scary?

No way.

So, we have to control the people who tell these kinds of stories, and ask them not to make the afterlife sound awful. Instead, they should say good things about it, because their scary stories will hurt the courage of future fighters.

That will be our responsibility, he said.

Then, I said, we will have to remove many bad parts, starting with the lines, "I would rather be a poor farmer’s servant than rule over all the dead who are nothing." We also have to cut out the verse that says Pluto was afraid, "Lest the ugly and sad mansions that the gods hate be seen by mortals and immortals." And again: "Oh heavens!"
