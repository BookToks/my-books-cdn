Sure, he said.

Since people only have themselves, their own clothes, and their complaints, there won’t be any fights about money, kids, or family stuff.

Of course, there won’t be.

They also won’t have fights or insults between each other. Because equals should defend themselves against equals, we think that’s fair and right. Protecting people will be very important.

That sounds good, he said.

Yes, and there’s another good thing about the law: if someone is mad at another person, they will deal with it right away and won’t make it worse.

Definitely.

The elders will be in charge of leading and correcting the younger people.

Obviously.

And it’s clear the younger ones won’t hit or hurt an elder unless the leaders tell them to. They also won’t disrespect them. Two things stop them: shame, which makes people avoid hurting their parents, and fear, because the elder’s family will protect them.

That’s true, he said.

So, the laws will help people live peacefully with each other?

Yes, there will be plenty of peace.

And since the leaders won’t fight among themselves, the rest of the city won’t be divided or fighting either.
