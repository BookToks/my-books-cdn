But if, while turning, the axis tilts to the right or left, forward or backward, then from no point of view can it be still.

That’s the right way to describe it, he answered.

Then none of these doubts will confuse us or make us believe that the same thing, at the same time, in the same place, or in relation to the same thing, can act or be acted on in opposite ways.

Definitely not, in my opinion.

Still, I said, so we don’t have to deal with all these doubts and prove they are wrong in detail, let’s just assume they are silly for now and keep going, understanding that if this assumption turns out to be wrong, we will take back everything that follows.

Yes, he said, that’s the best way.

Well, I said, wouldn’t you agree that agreeing and disagreeing, wanting and not wanting, liking and disliking are all opposites, whether they are active or passive (because that doesn’t change the fact they are opposites)?

Yes, he said, they are opposites.

Well, I said, and what about hunger and thirst, and desires in general, and also being willing and wishing—wouldn’t you put all these into the groups you just mentioned? You would say, right, that a person’s soul who desires something is looking for what they want; or that they are pulling toward themselves what they wish to have; or that when a person wants something to be given to them, their mind shows this wish like they were nodding yes to a question?

Very true.

And what about not wanting, disliking, and lacking desire—shouldn’t these belong to the opposite group of pushing away and rejecting?

Certainly.

Since this is true about desire in general, let’s focus on a special kind of desire, and from these, we’ll pick hunger and thirst because they are the most obvious.

Let’s take that group, he said.

The object of one is food, and the other is drink?
