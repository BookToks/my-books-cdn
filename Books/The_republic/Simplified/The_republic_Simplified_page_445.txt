Yes, pleasure is the greatest feeling; but can you explain why?

I will figure out the topic, and you will answer my questions.

Go ahead.

So, isn’t pleasure the opposite of pain?

That’s true.

And there is a neutral feeling that is neither pleasure nor pain?

Yes, there is.

A feeling in the middle, kind of like a calm state of mind between pleasure and pain—is that what you mean?

Yes.

Do you remember what people say when they are sick?

What do they say?

They say that nothing feels better than being healthy. But they didn’t really know this was the greatest pleasure until they got sick.

Yes, I know, he said.

And when people are in a lot of pain, you must have heard them say that nothing feels better than getting rid of their pain?

I have.

And there are many times when people are suffering, and just resting or having the pain stop—not any happy feeling—is called the greatest pleasure by them?

Yes, he said; at those times, they are happy and content just to rest.

Also, when pleasure goes away, that kind of rest or stopping will feel painful?

Definitely, he said.

So the middle state of rest will be both pleasure and pain?

It seems that way.

But can something that is neither pleasure nor pain become both?

I don’t think so.

And both pleasure and pain are feelings of the mind, right?
