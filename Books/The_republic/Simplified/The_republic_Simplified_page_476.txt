A love of wisdom. Let’s see who she influences, what kind of people and conversations she attracts because she’s close to something immortal, eternal, and divine. Also, let’s think about how different she would be if she fully followed this higher principle, guided by a divine force, leaving behind the ocean she’s in now, and breaking free from the stones, shells, and other earthly things that grow around her. She feeds on the earth and is surrounded by what people call the good things in life. Then you would see her true self and understand whether she has only one form or many, and what her real nature is. I think we’ve said enough about her feelings and the shapes she takes in this life.

True, he replied.

And so, I said, we have met the conditions of the argument; we haven’t talked about the rewards and honors of justice that you said are found in Homer and Hesiod. Instead, we’ve shown that justice itself is best for the soul by its own nature. Let a person act justly, whether or not they have the ring of Gyges, and even if they also wear the helmet of Hades.

Very true.

Now, Glaucon, it won’t hurt to list how many and how great the rewards are that justice and other virtues give to the soul from both gods and people, in life and after death.

Definitely not, he said.

Will you then give me back what you borrowed in the argument?

What did I borrow?

The idea that a just person might seem unjust, and an unjust person might seem just. You thought that even if gods and people couldn’t miss what’s really true, we should accept this idea for the sake of the argument, so pure justice could be compared with pure injustice. Do you remember?

I’d be to blame if I forgot.

Now that the cause is decided, I ask, on behalf of justice, that we restore the respect she deserves from gods and people, which we admit is right. Since justice has been shown to be real and not to fool those who truly have it, let’s give back what’s been taken from her, so she can win the prize of appearance too, which belongs to her and those who have her.

The demand, he said, is fair.
