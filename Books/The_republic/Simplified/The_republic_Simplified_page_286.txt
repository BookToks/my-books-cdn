I want to hear what you’re saying again because I don’t think I fully understand you.

I mean that courage is a kind of safety.

Safety from what?

Safety from the ideas we have about what things are scary, what they really are, and their true nature, which the law teaches us through education. When I say “in all situations,” I mean that whether a person is happy or in pain, or feeling desire or fear, they keep this idea and don’t lose it. Should I give you an example?

Yes, please.

You know, I said, that when dyers want to make true sea-purple wool, they first pick a white color carefully and prepare it well. This way, the white wool can fully take on the purple color. After dyeing, the color stays strong, and washing—even with strong soap or without it—won’t remove the color. But if the wool isn’t properly prepared, you’ve probably seen how dull and washed-out the purple or any other color looks.

Yes, he said; I know it looks faded and pretty bad.

So now, I said, you’ll understand why we choose and train our soldiers with music and exercise. We want to prepare them so they fully accept the law’s ideas, and the way they think about dangers and other things will be fixed strongly by their training. These ideas won’t be washed away by things like pleasure—which is even stronger at changing the soul than soap—or by sadness, fear, and desire, which are the strongest forces of all. I call this strong, unchanging belief in the law about real and fake dangers courage, unless you disagree.

But I agree, he said; I guess you mean to leave out untrained courage, like that of a wild animal or a slave—this kind of courage isn’t what the law wants and should have a different name.

Definitely.

So, can I say courage is what you describe?

Yes, I said, you can, and if you add the words “of a citizen,” you won’t be too wrong. Later, if you want, we can talk more about this, but right now we aren’t looking for courage—we’re looking for justice. And for this part of our discussion, we’ve said enough.
