And please, as Glaucon asked you, don’t talk about what people think about justice; because if you mix up what’s true and false about it, we won’t say you’re praising real justice, just how it looks. We’ll think you’re only telling us to hide injustice and that you actually agree with Thrasymachus, who says justice is just what benefits others and the strong, while injustice is what benefits a person even if it hurts the weak.

Now that you’ve admitted justice is one of the best things—wanted not just for what it brings but for itself, like seeing, hearing, knowing, or being healthy—I want you to focus on one thing when you talk about justice. I mean the true good or bad effects that justice and injustice have on the people who have them. Let others talk about justice and injustice by praising the rewards and honor of one and blaming the other. I can accept that from them, but since you’ve studied this whole question your whole life, I expect better from you.

So, I say, don’t just prove that justice is better than injustice, but also show what each one does to the person who has it. Explain why one is good and the other is bad, whether gods and people see it or not.

I had always admired how smart Glaucon and Adeimantus were, but when I heard these words, I was really happy. I said: Sons of a great father, that was a good start to the poem that a fan of Glaucon wrote for you after you did well at the Battle of Megara. He sang, “Sons of Ariston, divine children of a great hero.” That description fits well because it’s amazing to argue for injustice being better and still not believe your own arguments.

And I think you don’t believe them—that’s what I guess from who you are. If I only judged by what you said, I might not trust you. But now, the more I trust you, the harder it is for me to know what to say. I’m stuck between two things. On one side, I feel like I can’t do this. I realized this because you weren’t happy with what I said to Thrasymachus, where I tried to prove justice is better than injustice.

Still, I can’t refuse to help while I’m alive and able to speak. I’m afraid it would be wrong to stand by and let justice be insulted without defending her. So, I’ll help as much as I can.

Glaucon and the others begged me not to stop the discussion but to keep trying to figure it out.
