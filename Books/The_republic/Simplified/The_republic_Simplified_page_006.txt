 Neither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part of a still larger designwhichwastohaveincludedanidealhistoryofAthens,aswellasapolitical and physical philosophy. The fragment of the Critias has given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only in importance to the tale of Troy and the legendofArthur; andissaidasafacttohaveinspiredsomeoftheearlynavigators of the sixteenth century.

Wemayjudgefromthenoblecommencementof theTimaeus,fromthefragmentoftheCritiasitself,andfromthethirdbookof the Laws, in what manner Plato would have treated this high argument. We can only guess why the great design was abandoned; perhaps because Plato became sensible of some incongruity in a fictitious history, or because he had lost his interest in it, or because advancing years forbade the completion of it; andwemaypleaseourselveswiththefancythathadthisimaginarynarrative everbeenfinished,weshouldhavefoundPlatohimselfsympathisingwiththe struggleforHellenicindependence(cp.Laws),singingahymnoftriumphover Marathon and Salamis, perhaps making the reflection of Herodotus where he contemplates the growth of the Athenian empire–’How brave a thing is freedomofspeech, whichhasmadetheAthenianssofarexceedeveryotherstate ofHellasingreatness!’ or,moreprobably,attributingthevictorytotheancient good order of Athens and to the favor of Apollo and Athene (cp.
