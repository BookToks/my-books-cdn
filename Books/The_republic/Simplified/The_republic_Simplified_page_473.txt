Is there something you call good and something else you call evil?

Yes, he replied.

Would you agree that the part that ruins and destroys is evil, and the part that saves and makes better is good?

Yes.

And you admit that everything has both good and evil; like how eye disease is bad for eyes, and sickness is bad for the body; like how mildew harms corn, and rot harms wood or rust harms metal. Almost everything has some kind of built-in evil or sickness?

Yes, he said.

And anything that catches these evils becomes bad, and in the end breaks down and dies?

True.

The bad and evil inside each thing is what destroys it; and if that bad part doesn’t destroy it, nothing else will; because good things won’t destroy it, and things that are neither good nor bad won’t either.

Definitely not.

So, if we find something that has this built-in corruption but cannot be destroyed or broken down, we can be sure that it cannot be destroyed?

That makes sense.

Well, I said, is there no evil that can ruin the soul?

Yes, he said, there are evils like unfairness, lack of self-control, fear, and ignorance.

But do any of these evils break down or destroy the soul? And don’t make the mistake of thinking that an unfair or foolish person dies because of their own wrong actions, which are bad for the soul. Think about the body: the body’s evil is sickness that wastes away and destroys it; and all the things we talked about come to an end because their own corruption sticks to them and destroys them. Is that true?

Yes.

Think about the soul the same way. Does injustice or other evils in the soul waste away and destroy it?
