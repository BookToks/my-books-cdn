This kind of science is the highest way of thinking. It’s like the soul talking to itself or connecting with eternal truth and beauty. It’s also like the never-ending questions and answers, like Socrates always asked. Plato’s dialogues show this kind of thinking and how it works. The idea of "good" is a force or reason that makes the outside world match the inside world. But even the outside world is still a world of ideas.

Plato also looked at nature, but this was a different kind of knowledge. Here, he only tried to find probable answers (Timaeus).

If we ask whether Plato’s science of dialectic is closer to logic or metaphysics, the answer is that he didn’t clearly separate the two. He didn’t separate the inside and outside views of the world and people, which later German philosophy explained. He also didn’t decide if dialectic was about things staying the same or about change and growth. 

Modern metaphysics is the study of ideas or how thoughts change over time. Modern logic, when it goes beyond simple rules, is the study of method. Both these ideas are found in Plato’s dialectic. All metaphysicians share something with Plato’s ideas, and all logicians learned from Plato’s method. The closest modern idea to Plato’s universal science is found in Hegel’s idea of moments united as one. 

Plato and Hegel both saw the world as connected ideas, and maybe they would have understood each other better than their followers do.

In Swift’s "Voyage to Laputa," he talks about wanting to meet famous old thinkers. One day, he set aside time to see them. He thought Homer and Aristotle would appear first, but many others showed up too.

He could tell Homer and Aristotle apart right away. Homer was taller, looked better, stood straight, and had sharp, quick eyes. Aristotle was bent over, used a stick, looked thin and tired, and had a weak voice. Neither of them knew the others there, and a ghost whispered that the commentators stayed far away from their teachers because they felt ashamed for misunderstanding them badly.

He introduced Didymus and Eustathius to Homer and got Homer to treat them better than they might deserve because they needed a smart person to understand a poet’s spirit.
