That’s pretty true, he said.

But with rich people, it’s different. We don’t say they have a special job they must do to live.

People usually think rich folks don’t have much to do.

Have you never heard the saying from Phocylides, that as soon as a person can support themselves, they should start being good?

No, he said, I think it’s better if they start even earlier.

Let’s not argue about that, I said. Instead, let’s ask ourselves: Is it necessary for rich people to be good, or can they live without it?

And if it’s necessary, then we should ask if being too focused on controlling your body, which can stop you from working with your hands or doing physical tasks, also gets in the way of what Phocylides said.

There’s no doubt about that, he replied; taking care of your body too much, beyond normal exercise, makes it hard to be good.

Yes, I answered, and it also makes it hard to manage a household, an army, or a government job. Most important, it messes up any kind of studying, thinking, or self-reflection. People often think headaches or dizziness come from philosophy, so they stop practicing or trying to be good in a serious way. They’re always worried they’re getting sick and stressed about their body.

That’s probably true.

So, our smart doctor Asclepius only showed his skills to people who were usually healthy but had a specific problem. He treated them with purges and surgeries and told them to live normally, thinking about what’s best for the country. But if someone was sick all over, he wouldn’t try slow treatments. He didn’t want to keep alive useless lives or have weak parents make weaker kids. If a person couldn’t live a normal life, there was no point in curing them because it wouldn’t help them or the country.

So, you think of Asclepius as a politician?

Definitely. His character is shown even more by his sons. Remember, they were heroes long ago and used the medicine I’m talking about during the Trojan War. You’ll recall when Pandarus hurt Menelaus, they sucked the blood from the wound and put on soothing medicine, but they never told Menelaus what to eat or drink afterward, just like with Eurypylus. They believed the treatment was enough to heal anyone who was healthy and lived well before the injury. Even though Menelaus drank some bad wine, he could still get better.
