The story goes that anyone who has tasted the insides of even one human victim mixed with others is doomed to become a wolf. Haven't you heard that?

Oh, yes.

The protector of the people is just like that; he has a mob completely under his control and isn’t stopped from killing his own people. Using lies and false accusations, he brings them to court and kills them, making people’s lives disappear. With his evil words and lips that have tasted the blood of his own citizens, some he kills and others he sends away. At the same time, he talks about getting rid of debts and sharing lands. After all this, what will happen to him? Won’t he either be killed by his enemies or turn into a wolf — that is, become a tyrant?

Definitely.

I said this is the man who starts making a group against the rich?

Exactly the same.

After a while, he is kicked out but comes back, despite his enemies, as a full-grown tyrant.

That’s clear.

And if they can’t kick him out or get him sentenced to death by a public trial, they plan to kill him secretly.

Yes, that’s what usually happens.

Then comes the famous request for a bodyguard, which is the trick of all who have gone this far in their tyrant path — “Let the people’s friend not be lost to them,” they say. Exactly.

The people agree easily; they only worry about him — they don’t worry about themselves.

Very true.

And when a rich man who is also accused of being an enemy of the people sees this, then, my friend, like the oracle told Croesus, “By the rocky Hermus shore he runs away and never stops, and is not ashamed to be a coward.” And that’s right, because if he were brave, he would never be ashamed again.

But if he gets caught, he dies.
