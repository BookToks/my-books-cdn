But is war something you can learn quickly, so a man can be a good fighter even if he is also a farmer, shoemaker, or other craftsman? No one would be a good player of dice or checkers if they only played for fun and never practiced from a young age. No tools will make someone skilled at a job or fighting unless they know how to use them and have spent time learning.

So, how can someone who just picks up a shield or weapon become a good fighter right away, whether with heavy armor or any other kind of troops?

Yes, he said, the tools that teach their own use would be very valuable.

And the more important the job of the guardian, I said, the more time, skill, and effort will be needed.

No doubt, he replied.

Won’t he also need natural talent for his job?

Certainly.

Then it’s our duty to choose people who are naturally fit for guarding the city, if we can?

It will be.

And choosing them won’t be easy, I said, but we must be brave and try our best.

We must.

Isn’t a noble young person like a well-trained dog when it comes to guarding and watching?

What do you mean?

I mean both should be quick to see the enemy and fast to catch him; and strong if they have to fight him once caught.

All these qualities, he said, will definitely be needed.

Well, your guardian must be brave to fight well, right?

Certainly.

And can someone be brave without spirit? Whether horse, dog, or any other animal? Haven’t you seen how strong and unbeatable spirit is, and how it makes any creature’s soul totally fearless and impossible to defeat?

I have.
