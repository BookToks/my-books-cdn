There is a truth higher than what we experience, and our minds can recognize it. Many people today strongly believe this, and it might be becoming more popular. Among the Greek writers who became important during the Renaissance, Plato had the biggest influence.

Plato’s book, The Republic, is the first real book about education. Writers like Milton, Locke, Rousseau, Jean Paul, and Goethe followed his ideas. Like Dante or Bunyan, Plato had a vision of another life. Like Bacon, he believed all knowledge is connected. He influenced early Church ideas about religion and later ideas about politics. Even when people quote his words from far away, they still inspire others by showing a higher side of human nature. Plato is the founder of idealism in philosophy, politics, and literature. Many modern ideas, like the unity of knowledge, rule of law, and equal rights for men and women, were dreamed of by him long ago.

The main topic of The Republic is the search for Justice. This starts with Cephalus, an honest old man, who gives the first hint about justice. Then Socrates and Polemarchus talk about it based on common ideas of right and wrong. Thrasymachus argues in a negative way about justice, and Socrates partly explains it. Glaucon and Adeimantus make it more abstract. Justice, which is hard to see in individuals, becomes clear in the perfect State that Socrates describes.

The rulers’ first job is to make sure everyone is educated. This education is based on the old Greek model and focuses on better religion, morality, simple music and exercise, stronger poetry, and harmony between people and the State. Then the idea of a higher State comes up. In this State, no one owns anything privately, there is no marriage, and the rulers are both kings and philosophers. Education here is deeper, covering science and art, and lasts a lifetime, not just youth. This perfect State is hard to create and usually falls apart. After it falls, the government is run by soldiers and people who like honor, then it turns into democracy, and finally into tyranny, following a pattern that doesn’t match real history. When the cycle ends, things don’t start over again but go from the best to the worst, and that’s the end.

Next, the focus changes to the old argument between poetry and philosophy, which was only briefly mentioned before. Poetry is found to be an imitation far removed from the truth. Homer and other poets are seen as imitators and are banned. The idea of the State is then finished with a look at life after death.
