If you asked me whether the body can take care of itself or if it needs things, I would say: Of course the body needs things; it can get sick and needs to be healed. That’s why medicine exists—to help the body. You agree, right?

Yes, that’s right, he said.

But is medicine, or any other skill, ever imperfect or broken like how eyes can have bad vision or ears can have hearing problems? Does one skill need another skill to fix its problems? And does this keep going on and on? Or do skills only take care of what they are meant to, without needing help from others? Are skills perfect and don’t need fixing? Think carefully and tell me if I’m right.

Yes, clearly.

So, medicine doesn’t focus on medicine itself, but on what the body needs?

True, he said.

And the skill of horse riding doesn’t care about itself but cares about the horse; other skills don’t worry about themselves because they don’t need to. They only care about what they work on?

True, he said.

But isn’t it true, Thrasymachus, that skills are the bosses or rulers over what they work on?

He agreed, but not very easily.

So, I said, no skill or science looks out for the stronger or boss’s needs, only for the needs of the weaker or the one it works on?

He tried to argue, but finally agreed.

Then, I continued, a doctor, as a doctor, doesn’t think about what’s good for himself when he treats someone, but what’s good for his patient. A true doctor is like a ruler over the body, not just someone trying to make money; you agree with that?
