I think so too, he said.

Next, we should talk about melody and song.

That’s pretty obvious.

Everyone can already see what we should say about them if we want to be consistent.

I’m afraid, said Glaucon, laughing, that “everyone” doesn’t really include me, because I can’t say exactly what they should be right now, though I can guess.

Anyway, you can tell me that a song or ode has three parts—the words, the melody, and the rhythm. Can I assume that?

Yes, he said; you can.

And about the words, there’s no difference between words set to music and those that aren’t; both follow the same rules we already decided on?

Yes.

And the melody and rhythm depend on the words?

Definitely.

We said before, when we talked about the subject, that we didn’t need sad or sorrowful songs?

True.

Which harmonies express sorrow? You know music, so you can tell me.

The harmonies you mean are the mixed or tenor Lydian, the full tone or bass Lydian, and ones like those.

Those then, I said, must be banned; even for women who have character to keep, they’re useless, and even more so for men.

Certainly.

Also, drunkenness, softness, and laziness are totally wrong for our guardians’ character.

Totally wrong.

And which harmonies are soft or like drinking songs?

The Ionian, he replied, and the Lydian; they’re called “relaxed.”

Well, are these good for soldiers?
