Motion, I said, comes in many forms, not just one. Two of them are easy to see, even for people not very smart like us. There might be others too, but maybe only smarter people can understand those.

But where are those two?

There is a second one, I said, which matches the first one I already talked about.

What is it?

The second one, I said, seems to relate to hearing like the first one relates to seeing. I think eyes are made to look at stars, and ears are made to hear pleasant sounds. These two are like sister skills – as the Pythagoreans say, and we agree with them, right?

Yes, he said.

But this is a hard topic, so we should go learn from the experts. They can tell us if there are other ways these skills apply. At the same time, we must remember our main goal.

What is that?

There is a perfect understanding that all knowledge should reach, and our students should also reach it. They didn’t quite get there in astronomy, as I said before. The same thing happens in the study of harmony. Teachers of harmony listen to sounds and how they fit together, but their work, like the astronomers’, doesn’t get to the real point.

Yes, he said, it’s funny to hear them talk about their “condensed notes.” They put their ears close to the strings like they’re trying to hear a secret from a neighbor’s wall. Some say they hear an in-between note and found the smallest sound difference to measure. Others say two sounds have become the same. But they all listen with their ears before using their brains.

You mean those people who pull and twist the strings on instruments? I could keep using the same idea and talk about how they blame the strings for being too slow or too fast to make sound. But that would be boring. So I’ll just say these aren’t the real experts I mean. I’m talking about the Pythagoreans, who I want to ask about harmony. They make mistakes like the astronomers. They study the numbers in sounds but never get to the real problem – why some numbers sound good together and others don’t.
