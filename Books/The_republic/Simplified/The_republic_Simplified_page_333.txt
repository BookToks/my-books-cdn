I think, I said, that the State could be improved if we made just one big change. It’s not an easy change, but it’s still possible.

What is it? he asked.

Well, I said, I’m about to say something really important, even if it makes people laugh at me or think I’m crazy. Listen carefully.

Go ahead, he said.

I said: “Until philosophers become kings, or the kings and leaders start thinking like philosophers, mixing wisdom and power, and people who only care about one or the other step aside, cities will never be free from problems — and I believe neither will humanity. Only then will our State have a chance to live and see a better future.” 

That was my idea, Glaucon, but I almost didn’t say it because it sounds so wild. It’s hard to believe that no other State can be truly happy, for individuals or for everyone.

Socrates, what do you mean? he asked. You should know that many people, even important ones, will get really angry at you for saying that. They might attack you with words or worse before you even realize it. If you’re not ready with answers, they’ll tear you apart with their clever arguments.

You’ve got me into trouble, I said.

And I was right to warn you; but I’ll do my best to help you out. I can only offer good advice and maybe some better answers than others — that’s all. With that help, you have to try your hardest to prove you’re right to those who don’t believe you.

I ought to try, I said, since you’re offering to help. I think if we want to have any chance of convincing people, we must explain what we mean when we say philosophers should rule the State. Then we can defend our idea: some people are born to study philosophy and lead, while others are meant to follow, not lead.

Alright, now give me a clear definition, he said.

Follow me, I said, and I hope I can explain it well enough for you.
