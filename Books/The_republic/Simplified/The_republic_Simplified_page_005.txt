There are ideas close to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and the Sophist. The Politicus or Statesman is more about ideal ideas. The Laws explains the form and rules of the State more clearly. As works of art, the Symposium and the Protagoras are better.

But no other dialogue by Plato has such a wide view or such perfect style. None shows as much knowledge about the world or has as many new and old ideas from different times. Nowhere else in Plato’s writings is there deeper irony, more humor, better imagery, or stronger drama. Also, no other writing tries so hard to mix life and deep thinking or connect politics with philosophy.

The Republic is the main work around which the others can be grouped. Here, philosophy reaches its highest point, especially in Books V, VI, and VII. Plato, like Bacon in modern times, was the first to come up with a method of knowledge, even though neither of them always clearly separated the basic form from the true meaning. Both had to work with an abstract idea of science that wasn’t fully developed yet.

Plato was the greatest metaphysical genius the world has seen. In him, more than in any other ancient thinker, are the beginnings of future knowledge. The sciences of logic and psychology, which gave us many tools for thinking, are based on the ideas of Socrates and Plato. The rules about definitions, the law of contradiction, the mistake of arguing in circles, the difference between what is essential and accidental about something, between means and ends, and between causes and conditions—all these were probably first invented by Plato and are found in the Republic.

The most important logical truth, and the one many writers on philosophy often forget—the difference between words and things—was strongly emphasized by him.
