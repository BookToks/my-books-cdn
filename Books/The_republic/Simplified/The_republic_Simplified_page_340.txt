True.

If I may ask the guy who thinks that there is no one true idea of beauty—who believes beauty is many things instead of just one—and who can’t accept that the beautiful is one, or the just is one, or that anything is one—I’d ask him kindly: Can you tell me if, out of all these beautiful things, there is one that will never be found ugly? Or if there is one just thing that will never be found unjust? Or one holy thing that won’t sometimes be unholy?

He answered, no; the beautiful can seem ugly from some point of view, and the same goes for the other things.

Then, I said, couldn’t these many “doubles” also be “halves”? Meaning, could they be doubles of one thing and halves of another?

He said, yes, that’s true.

And things that are called big or small, heavy or light, don’t these names just stick to all of them without truly defining them?

True, he said; these names and their opposites will always apply to all of them.

Can any of these many things with specific names really be said to definitely be one way or the other?

He replied that they’re like tricky riddles—like the kind told at parties or children’s puzzles. The individual things he’s talking about are confusing and can have two meanings. You can’t clearly decide if they exist, don’t exist, both, or neither.

So what should we do with these things? I asked. Could they fit better somewhere in between being and not-being? Because they’re clearly not totally nothing, but also not fully something.

That’s exactly right, he said.

So it looks like the many ideas people have about beauty and other things are all floating somewhere halfway between completely real and completely unreal.

We have, he agreed.

And we had already agreed before that anything like this should be called a matter of opinion, not knowledge; it’s a kind of in-between state caught by an in-between part of the mind.
