And he said: You would know the secret of death.
 
 But how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life'?
 
 The ow 1 whose night-bound eyes are blind unto the day cannot unveil the mysÂ­ tery of light.
 
 If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life.
 
 For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.
 
 In the depth of your hopes and desires lies your silent knowledge of the beyond; And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow your heart dreams of spring.
 
 Trust the dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.
