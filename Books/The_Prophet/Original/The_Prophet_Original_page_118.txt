I am ready: The stream has reached the sea, and once more the great mother holds her son against her breast.
 
 Fare you well, people of Orphalese.
 
 This day has ended.
 
 It is closing upon us even as the waterÂ­ lily upon its own tomorrow.
 
 What was given us here we shall keep, And if it suffices not, then again must we come together and together stretch our hands unto the giver.
 
 Forget not that I shall come back to you.
 
 A little while, and my longing shall gather dust and foam for another body.
 
 A little while, a moment of rest upon the wind, and another woman shall bear me.
 
 Farewell to you and the youth I have spent with you.
 
 It was but yesterday we met in a dream.
