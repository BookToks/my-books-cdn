You who travel with the wind, what weather-vane shall direct your course'?
 
 What man's law shall bind you if ye,u break your yoke but upon no man's prison door'?
 
 What laws shall you fear if you dance but stumble against no man's iron chains'?
 
 And who is he that shall bring you to judgment if you tear off your garment yet leave it in no man's path'?
 
 People of Orphalese, you can muffle the drum, and you can loosen the strings of the lyre, but who shall command the skyÂ­ lark not to sing'?
