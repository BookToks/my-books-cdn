Yet you are not evil when you seek gain for yourself.
 
 For when you strive for gain you are but a root that clings to the earth and sucks at her breast.
 
 Surely the fruit cannot say to the root, "Be like me, ripe and full and ever giving of your abundance." For to the fruit giving is a need, as re­ ceiving is a need to the root.
 
 You are good when you are fully awake in your speech, Yet you are not evil when you sleep while your tongue staggers without pur­ pose.
 
 And even stumbling speech may strengthen a weak tongue.
 
 You are good when you walk to your goal firmly and with bold steps.
 
 Yet you are not evil when you go thither limping.
