And he answered, saying: It is when your spirit goes wandering upon the wind, That you, alone and unguarded, comÂ­ mit a wrong unto others and therefore unto yourself.
 
 And for that wrong committed must you knock and wait a while unheeded at the gate of the blessed.

 Even like the sun is your god-self; It knows not the ways of the mole nor seeks it the holes of the serpent.
