And he answered: You delight in laying down laws, Yet you delight more in breaking them.
 
 Like children playing by the ocean who build sand-towers with constancv and then destroy them with laughter.
 
 But while you build your sand-towers the ocean brings more sand to the shore, And when you destroy them the ocean laughs with you.
 
 Verily the ocean laughs always with the innocent.
 
 But what of those to whom life is not an ocean, and man-made laws are not sand-towers, But to whom life is a rock, and the law a chisel with which they would carve it in their own likeness'?
