Some of you say, "Joy 1s greater than sorrow," and others say, "Nay, sorrow is the greater." But I say unto you, they are insepar­ able.
 
 Together they come, and vrhen one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.
 
 Verily you are suspended like scales be­ tween your sorrow and your joy.
 
 Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.
 
 When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.
