And he answered: You would measure time the measure­ less and the immeasurable.
 
 You would adjust your conduct and even direct the course of your spirit accord­ ing to hours and seasons.
 
 Of time you would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit and watch its flowing.
 
 Yet the timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness, And knows that yesterday IS but to­ day's memory and tomorrow IS today's dream.
 
 And that that which sings and contem­ plates in you is still dwelling within the bounds of that first moment which scat­ tered the stars into space.
