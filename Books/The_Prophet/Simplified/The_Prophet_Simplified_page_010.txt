In the twelfth year, on the seventh day of Ielool, the month when people harvest, he climbed the hill outside the city walls and looked out to the sea. He saw his ship coming through the mist.

Then his heart opened wide, and his happiness flew far across the ocean.

He closed his eyes and prayed quietly deep inside himself.

But as he walked down the hill, he felt sad. He thought to himself, How can I leave without feeling pain? No, I will not leave this city without a hurt in my heart.

I have spent many hard days and lonely nights inside these walls. Who can leave their pain and loneliness without feeling some regret?
