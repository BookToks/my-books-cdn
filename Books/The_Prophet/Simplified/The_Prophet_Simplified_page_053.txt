He said, "It happens when your spirit is lost and drifting like the wind. That’s when, all alone and not careful, you do something wrong to others and also to yourself.

Because of that mistake, you have to wait and knock for a while at the gate of the blessed, but no one answers right away.

Your god-self is like the ocean; it is always pure and clean.

It’s also like the air, lifting only those who have wings.

Your god-self is like the sun; it doesn’t know the way of a mole or look for the holes where snakes hide.

But your god-self is not the only thing living inside you."
