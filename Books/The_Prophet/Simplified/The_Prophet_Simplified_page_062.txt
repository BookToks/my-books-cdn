You who move with the wind, what will guide your way?  

What rules will control you if you only refuse to be locked behind someone else’s door?  

What laws will scare you if you only dance and never get caught in anyone’s chains?  

And who can judge you if you take off your clothes but don’t leave them where others will see?  

People of Orphalese, you can stop the drum from beating, and you can loosen the strings of the lyre, but who can tell the skylark not to sing?  

And a speaker said, "Tell us about Freedom."
