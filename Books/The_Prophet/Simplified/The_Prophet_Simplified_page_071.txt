So, trust the doctor, and take the medicine quietly and calmly.  

Even if his touch feels rough or strict, it is guided by a gentle, unseen hand.  

And the medicine he gives you, even if it hurts your lips, is made from special clay that the Creator has carefully prepared with His own sacred tears.  

A man said, “Please talk to us about understanding ourselves.”
