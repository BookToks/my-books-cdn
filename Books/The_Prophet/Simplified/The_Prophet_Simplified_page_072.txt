He said, "Your hearts quietly understand the secrets of days and nights.

But your ears want to hear the sound of what your heart already knows.

You want to put into words what you've always known in your mind.

You want to feel the true form of your dreams.

And that's okay.

The hidden source of your soul needs to flow freely like a river to the sea; The amazing treasure inside you would then be shown to you.

But don’t try to measure your unknown treasure; Don’t try to explore the depths of your knowledge with tools or instruments."
