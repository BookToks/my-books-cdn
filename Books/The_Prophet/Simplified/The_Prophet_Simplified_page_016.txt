When he entered the city, everyone came to see him, shouting together with one voice.

The city elders stepped forward and said, "Please don't leave us yet.

You have been like midday light in our darkness, and your youth has given us hope to dream.

You are not a stranger or a visitor to us; you are like our son, someone we love very much.

Don't make us miss seeing your face."

The priests and priestesses said to him, "Don't let the sea waves keep us apart now, and don't let the years you spent here become just a memory.

You have been like a spirit walking among us, and your presence has been a light on our faces."
