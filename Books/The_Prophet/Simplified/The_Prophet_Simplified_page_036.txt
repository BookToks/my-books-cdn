Your blood and my blood are like the sap that helps a big tree grow.  

When you bite into an apple, think to yourself, "Your seeds will live inside me. The new buds you grow will bloom in my heart. Your smell will be my breath, and together we will be happy through every season."  

In the fall, when you pick grapes from your vineyard to make wine, think, "I am like a vineyard too, and my fruit will be picked for the winepress. Like fresh wine, I will be kept safe forever."  

In winter, when you pour the wine, let there be a song in your heart for every cup. Let the song remind you of the fall days, the vineyard, and the winepress.
