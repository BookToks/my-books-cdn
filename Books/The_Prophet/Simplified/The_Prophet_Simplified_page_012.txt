It must go alone into the sky.

And alone, without a home, the eagle will fly across the sun.

When he reached the bottom of the hill, he looked back toward the sea. He saw his ship coming into the harbor, with sailors from his own land on the front.

His heart cried out to them, and he said: Sons of my old homeland, you who ride the waves, I have dreamed of you many times. Now you come to me while Iâ€™m awake, which feels like a deeper dream.

I am ready to leave, and my excitement is like sails waiting for the wind.

I will take just one more breath in this quiet air, one last loving look back, and then I will stand with you, a sailor among sailors.

And you, great sea, endless mother, who alone give peace and freedom to the rivers and streams, just one more twist this stream will make, one more gentle sound in this quiet place, and then I will join you, a small drop in a huge ocean.
