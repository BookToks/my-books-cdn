For self is a sea boundless and measureÂ­ less.
 
 Say not, "I have found the truth," but rather, ''I have found a truth." Say not, "I have found the path of the soul." Say rather, "I have met the soul walking upon my path." For the soul walks upon all paths.
 
 The soul walks not upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed.
 
 The soul unfolds itself, like a lotus {)f countless petals.
