The self is like an endless ocean with no limits.  

Don't say, "I have found the truth," but instead say, "I have found a truth." Don't say, "I have found the path of the soul." Say, "I have seen the soul walking on my path." The soul walks on all paths.  

The soul doesn't move in a straight line, and it doesn't grow like a plant.  

The soul opens up like a lotus flower with many petals.  

Then a teacher said, "Tell us about teaching."
