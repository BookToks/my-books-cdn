Isn't the shepherd happy even though he’s shaking, because he will have the king’s special sign?

But doesn’t he also think a lot about why he’s shaking?

What does it mean to die, if not to stand alone in the wind and disappear into the sun?

And what does it mean to stop breathing, if not to let your breath go free so it can rise and reach God without any limits?

Only when you drink from the quiet river will you really start to sing.

And when you get to the top of the mountain, that’s when your climb really begins.

And when the earth takes your body, that’s when you will truly dance.

And now it was evening.
