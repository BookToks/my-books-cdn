Almitra, the wise woman, said, “This day, this place, and your spirit that spoke are all blessed.”

He replied, “Did I really speak? Or was I just listening?”

Then he walked down the Temple steps, and everyone followed him.

He got to his ship and stood on the deck.

Facing the people again, he shouted, “People of Orphalese, the wind tells me to leave you.

I’m not as quick as the wind, but I still have to go.

We travelers always look for a lonelier path. We never start a day where we ended the last one, and we’re never in the same place at sunrise as we were at sunset.

Even when the world is asleep, we keep moving.”
