First, make sure you believe you deserve to give and to help others.

Actually, life itself is what gives to life. You, who think you are giving, are really just watching it happen.

And all of you who receive—because everyone receives—don’t feel too much thanks. If you do, you might feel stuck or owe something to the person giving.

Instead, join the giver and feel uplifted by what they share, like flying on wings. If you keep worrying about what you owe, you might start doubting the kindness of the Earth and God, who give freely.
