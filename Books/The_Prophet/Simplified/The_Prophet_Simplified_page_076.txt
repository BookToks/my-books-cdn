He said: Your friend is someone who helps meet your needs.

They are like the land you plant with love and gather thanks from.

They are also the place where you eat and stay warm.

You come to them when you're hungry and look for peace.

When your friend shares their thoughts, you don’t fear disagreeing or holding back. When they are quiet, your heart still listens to theirs; without words, in friendship, all feelings and hopes are shared happily.

When you say goodbye to your friend, you don’t feel sad; what you love most about them can be clearer when they’re not around, like a mountain looks clearer from far away.

And friendship should only have one goal: to make your spirit grow deeper.
