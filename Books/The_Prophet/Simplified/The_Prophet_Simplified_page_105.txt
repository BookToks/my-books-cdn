We are like seeds from a strong plant, and when we are ready and full of love, the wind carries us away.

My time with you was short, and the words I said were even shorter.

But if my voice fades from your ears and my love disappears from your memory, I will come back. I will speak again with a fuller heart and words that follow the spirit more closely.

Yes, I will return like the tide. Even if death hides me and silence surrounds me, I will still try to reach your understanding.

And I won’t try in vain.

If anything I said is true, that truth will become clearer and speak in words closer to your own thoughts.

I go with the wind, people of Orphalese, but not into emptiness. And if today doesn’t meet your needs or my love, let it be a promise for another day.
