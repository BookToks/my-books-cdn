Like bundles of corn, he brings you close to himself.

He beats you to make you bare.

He shakes you to get rid of your outer layers.

He crushes you until you become pure.

He mixes you until you are soft and ready; then he puts you into his holy fire, so you can become holy bread for God’s special meal.

All these things love will do to you so you can understand the secrets of your heart, and through that, become a part of Life’s heart.

But if you are scared and only want love’s calm and fun, then it’s better for you to hide away.
