He said: You were born at the same time, and you will be together forever.

You will be together even when death comes and takes your days away.

Yes, you will be together even in God's quiet memory.

But let there be some space between you, and let the wind blow freely between you.

Love each other, but don’t hold on too tightly: Let your love be like a moving sea between the shores of your hearts.

Fill each other's cups, but don’t drink from the same cup.

Share your bread, but don’t eat from the same loaf.

Sing and dance together and be happy, but also be yourself, just like the strings of a lute are separate even when they play the same music.
