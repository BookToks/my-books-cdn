 You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days.
 
 Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.
 
 But let there be spaces in your togetherÂ­ ness, And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.
 
 Love one another, but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.
 
 Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.
 
 Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.
