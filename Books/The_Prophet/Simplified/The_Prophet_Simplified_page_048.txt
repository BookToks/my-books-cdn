You shall not fold your wings that you may pass through doors, nor bend your heads that they strike not against a ceil­ ing, nor fear to breathe lest walls should crack and fall down.
 
 You shall not dwell in tombs made by the dead for the living.
 
 And though of magnificence and splen­ dour, your house shall not hold your secret nor shelter your longing.
 
 For that which is boundless in you abides in the mansion of the sky, whose door is the morning mist, and whose win­ dows are the songs and the silences of night.
