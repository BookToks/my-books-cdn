You should not fold your wings just to fit through doors, or bend your head so it doesn’t hit the ceiling. Don’t be afraid to breathe, even if you think the walls might crack or fall.

You should not live in tombs made by the dead for the living.

Even if your house is grand and beautiful, it won’t keep your secrets or protect your deepest feelings.

Because what is endless inside you lives in the sky’s big home, whose door is the morning mist, and whose windows are the songs and quiet moments of the night.
