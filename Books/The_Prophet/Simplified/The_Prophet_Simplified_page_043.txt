He said: Your happiness comes from the sadness you hide.

The same part of you that makes you laugh has also made you cry many times.

How could it be different?

The more sadness you feel deep inside, the more happiness you can have.

Isn't the cup that holds your wine the same cup that was heated in the oven?

And isn't the guitar that makes you feel better made from wood that was carved with knives?

When you're happy, look inside your heart and you’ll see that the things that once made you sad are now making you happy.

When you're sad, look inside your heart again, and you’ll realize you are crying because of the things that once made you happy.
