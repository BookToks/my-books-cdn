And he said: Have I talked about anything else today?

Isn’t religion all about what we do and think? And also about the surprise and wonder that comes up inside us, even when we’re busy working or doing everyday things?

Who can really separate their faith from what they do, or their beliefs from their daily tasks?

Who can divide their time saying, “This part is for God and this part is for me; this part is for my soul, and this part is for my body?” All your time moves you from one part of yourself to another, like wings flying through space.

Someone who only shows their good morals like wearing nice clothes would be better off without them.
