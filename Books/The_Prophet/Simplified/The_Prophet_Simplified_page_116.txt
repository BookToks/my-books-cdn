I want you to remember this about me: The weakest and most confused parts of you are actually the strongest and most determined.

Isn't it your breath that made your bones strong and hard?

And isn't it a dream you don’t even remember that built your city and everything in it?

If you could see the flow of that breath, you wouldn’t notice anything else. And if you could hear the quiet voice of that dream, you wouldn’t hear any other sounds.

But right now, you don’t see or hear these things, and that’s okay.

The fog that covers your eyes will be lifted by the very hands that made it. And the clay filling your ears will be cleared by the same hands that shaped it.

Then, you will see.  
Then, you will hear.
