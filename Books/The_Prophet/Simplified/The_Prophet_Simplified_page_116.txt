This would I have you remember in remembering me: That which seems most feeble and beÂ­ wildered in you is the strongest and most determined.
 
 Is it not your breath that has erected and hardened the structure of your bones'?
 
 And is it not a dream which none of you remember having dreamt, that builded your city and fashioned all there is in it'?
 
 Could you but see the tides of that breath you would cease to see all else, And if you could hear the whispering of the dream you would hear no other sound.
 
 But you do not see, nor do you hear, and it is well.
 
 The veil that clouds your eyes shall be lifted by the hands that wove it, And the clay that fills your ears shall be pierced by those fingers that kneaded it.
