Even when they give up something, they still find happiness.

So, even if they only find roots while shaking, they still find something valuable.

But tell me, who can hurt the spirit?

Can a nightingale bother the quiet night, or can a firefly annoy the stars?

Can your flame or smoke make the wind heavy?

Do you think the spirit is like still water that you can stir with a stick?

Often, when you say no to pleasure, you just keep the desire hidden inside you.

Who knows? What you skip today might be waiting for you tomorrow.

Even your body understands what it needs and won’t be tricked.

Your body is like a harp for your soul, and it’s up to you to make beautiful music or confusing noise from it.
