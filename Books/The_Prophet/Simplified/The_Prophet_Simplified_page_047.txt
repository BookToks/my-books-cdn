Yes, it becomes easier to control, and with tricks and punishment, it makes your big desires like puppets.

Even though it seems soft, its heart is strong and tough.

It helps you relax but then stands by your bed and laughs at your body’s strength.

It makes fun of your good senses and treats them like delicate things that can easily break.

Really, wanting too much comfort kills the fire inside you, and then it happily walks at its own funeral.

But you, kids of the universe, always restless even when resting, you won’t be caught or controlled.

Your home will not hold you back like an anchor but help you rise like a mast.

It won’t be a shiny cover hiding a hurt but a protective eyelid guarding your eye.
