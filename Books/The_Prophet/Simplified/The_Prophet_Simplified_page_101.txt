And he said: You want to know the secret of death.

But how can you find it unless you look for it in the middle of life?

The owl, whose eyes only see at night, cannot understand the mystery of light.

If you really want to see the spirit of death, open your heart fully to the body of life.

Because life and death are connected, just like the river and the sea are connected.

Deep inside your hopes and dreams is a quiet understanding of what comes after; and like seeds sleeping under the snow, your heart dreams of spring.

Believe in your dreams, because inside them is the key to forever.
