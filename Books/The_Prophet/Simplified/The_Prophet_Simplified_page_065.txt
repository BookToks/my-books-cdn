For how can a tyrant rule the free and the proud, but for a tyranny in their own freedom and a shame in their own pride'?
 
 And if it is a care you would cast off, that care has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you.
 
 And if it is a fear you would dispel, the :seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared.
 
 Verily all things move within your being in constant half embrace, the deÂ­ sired and the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished, the pursued and that which you would escape.
 
 These things move within you as lights and shadows in pairs that cling.
 
 And when the shadow fades and is no more, the light that lingers becomes a shadow to another light.
 
 And thus your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater freedom.
