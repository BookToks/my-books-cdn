How can a ruler control people who are free and proud, unless those people let their own freedom and pride trap them?

If you want to get rid of a worry, remember that you chose to worry—it wasn’t forced on you.

And if you want to stop being afraid, know that the fear comes from inside you, not from what you are scared of.

Inside you, opposite feelings always exist together—what you want and what you fear, what you hate and what you love, what you chase and what you try to avoid.

These feelings are like light and shadow, always connected.

When one shadow disappears, the light left behind can become a shadow to another light.

In the same way, when your freedom loses its limits, it can become the limit for an even greater freedom.

And then the priestess spoke again and said: Talk to us about Reason and Passion.
