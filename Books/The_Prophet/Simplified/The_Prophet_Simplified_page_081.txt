And yet who does not feel that very love, though boundless, encompassed within the centre of his being, and moving not from love thought to love thought, nor from love deeds to other love deeds'?
 
 And is not time even as love is, un­ divided and paceless '?
 
 But if in your thought you must measure time into seasons, let each season encircle all the other seasons, And let today embrace the past with re­ membrance and the future with longing.
