Who doesn’t feel that deep love inside them, filling their whole being, staying steady instead of jumping from one loving thought or action to another?

Isn’t time, like love, continuous and without a set pace?

But if you have to think about time in parts, like seasons, let each season include all the others. Let today hold memories of the past and hopes for the future.

And one of the city’s wise people said, “Tell us about Good and Evil.”
