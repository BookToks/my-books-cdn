He said: Your kids don’t really belong to you.

They are the sons and daughters of Life wanting to live.

They come through you but not from you, and even though they’re with you, they don’t actually belong to you.

You can love them, but not control their thoughts, because they have their own ideas.

You can take care of their bodies, but not their souls, because their souls live in the future, a place you can’t visit, not even in your dreams.

You can try to be like them, but don’t try to make them be like you.

Life doesn’t go backward or stay stuck in the past.
