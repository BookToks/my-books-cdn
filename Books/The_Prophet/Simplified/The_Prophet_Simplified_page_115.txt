I believe and know this: you are not stuck inside your bodies or limited to your homes or fields.

Who you really are lives above the mountains and moves with the wind.

You are not something that hides in the sun to stay warm or digs into the dark to feel safe. You are free, like a spirit that surrounds the earth and moves through the air.

If these words seem unclear, don’t try too hard to understand them.

All things start out unclear and fuzzy, but that’s not how they end. I want you to remember me as a beginning.

Life, and everything alive, begins in mystery, not in something clear and perfect.

And who knows, maybe a clear crystal was once just mist fading away.
