He said: I have seen you bow down and worship your idea of freedom at the city gate and by your fires, just like slaves bow before a cruel ruler and even praise him while he hurts them.

Yes, even in the temple grove and near the fortress, I have seen the freest people wear their freedom like a heavy burden or handcuffs.

This made me very sad, because you can only be truly free when even wanting freedom doesnâ€™t control you, and when you stop thinking of freedom as something to reach or complete.

You will be really free when your days are not without worries, and your nights not without needs and sadness, but when these things surround your life and you still rise above them, strong and free.
