So, when you visit that invisible temple, let it be only for joy and a deep connection.

If you go there just to ask for things, you won’t get anything. If you go there to make yourself feel small, you won’t be lifted up. Even if you go there to beg for others, no one will hear you.

It’s enough just to enter the invisible temple.

I can’t teach you words to pray.

God doesn’t listen to your words unless He is the one speaking through you.

I also can’t teach you the prayer of the seas, forests, and mountains.

But if you come from the mountains, forests, or seas, you can find their prayer in your heart. If you listen quietly at night, you’ll hear them silently saying, “Our God, who is part of us, it is your will in us that guides us.”
