And how can you talk about her unless she helps you find the right words?

People who are hurt and sad say, "Beauty is kind and gentle.

Like a young mom who feels a little shy about her own brightness, she walks among us." But the passionate people say, "No, beauty is powerful and scary.

Like a storm, she shakes the ground beneath us and the sky above us." The tired and worn-out say, "Beauty is soft and quiet. She speaks inside us.

Her voice fades into our silence like a weak light that is afraid of the dark."
