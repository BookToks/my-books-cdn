Will my wishes flow out like a fountain so I can fill others' cups?

Am I like a harp that a strong hand can play, or a flute that someone’s breath can blow through?

I look for quiet moments, but what good have I found in silence that makes me sure I can share it?

If today is the day I gather what I planted, where did I plant those seeds, and when did I do it?

If this is really the time I lift my lantern, the light inside won’t come from me.

I will raise my lantern empty and dark, and the night’s guardian will fill it with oil and light it.

He said these things out loud, but he kept much inside his heart hidden. Even he couldn’t say his deepest secret.
