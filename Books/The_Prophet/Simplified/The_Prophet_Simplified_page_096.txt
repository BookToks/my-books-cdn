It is not a mouth thirsting nor an empty hand stretched forth, But rather a heart enflamed and a soul enchanted.
 
 It is not the image you would see nor the song you would hear, But rather an image you see though you close your eyes and a song you hear though you shut your ears.
 
 It is not the sap within the furrowed bark, nor a wing attached to a claw, But rather a garden for ever in bloom and a flock of angels for ever in flight.
 
 People of Orphalese, beauty is life when life unveils her holy face.
 
 But you are life and you are the veil.
 
 85 https://www.kahlilgibran.com/ Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a muror.
