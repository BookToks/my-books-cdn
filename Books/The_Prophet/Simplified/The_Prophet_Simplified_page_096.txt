It’s not about being thirsty or holding out an empty hand. It’s about having a heart full of passion and a soul that’s amazed.

It’s not the picture you see or the song you hear. It’s an image you can see even with your eyes closed and a song you can hear even when you cover your ears.

It’s not the sap inside the rough bark or a wing stuck to a claw. It’s like a garden that always blooms and a group of angels always flying.

People of Orphalese, beauty is life showing its true, special face.

But you are life, and you are the veil.

Beauty is like forever looking at itself in a mirror.
