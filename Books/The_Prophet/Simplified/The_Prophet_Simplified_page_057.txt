You can't separate the good people from the bad people; they live together under the same sun, just like black and white threads are woven together in cloth.

When the black thread breaks, the person making the cloth will look at the whole piece and check the loom too.

If someone wants to judge an unfaithful wife, they should also think carefully about her husbandâ€™s heart and soul.

And if someone wants to punish the person who did wrong, they should understand the feelings of the person who was hurt.

If you want to punish evil to make things right, look closely at its roots; you will find that good and bad, useful and useless, are all connected deep down in the earth.
