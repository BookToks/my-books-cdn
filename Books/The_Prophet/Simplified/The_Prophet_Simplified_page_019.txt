Then Almitra said, “Tell us about love.”

He looked at the people, and everything became quiet. With a strong voice, he said: When love calls you, follow it, even if it is hard and difficult.

When love holds you close, let it, even if it might hurt you like a hidden sword.

When love talks to you, trust it, even if its words break your dreams like a cold wind ruining a garden.

Because love can lift you up and also hurt you. It helps you grow but also cuts away what you don’t need.

Love can reach your highest parts and gently touch the soft branches that shake in the sun. But it can also go deep to your roots and shake them hard so they don’t hold on too tight to the ground.
