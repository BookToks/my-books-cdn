Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love.
 
 And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said: When love beckons to you, follow him, Though his ways are hard and steep.
 
 And when his wings enfold you yield to him, Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.
 
 And when he speaks to you believe in him, Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.
 
 For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.
 
 Even as he ascends to your height and 15 https://www.kahlilgibran.com/ caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.
