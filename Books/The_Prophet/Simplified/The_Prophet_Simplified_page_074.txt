An astronomer can talk about space, but he can’t give you his own understanding of it.

A musician can sing about the rhythm that exists everywhere, but he can’t give you the ability to hear that rhythm or sing along with it.

Someone who knows a lot about numbers can explain measurements and weights, but they can’t take you there themselves.
