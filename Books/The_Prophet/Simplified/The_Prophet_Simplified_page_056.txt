You all walk together like a group heading toward your true selves.

You are both the path and the travelers on it.

When one of you falls, he falls for those behind him, warning them about the obstacle.

And he also falls for those ahead of him, who are faster and more sure-footed but didn’t remove the obstacle.

And even though it’s hard to hear: the person who was killed is not totally blameless for being killed, and the person who was robbed is not without fault for being robbed.

The good person is not innocent of what bad people do, and the clean-handed person is not free from the actions of criminals.

Often, the guilty person is also the victim of someone who was hurt, and even more often, the punished person carries the burden for those who are innocent and blamed for nothing.
