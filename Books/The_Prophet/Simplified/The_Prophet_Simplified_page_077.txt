Love that wants anything other than to reveal its own mystery isn’t really love; it’s like a trap, and only useless things get caught.

Always give your best to your friend.

If your friend needs to know when you’re feeling down, let him know when you’re feeling good too.

Why would you look for your friend when you have nothing to do?

Look for him when you have life and time to share.

Your friend is there to help with what you need, but not to fill your emptiness.

In the joy of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing good times.

Because in the small, sweet moments, your heart wakes up and feels refreshed.
