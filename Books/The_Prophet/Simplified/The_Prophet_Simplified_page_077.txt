For love that seeks aught but the dis­ closure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.
 
 And let your best be for your friend.
 
 If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.
 
 For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill'?
 
 Seek him always with hours to live.
 
 For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.
 
 And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleas­ ures.
 
 For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.
