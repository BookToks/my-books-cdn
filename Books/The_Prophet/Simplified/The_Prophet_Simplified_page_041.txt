But I say, not when you’re sleeping but when you’re fully awake at noon, that the wind sounds just as nice to the biggest oak trees as it does to the smallest blade of grass. And the only person who is truly great is the one who turns the wind’s sound into a song made sweeter by their own love.

Work is love you can see.

And if you can’t work with love but only with dislike, it’s better to stop working and sit by the temple gate, asking for help from those who work happily.

Because if you bake bread without caring, you bake bitter bread that only fills half of a person’s hunger.

And if you are angry about crushing the grapes, your anger makes the wine taste bad.

And if you sing like angels but don’t love the singing, you block people from hearing the sounds of the day and night.
