And he said: I wish you could live just by smelling the earth, and like an air plant, be kept alive by sunlight.

But since you have to kill animals to eat, and take the milk from babies to drink, let it be a respectful act. Let your table be like an altar where the pure and innocent animals of the forest and fields are given up for something even purer and more innocent in humans.

When you kill an animal, say in your heart, "The same power that kills you will also kill me; I will be used up too.

The law that brought you into my hands will bring me into the hands of a stronger power."
