He said: Your soul is often like a battlefield, where your thinking and judgment fight against your feelings and desires.

I wish I could make peace inside you, so that the different parts of you could come together and work in harmony.

But how can I do that unless you also try to make peace and learn to accept all parts of yourself?

Your thinking and your passion are like the rudder and sails of a ship that is your soul.

If either your sails or rudder are broken, you will just drift aimlessly or get stuck in the middle of the sea.

Because reason alone can be too strict, and passion by itself can burn out and destroy itself.
