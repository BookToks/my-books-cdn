And he answered, saying: Your soul is oft en times a battlefield, upon which your reason and your judg­ ment wage war against your passion and your appetite.
 
 Would that I could be the peacemaker in your soul, that I might turn the discord and the rivalry of your elements into oneness and melody.
 
 But how shall I, unless you yourselves be also the peacemakers, nay, the lovers of all your elements'?
 
 Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul.
 
 If either your sails or your rudder be broken, you can but toss and drift, or else be held at a standstill in mid-seas.
