Is there anything you want to keep for yourself?

Everything you have will be given away someday. So, give now, so you can enjoy the feeling of giving, not just your kids after you.

You often say, "I want to give, but only to those who deserve it." But the trees in your orchard don’t think like that, and neither do the animals in your fields.

They give so they can live, because if they don’t give, they won’t survive.

If someone deserves their days and nights, they deserve everything else you have too.

If someone has earned the chance to enjoy life, they deserve to share even a little of what you have.

And the biggest thing someone can deserve is the courage and kindness to accept help.

Who are you to judge others so harshly, tearing open their hearts and pride just to see if they are worthy?
