There are no graves here.

These mountains and plains hold us like a safe place and help us move forward.

When you walk by the field where your ancestors rest, look closely, and you will see yourselves and your children dancing together.

You often have fun without even realizing it.

Others have come to you, and because of promises made to your faith, you have given them riches, power, and glory.

I have given less than a promise, but you have been more generous to me.

You have given me a deeper desire for life.

Surely, the greatest gift to a person is something that turns all their goals into a thirsty need and all of life into a source of water.

And in this is my honor and my reward: whenever I come to the fountain to drink, I find the living water thirsty too; and it drinks me while I drink it.
