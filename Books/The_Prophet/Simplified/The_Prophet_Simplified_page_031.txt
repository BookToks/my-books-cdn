Some people have very little but still give everything they have.

These people believe in life and all the good things it offers, and they never run out of kindness.

Some give happily, and that happiness is their reward.

Others give even though it hurts, and that pain is like a special test for them.

There are also those who give without feeling pain or looking for happiness or praise; they just give naturally, like how a flower spreads its sweet smell into the air.

Through people like these, God speaks, and from their eyes, He smiles down on the world.

It's good to give when someone asks, but it's even better to give without being asked, because you understand whatâ€™s needed.
