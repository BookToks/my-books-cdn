How can you live fully in your days and nights if you don’t break the chains you put on yourself when you first started to understand things?

The thing you call freedom is actually the strongest chain, even though it shines and looks amazing.

What you want to be free from is really just parts of yourself that you want to get rid of.

If there’s an unfair rule you want to get rid of, remember that you helped create it yourself.

You can’t get rid of it by burning books or trying to change the people in charge, no matter how much effort you put in.

And if you want to remove a cruel leader, first make sure to destroy the power they have inside you.
