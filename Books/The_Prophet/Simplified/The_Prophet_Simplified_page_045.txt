He said: First, imagine a peaceful place in the wild before you build a house in the busy city.

Just like you return home at night, there is a part of you that always feels like a traveler, far away and alone.

Your house is like your body.

It grows in the sunlight and rests quietly at night; and it doesn’t stop dreaming. Doesn’t your house have dreams? When it dreams, it leaves the city and goes to the forest or a hilltop.

I wish I could hold all your houses in my hand and scatter them like seeds in forests and meadows.

I wish the valleys were your streets and the green paths your alleys, so you could find each other walking through the vineyards, carrying the fresh smell of the earth on your clothes.
