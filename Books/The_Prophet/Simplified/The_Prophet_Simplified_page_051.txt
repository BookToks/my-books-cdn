And he said: The earth gives you its fruits, and you won’t need anything if you just know how to gather them.  

You will find plenty and feel happy when you trade the earth’s gifts with others.  

But if the trade is not done with love and fairness, some people will become greedy while others will stay hungry.  

When fishermen, farmers, weavers, potters, and spice gatherers meet at the market, call on the spirit of the earth to be with you and bless the fairness of your trades.  

Don’t let people who have nothing to offer join your trades, especially those who only sell words instead of work.
