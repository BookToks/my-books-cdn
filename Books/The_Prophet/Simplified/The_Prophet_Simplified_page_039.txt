If you think being born is a problem and see your body as a punishment written on your face, then I say only your own hard work can erase that mark.

People have also told you that life is full of darkness, and when you're tired, you repeat what other tired people say.

I say life is dark unless you have a strong desire. And desire is blind unless you have knowledge. Knowledge is useless unless you do something with it. And work means nothing unless you do it with love. When you work with love, you connect with yourself, with others, and with God.
