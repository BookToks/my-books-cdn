You are the bows from which your chil­ dren as living arrows are sen· t forth.
 
 The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
 
 Let your bending in the Archer's hand be for gladness; For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.
