If you want to understand God, don’t try to solve tricky puzzles about Him.  

Instead, look around you and you’ll see Him playing with your children.  

Look up at the sky; you’ll see Him walking in the clouds, stretching His arms in lightning, and coming down in the rain.  

You’ll see Him smiling in the flowers, then standing up and waving His hands in the trees.  

Then Almitra spoke, saying, “We want to ask about Death now.”
