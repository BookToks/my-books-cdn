You are not bad when you try to get something for yourself.

When you work hard to gain something, you are like a root holding on to the earth and drinking its milk.

The fruit can’t tell the root, “Be like me, full and always giving.” Because the fruit needs to give, just like the root needs to receive.

You are good when you speak clearly and are fully awake. But you are not bad when you are sleepy and your words don’t make much sense.

Even when your speech is messy, it can still help a weak tongue get stronger.

You are good when you walk confidently toward your goal.

But you are not bad when you walk slowly or with a limp.

Even those who limp are still moving forward.
