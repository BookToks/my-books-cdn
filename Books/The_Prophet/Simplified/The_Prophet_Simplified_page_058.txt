And you judges who want to be fair, what decision would you make about someone who is honest on the outside but steals inside their heart?

What punishment would you give to someone who kills on the outside but feels killed inside?

And how would you deal with someone who lies and treats others badly, but also feels hurt and angry themselves?

How can you punish people whose guilt is already bigger than what they did wrong?

Isn’t feeling sorry the kind of justice that the law you follow gives?

But you can’t make innocent people feel guilty, and you can’t take away guilt from those who deserve it.

Guilt will come on its own at night, making people wake up and think about themselves.

And you who want to understand what is right, how can you unless you see every action clearly and fully?
