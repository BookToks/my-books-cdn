If you are strong and fast, don’t slow down just because someone else is slow, thinking it’s being kind.  

You are good in many ways, and it’s not bad if you’re not always good—you might just be wasting time or being lazy.  

It’s sad that fast animals like deer can’t teach slow ones like turtles how to be quick.  

The desire to be your best self is what makes you good, and everyone has that desire inside.  

For some, this desire is like a strong river rushing to the sea, carrying all the stories of the hills and the songs of the forest.  

For others, it’s like a slow stream that twists and turns and takes its time before it reaches the shore.  

But if someone’s desire is big and strong, they shouldn’t make fun of someone whose desire is small and slow.
