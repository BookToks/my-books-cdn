Now your ship is here, and you have to go.

You really miss the place of your memories and your biggest dreams. Our love won’t stop you, and our needs won’t hold you back.

But before you leave, please talk to us and tell us your truth.

We will pass it on to our children, and they will pass it on to theirs, so it won’t be forgotten.

While you were alone, you watched us during the day, and while you were awake, you heard our cries and laughter in our sleep.

So now, show us who we really are and tell us everything you have learned about life between birth and death.

And he said, People of Orphalese, how can I speak about anything except what is already alive inside your souls?
