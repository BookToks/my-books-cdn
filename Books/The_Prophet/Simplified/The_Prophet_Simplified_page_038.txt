He said: You work so you can keep up with the earth and its spirit.

If you do nothing, you become out of sync with the seasons and miss out on the flow of life, which moves with power and respect toward something endless.

When you work, you are like a flute that turns the passing time into beautiful music.

Who would want to be quiet and useless like a reed, when everything else is singing together?

People have always told you that work is bad and a problem.

But I tell you that when you work, you are helping to make one of the earth’s biggest dreams come true, a dream given to you when it all began.

By working, you show love for life, and loving life through work means you understand life’s deepest secret.
