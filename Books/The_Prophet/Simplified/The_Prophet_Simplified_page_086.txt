He said, "You pray when you are upset and need help; I wish you would also pray when you are happy and have a lot.

Because prayer is like opening yourself up to the world around you.

If it helps you to send your sadness out into the space, it should also make you happy to share the joy inside your heart.

And if you can only cry when you pray, keep trying again and again, even while crying, until you end up laughing.

When you pray, you connect with others who are praying at the same time."
