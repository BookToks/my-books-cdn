He said: I can talk about the good in you, but not the bad.

Because what is bad is just good feeling hungry and thirsty in the wrong way.

When good is hungry, it looks for food even in dark places, and when it’s thirsty, it drinks even from dirty water.

You are good when you are true to yourself.

But when you are not true to yourself, you are not evil.

A house that is divided isn’t full of thieves; it’s just a divided house.

And a ship without a rudder might drift around dangerous islands but won’t sink to the bottom.

You are good when you try to give from your heart.
