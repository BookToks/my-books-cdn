Let your soul lift your reason up to the level of your passion, so it can sing. And let your reason guide your passion, so your passion can live and rise again every day, like a phoenix rising from its ashes.

Think of your judgment and your desires like two important guests in your home.

You wouldn’t treat one guest better than the other because if you do, you lose the trust and love of both.

When you’re sitting on a hill under the cool shade of white poplar trees, enjoying the calm and quiet of faraway fields and meadows, let your heart quietly say, "God rests in reason." 

But when a storm comes, with strong wind shaking the forest, and thunder and lightning showing how powerful the sky is, let your heart say with awe, "God moves in passion."
