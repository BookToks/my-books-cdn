Some of you think I’m too proud or too shy to accept gifts.

I am proud, but not proud enough to refuse gifts—only wages.

Even though I’ve eaten berries on the hills when you wanted me to eat at your table, and slept outside the temple when you wished to give me shelter, it wasn’t your care for my days and nights that made my food taste good or filled my sleep with dreams.

For this, I thank you the most: You give a lot without even realizing it.

True kindness doesn’t show off or expect praise, and a good deed that wants attention can turn into something bad.
