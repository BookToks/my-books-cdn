I’m ready now: The river has reached the sea, and once again the great mother holds her child close.

Goodbye, people of Orphalese.

The day is over.

It’s ending just like a water lily closes up for the night.

What we shared here, we will keep. And if it’s not enough, we will come back together and reach out to the giver again.

Don’t forget, I will come back to you.

Soon, my feelings will settle like dust and foam, ready for a new body.

Soon, after a short rest in the wind, another woman will carry me.

Goodbye to you and the time I spent with you when we were young.

It feels like we just met yesterday in a dream.

You sang to me when I was alone, and I built a tower in the sky from your hopes.
