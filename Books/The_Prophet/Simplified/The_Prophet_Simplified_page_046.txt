But these things are not ready to happen yet.

Your ancestors were scared, so they made you live very close together. That fear will stay for a little while longer. For a little more time, your city walls will keep your homes separate from your fields.

Now, people of Orphalese, what do you have inside your houses? What do you protect with locked doors?

Do you have peace, that quiet feeling that shows your true strength?

Do you have memories, the shining bridges in your mind?

Do you have beauty, that lifts your heart from simple things to something higher?

Tell me, do you have these inside your homes?

Or do you only have comfort, and the craving for comfort, that sneaky thing which starts as a visitor, then becomes the host, and finally takes control?
