The wind and the sun won’t hurt his skin.

If someone lives only by strict rules, it’s like keeping a songbird trapped in a cage.

The happiest songs don’t come from behind bars or wires.

If worship feels like a window you can open or close, it means you haven’t truly explored your soul, which is open all day long.

Your everyday life is like your temple and your religion.

Whenever you start your day, bring everything you have.

Bring your tools and your music—the things you made because you had to or because you wanted to.

When you dream, you can’t go beyond what you’ve done or fall below your mistakes.

And bring everyone with you, because when you admire others, you can’t rise above their hopes or feel lower than their sadness.
