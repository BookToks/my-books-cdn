Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.
 
 Love possesses not nor would it be pos­ sessed; For love is sufficient unto love.
 
 When you love you should not say, "God is in my heart," but rather,· "I am in the heart of God." And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.
 
 Love has no other desire but to fulfil it­ self.
 
 But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.
