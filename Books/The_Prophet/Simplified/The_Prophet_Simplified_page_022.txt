Love only gives itself and takes nothing from anyone else.

Love doesn’t own anything and can’t be owned; it is enough all by itself.

When you love, don’t say, “God is in my heart.” Instead, say, “I am in God’s heart.” And don’t think you can control love, because if love chooses you, it will guide you.

Love wants only to complete itself.

But if you must have wishes when you love, wish to melt like a flowing stream that sings softly at night.

And wish to understand the pain that comes from feeling too much kindness.
