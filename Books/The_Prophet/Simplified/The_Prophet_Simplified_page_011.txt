I have left pieces of my soul all over these streets, and many of my hopes and dreams walk around naked on these hills. I can't leave them without feeling sad and heavy inside.

Today, I'm not just taking off a piece of clothing, but tearing away a part of myself.

I'm not just leaving a thought behind, but a heart that's full of hunger and thirst.

Still, I can't stay any longer.

The sea is calling me, and I have to go.

If I stay, even though time passes, I will become frozen and stuck, like something trapped in a mold.

I wish I could take everything from here with me. But how can I?

A voice can't carry the tongue and lips that made it fly.
