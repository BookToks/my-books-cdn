There is still a lot of “man” inside you, and also a part that isn’t quite a man yet—a small, lost part that walks around like it’s sleeping, trying to wake up.

Now, I want to talk about the man inside you.

Because it’s this man, not your perfect self or the lost part in the mist, who understands what crime is and what punishment means.

Many times, I’ve heard you talk about someone who does something wrong like they’re not really one of you, like they don’t belong and are strangers in your world.

But I say that just like the good and the holy in you can’t be better than the highest part of you, the bad and weak parts can’t be worse than the lowest part inside you.

And just like a single leaf doesn’t turn yellow without the whole tree knowing it,
