 Oftentimes have I heard you speak of one who commits a wrong as though he were not one of you, but a stranger unto you and an intruder upon your world.
 
 But I say that even as the holy and the righteous cannot rise beyond the highest which is in each one of you, So the wicked and the weak cannot fall lower than the lowest which is in you also.
 
 And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, 46 https://www.kahlilgibran.com/ https://www.
