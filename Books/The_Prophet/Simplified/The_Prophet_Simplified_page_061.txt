What about the ox that loves its yoke and thinks the elk and deer in the forest are lost and wild?

What about the old snake that canâ€™t shed its skin and calls all others naked and shameless?

And what about the person who comes early to the wedding feast, but after eating too much and getting tired, leaves saying all parties are wrong and everyone there is breaking the rules?

What can I say about these people except that they stand in the sunlight, but with their backs to the sun?

They only see their shadows, and their shadows are their rules.

And what is the sun to them but something that makes shadows?

And what does it mean to follow rules except to bend down and draw their shadows on the ground?

But you, who walk facing the sun, what pictures drawn on the ground can hold you?
