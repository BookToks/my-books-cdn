You've heard that, like a chain, you are only as strong as your weakest part.

But that's only half true. You are also as strong as your strongest part.

Judging you by your smallest action is like judging the ocean by the foam on its waves.

Thinking less of you because of your failures is like blaming the seasons for changing.

Yes, you are like an ocean. Even though ships wait for the tide at your shores, you can't make the tide come faster.

And you are like the seasons too. Even if in your winter you donâ€™t show your spring, inside you, spring is resting and smiling quietly.

Don't think I'm saying this just so you can tell each other, "He said nice things about us."
