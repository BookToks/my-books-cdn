He only saw the good in us.

I talk to you using words about things you already think about.

And what is knowing words but just a small part of knowing without words?

Your thoughts and my words come from a hidden memory that holds all our past days, and even the ancient times when the earth didn’t know us or itself, and the nights when the earth was full of chaos.

Wise people have come to share their knowledge with you. I came to learn from your knowledge. And I found something even greater than wisdom.

It’s a fire inside you that keeps growing, while you, ignoring this growth, feel sad about your life ending.

It is life searching for more life in bodies that are scared of dying.
