And there are those who have the truth within them, but they tell it not in words.
 
 In the bosom of such as these the spirit dwells in rhythmic silence.
 
 When you meet your friend on the roadside or in the market place, let the spirit in you move your lips and direct your tongue.
 
 Let the voice within your voice speak to the ear of his ear; For his soul will keep the truth of your heart as the taste of the wine is rememÂ­ bered When the colour is forgotten and the vessel is no more.
