When I was quiet, I heard your children laughing like flowing streams, and your young people’s hopes like rushing rivers.

When these streams and rivers reached deep inside me, they didn’t stop.

But even better than laughter and stronger than hope came something else to me.

It was the huge power inside you; the great person made up of all your parts; the one whose song makes all your singing seem silent.

You are big because of this great person inside you, and when I saw him, I saw and loved you.

Because love can reach any distance inside that huge space.

Nothing you imagine or hope for can fly higher than that.

Like a giant oak tree full of apple blossoms, the great person inside you stands strong.

His strength keeps you grounded, his smell lifts you up, and because he lasts forever, you do too.
