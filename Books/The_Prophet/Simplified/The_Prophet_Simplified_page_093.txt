Now you might wonder, "How can we tell which pleasures are good and which are not?" 

Look at your fields and gardens, and you will see. The bee enjoys gathering honey from the flower. At the same time, the flower enjoys giving its honey to the bee.

For the bee, the flower is a source of life. For the flower, the bee is a sign of love. Both the bee and the flower need and enjoy giving and receiving pleasure.

People of Orphalese, enjoy your pleasures like the flowers and the bees do.

And a poet said, "Talk to us about Beauty."
