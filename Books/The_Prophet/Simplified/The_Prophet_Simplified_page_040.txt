What does it mean to work with love?

It means making something using your heart, like you are making it for someone you really care about.

It means building a house with care, like your favorite person will live there.

It means planting seeds gently and feeling happy when the crops grow, like your loved one will eat the fruit.

It means putting a little bit of yourself into everything you create and knowing that those who have passed away are watching over you.

I have often heard you say, almost like youâ€™re dreaming, "The person who carves marble and finds their own soul in it is greater than the one who works the land.

And the person who catches the rainbow and puts it on cloth like a human is greater than the one who just makes shoes for us."
