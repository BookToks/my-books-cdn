But the restless people say, "We heard her shouting in the mountains. With her cries, we heard hoofbeats, the flapping of wings, and lions roaring."

At night, the city guards say, "Beauty will rise with the sunrise from the east."

At noon, the workers and travelers say, "We saw her leaning over the earth from the sunset windows."

In winter, those stuck in the snow say, "She will come with spring, jumping over the hills."

In the hot summer, the harvesters say, "We saw her dancing with the autumn leaves, and she had snow in her hair."

You have said many things about beauty, but actually, you were talking about wants that are not fulfilled. Beauty is not a need; it is a joyful feeling.
