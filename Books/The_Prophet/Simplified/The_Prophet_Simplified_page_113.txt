Some of you have said I’m distant and lost in my own loneliness. You said, "He talks to the trees in the forest, but not to people. He sits alone on hilltops and looks down on our city."

It’s true that I have climbed hills and walked in quiet, faraway places.

How else could I have seen you except from very high up or far away?

How can someone really be close unless they are far?

Others called to me without words and said, "Stranger, stranger, lover of unreachable heights, why do you live on the mountaintops where eagles make their nests?

Why do you try to reach what seems impossible?"
