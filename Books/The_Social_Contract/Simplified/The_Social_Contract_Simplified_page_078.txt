Conclusion

Civil religion should have only a few simple and clear beliefs that everyone in the country can accept. It should allow tolerance only for religions whose beliefs don’t go against being a good citizen. If someone says, "Only my religion can save you," that person should be kept out of the government—unless the government is ruled by the church itself. That kind of strict belief only works in a theocracy (where church and state are the same), but in any other government, it causes big problems.

For example, King Henry IV is said to have accepted the Roman Catholic religion because Protestants said, “Our faith is the only way to heaven,” which should make any smart leader avoid such extreme ideas.

People who think there’s a difference between religious intolerance and civil intolerance are wrong. You can’t live peacefully with people you believe are doomed forever. Loving them would be like hating God, who punishes them. So, if you accept religious intolerance, it will always affect the government too. When that happens, the ruler loses power, and priests become the real bosses, while kings become their helpers.

Now that I’ve explained the true rules of political power and tried to base the state on solid ground, the next step would be to make it stronger through its relationships with other countries. This includes things like laws between nations, trade, war, peace talks, and treaties. But that’s a big topic, too big for me to cover here.

For example, marriage is a civil contract that affects society. If the church claims it has the only right to approve marriages—something intolerant religions always want—then it controls who can marry. This control could give the church power over inheritances, jobs, citizens, and even the government itself. What if people don’t marry but still have kids? That’s not a solution because the state couldn’t survive if everyone was born outside of marriage.

Some might say people can fight back through appeals, delays, and legal tricks. But the church wouldn’t even need courage to ignore these—they’d just wait calmly and still end up in charge. Giving up some power isn’t a big loss if it means gaining total control in the end.
