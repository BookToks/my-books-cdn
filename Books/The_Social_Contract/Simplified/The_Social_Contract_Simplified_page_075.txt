Starting from Hobbes’ point of view, some people argue that no government has ever been created without a religious foundation. Others say Christian law actually weakens the government more than it helps. I’ll explain this by looking at a strange kind of religion.

There’s a weird type of religion that gives people two sets of rules, two leaders, and two countries to follow. This religion makes it hard for people to be both good citizens and true believers. The religion of the Lamas (Buddhist monks) is like this, and so is the religion of the Japanese. Another example is Roman Catholic Christianity. We can call this kind of religion "the religion of the priest." It creates a confusing and sometimes harmful set of rules that don’t fit well with society.

Religion, when looked at in relation to society, can be divided into two types. (a) If you think about all humans, there’s the religion of mankind; (b) if you think about a particular nation, there’s the religion of its citizens.

Type (a) doesn’t have temples or ceremonies and is all about the personal worship of God and the moral duties people must follow. It’s simple and pure, like natural divine law or true theism.

Type (b) is specific to one country. It has its own gods, saints, rules, ceremonies, and forms of worship. It sees other countries as unbelievers or enemies. It focuses on loyalty to the nation and teaches that serving the country is like serving its guardian god. This is a kind of government-controlled religion where the prince is the top religious leader and judges act like priests. Dying for your country is like being a martyr, breaking its laws is a sin, and criminals are punished as if they anger the gods.

But type (b) is bad because it’s based on lies. It tricks people into superstition and empty ceremonies. It can also become cruel and violent, making people hate and kill those who don’t share their beliefs. This turns the nation into a place of constant war and danger.

In short, religion that divides people and destroys unity is useless. True religion should bring people together, not tear them apart.
