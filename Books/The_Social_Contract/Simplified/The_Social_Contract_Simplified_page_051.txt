Keeping control over justice and laws is really important. A tyrant is someone who takes power without having the right to it. That’s how the Greeks saw the word ‘tyrant’: they used it for both good and bad rulers who didn’t have real authority. So, ‘tyrant’ and ‘usurper’ basically mean the same thing.

To be clear, I call someone who takes royal power a tyrant, and someone who takes sovereign power a despot. A tyrant forces their way in but still follows the laws; a despot puts themselves above the laws. So a tyrant might not always be a despot, but a despot is always a tyrant.

The life of a country depends on its sovereign authority. The legislative power is like the heart of the state, and the executive power is like its brain, making everything work. Sometimes the brain can stop working but the person is still alive. But if the heart stops, the body dies.

What keeps a state alive isn’t the laws themselves, but the legislative power. Old laws aren’t always followed today, but if the sovereign doesn’t cancel a law, it’s seen as still valid. This is why old laws get so much respect. If a law is good, the sovereign keeps it alive by not changing it.

Good governments don’t last forever. If places like Sparta and Rome fell, no state can last forever. If we want a government that lasts, we shouldn’t even hope for something eternal! Instead, we have to accept that the state will change and grow stronger with new laws.

If laws get weaker over time, it shows the legislative power is gone, and the state is basically dead.

Like a person, a country starts to die as soon as it’s born. How long it lives depends on how strong its constitution is. People are born naturally, but a state is made by humans, so it’s artificial. We can’t live forever, but we can try to make the state last as long as possible by making a good constitution.

Even the best state will end eventually, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to keep it alive as long as we can.

The sovereign only has power through laws. Because laws show the general will, the sovereign can only act when the people come together. You might say, “People gathering like that is impossible today!” But it wasn’t impossible 2000 years ago. Has human nature really changed that much?
