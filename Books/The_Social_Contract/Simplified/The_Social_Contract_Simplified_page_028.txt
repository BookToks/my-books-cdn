People were getting ready for war. At first, he wanted to make Germans and Englishmen go, always hurting the unlucky people in the process.

But he should have started with the Russians first. He stopped his own people from becoming their best by making them believe they couldn’t be better than they were. This was like a French teacher who makes a student think they’re a genius at first but then ruins their chances of ever improving.

The way Russia is ruled is very confusing and messy. Because there are so many different levels of government, the people are actually worse off than if there was just one clear authority. All these layers of government are a constant drain on the people’s resources. There’s hardly anything left for emergencies, and when emergencies do happen, the country is close to falling apart.

Russia wants to take over Europe, but it could also be taken over itself. The Tatars, who live nearby or are part of Russia, might take over by a revolution that feels almost certain to happen. In fact, all the kings in Europe seem to be working together to make this happen faster.

When part of a country is very far from the government, it causes problems for both the government and the people. The government becomes weaker and slower at enforcing laws, stopping people from being mean to each other, fixing problems, protecting against rebellions, and managing things.

Just like nature limits how big a healthy person can grow, there are limits to how big a country can be to be governed well and to support itself. A country can only be so strong and connected; if it gets too big, it won’t reach its full potential. The bigger a country gets, the weaker the bonds between people become. Usually, smaller countries are stronger and more united than huge ones.

There are many reasons for this. One is that the same laws can’t work well in very different regions with their own customs, climates, and ways of living. So, someone might say, "Let’s have different laws for each region." But that would only cause confusion and fights because people from different areas mix and marry each other. When they do, and they don’t know which laws to follow, it causes problems.

Also, the government costs a lot to run. Each city has its own government paid for by the people, then each district, each province, and so on. The higher up the chain you go, the more expensive and complicated it gets, and the more confused people become about who’s actually in charge.
