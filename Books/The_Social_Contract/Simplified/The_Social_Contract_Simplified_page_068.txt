The comitia curiata lost its importance over time. People were given tablets to vote secretly, so no one knew how they voted. This stopped seditious people from using the old open voting method because it would show what they were doing. New rules were made for collecting and counting the votes, but people didn’t always trust the officers in charge. To stop cheating and vote trading, official orders were made, but they didn’t really help.

In ancient Rome, voting was simple. Each man said his vote out loud, and a clerk wrote it down. The majority in each group decided the vote for that group. This worked well when voters were honest and didn’t want to support bad ideas or people. But when people got corrupt and votes were bought, this system failed.

Sometimes, assemblies were called quickly so candidates had no time to prepare. Other times, voting was made secret to stop vote buying and protect those who didn’t want to seem disloyal. Cicero criticized secret voting and blamed it for Rome’s problems, but the author disagrees. They think secret voting is necessary when a country is corrupt, just like sick people need different health rules. Venice lasted a long time because its laws fit its people’s nature.

When a government’s parts don’t fit well together or change too much, a special kind of government is needed to keep things working.
