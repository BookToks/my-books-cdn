Making laws for the coastline, filling the sea with ships, and growing trade and navigation will make your country live a bright but short life! If your coast is just rocky with no easy access, you’ll have to live simply by fishing. This might mean a quieter, maybe even happier life.

Every country has rules that fit its own situation. For example, long ago, the Jews and Arabs focused on religion, the Athenians on literature, Carthage and Tyre on trade, Rhodes on shipping, Sparta on war, and Rome on law. The laws that keep a country working well are called political laws, and if they are good, they’re called fundamental laws.

Why are good laws called fundamental? Because each country has one best way to organize itself. If the people find the best way, they should stick to it, and those laws become fundamental. But if the system is bad, why keep laws that stop it from improving? People can always change their laws. Even if laws are good, if the people want to harm themselves, who can stop them?

There are two important types of relationships in a country. One is how people relate to each other, and the other is how each person relates to the whole country. There should be as little of the first and as much of the second as possible. Each citizen should be independent but also depend on the country. This balance helps bring wealth, more people, and peace. But if laws lose their power, the country’s system will change or fall apart, and nature will take over.

Lastly, there is the relationship between a person and the law, especially about following or not following the rules.
