A good government shows its strength by being able to act from far away, kind of like how a lever works. People’s power only works when it’s focused. If it’s spread out, it disappears like gunpowder scattered on the ground—it won’t explode all at once, only little bits catch fire. That’s why small countries are easier to control strictly, just like wild animals live only in deserts.

I’m surprised that such a simple way to tell if a government is good isn’t recognized. Maybe people see it but don’t want to admit it. So, what’s the main goal of any government? It’s to keep its people safe and help them do well. And how do you know if that’s happening? By looking at how many people there are and if the population is growing. That’s the main sign.

If the population grows without relying on foreigners moving in or taking over new lands, the government is doing well. If the population shrinks, it means the government is failing. So, the best government is the one where the population increases the most.

People argue a lot about what makes a good government. Some say it’s peace, others say freedom, some want safety for property, others want safety for people. Some think the best government is strict, others say it should be gentle. Some want crimes punished, others want to stop crimes before they happen. Some want the country to be strong and feared, others want it to stay quiet.

In the past, people admired times when arts and culture were strong, but they didn’t see the downsides. They didn’t realize those times could also involve a kind of slavery. Maybe someday, books will honestly explain the common interests behind all these ideas.
