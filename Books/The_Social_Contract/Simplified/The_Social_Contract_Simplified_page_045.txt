No one type of government works perfectly everywhere.

If the ruler has too much power compared to the people, the government should be split up so that all parts share authority over the citizens. This way, no one part becomes too strong. But when the government is split, it can be weaker against the ruler. This problem can be fixed by adding middle-level officials who balance the power between the ruler and the government, keeping things fair.

On the other hand, if the government is too weak, setting up courts or groups to force it to act can make it stronger. Democracies do this a lot. When the government is divided one way, it becomes weaker; when divided another way, it becomes stronger. The strongest and weakest governments are simple ones, while mixed governments are somewhere in the middle.

The amount the government takes from the people isn’t the same everywhere. It depends on things like the climate, the type of work people do, the land’s resources, how strong the people are, and how much they need to use. The further the government’s taxes have to travel from the people who pay them, the heavier the burden feels. It’s not about how much money is taken, but how far it has to move to get back to the people. When money moves quickly and safely, it doesn’t matter if the amount is small or big — people feel rich and the country does well. If money moves slowly or gets lost, even small amounts can leave people poor and the country struggling.

No one form of government fits every country. Freedom depends on where you live and who you are. The more you understand this idea, the more true it seems. In every government, the public uses resources without creating them, so it depends on the work of its people. A country can only survive if people’s work gives back more than what they need.

The heavier the taxes and the further they have to travel from the people, the harder it is on them. People have the lightest taxes in democracies, heavier in aristocracies, and heaviest in monarchies. So, monarchies work best in rich countries, aristocracies in medium-sized and wealthy countries, and democracies in small, poor countries.

Basically, free states use everything for the good of the people. Other governments struggle because there’s a fight between what the public needs and what individuals want. When one gets weaker, the other suffers too.
