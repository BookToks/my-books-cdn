Tribunes were created as a part of the government, but the tribunate itself isn’t a permanent part of any big political group. Each term, it fits back into its proper role with the others. The tribunate acts like a middle link connecting the leader with the people or the ruler with the government, or sometimes both at once if needed.

This group, called the tribunate, watches over the laws and the law-making process. Sometimes it protects the ruler from the government, like the tribunes of the people did in ancient Rome. Other times, it defends the government against the people, like the Council of Ten in Venice. Sometimes it keeps the balance between both sides, like the Ephors did in Sparta.

But if the tribunate becomes too powerful, it can cause big problems. In Sparta, the Ephors’ power ruined the city’s traditions and caused its downfall. Rome fell for the same reason: the tribunes gained too much power by claiming they had it. They used laws meant to protect freedom to help emperors destroy it. The Council of Ten in Venice became a terrifying group that harmed both nobles and common people. Instead of protecting the laws, it secretly did bad things without anyone noticing.

The tribunate doesn’t make laws or enforce them, but this actually makes it more powerful. It can’t act directly, but it can stop others from acting. People respect it more than the ruler who applies the laws or the government that makes them. This was clear in Rome when proud nobles had to listen to a simple officer of the people—a tribune.

The power of the tribunate gets weaker as more members join. At first, Rome had two tribunes, then five, and when they tried to double that number, the senate allowed it, thinking they could control them by making them compete with each other—and it worked!

The best way to stop the tribunate from getting out of control would be to have times when it doesn’t exist, instead of it working all the time. These breaks shouldn’t be too long, or bad habits could grow. Laws should be made to keep these breaks regular and short.
