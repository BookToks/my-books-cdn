Civic religion is like a set of rules that help keep society’s morals in check. Even though the law doesn’t control people's behavior directly, it sometimes ignores bad ideas and lets drunk people cause trouble. When laws get weak, bad behavior gets worse. Before talking about that, here’s another example.

In France, they stopped the use of seconds in duels—people who helped fight the duel—just by saying in a royal order: “Those who are too scared to fight without help…” This idea was accepted quickly because people already thought that way. But when the law said dueling itself was cowardly, people didn’t believe it because they already decided differently.

Censorship helps keep morals good by stopping bad ideas from spreading and by guiding people’s opinions when they’re unsure. It works best when the laws are strong; when laws get weak, nothing good can stay strong. Censorship can protect morals but can’t fix them once they’ve really broken down.

In the past, people didn’t have kings like we do now; they believed gods ruled everything. They thought like Caligula, a Roman emperor who thought he was a god. Back then, it made sense to believe gods were in charge because people needed a long time to accept that other humans could be leaders and that they could benefit from following them.

In Sparta, if a person with bad morals made a good suggestion, the leaders ignored it and waited for a good person to say the same thing instead. That was both unfair and honorable. Some drunk people even ruined the leaders’ ability to make good decisions. When Sparta decided what was right or wrong, Greece accepted it without question.

Sometimes, bad behavior was allowed instead of punished, which made things worse. Different groups of people couldn’t share the same leaders or gods because they didn’t trust each other. That’s how many gods came to exist, and it led to religious and political fights, which are really the same thing.

The Greeks liked finding their gods in other people’s lands because they thought they ruled those people. Today, scholars have come up with ideas about this that don’t always make sense.
