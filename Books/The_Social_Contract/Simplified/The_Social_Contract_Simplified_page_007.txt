The idea of "the right of the strongest" means the strongest person gets to be the boss. This idea comes from people like Caligula, Hobbes, and Grotius. Even Aristotle said that people aren’t naturally equal because some are born to be slaves and others to be leaders.

Aristotle was right about this, but he confused what caused it. You could think of a family as a small version of a government: the ruler is like the dad, and the people are like the kids. Everyone is born free and equal, so no one gives up their freedom without getting something back. The difference is in a family, the dad cares for his kids because he loves them, but in a government, the ruler only cares because he likes being in charge.

Slaves lose everything, even their will to be free. They might seem to accept their life, but that’s just because they have no choice. If slaves exist naturally, it’s because people were forced into slavery and then stayed that way because they were too afraid to fight back.

I haven’t talked about King Adam or Emperor Noah, who supposedly divided the world among his sons after the flood. Some people believe they ruled the whole world. I hope you think I’m fair in saying this. Like Adam, who was the only ruler on his island, a king can feel safe and not worry about rebellions if he’s the only one in charge.

Grotius says that not all power comes from people agreeing to it. He uses slavery as an example. His way of thinking is to say what is happening now must be right, which often helps rulers keep control.

Philo said that Caligula thought rulers are like shepherds and people are like sheep. Since rulers are stronger, they have the right to control people, and people should obey them. This idea, called "the right of the strongest," sounds like a joke but it’s actually taken seriously.
