Before talking about the different types of government, let’s first understand what the word ‘government’ really means. It’s wrong to think government is the same as the sovereign (the ultimate ruler). Instead, government serves the sovereign.

So, what is government? It’s a group set up between the people and the sovereign to help them communicate. Its job is to apply laws and keep freedom and order in society.

This part needs careful reading. The people in the government are called ‘magistrates’ or ‘kings’, meaning governors. The whole group is called the ‘prince’. Some say when people choose leaders, it’s not a contract but a job given to officials by the sovereign.

The government has the power the sovereign gives them, and the sovereign can change or take back this power. The government can’t have full control because that would go against how society works and what it’s supposed to do.

In my way of using the word, ‘government’ means the lawful use of executive power, and ‘magistrate’ means the person or group given that power.

We know the people, as the sovereign, hold the law-making power, but the government can’t have that power because it involves actions outside the law. So, the government needs its own agents to enforce the laws, follow the general will, and connect the state with the sovereign. It’s like how the body and soul work together in a person.
