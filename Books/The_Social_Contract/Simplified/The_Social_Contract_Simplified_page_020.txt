The limits of the sovereign power give the whole group total control over everyone in it. This power is general—it applies to everyone and everything. This power, guided by the general will of all the people, is called ‘sovereignty’. But when this power focuses on a specific, limited goal, it loses its true fairness because then we, the people who share the general will, have to judge something that doesn’t really belong to all of us. So, we don’t have clear rules to follow.

Besides the public group, we also have to think about the private people who make it up. Their lives and freedom naturally don’t depend on the group’s power. So, we need to clearly separate the citizens’ rights from the sovereign’s rights, and the citizens’ duties as members of society from their natural rights as human beings.

When a specific question comes up that hasn’t been settled by a general agreement, things get tricky. It’s like a court case where the people involved are on one side, and the public is on the other. But it’s hard to know what law should be used or who should make the decision. Could we ask the general will to decide? That wouldn’t work because the general will can only be the decision of one side, and the other side would see it as just someone’s personal opinion, which could be wrong or unfair.

So, just like a personal opinion can’t represent everyone’s opinion, the general will—even though it is for everyone—can’t decide about one person or one specific case. For example, when the people of Athens chose or removed their leaders, or gave rewards and punishments, they were acting as rulers, not as the general will. This might seem strange, but I’ll explain my point better soon.

You can see that what makes the will general is less about the number of people and more about the common good that brings them together. In this system, everyone accepts the rules because they know they must follow them too, and can’t just work only for themselves.

Why is the general will always right, and why does everyone want what’s best for each person? It’s because everyone thinks of “each” as meaning themselves, and so when they vote for what’s best for all, they are really voting for what’s best for themselves. This shows that equality and justice come from the way people naturally care about themselves.
