Voting is important because it helps people protect their own interests. But this isn’t always clear when a state’s constitution has different groups of citizens, like in ancient Rome where there were nobles and common people who often fought with each other.

Sometimes, instead of answering the real question, people vote as if they were answering a different one. But this problem shows that the state is kind of split into two parts. What’s true for the two parts together might not be true for each part on its own.

Even during tough times, when the common people voted without the Senate interfering, their votes usually passed easily because they shared the same interests and will.

On the other hand, when everyone agrees all the time, it can mean the citizens have lost their freedom and no longer have their own opinions. Fear and flattery replace real discussion. People stop thinking and just either praise the leaders or insult their enemies. This is how the Senate acted under the Emperors, sometimes so secretly that they would make loud noises to hide what they really thought.

What rules should we use to count votes and compare opinions? It depends on how easy it is to find out what the general will is, and how healthy the state is. The closer people’s opinions are to being the same, the more the general will is in charge. But if there are lots of arguments and fights, it means special interests are taking over and the state is getting weaker.

There is only one law that always needs everyone’s full agreement: the social contract. Joining society is the most voluntary thing anyone can do. Every person is born free and is their own boss, so no one can make them a subject without their permission.
