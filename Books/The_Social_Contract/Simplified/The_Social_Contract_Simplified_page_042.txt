Monarchy is a system where one person, like a prince or king, rules over everyone else. The prince wants his people to be strong because that makes him powerful and respected by other countries. But to stay in control, he also needs his people to obey him. The problem is that being strong and making people obey don’t always go well together, so the prince has to choose which is more important to him.

It’s really hard to run a big country well, and it’s even harder for just one person to do it alone. Everyone knows what happens when kings try to do everything themselves—it doesn’t work out well! Samuel warned the Hebrews about this, and Machiavelli talked about it too. Although Machiavelli wrote for kings, he was actually giving advice to the people.

Monarchy has a big problem that republics don’t have. In a republic, the people usually pick smart and capable leaders who do a good job. But in a monarchy, the people who get to the top are often not very smart or honest—they might be sneaky or selfish, and they end up showing how bad they are once they get power. The people usually make better choices than the prince does.

In democracies, everyone has a say, so the ruler is very close to the people. But in a monarchy, the ruler is far away from the people, and that makes the country hard to manage. To fix this, there need to be middle groups like nobles or dukes to connect the ruler and the people. But this kind of system doesn’t work well in small countries because the differences between classes cause problems.

Sometimes, when a really good leader finally takes charge in a monarchy that was almost ruined by bad rulers, people are surprised by how much he can fix. This can start a new and better time for the country.

Machiavelli was a smart and honest guy who cared about his country, but he had to hide his true feelings because of the powerful people around him. He chose a bad guy, Cesare Borgia, as an example in his book, which shows his real ideas. His writings can be confusing if you don’t look closely, and some people only read them the wrong way. The powerful court in Rome even banned his book because it showed them in a bad light.
