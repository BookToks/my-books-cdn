Can the general will ever be wrong? The general will is like the combined will of all the people, but it’s still a special kind of will when it comes to the state. This means that the general will always aims to do what’s best for everyone.

However, the people’s decisions aren’t always perfect. We all want what’s good for us, but sometimes we don’t really understand what that is. The people aren’t usually corrupted, but they can be tricked, and when that happens, it might look like they want something bad.

For the general will to be clear, there shouldn’t be groups within the state that only care about themselves. Each person should think about the community, not just their own group. This idea was part of the system made by the ancient lawmaker Lycurgus. If groups do exist, it’s better to have many of them and make sure none of them becomes too powerful, like what Solon, Numa, and Servius did long ago.

If people made decisions on their own without talking to each other, their small individual wills would add up to the general will, and the decisions would be good. But when groups form and start working against each other, the will of those groups can take over. Then the general will isn’t just the sum of everyone’s wishes anymore.

The state is like a body made up of many parts, and its main job is to keep itself alive and working well. It needs the power to make sure all its parts work together in the best way. Just like nature gives each person control over their own body, the social contract gives the state power over its members to keep things running smoothly.
