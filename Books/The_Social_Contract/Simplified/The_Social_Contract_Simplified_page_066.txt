In ancient Rome, the comitia were public meetings where important decisions were made. People were divided into different social classes, and this affected how the comitia worked.

There were really six classes, but usually only five are mentioned because the sixth didn’t have soldiers or votes and wasn’t very important. The Roman people did more than just pass laws and choose leaders—they actually handled many important government tasks. Some say these assemblies helped decide the future of Europe!

The comitia met in public squares or the Campus Martius, and there were three main types: (1) the comitia curiata, started by Romulus; (2) the comitia centuriata, started by Servius; and (3) the comitia tributa, started by the people’s tribunes.

Romulus set up these groups to balance power—the people could check the senate, and the senate could check the people. But the nobility still had more influence because of their rich clients. This system of patrons and clients was smart and helped keep the nobility in check, even though they had more power.

For the comitia to meet legally and make real decisions, three things had to happen: (a) the leader calling the meeting had to have permission, (b) the meeting had to happen on an allowed day, and (c) the religious signs (auguries) had to be good.

The meetings by curiae lasted until Servius’s time. Under the Republic, the curiae only included the city’s four urban tribes and didn’t represent all the people well. This caused the senate to prefer other types of assemblies.
