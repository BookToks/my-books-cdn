In ancient Rome, there were different groups that helped choose leaders and make decisions. Some of these groups were made up of rich, powerful people called nobles, while others included regular citizens called plebeians. Sometimes, the way they voted wasn’t very fair because the rich people had more power.

One group, called the comitia centuriata, was set up to favor the rich. They divided the people into groups based on how much money they had. The richest group had more votes than all the others combined. So, when the rich group agreed on something, the rest didn’t even need to vote. This meant the rich usually got their way.

But there were two things that made this less unfair. First, many of the tribunes, who were leaders of the plebeians, were also rich, so they balanced the power a bit. Second, instead of always letting the richest group vote first, the Romans picked one group by lottery to vote first. The others usually agreed with that group. This way, the order of voting was more random and fair.

There were other groups too. The comitia tributa was more like a council for the people, where only the tribunes could call meetings and lead votes. The senate had no say there and had to follow the laws made, even if they didn’t like them. The comitia curiata, where most Romans were members, didn’t really do much except sometimes cause problems.

Overall, these different groups showed how Rome tried to mix power between the rich and the regular people, but the system still mostly helped the rich.
