The sovereign, or the ruling power, only exists because of an agreement, called a contract. This contract is really important and can’t be broken. So, the sovereign can’t make promises that go against this original agreement, like giving away part of itself or letting another ruler take control. If it did, it would destroy itself, and nothing new can be made from something that’s already gone.

When many people come together to form one group, any harm done to one person is seen as harm to the whole group. And if the group is hurt, the members feel it too. So, both the individual and the group have to help each other because it’s their duty and it’s also in their best interest.

An individual can make promises to themselves in two ways: as a person and as a member of the group. But the sovereign can’t make promises to itself because it doesn’t have two separate roles like a person does. The sovereign is always made up of its people, so it can’t want to harm them or treat them badly. It naturally wants what’s best for its members.

However, the relationship between the people and the sovereign is different. The sovereign can’t be sure the people will always keep their promises to behave well unless it has some way to trust them.

Each person can have their own personal wishes that might not match what’s best for the group. Sometimes, what an individual wants conflicts with what’s best for everyone. But the sovereign, when dealing with other countries or rulers, is just one simple being, like an individual person.

The social contract itself can’t force the people to follow a law that even the group can’t break. This doesn’t mean the sovereign can’t make agreements with others, like other countries. It can, because when it’s dealing with things outside itself, it acts like a single person.
