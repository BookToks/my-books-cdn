What does ‘wise’ mean?

When Rousseau talks about what ‘you’ or ‘we’ can do, he actually means what ‘one’ can do. Subsistence means what you need to survive—like food, drink, and shelter.

In French, people use ‘on’ (which means ‘one’) much more often than we do in English. It sounds normal in French, but in English, using ‘one’ a lot can sound old-fashioned or awkward.

The word ‘wise’ is a tricky translation of the French word ‘sage.’ In French, it means not just ‘wise,’ but also ‘learned,’ ‘scholarly,’ or ‘intellectual.’
