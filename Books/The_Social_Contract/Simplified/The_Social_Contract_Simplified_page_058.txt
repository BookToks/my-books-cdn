Protecting the government from being taken over uses an old legal idea. The regular meetings I talked about earlier are meant to stop or delay this disaster. These meetings have a better chance of working if the leader doesn’t have to be officially called together because then the leader can’t stop them without openly breaking the law and becoming an enemy of the state.

The leader is supposed to only allow what is legally right. This rule helps the leader keep power even if the people don’t agree, without anyone being able to say the leader has stolen power. The meetings, which exist just to keep the social agreement alive, should always start by asking two important questions that must not be ignored and should be voted on separately:

(1) “Does the leader want to keep the government the way it is?”  
(2) “Does the people want the current leaders to stay in charge?”

I’m assuming something I think I have already explained: there is no law in the state that can never be changed. Even the social agreement itself can be ended if all the citizens meet together for the purpose of breaking it. If that happened, it would be totally fair. Grotius even believes that each person can leave their country, giving up their membership, and regain their freedom and property when they leave.

Of course, this only applies if the person isn’t running away just to avoid their duties or helping their country when it really needs them. In that case, running away would be a crime, not a fair exit.
