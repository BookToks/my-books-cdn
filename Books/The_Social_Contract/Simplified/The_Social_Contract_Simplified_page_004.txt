The magistracy is all the officials who govern, not just one event but ongoing rules and traditions that everyone follows as a group.

These traditions include the meaning of words, manners, and the basic habits of a people, like their ideas about right and wrong, how people usually act, and what is considered polite or decent. So, calling it a ‘convention’ or an ‘agreement’ is not quite right.

To alienate something you own means to lose it or give it away. This word doesn’t have a perfect English match, so sometimes people just use it because it sounds useful, like the word Schadenfreude.

The word ‘arbitrary’ means something decided by someone’s choice. Here, it doesn’t mean the choice was careless or unfair.

A moral person is not a real person but is treated like one for certain ideas.

The word ‘censorship’ here translates a word Rousseau used called ‘censure,’ but it doesn’t mean the same thing as what we think of as censorship today.

Rousseau talks a lot about ‘the people,’ which means a group or nation, not just the common public. Sometimes this way of saying ‘people’ sounds strange in English, so it’s easier to say ‘populace.’

The words ‘compact’ and ‘contract’ translate Rousseau’s words ‘pacte’ and ‘contrat.’ He uses them to mean the same thing.

Rousseau also uses ‘prince’ to mean the leader of the government. This doesn’t have to be an actual prince; it could be a group of people.

A ‘constitution’ means how something is set up and works, not just a written document.

The word ‘sovereign’ means the person or group with the highest power in a state. In a democracy, the whole population is the sovereign, and individual citizens are part of it. Rousseau sometimes uses ‘sovereign’ to mean the lawmakers, which is different from the government or leaders who carry out laws.
