When elections happen, winning by just one vote should be enough. This idea is clear. A mixed way of choosing leaders works best for two reasons: (i) it fits better with the laws, and (ii) it matches a mixed kind of government. The government in Venice shows this well. It’s mixed because it’s wrong to think it’s just controlled by rich, powerful families.

The best way to decide things is by combining different methods. In Venice, regular people don’t have a say in government, but the nobles are the people. Many nobles are poor younger sons who never get important jobs. Their “nobility” only gives them the right to be called “Your Excellency” and to sit in the Great Council, which is like our General Council in Geneva. Even though it looks fancy, these nobles don’t have more real power than regular citizens.

Elections for the prince and other leaders in Venice are complicated. There are two ways to pick them: by voting or by drawing lots (like a lottery). Both methods have been used in different republics. The election of the Doge in Venice still uses a mix of these two. Montesquieu said that picking leaders by lottery is democratic because it’s fair and gives everyone a real chance to serve their country. But that’s not the whole story.

If we remember that leaders are chosen by the government, not by the people’s power, we understand why lotteries make sense in democracies. In democracies, being a leader is a tough job, not a prize. It’s fairer to pick leaders by chance because no one is specially chosen by a person’s will. In real democracies, everyone would be equal in character, skills, and money, so it wouldn’t matter who was picked. But real democracies don’t exist.

In aristocracies like Venice, the prince picks the next prince, and the government stays controlled by the same group. This is the right situation for voting. The Doge’s election in Venice mixes voting and lottery well. Important jobs that need special skills, like military positions, are chosen by vote. Other jobs, like judges, are picked by lottery, because they need fairness and good sense.
