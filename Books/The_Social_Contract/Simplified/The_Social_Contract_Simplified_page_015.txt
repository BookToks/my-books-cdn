A person who controls land only for their own needs is free, but wanting more and more is like being a slave to desire. Once someone has a piece of land, they should stick to that amount. Following rules we make for ourselves is true freedom. I’ve talked a lot about this before, but the idea of the first person to take land having the right to it is important, even if it seems weak. What’s important is not what belongs to others, but what doesn’t belong to you.

To say someone has the right to land they first take, three things must be true: When the community starts, the land wasn’t taken by anyone else; each person gives themselves to the community as they are, with all they own; and they only take as much land as they need to live on. Also, they must actually work the land, not just claim it by standing on it. Their work is the only sign others should respect if there’s no legal paper.

The community owns everyone’s goods through a social agreement, which makes public ownership stronger than individual ownership. But this doesn’t apply to outsiders, whose land rights depend on being the first to take it. If someone just steps on land, is that enough to own it? If they push others away even for a little while, does that stop those people from coming back? If someone takes a huge area and keeps others out, that’s just stealing space and resources and shouldn’t be allowed.

There are two ways to claim land in nature: (i) being the first to take it, and (ii) being the strongest. The first way is more real, but it only becomes true ownership when laws support it. Everyone naturally has a right to what they need, but once something belongs to someone, it means others can’t claim it. For example, when Balboa claimed South America for Spain, was that enough to take land from the people living there or block other rulers? If so, there would be no need for all the official ceremonies.
