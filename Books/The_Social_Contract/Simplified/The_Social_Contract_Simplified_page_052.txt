We think that people in charge keep their power because the state’s rules are set in one big law or constitution. These rules limit them by controlling our weaknesses, bad habits, and biases. People who don’t believe in great leaders often make fun of the idea of freedom.  

Let’s think about what can be done, remembering what has already been done. I won’t talk about old Greek republics, but the Roman republic seems like a great example of a strong state, and Rome was a great city. The last count showed Rome had 400,000 citizens who could fight, and the whole Empire had over four million citizens—not counting foreigners, women, children, or slaves.  

Getting such a big population together often must have been a huge job! But the Roman people met almost every week and sometimes even more often. They had the right to make decisions and judge some cases. People acted as leaders and citizens in these meetings.  

If we go back to the early days of nations, most old governments—even kingships like Macedonia and the Franks—had similar councils. The fact that Romans had assemblies shows it’s possible to do. “If something exists, it can be done” seems like good logic to me.  

There must be regular meetings that can’t be canceled or delayed, so the people can come together on the right day without needing a special invitation. These are in addition to emergency meetings. Any meeting not called by the right officials in the right way should not be considered real, and its decisions don’t count. The law must be the reason people meet.  

How often should these meetings happen? It depends on many things, so there are no exact rules. But usually, the stronger the government, the more often the people need to meet and show they have power.  

You might say, “This might work for one town, but what if the state has many towns? Should power be split up, or should one town rule the others?” Neither is right. Power is one thing and can’t be split without breaking it. Also, one town can’t really rule another, just like one nation can’t rule another.  

The key to a country working well is a balance between obeying the rules and having freedom. The words “subject” and “sovereign” fit together because being a citizen means both following and having rights.  

It’s never good to combine many towns into one city, and anyone trying to do that should be careful.
