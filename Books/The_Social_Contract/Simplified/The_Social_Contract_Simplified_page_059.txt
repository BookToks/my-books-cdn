The general will can never be destroyed. When people believe this, it makes them happy. They don’t realize that in other places, leaders like Cromwell or the Duc de Beaufort would have been punished harshly by their people.

When a group of people come together and see themselves as one, they share one will that cares about everyone’s survival and happiness. But if the connection between people starts to weaken, and smaller groups push their own interests, the common good changes and gets weaker.

In that case, the general will is no longer what everyone wants; people start to disagree, argue, and don’t just accept advice without thinking. Simple people are easy to understand and not fooled by tricky excuses or false promises.

In the happiest places, you’ll find groups of simple people acting wisely and ignoring fancy tricks used by other nations. They don’t need many laws, and when new laws are needed, everyone agrees on them because they’re just stating what everyone already thinks.

When the social bond breaks, people stop thinking as citizens and only care about themselves. Bad laws that only help private interests get passed as if they were for the public good.

Does this mean the general will is destroyed or corrupted? No, it stays the same, pure and unchanging. But other selfish wills take over and push it aside. Each person knows they can’t separate their own interests from the common good because their personal gain might hurt others. Still, they think their private benefits are more important.

Even though people want their own good, deep down they also want what’s best for everyone else.
