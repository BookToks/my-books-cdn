The comitia in ancient Rome

When Servius made his new division, he split the people of Rome into thirty groups called curiae. These curiae didn’t fit evenly into his four tribes, and he didn’t want to change the tribes, so the curiae became a separate way to divide the people. But the curiae didn’t affect the rural tribes or their members because the tribes became only a civil system, not a military one. A new system for raising soldiers was created, so the old Romulus divisions were no longer needed.

Servius also said the assembly should meet in the Campus Martius, and everyone old enough to fight had to bring their weapons. Why didn’t he split the last group into young and old? Because these people weren’t allowed to carry weapons for the country. To have the right to defend your home, you had to actually have a home! Many poor people didn’t have homes, so they couldn’t be soldiers. Even though lots of beggars were in armies later, back then, if you were poor, you probably wouldn’t be accepted in a Roman soldier group.

Even though every citizen was in a tribe, many didn’t belong to a curia. Servius made a third big division, different from the other two, and this was the most important one. He divided all Roman people into six classes based on how much money they had, not where they lived or who they were. The richest were in the first classes, the poorest in the last, and people in the middle had moderate wealth. These six classes were split further into 183 smaller groups called centuries. The first class had more than half the centuries, but the last class, even though it had more than half the people, counted as only one century.

To hide this from the public, Servius gave the system a military feel: in the second class, he added two centuries of armourers, and in the fourth, two centuries of weapon makers. In every class except the last, he separated young men who had to fight from older men who didn’t have to. This wasn’t about wealth but about age and the right to bear arms. This idea made sure the system worked well for a long time.

The last class included many people called proletarians and capite censi. The proletarians still gave some soldiers when needed, but the capite censi, or “head-count people,” had nothing to give and were counted just by their heads. They had no property or animals. Later, Marius was the first to include these poorest people as soldiers.

This whole system could only work because early Romans were simple, liked farming, and didn’t care much about money or business. Today, with people always wanting more, always competing, and always changing their luck, such a system would fall apart quickly. The strong Roman customs and laws helped keep it stable for many years.
