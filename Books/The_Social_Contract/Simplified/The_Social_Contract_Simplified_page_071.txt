Censorship

In early Rome, when there was an emergency, a dictator was chosen to take charge. But this system wasn’t very smart. What bothers me isn’t that it could be abused or that dictators might be lazy. In Rome, dictators only had power for six months, and most of them stepped down early. If their term had been longer, they might have tried to stay in power, like the decemvirs did when they were chosen for a year. The dictator only had time to deal with the problem that made him needed; he couldn’t work on other projects.

Later on, near the end of the Roman Republic, the Romans became more careful and started using dictators much less often, which was the opposite of before when they used them too much.

But their worries were not true. The city of Rome was actually safe from its leaders because it was weak. A dictator might protect freedom sometimes but never threaten it. The real power came from Rome’s armies, not from inside the city. The weak resistance of generals like Marius against Sulla, and Pompey against Caesar, showed how outside forces were stronger than home authority.

Because of this wrong idea, the Romans made big mistakes, like not choosing a dictator during the Catilinarian conspiracy. Rousseau explains this complicated event in detail. He thinks a dictator could have fixed everything quickly, but in reality, it took a long time with many trials and mixed behavior by Cicero, who was both a consul and a lawyer. Things working out in Rome’s favor was more luck than anything else.

When someone is trusted with this power, their time in charge should be very short and never extended. In emergencies that lead to choosing a dictator, the state is either about to be lost or saved. The people’s opinions and values—called mœurs—are very important. You can’t separate what a nation likes from what it thinks is right. People’s tastes come from what they believe, not from nature. Good opinions and values will improve themselves over time.

People always love what is good or what they think is good, but they often make mistakes about what really is good. What needs to be controlled is their judgment about these values. When judging mœurs, you’re really deciding what is honorable, and this is based on public opinion, which is like a kind of law.

Rousseau also talks about how a country’s constitution depends on the people’s opinions and habits. These opinions shape what the country is like and what it values.
