People called him a fool; but he’ll never start a great empire, and people don’t like anyone pointing out their problems. Even if he fixes these problems, whatever he creates will soon fall apart. It’s like scared patients who act silly. Tricks only make people trust you for a little while; only real wisdom makes people respect a doctor.

The Jewish law still exists today, and I’m not saying Islamic law, which ruled half the world for a thousand years, wasn’t important. When violence and revolutions shake people, they still remember the great leaders who made the laws. Even after political fights destroy a state, it can rise again like a phoenix. But when people fight about politics, they often see those leaders as lucky cheats. Still, fresh energy comes from tough times.

True political thinkers respect the strong systems set up by great leaders. For example, Sparta under Lycurgus, Rome after the Tarquins were gone, and today, Holland and Switzerland after getting rid of tyrants.

The right idea is not that politics and religion have the same goal, but that religion is sometimes used for politics when a nation is just starting out. These big changes are rare and don’t happen twice to the same people. People can make themselves free when they are still wild, but not after they’ve settled down. Then, revolts can break things but not fix them. A country needs a leader to build, not just a hero to free it. Free people should remember: “Liberty can be gained, but it can never be taken back.”

Before building a big building, an architect checks if the ground can hold it. Similarly, a smart lawmaker doesn’t make laws without seeing if the people are ready for them. Plato wouldn’t make laws for some groups because he knew they were too rich and couldn’t handle equality. Crete had good laws but bad people because the leader tried to control people who were already bad.

Some nations can handle rules early on; others take centuries. Russia, for example, was never truly civilized because it tried too soon. Peter the Great copied others but didn’t create his own ideas. He knew his people were wild but didn’t realize they weren’t ready to be civilized yet. He wanted to civilize them when they just needed to prepare.

Many great nations couldn’t keep good laws for long, and most people are only open to learning when they’re young. As they grow older, they get set in their ways. Once habits and beliefs are strong, trying to change them is risky and mostly useless.
