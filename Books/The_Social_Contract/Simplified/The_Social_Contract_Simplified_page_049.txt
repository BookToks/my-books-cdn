Is the author motivated by abuse and decay of government? No! No matter what people say, when a country’s population is shrinking, it’s not true that everything is falling apart. Sometimes a little trouble can wake people up. What really makes us successful isn’t just peace, but freedom.

We should care less about the rulers’ calm and more about the well-being of whole countries, especially the biggest ones. A hailstorm might destroy some towns, but it usually doesn’t cause a famine. Wars and uprisings scare leaders, but they aren’t the real problems for people. People can even relax when there’s a fight over who will be the boss. Their true good times and bad times come from their ongoing situation: when the whole country is crushed under control, it starts to fall apart. That’s when rulers ruin their people by breaking the balance of power.

When big fights shook France, even when the Assistant Bishop of Paris carried a dagger to Parliament, the people still lived well and grew in honor and freedom. A long time ago, Greece did great even during terrible wars; blood was spilled everywhere, but the country was still full of life. Machiavelli said that even in civil war, the republic did well because the people were virtuous, moral, and independent.

How does a government decay? There are two main ways: it either shrinks or breaks apart.

A government shrinks when power moves from many people to just a few—like going from democracy to aristocracy, or from aristocracy to monarchy. This usually happens naturally. If a government tried to go the other way, it would be unusual.

For example, the Republic of Venice slowly developed like this and stayed mostly in the aristocracy stage for over a thousand years. Some people might say the Roman Republic went the opposite way, from monarchy to aristocracy to democracy. But that’s not quite right. Rome started with a mix of powers but quickly became a dictatorship. The real Roman Republic began after the kings were kicked out, but it wasn’t stable because the nobility still held a lot of power. This fight between the rich nobles and the people made the government unstable until it finally settled later on.
