The people as a whole are the true rulers because they share a common will, and everyone has to follow the government because of their duty to obey.

Sometimes, the group in charge can get really big by including every citizen, but this doesn’t change who’s really in control. The government isn’t based on a contract or deal; it’s more like a law that everyone agrees to follow.

The leaders aren’t bosses over the people; they are just workers doing their jobs for the citizens. The people can change or remove these leaders whenever they want. The leaders don’t have the right to question the rules because they’re just doing what they’re supposed to as citizens.

When the people decide to create a government led by one family (like a king) or a group of rich people (an aristocracy), they aren’t making a promise forever. They are just choosing a temporary way to run things until the people want to change it.

This kind of change happens all the time, like in England’s parliament, where the group of representatives can change how they work to make better decisions. They can switch between making laws and carrying them out, but they’re still working for the people.

Democracy is special because it can start just by the people agreeing together. Then, this temporary government can stay in charge if that’s what the people want, or it can create a new government following the rules.

It’s true that changing a government can be risky, and it shouldn’t happen unless the government is doing something bad for the people. But this is just advice, not a strict law. The state doesn’t have to keep bad rulers any more than it has to keep bad generals.

Whenever a government is changed, it’s super important to follow all the proper steps so it’s done legally and not just because a small group is causing trouble. The decision has to come from the will of all the people, not just a loud faction.

Taking great care in this process is crucial—there’s no such thing as being too careful!
