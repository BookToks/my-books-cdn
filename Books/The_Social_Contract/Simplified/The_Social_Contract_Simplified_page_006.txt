The Social Contract  
Jean-Jacques Rousseau  

12. The first societies  

This short piece comes from a much longer work that I stopped writing a long time ago because I wasn’t sure I could finish it. Out of all the parts I could save from that longer work, this is the biggest and the one I think is worth sharing. The rest isn’t.

I want to talk about this question: With people as they are, and only thinking about force and laws, can there be any real and fair way to run a government by force? When a group of people is forced to obey, they do it because they have to. But as soon as they can break free, they usually do. If someone says they don’t have the right to break free, they can answer that they got their freedom back by force—the same way it was taken away.

I’m not going to start by proving that this topic is important. You might ask me, “Since you want to write about politics, does that mean you’re a king or lawmaker?” I’m neither, and that’s why I’m writing about politics. If I were a king or lawmaker, I wouldn’t waste time saying what should be done—I’d just do it or stay quiet. But social order isn’t about force; it’s a sacred right that all other rights depend on. It doesn’t come from nature, so it has to be based on agreements.

Before I explain more, I need to show that what I’ve said is true.

I always find that thinking about governments makes me love my own country’s government even more!  

2. The first societies  

The oldest and only natural society is the family. But children only stay connected to their father as long as they need him to survive. Once they don’t need him anymore, the natural bond breaks. The children stop obeying the father, and the father, no longer responsible, goes back to being independent too. If they stay connected after that, it’s not because it’s natural but for other reasons.
