When the law-maker tried to bring back all the old cruel ways of ruling and the basic rules of running a country, it almost caused the end of everything. This was because it gave the power to make laws and the power to rule to the same people. These new groups would have to control themselves.

In the 5th century BCE, a group called the Decemviri, which means “ten men,” was chosen to create a set of laws for the Roman Republic. But even the Decemviri, who made the laws, didn’t claim the right to make laws by themselves. They knew they couldn’t force people or just use their own reason to pass laws. Instead, they needed a different kind of power. They told the people, “Nothing we suggest can become law without your agreement.”

Rousseau said this means “persuade without convincing.” In other words, the law-maker should get people to agree without just forcing reasons on them.

So, the person who writes the laws doesn’t have the right to make laws alone. And the people can’t give up this right, even if they want to. This idea has made leaders over the years ask for help from higher powers or gods so people would follow the laws, seeing them as natural and fair.

Making laws involves two things that seem to clash: it’s a task that needs great power beyond what people usually have, but its power comes from nothing but the agreement of the people.

Another problem is that wise people who try to explain laws in their own smart way often fail to connect with regular people. To pass laws, they have to speak like the everyday crowd, not like experts. But it’s not easy for anyone to truly represent the will of the people.

There are many ideas that are too broad or too far away from what people understand. Each person cares mostly about what benefits them and dislikes laws that make life harder.

Some try to trick people by making fake religious messages or using tricks to force laws on them. But these tricks don’t work well. Only a law-maker with a big heart and real care for the people can make laws that truly help everyone.

Anyone else might write words on stone or pretend to talk to gods, but without real understanding and respect for the people, their laws won’t last or be fair.
