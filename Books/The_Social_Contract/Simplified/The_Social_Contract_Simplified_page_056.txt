What sets up a government isn’t a contract or an agreement between people. Because of this, it can’t be just a law or a decision by a ruler, or else it wouldn’t be fair or real.

After the law-making power is created, the next step is to create the executive power, the people who actually make sure the laws are followed. The law and the people who enforce it are separate things. If the ruler had both powers mixed together, no one would know what the law really is. It would be like one person saying to another, “I’ll give you all my stuff, but I get to take back whatever I want.” That wouldn’t work.

There is only one real contract in a state: the agreement that brings people together to form a society. No other contracts can go against this one. Since all citizens are equal in this agreement, they all have the right to decide what everyone should do, but no one can force others to do something they don’t do themselves. This is the right the government leader gets when setting up the government, and it’s necessary to keep the country working.

So, how do we think about the act of creating a government? It’s a two-part process: (1) making the laws and (2) putting the laws into action.

First, the leader or sovereign decides what kind of government there will be. This is a law.

Then, the people choose the rulers who will run the government. This is not a law but a choice made as part of running the government.

But there’s a problem: how can people set up a government before it even exists? And how can the people, who are either the rulers or the subjects, become one group?
