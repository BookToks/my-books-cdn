In ancient Rome, there were different groups called tribes. Servius started with four urban tribes, which were groups of people living in the city. Later, he added fifteen rural tribes, made up of people living in the countryside, divided into fifteen areas called cantons. Over time, fifteen more tribes were created, so by the end of the Republic, Rome had thirty-five tribes.

These tribes were important because freed slaves always joined the urban tribes, never the rural ones. Even though freed slaves could become citizens, none ever reached a government position during the Republic. This was a good rule, but it was taken too far and eventually caused problems in the political system.

At first, the censors (officials in charge) had the power to decide which tribe a citizen belonged to. After many years, they allowed people to choose their own tribe. This caused trouble because rich and powerful people joined the rural tribes, while freed slaves stayed in the urban tribes. Soon, the tribes lost their connection to specific places, and it became hard to tell members of one tribe from another just by where they lived.

The countryside was seen as the best place to find strong and honorable men to keep Rome safe and running. People respected the hardworking villagers more than the lazy city dwellers. A person working in the fields was a respected citizen, while a poor city worker was looked down on.

Each tribe had smaller groups called curiae, each with its own temples, gods, officers, priests, and festivals. The rural tribes were like schools that raised tough, brave men who defended Rome during war and fed the people during peace. This system helped keep Rome strong and safe.
