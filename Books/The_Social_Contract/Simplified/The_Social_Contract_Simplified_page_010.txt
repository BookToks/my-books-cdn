The only enemies a country can have are other countries, not people. You should only kill an enemy if you can’t make them a slave. But since there can’t be a true, fair relationship between people like that, the right to enslave someone can’t come from the right to kill them. States and people are very different. It’s not fair to make someone give up their freedom just to keep their life, which the winner doesn’t actually own. This idea fits with the rules and habits of all civilized societies.

When countries declare war, they tell other countries, not their own citizens. A foreigner—whether a king, a person, or a whole group—who steals, kills, or holds the people of another country without declaring war first is just a criminal. During a real war, a leader can take anything from the enemy country because it belongs to the public. But a fair leader will respect individual people’s lives and belongings. The enslaved person or conquered people don’t owe anything to their conqueror. By taking a person’s life instead of killing him without reason, the winner hasn’t done a favor; he has just used his power. The goal of war is to destroy the enemy country, so it’s okay to kill its fighters while they fight; but when they stop fighting and surrender, they stop being enemies. Their relationship changes from enemy to just people, and no one has the right to take their life. Sometimes a war can end without killing anyone, and war does not give the right to kill people after the fighting stops.

The rules explained here are not from poets but come from reason and how things really are.

The idea of the “right of slavery” is not just wrong but also makes no sense. Saying someone is a slave and has rights at the same time is a contradiction. It’s crazy to tell a person or a group, “I will make all the rules, keep all the benefits, and you have to accept it for as long as I want.” 

What about the “right of conquest”? That’s just “the law of the strongest.” If war doesn’t give the winner the right to kill everyone they beat, then it can’t give the right to enslave them either. No one has the right to make others slaves.

People can only join the military if they agree to fight specific enemies. Rousseau mentions a story about a soldier who had to renew his military oath. He knows there are exceptions, but he’s talking about general laws and customs. The Romans followed their laws better than anyone else and had better laws too.
