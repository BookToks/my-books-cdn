Sometimes, land that already belongs to other rulers is combined to create public land. When this happens, the power over the land changes from just the owners to the whole community. This means landowners depend more on the ruler, because they have more to lose if things go wrong. This helps make sure they stay loyal. This idea wasn’t really used by old kings who thought of themselves as rulers of people, not just lands. But today’s kings are smarter and call themselves kings of countries like France or England. By owning land this way, they feel sure they control their people.

People can also come together before they even own land. They might find a piece of land big enough for all of them, and then share it equally or by rules set by the ruler. No matter how they get the land, each person’s right to their own part is always less important than the community’s right over everyone’s land. Without this, society would be weak and rulers would have a hard time keeping control.

To finish, here’s an important fact for any society: the social contract doesn’t get rid of natural differences between people. Instead, it replaces physical differences with an equal and fair system where people become equal by law and agreement, even if they’re not equal in strength or smarts. However, bad governments can make this equality only seem real, keeping poor people poor and rich people rich. Laws usually help those who already have things and hurt those who don’t. So, society only works well when everyone has something and no one has too much.
