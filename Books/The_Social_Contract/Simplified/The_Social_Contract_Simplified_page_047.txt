No one type of government is the same everywhere. People in some places eat very little, but that’s actually true for everyone there. For example, the wheat grown in Barbary isn’t as good as the wheat in France, but it produces more flour. In France, some areas grow more wheat than others because their land is more fertile. So, it’s fair to say that wheat production changes across the whole country. This kind of pattern happens in many places, from the equator to the poles. 

When it comes to diet and skin color, it’s clear that if the same amount of food has less nutrition, it’s a big problem. In hot countries, people eat less meat and more rice, maize, couscous, millet, and cassava. In some parts of the Indies, people live on food that costs less than half a penny a day. Even in Europe, people in the south and north eat very differently. For example, a Spaniard could live a whole week on the food a German eats in one day. 

Because hot countries produce more food but their people eat less, there’s extra food left over, which helps rulers keep control. Clothes also show differences between hot and cold places. In places with quick, strong seasons, people wear simple, useful clothes. In hot places, clothes are more about looking fancy than being practical. For example, in Naples, men wear fancy gold-embroidered vests with no pants. Buildings are also different: in warm places, being flashy matters because there’s no need to protect yourself from cold weather.

In cold cities like Paris and London, you want warm, cozy homes. Madrid has fancy salons but no windows that close, and people sleep in very simple rooms. Food in hot places is more filling and tasty, which affects how much people eat and how they live. 

Rousseau also says that the way people live affects how hard it is to rebel against the government. If people live spread out over a big area, it’s harder for them to work together secretly to fight the rulers. Governments can easily find and stop them. But if people live close together, it’s harder for the government to take control because people can meet safely and quickly in groups to plan revolts.

Vegetables are eaten more in Italy because they taste good and are healthy. In France, vegetables don’t grow well and aren’t very nutritious, so people don’t eat much of them. Growing vegetables takes up land and effort, so it’s not easier in the south. 

In short, tyrant rulers do best when people are spread out far apart. They use meeting points to keep control, stopping people from joining forces to fight back.
