People and Population Size

There’s no perfect way to decide the ideal size of a population because it depends on many things. These include how good the land is, what grows there, the climate, and the habits of the people living there. Some people live in rich farmland and don’t need much, while others live on poor land and need more. Lawmakers have to think about how fertile the land is, how many people can grow there, and how much the government can help. They shouldn’t just look at the current population but aim for what the population should be in the future.

Sometimes, it makes sense to get more land. For example, in mountainous areas with lots of woods and pastures, expanding the land is useful because farming space is limited. On the other hand, on the coast, places can shrink because fishing helps make up for less land. Also, it’s easier to reduce extra population by starting colonies.

Who Can Be a Good Group?

A group of people is a good subject for laws if they already share some history or interests, and don’t have strong old customs or superstitions. They shouldn’t be scared of sudden attacks and should be able to protect themselves or get help if needed. Everyone should know each other, and no one should have too much responsibility that’s hard to handle.

Peace and Plenty Are Key

Enjoying peace and enough resources is very important. Threats like war or lack of food are serious problems because if a state is weak during times of trouble, it can easily fall apart. Sometimes governments collapse during chaos, but often it’s because the rulers made bad choices during those times to control people with unfair laws. One way to tell a good lawmaker from a tyrant is to see when they choose to act—whether in calm times or in chaos.

Finally, a people shouldn’t depend on others too much because that can be bad for both sides. Wise nations try to help each other stay independent.
