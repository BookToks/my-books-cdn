The law, the senate, and the consuls never promised to forgive anyone, and this shows us what a law of nature really is. It doesn’t protect any one person. The people sometimes changed their minds, but they didn’t really understand what a law of the state is.

Often, pardons are made for specific reasons. I’ve said before that if pardons happen too much, crime will start to seem worth it, and everyone can see where that leads. But I want to hold back my feelings and keep writing carefully. Let’s leave these tricky questions to a fair person who understands things better than I can explain here. We can assume that the general will of the people is what matters, not just one person getting a pension.

Either a person is part of the people or they aren’t. If they aren’t, then the people’s will doesn’t apply to them. The law doesn’t have to agree with that person’s wishes. But if the person is part of the people, then the people’s decision about giving them a pension is about the whole group and that one person. The group and the person are connected but different. The group without that person isn’t the whole group anymore. This shows that the will of one person isn’t the same as the will of the whole group.

Things are good when they follow the natural order, not just because people agree on them. All justice comes from God, who is the only true source. If we knew exactly how to get justice from God, we wouldn’t need governments or laws! There is a universal justice that comes from reason, but we can only accept it if it’s fair to everyone. Without natural consequences, laws don’t work well among people. Agreements and laws are needed to connect rights with duties and make justice real.

When I say laws are always about general things, I mean they look at groups of people or types of actions, not at one specific person or action. For example, laws can say there will be privileges but can’t say exactly who gets them. Laws can create different classes of citizens and set rules for each class, but they can’t choose who belongs to each class. Laws can set up a monarchy with kingship passed down in families, but they can’t pick the next king themselves.
