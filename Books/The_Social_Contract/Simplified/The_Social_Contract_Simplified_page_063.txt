The comitia in ancient Rome was important because it held the highest power in a well-organized state.

After Rome was founded, the new republic’s army was made up of Albans, Sabines, and foreigners. This army was split into three groups called ‘tribes.’ Each tribe was divided into smaller groups called curiae, and each curia was divided into even smaller groups called decuriae, led by curiones and decuriones.

From each tribe, 100 cavalrymen, called a ‘century,’ were chosen. These divisions started as military groups since they weren’t needed in a small town. But Rome wanted to be great, so it made a political system fit for a big city.

I will now explain how opinions were shared and counted in the people’s assembly. It might help you understand the rules better if I tell you about how public and private affairs worked in a council with 200,000 members.

At first, the Albans and Sabines tribes stayed the same, but the foreigners’ tribe kept growing as more people came to Rome. This caused a problem because the foreigners’ tribe became much stronger. Servius, a king of Rome in the 6th century BCE, fixed this by changing the tribes from being based on race to being based on geography. He made four tribes, each including people from one of Rome’s hills.

To stop people from moving between tribes and mixing races, Servius made a rule that no one could move from one tribe’s area to another. He also doubled the size of the cavalry groups and added twelve more, keeping the old names. This created a clear line between the knights and the rest of the people, and no one complained.

We don’t have many reliable records about Rome’s early years, and many stories might be made up. Still, the customs and traditions that have strong evidence show us how Rome’s system began. These are the rules I have followed to understand how the freest and strongest people of that time lived.
