In ancient times, like in Greece and Rome, people didn’t have representatives like we do today. The Greeks lived in nice weather, weren’t greedy, and never needed representatives—the idea didn’t even exist. They had slaves to do their work, and their main focus was on freedom.

In Rome, where certain leaders called tribunes were very important, no one thought these leaders could take over the people’s power. Even with big crowds, they never tried to make decisions on their own. But in harsher places, like where the weather is bad for half the year or the language is hard to understand, it’s tougher to protect freedom. People there care more about making money than being free, and they fear being poor more than being slaves.

So, is freedom only possible because of slavery? Maybe. Sometimes, to keep freedom, some people have to be slaves. In some places, like Sparta, slaves had to be very controlled so citizens could be free. For modern people, even if they don’t have slaves, they might still be slaves in a way—they pay for others’ freedom with their own loss of freedom. 

I’m not saying slavery is okay or fair. I’m just saying that ancient people didn’t have representatives like we do, and they still managed freedom differently. When people let others represent them, they stop being truly free.

We can’t really have true laws if the people aren’t free to act themselves. The Roman tribunes didn’t have real power to represent the people; they only took power from the senate. In Greece, the people did everything themselves by meeting in public places.

If a country is very small, it can keep freedom, but then it might get taken over by a bigger country. Later, I’ll explain how a big country can stay strong while still having good government in a small state.
