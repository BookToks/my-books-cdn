[Brackets] show extra explanations added by the editor. Small ·dots· mark material that was added but can be read like it was part of the original text. Sometimes •bullets and indenting help to understand the structure of sentences or ideas. Every four-point ellipsis .... means a small part was left out because it was too hard or not important. Longer parts left out are shown in brackets with normal-sized letters.
