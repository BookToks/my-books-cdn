What the pagans were afraid of actually happened. Everything stayed the same, but it was rearranged. The humble Christians changed how they talked, and soon this so-called kingdom of the world, led by a visible leader, became the most violent kind of control in the world.

The Christians became leaders of the Church, not its bosses. They gained power to keep the church strong, not to change it. They became rulers, but not the ones who made the laws.

Because there was always a prince, civil laws, and a church, this double power caused fights over who was really in charge. This made it impossible for Christian countries to be ruled well. People couldn’t figure out if they had to listen to the ruler or the priest. There were always two powers and two rulers, in England, Russia, and other places.

Some people, even in Europe and nearby areas, tried to bring back the old system, but they failed, because Christianity’s influence was too strong every time. The sacred church has always stayed separate from the ruler or became independent from the state.

The philosopher Hobbes was the only Christian thinker who saw this problem clearly and knew how to fix it. He suggested bringing the two rulers together again, creating one united government without splitting power between religion and the state. 

Muhammad had smart ideas and made a good political system that combined religion and government in one. As long as his successors kept this system, the government stayed united.

But when the Arabs became wealthy and educated, they were taken over by less advanced people. Then the split between religious and political powers started again. This division is less obvious among Muslims than Christians but still exists, especially in some groups and countries like Persia.

In Europe, English kings became heads of the Church, and Russian Czars did similar things.

What holds the clergy together as a group is not a formal meeting but their shared beliefs and practices. Communion and excommunication are like a social contract among priests, making them leaders over people and kings. All priests who share communion are part of the same community, even if they come from far apart. This idea is a political masterpiece. Pagan priests never had anything like it, which is why they never formed a united group like the Christian clergy.
