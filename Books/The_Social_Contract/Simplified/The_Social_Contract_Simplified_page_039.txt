Democracy needs a lot of things that are hard to get all at once!

First, it works best in a small country where the people who make laws understand how everyone can meet easily. It should be simple, so there aren’t many arguments about public issues. Everyone should be pretty equal in status and money because without that, rights and power won’t stay equal for long. Also, there shouldn’t be much luxury, since luxury either comes from being rich or makes people want to be rich. Luxury can ruin both rich and poor people—it makes the rich lazy and the poor jealous. It also harms the country by dividing people and making some serve others instead of all working together.

That’s why a famous thinker named Montesquieu said that virtue, or good morals, is what keeps a republic going. Without virtue, none of these conditions can happen. But he didn’t explain everything perfectly. He missed that since the same power is everywhere, the same good qualities should be found in every part of the government, depending on how it’s set up.

True democracy, where many rule over a few, can’t really exist because it goes against how things naturally work. It’s impossible for everyone to always be involved in politics all the time, and if they tried, the system would change too much. No real democracy has ever existed or will exist in the strict sense.

Democratic governments often have the most civil wars and internal problems. They change a lot and need the most attention and courage to keep them going. In a democracy, citizens need to be strong and steady. They should live by the idea that it’s better to have freedom with danger than peace with slavery.

When government work is split among many groups, the smaller groups usually get more power because they can act faster. Only a perfect society of gods could have a perfect democracy.

A perfect government like that isn’t possible for humans.
