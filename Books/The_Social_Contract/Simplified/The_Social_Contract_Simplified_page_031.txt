Different systems of laws exist in the world. Some places are neither rich nor poor but can take care of themselves. People with power don’t have to use violence to keep it, and they should always use their power because of their rank and the law. Good laws mix the strength of old traditions with the willingness of new people to follow rules.

Making laws is hard, not because it’s tough to create new rules, but because you have to get rid of old ones. It’s also hard because it’s almost impossible to find a simple way to keep society working well. For this to happen, the rich shouldn’t have so much money that they can buy others, and the poor shouldn’t be so desperate that they have to sell themselves. The rich shouldn’t be greedy, and ordinary people shouldn’t be stingy either.

This kind of equality is rare, and that’s why few countries have good laws. Some say this equality is just a dream that can’t really happen. But even if people might abuse it, isn’t it still worth trying to make laws that protect it? Since the world often tries to destroy equality, laws should work to keep it alive.

In Europe, Corsica is one place that could have good laws. The people there are brave and determined to keep their freedom. They deserve someone wise to help them keep it safe. I think one day, Corsica will surprise all of Europe. (By the way, Napoleon Bonaparte was born there!)

Good laws should fit each country’s situation and the personality of its people. What’s best for one country might not work for another. For example, if the land is poor or crowded, focus on industry and crafts, and trade what you make for what you need. But if the land is rich, focus on farming and gather people into towns to live.

If you want a strong country, make sure the gap between rich and poor is small. Don’t let some people be super rich and others super poor. These two things always come together: if some people are very rich, others will be very poor, and this is bad for everyone. Rich people can support tyrants, and poor people might become tyrants themselves. Public freedom is often sold between these two groups—one buys, the other sells.

Also, foreign trade might seem good because it makes some people or towns richer, but in the end, the whole country doesn’t really get better, and most people don’t benefit.
