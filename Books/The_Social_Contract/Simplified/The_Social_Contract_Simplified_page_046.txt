No one type of government is always the best or strongest everywhere. Instead of making people stronger or happier, a harsh government often makes them miserable to keep control.

To understand what I mean, think about this example: There are two areas, x and y, each 100 square miles. Area x produces five loads of corn, and area y produces ten. The people in x eat four loads, while people in y eat nine.

Both places have the same extra food left over, but the amount left compared to what they produce is different. In x, the extra is one-fifth of the total food, and in y, it’s one-tenth.

It’s not that x produces twice as much as y. Also, it’s not true that cold countries have land as fertile as hot ones. Imagine England and Sicily produce the same amount, even though Sicily’s land is easier to farm. People in England have to work much harder to get the same food, so their extra food is less.

We should not mix up general rules with specific things that might change them. For example, people eat less in hot countries because they need to stay healthy by eating and drinking less. Europeans who live in hot places like that often get sick because they eat too much like they do at home.

Chardin says that compared to Asians, Europeans eat like carnivores or wolves. Some think Persians are frugal because their country isn’t farmed well, but it might actually be the other way around: their country has less food because the people eat less.

I know some people might disagree based on their own ideas, but we have to look carefully at all the facts. The main point is that harsh governments work better in hot countries, barbaric ones fit cold countries, and fair governments do best in places with mild climates.
