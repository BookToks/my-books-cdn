Sovereignty can’t be divided.  

It can’t be taken away because it doesn’t make sense for a group to give up their power forever. No one has to agree to something that isn’t good for them. If the people just promise to obey without thinking, they stop being a real group. When there’s a boss telling everyone what to do, there’s no longer a true government, and the group stops existing.  

Different people have different interests, and that’s why they need to form a society. But they also have some common interests that bring them together. Without something they all share, no society would be possible. It’s this shared interest that should guide how the society is run.  

Rulers can make rules, but only if the people agree. If the people don’t show any opinion, we should understand that they agree by staying silent. I’ll explain this more later.  

I believe sovereignty is just the power of the whole group’s will, and it can never be given away. The group that holds this power can only represent itself. The power can be passed on, but not the actual will of the people.  

Here’s why sovereignty can’t be divided. The will is either the will of the whole group or only part of it. If it’s the whole group’s will, it becomes a law. If it’s only part of the group, it’s just a personal choice or favoritism.  

A personal choice can’t be guaranteed to last or be fair. The whole group’s will aims for fairness and equality. So, the government can sometimes follow what one person wants at the moment, but it can’t promise to always follow that person’s wishes.  

Rousseau meant that laws made by important officials are different from the real laws made by the whole group, the sovereign.
