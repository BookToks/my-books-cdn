Civic religion was about seeing the gods of one country as the same gods in another country. This idea didn’t exist much until Christianity came along. People thought gods like Moloch, Saturn, and Chronos could actually be the same god! Like the Phoenician Baal, the Greek Zeus, and the Latin Jupiter were all the same god too. It was like thinking that all religions were just different names for the same imaginary beings.

Back then, every religion was tied to the laws of its country. To convert a people to a new religion, they had to be taken over by force. The only missionaries were conquerors. You might wonder, “Why didn’t the pagans have religious wars if each state had its own gods and worship?” The answer is that each country’s gods were connected to its own laws and government. So, fighting political wars was also fighting religious wars.

When the Romans won a place, they called on that place’s gods to accept Roman rule. If the Romans left, the locals still respected their own gods but had to accept Roman laws. Sometimes, the only thing the Romans demanded was a small tribute to their god, Jupiter. The gods of different pagans didn’t get jealous or demand that their followers only worship them. They shared the world’s worship.

Even Moses and the Hebrew people sometimes accepted this idea. They talked about “the God of Israel” but also recognized other gods as powerless. They couldn’t attack the gods of nearby peoples because those gods also had a right to their lands. For example, Jephthah told the Ammonites that their god Chemosh had the same rights as the God of Israel.

When the Jews were ruled by Babylonian and Syrian kings, they still refused to accept any god but their own. This refusal was seen as rebellion against their rulers and caused them to be persecuted. This is why Christians were often seen as rebels too—they seemed to obey the rulers but secretly wanted to be independent and in charge.

All this caused the persecutions we hear about in history.  

It’s clear that the so-called “Sacred War” against the Phocians wasn’t really a religious war. It was about punishing wrong acts, not about defeating people who didn’t believe the same things.
