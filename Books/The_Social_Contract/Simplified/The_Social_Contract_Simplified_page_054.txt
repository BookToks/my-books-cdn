Deputies or representatives aren’t really cared about because people don’t see public service as their main job anymore. Instead, they prefer to help with money rather than their own effort, and this makes the country weak and close to falling apart.

People get so busy with their own lives that they don’t want to fight in wars or join important meetings. If they’re needed to go to war, they just pay soldiers and stay home. If they’re supposed to meet in councils, they pick deputies and still stay home. Because of laziness and money, these soldiers and representatives can end up controlling and even hurting the country.

Trade and business make people care more about money than their own personal efforts. People give up some of their profits so they can have free time to make more money later. They don’t realize how dangerous this is. Giving money can lead to losing freedom and ending up like slaves. “Finance” is like a word for being controlled, and in a truly free place, people do everything themselves without paying others to do it for them. Instead of avoiding their duties, they would even pay to be allowed to do them.

I believe forced work is just as bad as taxes. Deputies can’t truly represent the people because true sovereignty is the general will, and a will can’t be represented by someone else. If someone claims to speak for the people, they're either telling the truth or lying—there’s no middle ground. Deputies are just agents and can’t make decisions on their own. Any law that hasn’t been personally approved by the people isn’t a real law.

In England, people only feel free when they vote for members of parliament. But once those members are elected, the people lose their freedom because they stop paying attention. The way people behave during their short time of freedom shows they don’t deserve it.

The idea of having representatives is a new one. It comes from feudal times, a system that lowers people’s value and dishonors humanity.
