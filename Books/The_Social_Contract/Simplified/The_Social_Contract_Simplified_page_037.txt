The source of government power is always the state, so it never changes. This means that the more power the government uses for its own members, the less it has to use for all the people. So, the more leaders (magistrates) there are, the weaker the government becomes.

This idea is very important, so we should understand it clearly. The power a government uses depends on how strong its will is. Since the total power of the government stays the same, the strongest government is the one ruled by just one person.

Now, imagine doing the opposite. If the leaders’ power becomes the same as the people’s power, the government won’t be any stronger than the people. This means the government will be the weakest it can be.

In perfect lawmaking, personal wishes should be ignored, the leaders’ wishes should come second, and the people’s wishes should be the most important. The people’s will should always guide everything.

Different kinds of wills become stronger when they are more focused. The general will (people’s will) is always the weakest, the leaders’ will is stronger, and personal will is the strongest. Also, the bigger the state, the stronger its real power gets, but not just because it has more people.

When the state stays the same size, it doesn’t help to add more leaders because the government’s power stays the same. Also, the more people in charge of a project, the longer it takes to get things done. This shows that being too careful doesn’t always help.
