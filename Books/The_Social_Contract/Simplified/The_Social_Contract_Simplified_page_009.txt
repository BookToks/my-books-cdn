Slavery is something no one can really understand or accept. It’s completely wrong and makes no sense. The person who tries to own another is crazy. Talking about my rights against slavery doesn’t even work because slavery itself is insane.

Saying an entire group of people could be slaves is like saying they’re all crazy. Some people argue that war can create the right to own slaves, but madness doesn’t give anyone rights.

They say the winner of a war has the right to kill the loser, but the loser can buy their freedom. Even if someone could sell themselves, they can’t sell their children because kids are born free. Their freedom belongs to them, and no one else can give it away. While kids are too young to decide for themselves, their parents can only make choices that help protect them, not give away their freedom forever. A parent can’t make a permanent gift of their children’s freedom because that goes against nature and a parent’s duties.

Before governments existed, people lived freely without rules or social order. Back then, they didn’t have relationships strong enough to create peace or war. War happens between groups or states, not just between individuals. So, in the natural state without society or laws, private wars between people can’t really happen.

Giving up your freedom means giving up being a human and all your rights and responsibilities. There’s no way to make up for losing everything. Taking away freedom is against human nature and removes morality from a person’s actions.

Fights between individuals, like duels, don’t create a real state or society. Some private wars were allowed by rulers like Louis IX of France, but those were abuses of power and went against natural rights and good government.

Finally, agreeing to give someone total control over you and to obey them forever is a useless and contradictory idea. If someone can take everything from you without giving anything back, how can you owe them anything? That fact alone cancels out any so-called agreement. What rights would a slave have against their owner? Everything the slave has belongs to the owner, not as a person but as property.

War is not between individual people but between states. Soldiers fight not as citizens or men, but as defenders of their country.
