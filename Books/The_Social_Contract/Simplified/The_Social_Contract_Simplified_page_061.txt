Voting means that when people decide who rules, sometimes someone will lose. Saying that a son of a slave is also a slave is like saying someone is not really a person. It shows that I was wrong if I thought differently. If some people disagree with the rules when the agreement was made, their disagreement doesn’t cancel the contract. It just means they aren’t included in it. Once a country is set up, living there means you agree to follow its rules.

If most people don’t agree with the general will, no matter what side you take, freedom isn’t really possible anymore.

You might ask, “How can someone be free but still have to follow laws they didn’t agree with?” The question is wrong because a citizen agrees to all laws by being part of the country, even if they don’t like some laws. The general will is what everyone wants together, and by being a citizen, you accept it and are free.

When people vote on a law, they aren’t just saying yes or no to the idea; they are saying if it matches what most people want. Each vote shows a person’s opinion, and the general will is found by counting the votes.

There are two main rules for voting: (1) The more important the question, the closer the vote should be to everyone agreeing. (2) The faster a decision needs to be made, the smaller the majority can be.

This idea only works in a free country. In other types of countries, someone might be forced to stay there and that doesn’t mean they agree with the rules.

At Genoa, the word "Liberty" was written over prisons and on the chains of prisoners. This was true because only criminals stop others from being free. If all criminals were locked away, everyone else would enjoy true freedom.
