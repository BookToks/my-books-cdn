A law is made by a king or a royal family. Basically, it’s any rule that is planned and announced before it happens.

But what if one person makes a rule on their own? Is that a real law? How can people know about it when they need to? How can a crowd, which often doesn’t understand what’s best for them, follow these rules? We can ignore these questions for now.

Who should make laws? Laws come from the general will, meaning the will of the people as a whole. Is the prince or leader above the law? No, because they are part of the state too. Can a law be unfair? No, because a law is meant to be fair to everyone. How can we be free but still follow laws? There’s no problem because laws are just records of what we want.

Laws are made for everyone, not just one person. Anything one person orders alone isn’t a law but a command or an order. Even the leader can’t make laws by themselves. Laws should help people see what’s really good and guide them to make good choices.

We call any state ruled by laws a ‘republic,’ no matter how it’s run. Only when laws rule, the public interest is real. People often want what’s good but don’t always see it clearly. Both individuals and the public need help to understand what’s best. People’s wishes need to match their reason, and the public must learn what it really wants. When this happens, everyone works together to make the whole society strong and powerful. For this, there must be someone or a group to make the laws.

Since people must follow laws, they should be the ones to make them. The rules of society should be set only by those who join together to form it. But how will they do this? By agreeing together? Or by a sudden idea? Does the whole society have a way to express its will, like using a voice or language?

For a government to be real and fair, it must serve the people’s will, not be the same as it. So, even a monarchy can be a republic if it follows the general will. I will explain this more later.
