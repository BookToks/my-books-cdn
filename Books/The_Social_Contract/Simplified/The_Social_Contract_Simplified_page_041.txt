Monarchy

Aristocracy doesn’t require all the good qualities that the government and the people need, but it does need some special ones. For example, the rich should be calm and the poor should be satisfied. I’m not saying we should get rid of the rich and poor because total equality wouldn’t fit here — even Sparta didn’t have that.  

If this kind of government makes people more equal, that’s good because it lets the best people spend all their time running things. Aristotle says the rich should be in charge first. But sometimes, it’s important to show people that being talented matters more than being rich.

In this system, everything works smoothly because all parts move toward the same goal. There’s no fighting or confusion, so even a small effort can cause big results. Archimedes pulling a big boat with a lever is a good example of a smart king managing a big country from his office without showing much effort.

No government works better or is stronger than this one. The leader’s will rules over everyone else’s more easily. But the goal isn’t always to make the people happy, and sometimes this power hurts the country.

Monarchy

So far, we talked about the leader as a group controlled by laws, who runs the country’s power fairly. Now let’s think about when all this power is given to one real person, a king or monarch, who rules by the law.

In some governments, a group acts like one person. But here, one person is the whole group. That means the king’s mind and body are united naturally, and all the qualities that in other governments are brought together by law are already in this one person.

This single power controls both the people’s and the king’s will. People say kings should be loved by their people, and that’s partly true. Love from the people is powerful but can easily change. Kings don’t like just being loved; they want to keep full control, even if they have to be cruel.

Some people say kings should want their people to be strong and happy because that helps the kingdom. But kings know it’s better for them if the people are weak, miserable, and can’t fight back.
