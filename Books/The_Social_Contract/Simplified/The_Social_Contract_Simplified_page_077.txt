People who really love their country feel deeply about what is right and want to make sure the rules are fair. Think about your Christian country going up against Sparta or Rome: the faithful Christians would be defeated before they even realize it, or they’d only be safe because their enemies didn’t think they mattered.

The agreement between rulers and people doesn’t include anything that isn’t good for everyone. People owe their rulers their opinions only when those opinions affect the community. It’s very important that every citizen has a religion that makes them love their duty, but the government only cares about religion when it involves being a good person and doing your part for others.

Besides that, a person can believe whatever they want without the government getting involved. The rulers don’t worry about what happens after this life, as long as people are good citizens now.

Christian soldiers are said to be great fighters, but I disagree. Show me proof! I don’t know of any Christian armies. The Crusaders fought for the Church, not the country. They were soldiers of their spiritual home, which the Church turned into something like a kingdom. So, there can’t be a holy war for Christians because the Bible doesn’t set a national religion.

There is a civil belief system the government should set—not religious rules, but social ideas needed to be a good citizen and loyal subject. People can’t be forced to believe it, but the government can kick out anyone who doesn’t believe it because they don’t fit into society, don’t love the laws, and might even hurt the community. If someone says they believe these ideas but acts like they don’t, they should be punished by death for lying to the law.

Under pagan rulers, Christian soldiers were respected and copied the pagan soldiers. But when the emperors became Christian, this stopped. When Christianity replaced Rome’s old ways, Roman bravery disappeared.

Now let’s forget politics for a moment.
