The reason why governments are different is pretty simple. It’s because people see the government as a separate group inside the state. The government is different from the people and the ruler, and it’s in the middle between them. The government is always ready to protect the people and never to harm them.

The government is like a made-up group that only exists because of the ruler. The state, on the other hand, exists on its own. Even though the government depends on the ruler, it can still act quickly and strongly, like being healthy or sick. The ruler’s power comes from the law or what most people want, not from doing whatever they want alone. If the ruler tries to act without following the law, everything falls apart.

Imagine if the ruler started to follow their own wishes instead of the people’s. Then there would be two rulers—the real one and the one in charge—and the whole system would break down. This shows how important it is that the government’s actions match what the state needs.

For the government to really work and be different from the state, all its members have to feel connected and work together. They need to share a goal to keep the government alive. This means having groups or councils that can make decisions and handle important things, like who gets special titles or honors.

How many people are in these groups depends on how many people are in the state. It’s hard to organize everything so that the government keeps its own rules without changing the state’s rules. The government’s power is meant to protect itself, while the state’s power is meant to protect everyone.
