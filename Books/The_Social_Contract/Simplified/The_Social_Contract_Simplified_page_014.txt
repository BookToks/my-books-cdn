Before, people didn’t have a proper society. Now, the feeling of duty has taken over basic urges, and a sense of what’s right has replaced selfish wants. The person who used to only think about themselves now has to think differently and use reason before following their feelings.

In this “civil” state, they lose some natural advantages, but they gain a lot more. Their abilities grow, their ideas expand, their feelings become nobler, and their whole spirit lifts up. If the problems of this new life didn’t sometimes make people worse off than they were in nature, they would always be grateful for the moment they changed from a simple animal to a thinking human.

To keep the social agreement from being meaningless, it quietly includes the rule that anyone who refuses to follow the general will will be forced to obey it by the whole group. This rule is very important because it means that everyone will be forced to be free. It might sound strange to force someone to be free, but this is what protects each person from being controlled by others. This idea is the key to making politics work and makes civil rules fair instead of abusive.

We have to understand the difference between natural liberty, which means being free to do anything you can, and civil liberty, which means freedom limited by the general will. Also, we should know the difference between possession, which just means holding something by force or first come, first served, and property, which is based on a legal right.

On the positive side, in the civil state, a person gains moral freedom, which is what truly makes them free.
