When people agree to live together under a social contract, they give up some of their natural freedom but gain protection for what they have.

Basically, the social contract means this: everyone agrees to give up their individual rights and power to the whole group. This might sound extreme, but there are three reasons why it works.

First, since everyone gives themselves completely, what happens to one person happens to everyone. So no one wants to make things harder for others because it would hurt themselves too.

Second, because people give up everything without holding anything back, the group is as united as possible, and no one can ask for more.

To understand why this full agreement is necessary, imagine if people kept some rights for themselves. Without a higher authority, everyone would be their own judge, which would lead to chaos or unfair rule. So, the social contract prevents this.

Third, when someone gives themselves to everyone else, they actually give themselves to no one in particular. The rights they lose over themselves are balanced by the rights they gain over others. So, they don’t lose anything but actually gain more power.

The group formed by this agreement is called a “city” or a “republic.” People in it are called “citizens” when they share power and “subjects” when they follow laws. These terms can be confusing, but it’s important to know the difference when they’re used carefully.
