The right of life and death

Sometimes, two people can’t both survive, and one has to die. When we put a guilty person to death, we are doing this. Some people ask: “If a person doesn’t have the right to end their own life, how can they give that right to the government?” This seems confusing because it’s explained the wrong way. Every person has the right to risk their own life to protect it. For example, if someone jumps out of a burning building to save themselves, we don’t call it suicide.

If someone dies in a dangerous situation they knew about, like a storm while sailing, no one says they deserved to die.

The social contract is made to protect everyone involved. If you agree to the goal, you also accept the risks that come with it. Someone who wants to save their life by putting others in danger should be ready to give up their own life when needed. When the government says a person must die for the good of the state, that person should obey because their life isn’t just their own anymore—it’s a gift from the state, given as long as they follow its rules.

When a government has many punishments like death or torture, it usually means it is weak or lazy. Every criminal could be turned into something good. There is no right to kill someone just to make an example if that person could be safely left alive.

The death penalty can also be seen as a way to protect ourselves from murderers. In the social contract, we don’t give up our lives, but we agree to protect them. No one expects to be killed themselves!

A criminal who breaks the law is like a rebel or a traitor because they stop being part of the community and even fight against it. The government has the power to forgive criminals or reduce their punishments, but this power belongs to the highest authority, not the judges. A well-run country has few punishments because there are few criminals. It’s easier to break the law when there are many criminals and the government is weak or failing.
