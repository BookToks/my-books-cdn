Keeping control over a country has its problems. Rousseau talks about “states,” not just cities, and sometimes switches between the two. In ancient Rome, the leaders like consuls were just the heads, the tribunes only spoke for the people, and the senate didn’t have real power.

Small states can’t stand up to big ones alone. They need to team up with others, like how Greek cities fought against the Persian king Xerxes, or how Holland and Switzerland resisted the House of Austria.

If a state can’t be controlled well, there’s one solution: don’t keep the capital in one place. Move the government from town to town, meeting in different provincial areas. Spread people out evenly and give everyone the same rights, so life is good everywhere.

This way, the state becomes strong and well-run. When setting this up, don’t make the government too fancy in each town where it stays. Remember, towns are often built using materials from the countryside’s old buildings. Every new palace in the capital means the countryside suffers.

When the people come together as the true rulers, the government’s power stops. Everyone, from the poorest citizen to the highest official, is equally protected. There are no representatives during these times because all power belongs to the people.
