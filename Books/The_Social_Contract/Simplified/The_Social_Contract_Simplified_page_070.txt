A dictatorship is set up so that breaks or pauses can be shortened when needed. If the problem can be fixed by making the government do more, power is held by just one or two people. In this case, the change isn’t about the laws themselves but about how they are carried out. 

But if the danger is so big that the laws get in the way of saving the state, a leader with full power is chosen to stop or pause the laws for a short time. There’s no doubt about what the people want here: they want the country to survive. So stopping the law-making power doesn’t mean getting rid of it; the leader can control the laws but can’t make new ones.

The laws are too strict and can’t be changed to fit new situations, which can be a big problem during a crisis. Laws need to be followed slowly and carefully, but sometimes things happen too fast. The people who make laws can’t think of everything ahead of time, so it’s important to be able to pause or change how things work when needed.

It’s wrong to make political rules so strict that they can’t be paused. Even Sparta let some laws stop for a while. But only the biggest dangers should be important enough to stop the normal order of things. The power of the laws should never be stopped unless the whole country is in danger.

When it’s clear the country’s safety is at risk, special steps are taken to give power to the person best suited to handle it. This can happen in two ways, depending on the kind of danger.

In ancient Rome, during serious trouble, the Senate first asked the consuls to protect the Republic. Later, one consul could secretly pick a dictator at night to take full control for a short time. Early on, Rome often used dictators because the state wasn’t strong enough yet. People with this power didn’t like it and wanted to give it up quickly because having so much control was hard and risky.

So, dictatorships were only used when absolutely necessary, to keep the country safe.
