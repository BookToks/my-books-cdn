Governments give orders to the people. The bigger the population, the stronger the government's power needs to be to keep things under control.

For a government to work well, there has to be a balance between the rulers and the people. If this balance is messed up, problems like chaos or dictatorship can happen.

There are three parts to this balance: the people who make the rules (the sovereign), the leaders who enforce them (magistrates), and the citizens who follow them. If the rulers try to control too much, or the people don’t obey, the government breaks down.

Also, the bigger the country, the more chances there are for leaders to misuse their power. So, a bigger government needs even stronger control to keep order.

There isn’t just one perfect kind of government for everyone. Different governments work better for different people or at different times because people and situations change.

Let’s think about how many people live in a state. Imagine there are 10,000 citizens. The whole group of people who make the rules is called the sovereign. Each person has a tiny part of that power, like one part in 10,000.

If the population grows to 100,000, each person’s share of power gets smaller, only one part in 100,000. So, as the population grows, people have less freedom.

The bigger the number of individual opinions compared to the general will of the government, the harder it is to keep everything balanced.

This idea isn’t exact like math, but it helps us understand how the size of a population affects the power and freedom in a state.
