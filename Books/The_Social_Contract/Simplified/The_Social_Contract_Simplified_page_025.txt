The law-maker

Rousseau explains that making laws isn’t really three separate jobs, but three ways to look at one big task. To find the best rules for society, you’d need a super smart mind that understands all people’s feelings without having those feelings itself. This mind would have to do some tough things: it would take away people’s natural ways and replace them with new ones that feel strange and that they can’t use without help from others. The more you destroy natural ways, the stronger and longer-lasting the new rules become.

If that sounds too crazy, think about this: each person can’t do anything alone. We all depend on each other, and the things we get from working together are bigger than what we can do on our own. Because of that, laws made together by everyone are better than just natural instincts. A god-like mind would be needed to make perfect laws! But if a great king is rare, then a great law-maker must be even rarer.

The law-maker is a special person in the state. If a prince is a leader because of who he is, the law-maker is a creator because of what he can do. He’s like an inventor who designs a machine, while the prince is just the mechanic who runs it. This job of creating laws is unique and powerful. If someone who rules people also controls the laws, the laws will only serve their own selfish desires. That would ruin the fairness of the laws.

To make good laws, a person must be able to change human nature a bit. They have to turn each person—who is normally alone and independent—into part of a bigger group, where they get their life and identity. They must change people’s nature to make it stronger and replace our natural independence with a shared moral way of living.

When Lycurgus made laws for Sparta, he gave up his power as king first. It was common in Greek cities to have outsiders make laws. Many Italian republics did the same, and Geneva followed their example and benefited from it. Rome was strongest when it had good laws.

A nation only becomes famous when its laws start to fall apart. We don’t know how long Lycurgus’s system made the Spartans happy before others noticed it.

People who only know Calvin as a religious thinker don’t realize how smart he was. He helped make important rules that still honor him today. No matter what changes religion goes through, as long as love for the country and freedom lasts, people will always respect him.
