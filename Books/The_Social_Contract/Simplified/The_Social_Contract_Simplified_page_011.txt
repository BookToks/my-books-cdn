The social contract

People have reached a point where living by themselves in nature is too hard. If things stayed the same, humans wouldn’t survive. So, they have to change how they live.

People can’t create new powers; they can only use the powers they already have and guide them. To survive, they need to join their powers together and work as one strong group to face challenges.

For this to work, many people must cooperate. But everyone wants to keep their own freedom and strength. So, how can they work together without hurting their own interests? This is the big problem the social contract solves.

Grotius says a group of people can give their power to a king. But first, that group has to really be a group. This means they must agree to come together as one before choosing a leader. This first step is the real start of society.

Without this agreement, why would a smaller group have to follow the bigger group? If 100 people want a leader but 10 don’t, what gives the 100 the right to decide? The rule that most people decide only works if everyone has agreed to it at some point.

These agreements are called the social contract. Even if they aren’t written down, they are understood and accepted everywhere—until someone breaks the contract and everyone goes back to their original, separate state.
