Sovereignty can't be split up. Its source can’t be divided based on what it does. If we try to divide it by its different parts, we make a mistake. Sometimes people think sovereignty is made up of things like force and will, or legislative power and executive power, or rights like taxation, justice, and war, or even internal and foreign affairs. But really, all these are just parts that follow from the main power. They are just the actions of the highest authority.

Sometimes people mix these parts together and sometimes they separate them. This confusion makes it unclear what the real rights of kings and people are. It’s like imagining a person made of different bodies—one with eyes, one with arms, one with legs—but none of them whole. There’s a trick in Japan where they seem to cut a child into pieces, then throw the pieces in the air, and the child ends up whole again. Political thinkers do something like that: they break up the state into parts, then try to put it back together in a confusing way.

This mistake happens because people don’t think clearly about what sovereignty really is. They see different parts as separate powers, but actually, those parts are just different ways the sovereign authority works. Rousseau seems to think these are just different actions done under the sovereign’s power. The problem is not mixing up parts of sovereignty with actions done by lower government officials.

For example, declaring war or making peace are actions under sovereignty, but they are not laws themselves. They follow the law and apply it to specific cases. They involve decisions about how the law is used, not about creating new laws. This is clearer when we understand what a law really means.
