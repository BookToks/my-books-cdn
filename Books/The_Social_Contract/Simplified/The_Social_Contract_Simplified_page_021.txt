The limits of the ruler’s power come from the rules he sets for everyone else. This ruler can do what he wants with any things and freedoms that the common agreements allow. But it’s never fair for the ruler to treat one person worse than another because that would be unfair and not part of what the ruler should do.

When we understand this, it’s clear that the social contract doesn’t make people give up their freedom. It’s actually better than the life they had before. Instead of losing something, they have made a good deal, trading a risky and uncertain life for one that is safer and more secure.

The ruler only represents the whole group of people and doesn’t treat individuals differently. So, what is an act of ruling? It’s the strength of the group, which no one can easily beat, and this strength is fair because everyone agrees to it. Even their lives, which they have given to the state, are protected by this agreement. When they risk their lives to defend the state, they are just giving back what they got from it. They would have to risk their lives anyway if they were alone.

Everyone has to fight when the country needs them, but no one fights just for themselves. Sometimes we have to take risks to keep our safety. The other choice is to lose safety and face bigger dangers alone. So, haven’t we gained from this deal?

This means the ruler’s power, even if it’s very strong and respected, can’t go beyond the rules everyone agreed on. And every person can only make promises that follow these rules.
