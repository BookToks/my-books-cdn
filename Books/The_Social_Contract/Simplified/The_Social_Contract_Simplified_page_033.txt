Classifying laws and punishment creates a need for criminal laws. These laws are not really a kind of law by themselves but are the punishment behind all other laws. The rules come first, and customs only become important later, but they eventually act like the keystone holding everything together.

There are three kinds of law, but there is a fourth, most important one. This law is not written on stone or metal but is written in the hearts of the people. It is the real foundation of the state and grows stronger every day. It replaces old laws when they die out and keeps the people connected to the spirit of their country. Over time, it changes the way people accept authority by the power of habit.

The stones of the arch are held in place by supports until the last stone, the keystone, is put in. Then, the whole arch stands by itself. This keystone is like customs and public opinion. Political thinkers often ignore this part, but everything really depends on it. It is the part that the great lawmaker relies on the most.

Of all these kinds of laws, the only ones important here are the political laws, which decide how the government is set up.
