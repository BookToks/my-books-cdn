Slavery is a basic fact. But will no one explain what this really means? Force is just physical power; I don’t see how it has anything to do with what’s right or wrong. Since no person naturally has power over another, no one really has the right to control someone else.

Giving in to force is something you have to do, not something you choose. If you say that force doesn’t create any rights, then all authority must come from agreements between people.

Grotius says: If a person can give up their freedom and become a slave, why couldn’t a whole group of people do the same and make themselves slaves to a king?

If force creates rights, then when one force beats another, the rights would change too. So, when the strongest wins, they are always “right.” The only thing that matters is becoming the strongest. But what kind of right disappears when force stops working?

Force makes us obey, but that doesn’t mean we have to obey. If force doesn’t control us, then we are not really obligated to obey. So, in this case, saying something is “right” just means force is involved, but it doesn’t add any real meaning.

Some say, “The ruler keeps peace in the country.” That might be true, but what good is peace if the ruler’s wars, greed, and officials cause more problems for the people than if there were no ruler at all?

If the ruler’s peace feels like being trapped in a prison, is that really a good life? The Greeks trapped in the cave of the Cyclops lived peacefully too—but they were waiting to be eaten.

So, let’s agree that force does not create real rights, and we only have to obey powers that are truly legitimate. Saying someone freely gives themselves to another is just nonsense.
