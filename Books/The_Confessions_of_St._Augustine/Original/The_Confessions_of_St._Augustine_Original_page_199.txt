cast down because it relapses and becomes an abyss, or rather it feels that it still is an abyss. My faith speaks to my soul—the faith that thou dost kindle to light my path in the night: “Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted in me? Hope in God.”554 For his word is a lamp to your feet.555 Hope and persevere until the night passes—that mother of the wicked; until the Lord’s wrath subsides-that wrath whose children once we were, of whom we were beforehand in darkness, whose residue we still bear about us in our bodies, dead because of sin.556 Hope and endure until the day breaks and the shadows flee away.557 Hope in the Lord: in the morning I shall stand in his presence and keep watch558; I shall forever give praise to him. In the morning I shall stand and shall see my God, who is the health of my countenance,559 who also will quicken our mortal bodies by the Spirit that dwells in us,560 because in mercy he was moving over our lightless and restless inner deep.
 
 From this we have received an earnest, even now in this pilgrimage, that we are now in the light, since already we are saved by hope and are children of the light and children of the day—not children of the night, nor of the darkness,561 which we have been hitherto. Between those children of the night and ourselves, in this still uncertain state of human knowledge, only thou canst rightly distinguish—thou who dost test the heart and who dost call the light day, and the darkness night.562 For who can see us clearly but thee? What do we have that we have not received from thee, who madest from the same lump some vessels to noble, and others to ignoble, use563?
 
 CHAPTER XV 16. Now who but thee, our God, didst make for us that firmament of the authority of thy divine Scripture to be over us? For “the heaven shall be folded up like a scroll”564; but now it is stretched over us like a skin. Thy divine Scripture is of more sublime authority now that those mortal men through whom thou didst dispense it to us have departed this life. And thou knowest, O Lord, thou knowest how thou didst clothe men with skins when they became mortal because of sin.565 In something of the same way, thou hast stretched out the firmament of thy Book as a skin—that is to say, thou hast spread thy harmonious words over us through the ministry of mortal men. For by their very death that solid firmament of authority in thy sayings, spoken forth by them, stretches high over all that now drift under it; whereas while they lived on earth their authority was not so widely extended. Then thou hadst not yet spread out the heaven like a skin; thou hadst not yet spread abroad everywhere the fame of their death.
