But when will this happen? Won’t it be ‘when we all rise again,’ and won’t everything be changed?” I was thinking about this, and even if I didn’t say it exactly like that, Lord, you know that on that day we talked about these things. The world and its joys felt unimportant to us as we spoke.

Then my mother said, “Son, I don’t enjoy anything in this life anymore. Now that my hopes are fulfilled, I don’t know what else I want or why I’m still here. There was one reason I wanted to stay longer — to see you become a Catholic Christian before I died. God has given me more than I hoped for, because I see you now serving Him and ignoring all worldly happiness. What else do I need to do here?”

I don’t clearly remember what I said to her. But about five days later, she got very sick with a fever. One day she fainted and was unconscious for a little while. When she woke up, she looked at me and my brother and asked, “Where was I?” Then she looked carefully at us and said, “This is where you will bury your mother.” I stayed quiet and held back my tears, but my brother said something about hoping she would die in her own country, not far away.

When she heard that, she looked at him with a serious face, because he was thinking about earthly things. Then she looked at me and said, “Look how he talks.” Soon after, she told us, “Put my body anywhere. Don’t worry about it at all. Just remember me at the Lord’s altar, wherever you are.” After saying this as best as she could, she became quiet and suffered more from her sickness.

As I thought about your gifts, God, that you put in the hearts of your followers and that bring wonderful results, I felt happy and thanked you. I remembered how much my mother cared about where she would be buried. She had chosen a place next to her husband, because they had lived happily together. She wanted to be buried in the same grave as him after her journey across the sea. This shows how little people can understand divine things.

I don’t know when this wish left her heart, but I was glad to see she no longer cared about it. When she said by the window, “What is left for me here?” she didn’t seem to want to die in her own country. Later, I heard that while we were in Ostia, she talked to some friends about how she didn’t care about this life and welcomed death. When they were surprised by her courage and asked if she wasn’t afraid to be buried so far from home, she answered, “Nothing is far from God. I am not afraid that at the end of time, He won’t know where to find me to raise me up.”

And so, on the ninth day of her sickness, when she was fifty-six years old and had been a Christian for thirty-three years, she passed away.
