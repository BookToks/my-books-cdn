Oh, heart? You, who are all-powerful and good, care about each of us like we’re the only one, and you care for everyone as if we were all just one person!

When she told me about her vision, I tried to understand it by thinking, “Maybe she hoped she could be like me someday.” But she quickly said, “No, it wasn’t said ‘where he is, there you shall be,’ but ‘where you are, there he will be.’” I remember this, Lord, as best as I can, and I’ve said it many times before. Her answer, given through my careful mother, showed she understood something important that I hadn’t seen until she spoke. This answer touched me more than the dream itself. Still, that dream predicted the happiness that would come to that devoted woman long after, to comfort her during her hard times.

Almost nine years went by while I struggled in a deep, dark pit full of lies. I tried many times to get out, but I kept falling back down even harder. During all that time, the pure, faithful, and serious widow you love stayed hopeful, even though she kept crying and mourning. She never stopped praying to you for me, every time she begged you. Her prayers reached you, but you still let me stay lost in that darkness.

CHAPTER XII Meanwhile, you gave her another answer, as I remember—though I skip many things because I want to focus on the most important parts—and I have forgotten some, too. You sent a priest, a bishop raised in your Church and well-read in your books, to help her. She asked him to talk with me, to correct my mistakes, to help me stop doing wrong and learn what’s right. The bishop usually did this when people were ready to listen, but he wisely refused this time. He said I was not ready to learn because I was proud of my new wrong ideas and had already confused many inexperienced people with difficult questions, as she told him. “Just leave him for now,” he said, “and pray to God for him. He will figure out on his own, by reading, how wrong and bad this belief really is.” He also told her how, as a boy, he had been tricked by his misguided mother into following the Manicheans. He had read and even copied almost all their books, but later he realized on his own how much that group should be avoided—and he left them. When he said this, she wasn’t happy and begged him even more, crying a lot, asking again for him to meet and talk with me. Finally, the bishop, a little annoyed by her persistence, said, “Go away; as you live, your son won’t be lost.” She often told me later that she took this answer like it came straight from heaven.
