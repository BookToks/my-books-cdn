Let’s share our food with hungry people, invite those without homes into our houses, give clothes to those who have none, and never look down on our own family.

Look at the good things that grow from the earth. Let our actions, even the small ones, shine brightly, and let us find joy in thinking deeply and holding on to the Word of Life. Eventually, let us be like “lights in the world,” shining by following the teachings of Scripture.

Scripture helps us understand the difference between things we can think about and things we can touch, like the difference between day and night. It helps us see who focuses on spiritual things and who cares only about physical things. Now, you are not alone in understanding God’s plans like before the world was made and before light and dark were separated.

God’s followers, placed in this world by His grace, can shine light and tell the difference between good and bad times. Old things have passed away, and everything is new. Our salvation is closer than when we first believed. The night is almost over, and the day is coming soon. God blesses the year by sending workers to gather the harvest, continuing the work of others and planting new seeds that will grow until the end of time.

God answers the prayers of those who seek Him and blesses the years of good people. He never changes and, in His perfect timing, prepares a storehouse of blessings for our short lives. He spreads heavenly blessings on earth in the right seasons.

Different gifts come from God’s Spirit. One person gets the gift of wisdom, like a bright light guiding the day. Another gets knowledge, like a smaller light. Others receive faith, healing, the power to do miracles, prophecy, the ability to understand spirits, or the gift of speaking in different languages. All these gifts are like stars in the sky.

The same Spirit gives each person a special gift as He wants, making these “stars” shine brightly to help others. The gift of knowledge includes all the secrets that change like the moon. All these gifts are many, like the stars, but none shine as brightly as Wisdom, which brings joy during the day and rules the night.
