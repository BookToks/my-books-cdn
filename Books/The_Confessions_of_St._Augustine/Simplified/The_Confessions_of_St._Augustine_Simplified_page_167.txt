The sun moves all the way around from east back to east, and because of this, we say, “So many days have passed.” When we say “days,” we include the nights too, but we don’t count the length of the nights separately. Since the day ends when the sun moves from east to east, I wonder if the motion itself is the day, or if the day is the time it takes for that motion to finish, or maybe both?

If the sun’s movement is the day, then a day could be as short as an hour if the sun moved that fast. If the motion itself is the day, then it wouldn’t be a day if the time from one sunrise to the next was only an hour. But if that were true, the sun would need to go around twenty-four times to make one full day. If it’s both, then it wouldn’t be a day if the sun moved its whole path in just an hour, and it wouldn’t be a day either if the sun stood still but time kept passing as usual.

So, I won’t ask what exactly a day is anymore. Instead, I’ll ask what time is because we use time to measure how long the sun takes to move. We could say that if the sun finished its path in half the usual time, that would be a shorter period, or if it took twice as long, that would be a longer period.

No one should tell me that the movement of stars and planets is what makes time. For example, when the sun stood still during a battle so one side could win, the sun didn’t move, but time still passed. The battle happened and ended in that time. So, I see that time is like a kind of space or stretch. But I’m not sure if I really understand it or just think I do. Light and Truth, help me understand.

Do you want me to agree if someone says time is “the motion of a body”? You don’t want me to agree. I understand that no body moves except in time, but you don’t say the motion itself is time. When a body moves, I use time to measure how long it moves, from when it starts moving until it stops. If I don’t see when it starts or stops, I can only measure the time I watch it moving.

If I watch it for a long time, I can say the time is long but not exactly how long. When we ask “How long?” we usually compare things, like saying “This is as long as that,” or “This is twice as long.” If we can see where the body started and where it moved to, or see parts moving like a wheel, we can say how long the movement took.

Since the motion and the way we measure how long it takes are different, it’s hard to say which one is time. A body can move or stand still, and we measure both the moving and the resting by time! We say things like “It stood still as long as it moved,” or “It stood still two or three times longer than it moved,” or other comparisons based on how we measure.

So, time is not just the motion of a body.
