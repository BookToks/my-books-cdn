I couldn’t keep looking at it. My weakness came back, and I went back to my usual habits, holding only a loving memory of what I saw and a hunger for what I had only smelled but never tasted.

So, I looked for a way to get the strength to enjoy it fully. I didn’t find it until I accepted the “Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus,” “who is over all, God blessed forever,” who came and said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life,” and who shared with us the heavenly food I couldn’t yet receive. Because “the Word became flesh” so that your wisdom, which made everything, could become like milk for us when we were babies. At that time, I wasn’t humble enough to accept the humble Jesus, and I didn’t understand why his weakness was important. Your Word, the eternal Truth, is way above everything you created, and it lifts people up to you. But in this lower world, he made himself humble like us so he could bring down proud people and win them over. He lowers their pride and raises their love so they stop trusting themselves and instead become weak, seeing God made weak by living as us, so they can lean on him and be lifted up when he rises.

But I thought differently. I saw Jesus as just a very wise man, better than anyone else—especially because he was miraculously born from a virgin—sent to show us how to ignore worldly things to live forever, and to show he cared for us.

Because of this, I believed he earned his great authority as a leader. But I couldn’t understand the mystery of “the Word became flesh.” From what I learned in the books about him—that he ate, drank, slept, walked, felt happy or sad, and talked with others—I saw that his flesh was joined not just with God’s Word but also with a human soul and body. Anyone who knows God’s unchanging Word understands this, and I had no doubts. Sometimes Jesus moved by will, sometimes not; sometimes he felt emotions, sometimes not; sometimes he spoke clearly, sometimes not—these are all signs of a soul and mind that can change. If these things about him were false, then everything else in those books would be false too, and there would be no hope for us.

So, because the books are true, I believed Jesus was a perfect man—not just a body, or a body with only an animal soul, but a real man with a rational soul too. I thought he was better than all others, not only because he was a form of the Truth but also because of his greatness.
