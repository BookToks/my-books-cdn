Your mind experiences a flood of impressions all the time. As I said, I measure time by the impressions things leave on you as they happen and what stays with you after they are gone—I don’t measure the things themselves, only the impressions they make. This is how I measure periods of time. So, either these impressions are the periods of time, or else I don’t measure time at all.

What do we do when we measure silence and say it lasts as long as a sound? Don’t we imagine the sound still happening in our minds so we can compare how long the silence lasts? Even when no one is talking, we think about poems, stories, or movements in our heads and figure out how long they would take, just like if we were saying or doing them out loud. If someone plans to hold a sound for a certain time, they have already gone through that time in their mind before speaking. Then, their voice lasts until they stop. The sound really happens and keeps going until it ends. What’s already finished has already happened, and what’s left will still happen. Time moves on as the future becomes the past, with the past growing as the future shrinks until all the future is gone and only the past remains.

But how can the future get smaller when it doesn’t exist yet? Or how can the past grow if it no longer exists? Maybe it’s because our mind has three jobs: expecting, paying attention, and remembering. What we expect turns into what we remember through what we focus on. No one denies that future things don’t exist yet, but we still expect them in our minds. No one denies that past things no longer exist, but we still remember them. No one denies that the present moment is very short since it passes so fast. Yet, because our attention continues, what is present can turn into what is gone. So, the future isn’t really long—it’s just a long time expecting something. The past isn’t really long—it’s just a long memory.

I’m about to recite a psalm I know. Before I start, my attention covers the whole thing, but as I say it, the part I already spoke stays in my memory. The time I spend speaking is split between my memory of what I said and my expectation of what I will say next. My attention stays with me, helping the future turn into the past. The more I do this, the bigger my memory gets and the shorter my expectation becomes, until I finish the whole thing. Then the whole action ends and is stored in memory. This happens with the entire psalm, with each part of it, and even with every syllable. The same thing happens with longer actions, like a whole life, where each action is a part. And the same goes for the whole history of humans, where every life is a part.
