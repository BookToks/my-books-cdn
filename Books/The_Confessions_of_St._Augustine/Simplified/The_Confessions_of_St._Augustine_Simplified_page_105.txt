The way to get there isn’t by ships, chariots, or walking—actually, it wasn’t far from the house to where we were sitting. To follow that road and reach the goal, all you need is the will to go. But it has to be a strong, steady will—not one that keeps changing or fighting with itself.

At one point, I was so unsure that I moved my body a lot, like people do when they want to act but can’t—maybe because their body is weak or stuck. So, if I pulled my hair, hit my forehead, or held my knee tightly, I did it because I wanted to. But I might have wanted to and still not done it if my body didn’t listen. I did many things where wanting and doing didn’t match. Still, I didn’t do the one thing I really wished for, which I would soon want with a single, clear will. When that happens, willing and doing become the same. Right now, my body followed my small wishes better than my mind could make a strong decision.

How can this be so strange? Why does it happen? Please help me understand as I try to find answers in the confusing struggles of people. Why is it that the mind tells the body what to do, and the body listens, but the mind telling itself doesn’t always work? The mind tells the hand to move, and it moves right away. But the mind telling itself to will something doesn’t always obey. Why is that?

I say again: The will tells itself to will, but even though it wants to, it doesn’t fully obey. The will doesn’t want completely, so it doesn’t fully command. It commands as much as it wants, and only those things happen. The will tells itself to act—but not fully. If the will was whole and complete, it wouldn’t even need to command because it would already be acting. So, it’s not strange to want something and also not want it. This is a weakness of the mind, which can’t fully rise because habits hold it down, even if it knows the truth. That’s why there are two wills—one isn’t complete, and what one has, the other lacks.

Let those who say there are two kinds of minds in us—one good and one bad—be gone, God. They are wrong and misleading. They will only be good when they accept the truth, so your apostle can tell them: “You used to be in darkness, but now you are in the light in the Lord.”
