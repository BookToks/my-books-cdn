As I listened to your songs, I had been wanting you for so long. Now finally, I could breathe as much as this small, simple house lets me.  

You, Lord, who make people come together to live in one home, also brought Evodius to join us. He was a young man from our city. While working as a secret agent, he believed in you and was baptized with us. He left his old job and got ready to serve you. We stayed together, determined to live with a strong purpose to serve you.  

We looked for a place where we could help you best and planned to go back to Africa together. But when we reached Ostia by the Tiber River, my mother died.  

I'm skipping many things because I must hurry. God, please accept my prayers and thanks for all the things I don’t mention.  

But I won’t forget what I remember about your servant who gave me life—my mother. She gave me life both in her body, so I could be born into this world, and in her heart, so I could be born to eternal life. I won’t talk about her talents, but about your gift in her. She didn’t make herself or teach herself. You created her, and her parents didn’t know what kind of person would come from them. It was the teaching of your Christ, your only Son, that trained her to respect you, in the home of a faithful Christian.  

My mother said her good training was more because of an old maidservant than her own mother. This maid had cared for her father when he was a child, carrying him on her back like big girls do with babies. Because she had served so long and was very old and good, the leaders of that Christian home respected her a lot. She was put in charge of the daughters and did her job carefully. She was strict but wise, teaching them seriously.  

Except at mealtimes at their parents’ table—where they ate very simply—she didn’t even allow them to drink water, no matter how thirsty they were. She wanted to stop a bad habit and wisely said, “You drink water now because you don’t have control over wine yet. But when you marry and are in charge of the pantry and cellar, you might not want water anymore, but the habit of drinking will be stuck.”  

By this teaching and her authority, she stopped the girls’ young desires and controlled even their thirst so well that they no longer wanted what they shouldn’t have.  

Yet, as this servant told me, her own son, she developed a liking for wine. Normally, when her parents sent her as a sober young girl to get wine from the barrel, she would hold a cup under the tap and wet her lips with a little wine before pouring it into a bottle. She didn’t do this because she craved wine, but because young people are playful and full of energy, which older people usually calm down.  

But adding a little more each day—because “those who ignore small things will fall little by little”—she got into the habit of eagerly drinking nearly a full cup of wine.
