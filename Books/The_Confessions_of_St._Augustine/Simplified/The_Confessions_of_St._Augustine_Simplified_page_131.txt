They suddenly appear like they want to say, “Isn’t it us, maybe?” I push these away with my heart, from my memory, until finally what I really want shows up from its hidden place. Some things come to me easily and in order, just when I need them—the first things step aside for the next, but they stay saved to come back when I want them again. All this happens when I remember something.

All these things, each one coming to mind in its own way, are kept separately in different groups based on how I understand them. For example, light, colors, and shapes come through my eyes; sounds come through my ears; smells come through my nose; tastes come through my mouth; and feelings like hard or soft, hot or cold, rough or smooth, heavy or light come through my whole body. My memory is like a huge cave with many secret parts where all these things are stored, ready to be brought back when needed. Each experience comes in through its own door and is saved in memory. But it’s not the real things that go in—only pictures of those things that my mind can remember. And no one really knows how these pictures are made, even though it’s clear which sense brought them in.

Even when I’m in the dark and it’s quiet, I can still see colors in my mind if I want, and tell black from white and other shades. Sounds don’t jump in and mess up the colors I’m thinking about, because the sounds are stored separately. I can call up those sounds anytime I want, and they appear right away in my memory. And even if my mouth is quiet, I can still “sing” in my mind; the colors I’m thinking about don’t get in the way when I’m remembering sounds. The same goes for all the other senses—I can remember smells like lilies or violets even when I’m not smelling anything, and I can think about liking honey more than mead, or smooth things over rough things, even when I’m not tasting or touching them—only remembering them.

I do all this inside myself, in that huge space of my memory. In there, everything—heaven, earth, and sea—is with me, and I can think about all of it, except what I’ve forgotten. I also meet myself there and remember what I did, when, where, and how I felt doing it. All the things I remember, whether I experienced them or someone told me about them, are there. From these past memories, I can now build pictures of things I’ve experienced or believe because of experience—and from those, I can imagine future actions, events, and hopes. I can think about all these things like they are happening right now. I say to myself, “I will do this or that,” with all these images in my mind, “and this or that will happen.” Or I think, “I hope this or that happens!” or “Please don’t let that happen.” I talk to myself like this, and when I do, the pictures I talk about are right there in my memory; without those pictures, I couldn’t say anything about them.

Memory is a huge power, really amazing, oh my God—a big and...
