God wants to see that what He has made is good so He can be truly loved through the Holy Spirit He gave us. The Holy Spirit is what helps us feel God's love in our hearts. Because of Him, we see good in everything around us, since God is perfect and doesn’t change.

Thank you, Lord! We see the sky and the earth, both the physical parts and the spiritual parts. We see light separated from darkness to decorate these parts, forming the whole world and everything in it.

We see the sky, which can mean the space between the higher spiritual waters and the lower physical waters, or the air where birds fly. Above them are clouds that drop dew on clear nights, and below are waters flowing on the earth. We see the seas full of water, the dry land that was first empty but then shaped and ordered, with soil for plants and trees.

We see the sun shining during the day, and the moon and stars lighting up the night. These mark time with day and night. Around us are water creatures like fish, land animals, and birds. The air birds fly in is thickened by water evaporating from the seas. We see the earth full of animals, and humans made in God’s image, meaning we have reason and understanding. This lets us rule over animals. Just like one part of the soul controls by thinking and another part obeys, the woman was made for the man. Though she also has reason, her body is made to be subject to her husband, like how desire follows the mind’s rules for right actions. We see all this, and it is good; everything together is very good!

Let your works praise you so we can love you, and let us love you so your works can praise you. Your works have beginnings and ends, like morning and evening, growth and decay, shape and loss. They happen in time. You made them from nothing, not from yourself or any old matter. You created matter and shaped it at the same time, without any delay.
