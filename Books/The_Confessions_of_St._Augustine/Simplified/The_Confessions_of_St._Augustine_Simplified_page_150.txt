We are supposed to truly respect and fear you. That’s why “you oppose proud people but give kindness to those who are humble.” You strike down the plans of those who are full of themselves, and even the strongest things seem to shake because of you.

But in real life, some jobs or roles need people to be both loved and feared by others. This is when the enemy of our true happiness tries to trick us. He spreads traps everywhere saying, “Good job, good job,” so we get caught without realizing it. We might start to enjoy being loved and feared, but not because of you—instead, we care about what people think. The enemy wants people to be like him, so he can control them—not through love, but through punishment. He wanted to be powerful in a dark, cold place, making people serve him in twisted ways, pretending to be like you.

But look, Lord, we are your small group. Take care of us, cover us with your protection, and let us hide safely under your wings. Be our honor; let us be loved because of you, and let your word be what we respect. People who want praise from those you judge won’t get help from anyone when you decide. And when someone is praised not for being good but just for their own selfish reasons, that person is actually being judged by you even while others praise them. The one who gives the praise is better than the person being praised because the praiser values God’s gift, while the other just likes the attention.

CHAPTER 37  
We face these tests every day, Lord; they never stop.

Our daily challenge is how we use our words. You tell us to control ourselves. Please help me with this because I don’t know how free I am from this problem. I’m very worried about my hidden faults that you see but I don’t.

When it comes to desires like fleshly pleasures or useless curiosity, I can tell how much control I have when I choose not to give in or when those things just aren’t around. Then I can see if I’m more or less frustrated without them.

The same goes for money, which people want because it can satisfy one or more of these desires. The mind can tell if, when it has money, it doesn’t depend on it and can let it go to prove itself.

But if we want to see if we can live without praise, do we have to live badly or so terribly that everyone hates us? What craziness is greater than that? Yet praise, by its nature, usually comes with living a good life and doing good things.
