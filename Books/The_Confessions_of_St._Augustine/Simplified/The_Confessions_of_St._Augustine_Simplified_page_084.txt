I didn’t completely lose my belief in the right teachings, and every day I learned more and more about them.

By this time, I had also stopped believing in the fake predictions and silly ideas of astrologers. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, God. Because only you can bring us back from all the wrong ideas, with your endless life and wisdom that guides everything, even the smallest leaves on trees.

You helped me deal with my stubbornness when I argued with two friends: Vindicianus, an old smart man, and Nebridius, a very talented young man. Vindicianus was sure, and Nebridius often said—though he wasn’t completely sure—that no skill can really predict the future. People sometimes guess right by chance, but it’s just luck when their predictions come true.

You also gave me a friend named Firminus, who wasn’t serious about astrology but was curious. He wasn’t an expert, but he knew a bit because of what his dad told him. Firminus had a good education and was a skilled speaker. One day, he asked me what I thought about some things he hoped for in life, based on his so-called horoscope.

Even though I was starting to agree more with Nebridius, I didn’t completely refuse to talk about it. I told Firminus that I was almost convinced astrology was silly. Firminus said his dad was really interested in astrology and had a friend who was too. Together, they loved studying it so much that they even watched when their animals had babies, checking the stars to find proof for astrology.

Firminus also told me a story: when his mom was about to have him, a female slave of a friend of his dad’s was pregnant too.

Her master was very careful and kept exact records of birth dates, even for his dogs. It turned out both women gave birth at the exact same time. So, both babies’ horoscopes were made down to the minute. When labor started, they told each other what was happening and sent messengers to confirm the exact birth times.

The messengers met halfway and found no difference in the stars or details. But Firminus, born in a rich family, lived a good life, got richer, and earned honors.
