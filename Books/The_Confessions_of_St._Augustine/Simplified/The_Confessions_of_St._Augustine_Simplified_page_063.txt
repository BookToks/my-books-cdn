I believed that God never made anything evil, so I thought there were two forces: one good and big, and one evil but smaller. From this wrong idea, other wrong ideas followed.

When I tried to go back to the Catholic faith, I felt sad because it wasn’t what I thought it was. I thought it was more respectful to believe God was infinite in everything except where evil was, which made God seem limited. I thought it was better to believe God didn’t create evil at all. At that time, I only understood the mind as something like a body spread out in space.

I also believed Jesus was born from God’s bright substance to save us. So, I couldn’t believe Jesus was born from Mary without mixing with flesh, and I was afraid that would mean God’s pure substance got mixed with something dirty. I hope spiritual people will forgive me for thinking this way, but that’s how I felt.

I also thought many things in the Bible were impossible to defend. Sometimes, I wanted to talk with someone smart about these things to see what they thought.

I had heard a man named Elpidius argue against the Manicheans, and he used parts of the Bible that were hard to argue against. The Manicheans said the New Testament was changed by people who wanted to add Jewish laws, but they never showed any original copies. I was still stuck thinking in physical terms and felt trapped by these ideas. I wanted to understand the truth better but couldn’t.

When I got to Rome, I started teaching speech and writing. I invited some people to my house who had heard of me. Then I learned about new problems in Rome that I hadn’t faced in Africa. Unlike what I was told, unruly gangs didn’t cause trouble here. But many students in Rome were dishonest; they would suddenly switch teachers to avoid paying fees, just for money.
