The Confessions of Saint Augustine BOOK ONE

In God’s presence, Augustine tries to remember his life and how God’s grace has guided him. He wants to thank God for always being there and helping him. While praying, he thinks back to his baby days, learning to talk, and his time at school. He ends by praising God with a thankful heart.

CHAPTER I

1. “You are great, Lord, and deserve to be praised; your power is huge, and your wisdom never ends.” People want to praise you because they are part of your creation. We carry signs of being human and show that you don’t like proud people. Still, people want to praise you, even though we are just a small part of everything you made. You made us want to praise you because you made us for yourself, and our hearts keep searching until we find peace in you.

Please, Lord, help me understand if I should first call on you or praise you. Should I first know you or ask for your help? But how can someone call on you if they don’t know you? People might call on you but think you’re someone else. Maybe we should call on you to get to know you. But how can they call on you if they don’t believe? And how can they believe without someone telling them about you? Those who look for you will praise you because those who search will find you. I will look for you, Lord, and call on you. I call on you with the faith you gave me through your Son and through the preacher who teaches me.

CHAPTER II

2. How can I call on my God and Lord? When I call on you, I ask you to come into me. But how can you, God who made heaven and earth, come into me? Is there any part of me that can hold you? Even the whole world you made can’t hold you. Since nothing exists without you, maybe everything has some way to hold you.

Then why do I ask you to come into me if you are already there? I am not in hell, but you are there too. If I go down into the deepest place, you are there as well.
