BOOK THREE  
This part tells the story of his days as a student in Carthage, how he found Cicero’s book called Hortensius, how he got interested in philosophy, how he became obsessed with the Manichean beliefs, and about his mother’s dream that predicted he would come back to the true faith and to God.

CHAPTER I  
1. I went to Carthage, where there were lots of bad desires all around me. I wasn’t in love yet, but I loved the idea of love; and deep down, I hated myself for not feeling a stronger need for love. I was looking for something to love because I loved loving, and I hated feeling safe and having an easy, trouble-free life. Inside me, I was missing what really matters—God—but strangely, I didn’t feel hungry for Him.  

I didn’t want the kind of food that lasts forever—not because I already had it, but because the emptier I felt inside, the more I didn’t want it.  

Because of this, my soul was sick; it felt full of sores and wanted to be scratched by chasing after physical pleasures. But if these things didn’t have a soul, they wouldn’t make us love them.  

Loving and being loved felt good to me, especially when I enjoyed being close to the person I loved. So I mixed friendship with dirty desires and ruined its beauty with lust. Even though I was dirty inside, I still wanted people to think I was classy and cool. And I quickly fell into the love I was craving.  

My God, my mercy, how bitterly did You, in Your endless kindness, make that sweetness taste for me! Because I was not only loved but also secretly reached the highest pleasure; yet I was happily trapped by painful feelings like jealousy, doubt, fear, anger, and fights.

CHAPTER II  
2. I also loved watching plays, which showed scenes full of sadness like my own problems—fuel for my own pain. But why does a person like to feel sad by watching sad and tragic stories that they couldn’t handle in real life?  

As a viewer, the person wants to feel grief, and that feeling of grief is what makes the experience enjoyable. Isn’t that crazy? People get more affected by these stories the more they get caught up in those feelings. When someone actually suffers, it’s called “misery.” But when someone feels sad for another person who is suffering, it’s called “compassion.”  

But what kind of compassion is it when it comes from watching fake and made-up suffering? The viewer isn’t expected to help the person suffering but only to feel sorry for them. And the more the viewer feels sorry, the more they cheer the actor playing these fake stories. If the sad stories don’t touch the viewer’s feelings, they leave feeling bored and annoyed. But if the stories do touch their feelings, they watch carefully and cry tears of happiness.  

3. So people like tears and sadness. But surely, everyone wants to be happy.
