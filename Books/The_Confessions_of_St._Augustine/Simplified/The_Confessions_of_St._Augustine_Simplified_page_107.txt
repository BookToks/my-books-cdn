“Is the gospel good?” People will say, “Yes, it is good.” But what if everything makes us happy at the same time? Doesn’t having different wants confuse us when we try to choose? Still, all these things are good, but they can fight with each other until we pick one. When we choose, our whole will can move forward in one direction instead of being pulled apart.

The same happens when eternity pulls us up and the fun of this world pulls us down. Our soul doesn’t fully want one or the other. It’s the same soul, but it’s not united, so it feels torn and confused. It wants the truth but can’t let go of old habits.

I felt sick and upset, blaming myself more than ever. I was trapped but starting to feel less tied down. And you, Lord, pressed on my heart with tough love, making me feel afraid and ashamed so I wouldn’t give up and stay trapped again.

I kept telling myself, “Do it now; do it now.” I almost made up my mind. I nearly did it—just not quite. But I didn’t go back to how I was before; I just paused and caught my breath.

I tried again and almost reached my goal—then again, getting closer each time. But I didn’t fully reach it because I was scared to give up my old self and start a new life. The bad habits I was used to were stronger than the good ones I hadn’t tried yet. As the moment to change got closer, I felt more scared. But I didn’t run away; I stayed stuck between hope and fear.

It was my old habits, small silly things and useless desires, that still held me back. They pulled at me like clothes and whispered softly, “Are you really going to leave us? Will you never have these things again? Will some things be forbidden forever?” What were they trying to say? God, please protect me from the shame of what they suggested!

Now I barely heard them because they weren’t facing me directly. They whispered behind my back and tried to make me look back. They slowed me down so I hesitated to break free and jump toward where I was being called. My stubborn habit kept asking, “Do you think you can live without us?”

But now this voice was quieter because I was looking forward, even though I was still scared to go. I saw the pure and honorable life of self-control. It welcomed me gently, without being wild, with a modest smile, holding out its hands full of good examples. There were many young men and women, people of all ages, serious widows, and old virgins. And in the middle was self-control—not empty, but a joyful mother of children—her happiness comes through you, Lord, her husband.

She smiled at me like a challenge, as if to say: “Can’t you do what these young people do? But none of them can do it alone; they do it with the Lord their God. He gave me to them. So why are you trying to do it on your own? Trust in Him; don’t be afraid.”
