In the beginning, the Word was God. Everything was made by him, and nothing was made without him. What he made is life, and this life is like a light for people. The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness didn’t understand it. I also read that the soul of a person knows about the light, but it is not the light itself. The true light is the Word of God, who is God, and this light shines on everyone who comes into the world. The Word was in the world, and the world was made by him, but the world didn’t recognize him.

He came to his own people, but they didn’t accept him. However, everyone who did accept him was given the power to become children of God if they believed in his name. I didn’t find these parts in those books.

I also read that God the Word was not born like a regular person, not from flesh or blood, or by human choice, but from God. But I didn’t find anywhere that the Word became flesh and lived among us. In those books, it said the Son was like God and didn’t think being equal with God was something to grab onto, because he was naturally like God. But I didn’t find the part where he gave up his place, became a servant like a human, humbled himself, and died on the cross. I also didn’t find that God raised him up and gave him the highest name, so that everyone would bow to Jesus and say he is Lord to honor God the Father.

The books said that before all time, the Son was always with God, and that all people get blessings from him. They said that by joining with his wisdom, people can become wise. But I didn’t find that Christ died for sinners or that God didn’t hold back his Son but gave him up for all of us.

It’s said that God hides these truths from those who think they are smart but shows them to those who are like children. He wants people who are tired and carrying heavy burdens to come to him and find rest because he is humble and kind. The humble will be guided and taught by him, and he will forgive their sins because he sees their troubles.

But people who think they are better because of their knowledge won’t listen to him when he says, “Learn from me, because I am humble and gentle, and you will find rest.” Even though they know about God, they don’t honor or thank him. Because of this, they become foolish, their hearts become dark, and even though they think they are wise, they actually become fools.
