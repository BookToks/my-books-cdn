AUGUSTINE’S TESTIMONY ABOUT THE CONFESSIONS  
I. THE Retractations, II, 6 (A.D. 427)  

1. My book, Confessions, has thirteen parts. It talks about God, who is good and fair. It shares both my mistakes and good moments. The goal is to help people think about God and feel closer to Him. When I was writing it, it helped me, and it still helps me when I read it again. What others think doesn’t matter as much, but I know many people have enjoyed reading it. The first ten parts are about me, and the last three talk about the Bible, starting from the very beginning when God made the world, all the way to the day of rest.  

2. In Book IV, I talked about how sad I felt when my friend died. I said it felt like our souls were once joined as one. But now, I think I was just being dramatic and not very serious. I wasn’t sure, though, because I said “maybe” to soften it. In Book XIII, I said something about the sky being made between two kinds of waters. I said it without thinking much, and it’s actually a confusing idea.  

The book starts with, “Great are you, O Lord.”  

II. De Dono Perseverantiae, XX, 53 (A.D. 428)  

Which of my shorter writings is more famous or liked than my thirteen books of Confessions? I wrote them long before a wrong idea called Pelagianism started. In the Confessions, I often prayed to God, “Give what you command and command what you want.” One time, a church leader heard me say this, and he got really upset and almost argued with me. What does God want most? That we believe in Him. And God gives us this faith. So it makes sense to say, “Give what you command.”  

In those books, I also told the story of how God helped me believe, even when I didn’t want to. My mother prayed every day for me, and God promised she wouldn’t lose me. I said clearly that God’s grace can change people’s hearts, even when they don’t want to believe. If you want to know more about how I kept growing in faith, you can look it up yourself.
