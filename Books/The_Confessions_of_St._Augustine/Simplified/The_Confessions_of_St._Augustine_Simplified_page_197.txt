CHAPTER XI  
12. Who can really understand the all-powerful Trinity? Yet, almost everyone talks about it, even if they don’t really know what they’re saying. Few people, when they talk about it, truly understand it. People argue and try hard, but no one sees it clearly without feeling peaceful inside.  

I wish people would think about three things inside themselves. These three things are different from the Trinity, but I mention them so people can use their minds and check themselves, realizing how different they are from the Trinity. The three things are: to be, to know, and to want. I am, I know, and I want. I am a being who knows and wants; I know I exist and I want to exist and to know. These three parts show how connected life is; there is one life, one mind, one essence.  

Even though these parts are different, they don’t separate from each other. A person understands this difference inside their mind; they should look inside themselves and see it. But when someone understands and talks about any one of these parts, they should not think they have found the unchanging thing above them all—the one that always is, always knows, and always wills.  

Whether the Trinity exists because these three parts are in one God, or whether all three parts are in each Person of the Trinity so each is three-in-one, or whether both ideas are true and the Infinite is somehow both one and many in itself—who can easily understand? Who can explain it clearly? Who can say anything about it without being wrong?  

CHAPTER XII  
13. Keep going in your faith; tell the Lord your God, “Holy, holy, holy, O Lord my God, in your name we have been baptized—in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.” We baptize in your name, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  

God, through Christ, made “heaven and earth,” which means the spiritual and physical parts of his Church. Before the Church had “the form of doctrine,” our “earth” was “invisible and unformed,” and we were covered by the darkness of not knowing. You correct people for their wrongs, and your judgments are deep like an ocean.  

But because your Spirit was moving over these waters, your kindness didn’t leave us in our misery, and you said, “Let there be light; change your ways, because the kingdom of heaven is near.” Change your ways, and there will be light.  

Because our souls were troubled inside, we remembered you, Lord, from the land of Jordan and from the mountain—and when we didn’t like our darkness, we turned to you, “and there was light.” Before, we were in darkness, but now we are light in the Lord.
