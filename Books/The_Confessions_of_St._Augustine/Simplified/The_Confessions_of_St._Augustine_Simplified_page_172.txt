When you listen to songs, or hear a song you know well, your feelings change because you expect certain words to come next and remember the ones that already played. Your senses are split between what you expect and what you remember.

But this isn’t how it works for you, who are always the same and never change. You are the true eternal Creator of minds. From the very start, you knew both heaven and earth perfectly, without your knowledge changing. You also made heaven and earth at the beginning without any confusion or struggle.

Let anyone who understands this admit it to you; and even those who don’t understand should admit it too! Oh, you are so highly honored, yet you live with those who are humble. You help those who feel down, and they don’t fall because you are the Most High.
