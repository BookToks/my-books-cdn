Long ago, God showed himself to holy people so they could be saved by believing in the suffering he would go through. Just like they believed in what was coming, we believe in what already happened. As a man, Jesus was the go-between for us and God, but as God’s Word, he wasn’t just in the middle—he was fully God, equal with God, and one with the Holy Spirit.

God, you loved us so much that you didn’t hold back your only Son but gave him up for us, even though we don’t deserve it! Jesus, who didn’t think being equal with God was something to grab onto, obeyed you completely—even when it meant dying on the cross. He was the only one who was “free among the dead.” He had the power to give up his life and to take it back again. For us, he was both the winner and the sacrifice, the priest and the offering, because he gave himself up and served us.

That’s why I trust him completely to heal all my problems. He is at your right side, speaking up for us. If not for him, I would be hopeless because I have so many weaknesses and troubles. But your power to heal is even greater than all my problems.

If Jesus hadn’t become human and lived with us, we might think God’s word is too far from us and give up on ourselves. I was scared of my sins and how miserable I felt, and I thought about running away and hiding. But you stopped me and made me strong, reminding me that since Jesus died for everyone, we shouldn’t live just for ourselves but for him who died for us.

So, Lord, I give all my worries to you, hoping to learn amazing things from your teachings. You know how weak and unable I am, so please teach and heal me. Your only Son, who holds all the wisdom and knowledge, saved me with his blood. Don’t let proud people talk badly about me just because I remember what Jesus did for me. Even though I have little, I want to be satisfied by him, just like others who find their joy in you. And those who seek you will praise you.
