You might have once stopped someone from doing something and didn’t explain why at that time. Even if it went against the rules of some group of people, it should still be done because only the group that listens to you is truly right. People who understand what you want are lucky. Everything done by those who obey you either shows something needed right then or hints at what will happen later.

But I didn’t know any of this and made fun of your holy servants and prophets. What good did that do me? Only that you made fun of me back. Slowly, I started to believe silly things, like a fig tree crying when its fruit was picked and that the tree’s sap was like tears.

Still, if someone took a fig because of another person’s bad actions, a special Manichean saint might eat it, digest it, and then breathe it out as angels. When praying, he would sigh out pieces of God. Those pieces would have stayed stuck in the fig if the saint hadn’t freed them by eating it! And, sadly, I thought the fruits of the earth deserved more kindness than people, even though the fruits were made for people. If a hungry man who wasn’t a Manichean asked for food, giving it to him felt like it was a terrible punishment.

Then you reached down and saved me from the deep darkness of Manicheism because my mother, who was faithful to you, prayed and cried for me more than most mothers cry when their children die. She saw with the faith and spirit you gave her that I was lost. You heard her, Lord, and didn’t ignore her tears as she prayed everywhere. You truly listened.

How else could she have had the dream that comforted her and made her let me live with her and eat at her table again, even though she hated my wrong beliefs? In the dream, she stood on a wooden plank and saw a bright young man smiling at her while she was sad and bowed down. He asked why she was so sad and crying every day—not to learn, but to teach her, as happens in visions. When she said it was because of my soul’s fate, he told her to be calm and look—she saw me standing with her on the same plank.

Where else could this vision have come from, if not because you listened to her prayers?
