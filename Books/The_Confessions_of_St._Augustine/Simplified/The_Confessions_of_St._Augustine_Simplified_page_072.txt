He had been my student when I first started teaching in our town, and later at Carthage.

He respected me a lot because he thought I was good and smart, and I respected him because he had a natural love for doing what was right, which was rare for someone so young.

But in Carthage, where people loved silly shows, he got caught up in the craze for gladiator fights. While he was wasting his time on this, I was teaching public speaking at a school there. At that time, he wasn’t coming to my classes because of some bad feelings between me and his father. That’s when I found out how obsessed he was with the games, and it made me very sad. He seemed like he might throw away his great potential—if he hadn’t already. But I couldn’t give him advice or stop him because I thought he felt the same way about me as his father did. But I was wrong.

Ignoring his father’s wishes, he started being friendly again and came to my classes to listen for a while before leaving.

But I forgot to actually try to help him stop ruining his mind with this crazy passion for useless sports. But you, Lord, who control everything you made, didn’t forget him—someone who would one day be one of your followers and a leader in your church. You decided to help him change through me, even though I didn’t know about it.

One day, as I sat teaching my students, he came in, said hello, sat down, and paid close attention to what I was saying. I happened to be explaining a part of a text and thought of a comparison to the gladiator games. I used it to make my point clearer and added a sharp joke about those obsessed with the games. You know, God, I wasn’t trying to fix Alypius then. But he thought I was talking about him. What most people would have taken as an insult, he took as a reason to be upset with himself and to like me even more. You said long ago, “If you correct a wise person, they will love you.” I didn’t actually correct him, but you can use anything, even without us realizing it, in the best way. You turned my words into a burning coal that healed his hurting mind. Anyone who doesn’t think about your kindness should stay quiet, because inside me I thank you.

After that talk, Alypius jumped out of the deep hole he had fallen into by choice, blinded by those terrible pleasures. He decided to be more careful and calm. Once he did this, all the bad influence of the gladiator games left him, and he stopped going to them. Then he even convinced his father to let him be my student again. Because Alypius wanted it, his father agreed. So Alypius started coming back to my classes and joined me in the same beliefs, especially admiring the strict self-control shown by the Manicheans, which he thought was real and honest.
