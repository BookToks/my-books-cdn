Sometimes things happen one after another; but if there’s no shape or form, you can’t tell one thing from another. So, by thinking about two things—one that is perfectly formed at the start and another that has no shape at all, one being heaven (the highest heaven) and the other being earth (which is invisible and shapeless)—I understand why your Scripture says, without mentioning days, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” It shows right away which earth it means. Later, on the second day, it says the sky was made and called heaven, which helps us know which heaven was meant earlier, even though it didn’t say the day.

Your words are amazing and deep. On the surface, they seem simple and easy for beginners, but inside, they are really deep and wonderful! It’s both scary and awe-inspiring to think about them, filled with respect and love.

I strongly dislike those who hate your words. I wish you would use your powerful sword to stop them, so they wouldn’t be enemies! I’d rather they be stopped than be against you, because then they could live for you. But some people don’t hate the book of Genesis; they say, “God’s Spirit, who inspired Moses to write this, didn’t mean it the way you do. He meant it the way we say.” To them, O God who judges all, I answer.

Will you say that the truths God tells me deep inside about His endless nature are false? He tells me that He never changes over time, and His will is the same as who He is.

He doesn’t want one thing now and something else later. He wants everything all at once, not bits at different times. He doesn’t start wanting something new later or stop wanting what He wanted before. If He did, He would change, but nothing that changes lasts forever. But God is forever.

He also tells me that when we hope for something, it becomes real when it happens, and then it becomes a memory after it passes. Any thought that changes like this is not forever, but God is forever. So, I believe God has not made anything new by changing His will, and He knows everything without anything temporary.

What will you say, those who disagree? Are these things false? “No,” they say. “Then do you deny that every perfect thing and all things that can be shaped come from the one who is the best and highest?” “No,” they say. “Do you deny that there is a special created order that loves God truly and closely? It’s not as old as God, but it doesn’t separate from Him or change. It only focuses on God.” If God shows Himself to someone who loves Him as He wants, and is enough for that person, then they won’t turn away from God or themselves. This is “God’s house.” It’s not made of earth or stars, but it’s a spiritual house that lasts forever without any flaws.
