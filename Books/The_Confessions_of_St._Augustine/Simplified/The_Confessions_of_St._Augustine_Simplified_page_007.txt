He starts by talking about mistakes and lying as special kinds of evil. Then he goes back to the hopeless situation of fallen humans, and how God’s free gift of grace came through Jesus Christ, who is both God and Savior. Questions about how people receive God’s grace lead naturally to talking about baptism and being made right with God, and then to the Holy Spirit and the Church.

Augustine explains the good things that come from this saving grace and thinks about how faith and good deeds work together in a person who is forgiven. But salvation looks ahead to resurrection, so Augustine spends a lot of time thinking carefully about what eternal life will be like. After that, he talks about what happens to the wicked and the mystery of predestination. He doesn’t avoid these tough subjects; in fact, he even explains some of his strict ideas about God’s harsh justice toward those who are punished.

After covering Christian faith and hope, he briefly talks about Christian love as the most important part of the Christian life. This “handbook” on faith, hope, and love is meant to help Laurence use it, not just leave it unused on a shelf. Together, Augustine’s Confessions and this handbook give us two key ways to understand his views—one from when he was younger and one from when he was older. From both, we get a good, though not complete, introduction to the heart and mind of this great Christian thinker. There are important differences between the two books, which careful readers should notice. But all the main ideas of Augustine’s Christianity show up in them, helping us understand its core.

There’s no need to prove why we need a new English translation of these books, even though many good ones already exist. Every translation is just an attempt—and also an interpretation. It’s unlikely any translation will ever be perfect. Augustine’s Latin is mostly easy to read. You can feel his clever wordplay, the way he balances his sentences, his simple use of short phrases, and his complex twists in thought and word order. He was a master of Latin style, and writing in a smart way was natural for him—even though the Latin Bible influenced his writing style a lot.

But it’s very hard to turn his Latin style into modern English without changing it too much. A word-for-word translation is just not readable English. And that also changes the meaning because Augustine’s Latin is actually very readable!

On the other hand, when you have to explain things in your own words, it’s always tricky to know when you’ve changed the original meaning too much. My goal is that these translations help readers connect well with Augustine’s style and way of arguing. I’m not trying to copy his style exactly in English. If his ideas come through clearly and strongly, it’s okay if the English isn’t as fancy or smooth as Augustine’s original Latin. Anyone who compares this translation with others will at least get a sense of how complicated and brilliant the original really is.

A careful reader soon sees that Augustine doesn’t want to be studied from far away or by someone who doesn’t care. In all his writing, he really wants to pull the reader into his own questions and confusion. He is eager to share his sudden moments of understanding and his glimpses of God’s glory. Augustine’s style is very personal, so it often sounds like everyday speech and is full of his own way of expressing things.
