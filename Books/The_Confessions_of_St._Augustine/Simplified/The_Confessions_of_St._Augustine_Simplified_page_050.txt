I was being guided by you, even if I didn’t realize it at the time.

And how do I know that I loved him more because others praised him, not just because of who he really was? If people had said bad things about him instead, I wouldn’t have started loving him. But he would have been the same person, with the same qualities. It was just what other people thought that changed how I felt. This shows how weak the soul is when it’s not supported by truth. Just like the wind blows in different directions, opinions push the soul around, making it hard to see what’s really true. But truth is right in front of us.

It was really important to me that he knew about my writing and how much I loved learning. If he liked those things, I would like him more. But if he didn’t, my proud heart would feel hurt. So, I thought hard about what is truly beautiful and fitting, and I wrote an essay about it for him. I loved the essay, even if no one else did.

But I didn’t realize that the real point about beauty was about your amazing power, God, who does great things. So, I looked at physical things and said something is “beautiful” if it’s beautiful on its own, and “fit” if it’s beautiful in relation to something else. I used examples from the real world to explain this. Then I thought about the mind, but my wrong ideas about spiritual things stopped me from seeing the truth. Still, the truth kept pushing itself on me, and I turned my mind away from invisible things to things with shape and color, because I couldn’t understand those invisible things. I thought maybe I couldn’t even understand my own mind.

Since I liked peace and hated chaos, I said unity is found in goodness and disunity in badness. I thought unity was about the soul, truth, and the highest good. But I thought disunity was some kind of evil life, something real but not from you, God. I called the first one a Monad, like a soul without gender, and the other a Dyad, connected to anger and passion—but honestly, I didn’t really understand what I was saying. I didn’t know that evil isn’t a real thing and that our soul isn’t the highest good.

Just like when people act violently because of bad feelings in their soul, or when they give in to desires without control, wrong ideas mess up life if the soul itself is messed up. This was true for me because I didn’t know that my soul needed to be lit up by another light to understand the truth. The soul itself isn’t the truth. “For you will give light...”
