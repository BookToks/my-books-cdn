The spiritual and the physical parts of me were fighting inside, and this battle was tearing my soul apart.

I came to understand from my own experience what I had read: “the flesh wants one thing, and the Spirit wants another.” I really wanted both, but I liked the things I approved in myself more than the things I didn’t. The bad parts weren’t really me anymore because I didn’t want them—I was more like a victim. But still, I became my own enemy because I had chosen to be the person I didn’t want to be.

So, who can blame me when I get punished for doing wrong? I could no longer say I hesitated to leave the world and follow God because I wasn’t sure what was true. Now I knew for sure. But even though I was tied to the earth, I didn’t want to be God’s soldier. I was as scared to be free as I was to be trapped.

I was carrying the weight of the world, feeling kind of sleepy and half-awake. Thinking about God was like trying to wake up but falling back asleep. No one wants to sleep forever because waking up is better. But when you’re really tired, you don’t want to get up, even if your brain knows it’s time. That’s how I was—I knew it was better to give myself to God’s love than to keep giving in to my own desires. God’s love won and made me feel whole; my desires only trapped me.

I had no answer when God called me, “Wake up, you who are sleeping, and Christ will give you light.” Everywhere I looked, God showed me the truth, and I could only reply with sleepy words, “Soon; just a little longer.” But “soon” never came, and my “leave me alone for a bit” lasted a very long time. I tried to enjoy God’s law inside me, but another law inside me fought against it and held me prisoner to sin. This law of sin is like a bad habit that controls the mind, even when the mind doesn’t want it to. But it deserves to be like that because it willingly falls into the habit. “I am so miserable! Who will save me from this body of death?” Only your grace can, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Now I will tell you, Lord, my helper and rescuer, how you freed me from the strong chains of sexual desire and from being a slave to worldly business. I was anxious as I went about my usual tasks and kept sighing to you. I went to your church as often as I could, even though my work made me groan and tired.
