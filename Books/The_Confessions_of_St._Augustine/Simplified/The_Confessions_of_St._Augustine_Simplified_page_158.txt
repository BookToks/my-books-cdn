Something already exists, like clay, stone, wood, or gold. But where would these things come from if you hadn’t made them? You made the body for the craftsman and the mind that controls the body. You made the stuff he uses to create things. You gave him the ability to understand his work and imagine what he can do with the materials. You gave him his senses so he can send messages from his mind to his hands and tell his mind what he has done. This way, his mind can check if the work is done well.

All these things praise you, the Creator of everything. But how did you make them? How, God, did you make the heaven and earth? You didn’t make heaven and earth inside the sky or on the earth, or in the air or water, because these are all part of heaven and earth. You didn’t make the whole world anywhere in the world because there was no place before it was made. You didn’t hold anything in your hand to shape heaven and earth, because where would you get something that you didn’t make? Is there anything at all except because you are? You spoke, and everything was made. By your Word, you made them all.

But how did you speak? Was it like the voice from the cloud that said, “This is my beloved Son”? That voice started and ended, with sounds that passed one after another until silence came. That shows it was the action of a created thing, happening in time, following your eternal will. The ear heard the words and sent them to the mind, which listened carefully to your eternal Word in silence. The mind compared the temporary words with your never-ending Word and said, “These words are different and not real because they fade away. But God’s Word stays forever.” 

If you said “Let heaven and earth be made” with words that come and go, then there must have already been some kind of physical thing before heaven and earth for that voice to happen in time. But there was no physical thing before heaven and earth. Or if there was, you had already made it without time, and then used it to make the time-based voice that said, “Let the heaven and earth be made!” Whatever that voice came from didn’t exist until you made it. Did your Word decide that a body could be made so that it could speak those words?
