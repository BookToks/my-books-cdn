CHAPTER XIII  
20. I remember all these things and how I learned them. I also remember hearing some wrong ideas about them. Even if those ideas are false, I still remember hearing them.

I also remember that I can tell the difference between what is true and what is not true. Now, I see that it’s one thing to figure that out and another to remember that I figured it out. So, I remember both understanding these things and saving them in my memory. This way, later on, I can remember them just like I understand them now. I remember remembering, and if I think about it later, it will be because my memory helps me recall it.

CHAPTER XIV  
21. My memory also holds my feelings, but not the way I felt them at the time. Memory works differently. For example, I can remember being happy without actually feeling happy now, or remember being sad without feeling sad now. I can remember being scared without being scared now, and remember wanting something without wanting it at the moment. Sometimes the opposite happens: when I’m happy, I remember being sad before, and when I’m sad, I remember being happy.

This isn’t strange when it comes to the body because the mind and body are different. So, if I’m happy but remember a time my body hurt, that’s not weird. Even though memory feels this way, it’s still part of the mind. When we tell someone to remember something, we say, “Keep this in mind.” When we forget, we say, “It slipped my mind.” So, memory and mind are connected.

Since that’s true, how can I be happy but remember sad times? The mind feels joy, and memory holds sadness. The mind is happy because of the joy it has, but memory doesn’t feel sad just because it remembers sadness. Could memory be separate from the mind? No one would say that. Memory is like the stomach of the mind: joy and sadness are like tasty or bitter food. When they go into memory, they’re stored like food in the stomach but not tasted. This is just an example, but it’s not totally wrong.

22. Now, I remember that there are four main feelings in the mind: desire, joy, fear, and sadness. I can study these feelings more by dividing them into types and explaining them. But I find all this in my memory, and I take it out from there. Even when I remember these feelings, I don’t actually feel moved by them. They were already in my memory before I thought about them. Maybe it’s like how food comes back up from the stomach when you remember it.
