There’s a risky temptation to want praise from others. Loving praise makes people feel too confident about how great they are and then they go looking for compliments. It tempts me, even when I know I shouldn’t want it, and that’s exactly why I want it. Sometimes people even feel proud when others look down on their pride—but if they really felt that way, they wouldn’t be proud of it.

Inside us, there’s another problem from the same kind of temptation. Some people only care about pleasing themselves, even if they don’t try to please or upset others. But by doing that, they actually upset you a lot. They enjoy things that aren’t good as if they were good, or they enjoy your good things as if they were their own. Sometimes they think they earned those good things themselves, or got them through your kindness but act jealous toward others. In all these struggles, you know how my heart feels. I’d rather you heal my wounds than have me hurt myself.

Wherever I go, Truth, you are with me, teaching me what to avoid and what to want when I try to understand the world and ask for your advice.

I’ve looked at the world through my senses and noticed how my body lives through them. Then I thought deeply about my memory—the many parts of my mind full of endless thoughts. I was scared and couldn’t understand any of it without you. I realized you aren’t any of these things, and I’m not either. I looked carefully at everything, trusting some things from my senses and questioning others about my soul, checking and sorting all these thoughts. In my memory, I studied some things, kept some, and took out others. But I wasn’t the one doing all this, nor were you. You are the constant light I ask for help from to understand if things are true and what they really mean. I heard you teaching and guiding me. I do this often and it makes me happy. When I’m free from my daily duties, I enjoy this time with you.

But even when I think about all this with you, I still don’t find a safe place for my soul except in you. Only with you can all parts of me come together and nothing be lost. Sometimes you give me a very deep, special feeling—a sweet feeling I can’t explain. If this feeling grew fully inside me, I don’t know how amazing life would be. But because of my own weaknesses, I fall back into old habits and get stuck. I feel sad, but I’m still held tightly by these habits. That’s how much habits weigh us down. I can live like this, but I don’t want to. I want to live the other way but can’t. Either way, I’m unhappy.
