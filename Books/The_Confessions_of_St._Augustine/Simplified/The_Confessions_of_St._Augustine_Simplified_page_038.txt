Sometimes people do bad things to avoid something worse, like when someone is scared of another person. Sometimes they do bad things because they are jealous, like when an unlucky person hurts someone who is happy just because that person is happy. Other times, rich people do bad things to those they are afraid might become as rich or powerful as they are, or because they don’t like that person being equal to them. Some people even hurt others just for fun, like people who watch violent gladiator fights or those who laugh at and make fun of others.

These are the main kinds of wrong things that come from wanting pleasure, wanting what we see, or wanting power. Sometimes a person is guilty of one of these, sometimes two, and sometimes all three at once. In this way, people break the Ten Commandments, which are like a song with ten strings, telling us how to live right.

But how can these bad actions hurt God, who cannot be made dirty or hurt? Still, God punishes these sins because when people sin, they actually harm their own souls. Sin lies to itself by ruining or twisting the natural way God made us. People do this by using good things in bad ways, by wanting things they shouldn’t have, by being angry and rebelling against God, or by ignoring what society needs and choosing to cause trouble because of their own likes and dislikes.

This happens when people turn away from God, the true Creator and Ruler of everything. It happens when people are proud and love part of something as if it were the whole thing. Because of this, we need to come back to God humbly, let Him clean us from our bad ways, and be kind to those who admit their sins. God listens to those who suffer and helps free us from the chains we made for ourselves. He will do this as long as we don’t act arrogantly, thinking we are free in the wrong way. If we love ourselves more than God and what is good for everyone, we lose everything by wanting too much.

But even with all these sins and crimes, there are some sins done by people who are still trying to do good. When we judge these sins in the right way, we can see that the people should be praised because they show hope, like a young green plant growing. Some actions look like sins but aren’t really sins because they don’t hurt God or break social rules. For example, saving money for hard times isn’t just being greedy. Also, when leaders punish people to help them learn, it’s not just about causing pain.

So, many things people don’t like might be okay in God’s eyes. And many people who are praised by others might actually be doing wrong, as God knows the truth. This is because actions, the person’s thoughts, and the situation can all be different. Sometimes God even asks for things that people don’t expect or understand.
