She went back to her own home, and I continued on to Rome.

When I got to Rome, I got really sick. I was so close to dying and going to hell because of all the bad things I had done to you, to myself, and to others—on top of the original sin we all have from Adam. You hadn’t forgiven me for any of these sins through Christ, and his cross hadn’t taken away the anger you felt because of my mistakes. How could it, when I only thought of him as a ghost? The death of my soul was real, but the death of his body seemed fake to me. My soul’s life was fake too because it was as unreal as his body’s death was real, even though I didn’t believe it.

My fever got worse, and I was about to die. If I had died then, I would have gone to the burning punishment I deserved because of my sins, according to your rules. My mother didn’t know how bad I was, but she kept praying for me even from far away. And you, who are everywhere, heard her prayers and felt sorry for me where I was, so I got better physically, though my heart was still far from you.

Even though I almost died, I didn’t want to be baptized. When I was younger, I asked my mother for baptism, but now I was worse and made fun of all the ways your help could save me. I was a sinner, but I didn’t want to die twice—once physically and once spiritually. If my mother’s heart had been broken by my death, it never could have healed, because I can’t explain how much she loved me or how much she suffered in spirit, even more than when she gave birth to me.

I can’t understand how she could have been healed if my death, while I was still sinful, had hurt her so deeply. So, where were all her many prayers? Nowhere but with you. Could you, merciful God, ignore the humble heart of that pure and wise widow who was so generous, kind, and always cared for your saints? She never missed going to church twice a day, morning and evening—not to gossip or hear silly stories, but to listen to your sermons and to pray to you. Could you ignore the tears of someone like her, who asked you not for money or temporary things, but for her son’s soul to be saved? No way, Lord. You were surely close, listening and working out your plan that you had already decided on. You would never trick her with false visions or answers she got from you—some I have told, others I haven’t—because she kept them safe in her heart and kept praying, trusting they were your promises. Because your mercy lasts forever, you have promised to help those whose debts you have forgiven, and you keep your promises.
