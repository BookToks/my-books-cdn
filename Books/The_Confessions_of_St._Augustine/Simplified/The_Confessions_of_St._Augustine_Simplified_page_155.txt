BOOK ELEVEN  
The eternal Creator and creation in time. Augustine connects his memories of the past, his current experiences, and his strong wish to understand how creation works. This makes him ask questions about how and when creation happened. He thinks about how creation occurred and explains that it happened out of nothing and didn’t change God. Then, he thinks about when the world and time began and shows that time and creation started together. But what exactly is time?  

Augustine then gives a smart explanation about how time depends on our minds and how everything that happens in time relates to God’s endless eternity. After this, he gets ready to explain the first verses of the Bible, Genesis 1:1-2.  

CHAPTER I  
1. Is it possible, Lord, that because you live forever, you don’t know what I’m saying? Or do you see things happening in time exactly when they happen? If not, then why am I telling you these stories? It’s not to inform you, but to help me and my readers love you more, so we can all say, “The Lord is great and deserves all praise.” I have said this before and will say it again: “I do this because I love your love.” We also pray, even though Truth tells us, “Your Father knows what you need before you ask.” So we open our hearts to you, confessing our troubles and your kindness, so you can fully free us as you already have started to do. Then we won’t be unhappy on our own but happy in you—since you have called us to be humble, gentle, sad for our sins, eager for justice, kind, and pure in heart. I have told you many things whenever I could, because you wanted me to confess to you, Lord God—“You are good and your mercy lasts forever.”  

CHAPTER II  
2. But how long would it take for me to write down all your warnings, your scares, your comforts, and your guidance that helped me preach your Word and serve your people? Even if I could do it well, time is very precious to me. For a long time, I have wanted to think deeply about your law and admit what I know and don’t know about it—from the first moments of your light in my mind to the darkness still there—until my weaknesses are replaced by your strength. I don’t want to waste any free time that I have outside of taking care of my body and daily duties.
