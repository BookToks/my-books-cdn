CHAPTER XXV  
36. But where do you live in my memory, Lord? Where do you stay there? What kind of place have you made for yourself? What kind of special space have you built? You have honored my memory by living in it, but I need to think more about which part of it you live in.  

When I try to remember you, I go beyond the parts of my memory that animals have, because I don’t find you among the pictures of physical things. Then I look in the part where I keep feelings I remember, but you’re not there either. I even check the deepest part of my mind, which is in my memory, since the mind can remember itself—and you aren’t there.  

You are not a body or an image, and you are not feelings like joy, sadness, desire, fear, or memory. You are the Lord God of the mind and all these changing things, but you stay the same forever. Still, you chose to live in my memory since I learned about you. But why do I ask where exactly in my memory you live, as if it were made of different parts?  

You definitely live there, because I have remembered you since I first learned about you, and I find you in my memory whenever I think of you.

You are everywhere and at the same time, Truth. You guide everyone who asks you questions, and answer all of them even if they ask about very different things. You answer clearly, but not everyone understands clearly. Everyone asks you about what they want, but they don’t always hear what they want to hear. The best person serving you is the one who doesn’t want to hear what they want, but instead wants to accept what you tell them.  

CHAPTER XXVII  
38. I loved you late, O Beauty so old and so new, I loved you late. You were inside me, but I was outside, looking for you there.  

I ran blindly among the beautiful things you made. You were with me, but I wasn’t with you. These things kept me away from you, even though they only exist because of you. You called and shouted, breaking through my deafness. You shined and chased away my blindness. You breathed sweet smells and I breathed them in; now I’m eager for you. I tasted and now I hunger and thirst. You touched me, and I burned with desire for your peace.  

CHAPTER XXVIII  
39. When I am completely joined with you, with all my being, then there will be no...
