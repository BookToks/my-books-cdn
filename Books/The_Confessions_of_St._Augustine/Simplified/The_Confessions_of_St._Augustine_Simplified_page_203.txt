Sometimes, people aren’t ready to understand deep spiritual things. It’s like they’re babies who drink milk before they’re strong enough for solid food. Instead of leaving them in complete darkness, we give them light like the moon and stars, so they can start to see. In your book, God, you teach us wisely so we can admire and understand the world, even if right now we only get it through signs and seasons and time.

First, God tells us to “wash yourselves and make yourselves clean; get rid of the wrong things in your hearts” so that “dry land” can appear. We should learn to do good, protect those without parents, and help widows. This way, the earth will grow green plants and fruit trees. God invites us to talk with Him so that the lights in the sky can shine on the earth.

There was a rich man who asked Jesus what he needed to do to have eternal life. Jesus, who is God even though the man thought He was just a regular person, told him to follow the commandments: don’t be mean or do bad things like killing, cheating, stealing, or lying. This way, “dry land” appears, meaning respect for parents and love for others grows. The man said he already followed all these rules. But Jesus saw that his heart was full of greed, like a patch of thorny bushes. Jesus told him to sell what he had, give to the poor, and follow Him if he wanted to be truly perfect and wise like others who understand God’s ways. Only then would the lights in the sky shine for him too, but that won’t happen unless his heart is with God. And his heart won’t be with God unless he treasures what God treasures. But the rich man’s heart was like barren land, and the thorns choked out God’s word.

But you, the chosen people, who have given up everything to follow God, keep following Him and surprise the powerful! Follow Him, shining bright in the world, so the heavens can show His glory and separate the light of those who are truly perfect.
