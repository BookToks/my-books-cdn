I talked with my friends and also spoke to you alone in my heart. I wrote letters to Nebridius, who wasn’t there yet. When could I ever have enough time to tell you about all the great blessings you gave us back then, especially since I’m moving toward even bigger gifts? My memory brings them back, and it feels good to admit them to you, Lord: how you guided me inside, made me humble, calmed my busy thoughts, straightened my twisted ways, and smoothed out my rough path. I also remember how you helped Alypius, my close friend, believe in your only Son, Jesus Christ—something he didn’t want to include in our writings at first. He liked the old ideas from the schools better than the true teachings of the Church, which fight against evil.

Oh God, how I cried out to you when I read the psalms of David, those songs full of faith and devotion that leave no room for pride! I was still new to your love, like a beginner learning about faith, spending time at the villa with Alypius, who was just like me. My mother was there too—she looked like a woman but had the strong faith of a man, peaceful with age, full of motherly love and Christian devotion. I shouted prayers to you in those songs and felt my love for you grow! I wanted to sing them all over the world, to fight against human pride. And they are sung all over the world—no one can hide from your power.

I was very upset with the Manicheans, but I also felt sorry for them because they didn’t know about the sacraments, the healing gifts, and they angrily rejected the cure that could have helped them! I wished they could have been nearby, secretly watching my face and hearing my words when I spent quiet time reading the Fourth Psalm. I wish they had seen how that psalm touched me. “When I called on you, God, you heard me; you made me stronger when I was in trouble. Have mercy and listen to my prayer.” I wish they had heard what I said about these words—without me knowing, so they wouldn’t think I was talking just to them. If I knew they were listening, I might have said things differently. And if I had, they might not have understood my true feelings, because I was speaking honestly to you from my heart.

Sometimes I was scared, sometimes hopeful, and I felt happy because of your mercy, Father. All these feelings showed in my eyes and voice when your Spirit spoke to us and said, “People, how long will you be slow to understand? How long will you love worthless things and chase after lies?” I had loved worthless things and chased after lies. But you, Lord, had already honored your Holy One by raising him from the dead and putting him at your right side.
