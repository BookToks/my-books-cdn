I had only been friends with him for less than a year, but he was the sweetest part of my life so far.

Who can truly praise you for what they’ve only felt inside themselves? What did you do then, God? Your decisions are so deep and hard to understand! When he was very sick with a fever, he was unconscious and everyone thought he would die. While he was like that, he was baptized without knowing it. At the time, I didn’t care much because I thought his soul remembered what he had learned from me, not what happened to his body when he was unconscious. But things turned out very different. He got better and came back to life.

As soon as I could talk to him – which was right away because I never left him and we were very close – I tried to joke about the baptism he had when he wasn’t awake. But he pulled away from me like I was an enemy. Then, surprisingly, he told me that if I wanted to stay his friend, I had to stop saying things like that. I was confused and kept my feelings hidden until he got stronger and I could talk to him like I wanted. But then he was taken away from me so you could keep him safe for me. A few days later, when I wasn’t there, his fever came back and he died.

My heart was completely dark with sadness, and everywhere I looked I saw death. My hometown felt like a torture room, and my father’s house felt strange and unhappy. Everything I had done with him now felt like a terrible pain. I looked for him everywhere, but he wasn’t there. I hated all the places because he wasn’t in them, and they couldn’t tell me, “Look, he’s coming,” like they did when he was alive but not there. I became a puzzle to myself, asking my soul why it was so sad and why it hurt so much. But my soul didn’t know how to answer. When I told myself to hope in God, my soul didn’t listen, because my lost friend felt more real and better than the God I was supposed to trust. Only tears felt good, and they took my friend’s place in my heart.

But now, Lord, those days are over and time has healed my pain.

Let me learn from you, who are Truth. I want to listen closely so you can tell me why tears feel so good to someone who’s unhappy. Have you, who are everywhere, stopped caring about our pain? You stay the same while we face trial after trial. But if we didn’t cry to you, we would have no hope left. How can something sweet come from all the sadness, groans, tears, and sorrow? Is it because we hope you hear us? That’s true for prayer, because prayer means we want to be close to you. But is it also true for grief, like the sadness I felt then? I didn’t hope he would come back to life, and my tears weren’t for that. I just cried because I was miserable and had lost my happiness. Or is crying just a painful thing that feels good because we hate the bad stuff?
