Why do I even talk about these things now? This isn’t the time to ask questions but to be honest with you. I felt awful. Anyone who depends on friendships with mortal people feels awful too—when they lose those friends, it hurts so much, and then they realize they were unhappy even before losing them. That’s how I felt back then. I cried a lot and found some comfort in being sad. I was miserable, but even so, I cared more about my own life than my friend. I wanted to change my life, but I didn’t want to lose it more than I wanted to lose him. I’m not sure I would have given up my life for him, even though stories say friends like Orestes and Pylades would die for each other because loving each other was more important than living. But my feelings were different—I was tired of living and scared of dying. The more I loved him, the more I hated and feared death, which had taken him away. I even thought death might suddenly kill everyone, since it had that power over him. That’s how I remember feeling.

Look into my heart, God! See deep inside me, because I remember it clearly. You, my Hope, who cleans me from these bad feelings, helped me look toward you and pulled me out of this trap. I was amazed that other people kept living when the one I loved like he would never die was gone. I was even more amazed that I, who felt like his other half, could keep living without him. Someone once said a true friend is like “half of your soul”—I felt like my soul and his were one soul in two bodies. So life was terrifying to me because I didn’t want to live as just half a person. Maybe I was also afraid to die, because then he would be completely gone, and I loved him so much.

Oh, how crazy it is to not know how to love people the right way! How foolish I was back then, struggling so much with the hard parts of life!

I worried, sighed, cried, and tortured myself without rest or advice, carrying my broken and hurting soul around. It was tired of being dragged along, but I couldn’t find a place to set it down. Not in beautiful forests, fun or music, sweet-smelling places, fancy parties, or even in the pleasures of bed or rest. Not even books or poems made me feel better. Everything seemed dark, even the light itself. Anything that wasn’t like him felt ugly and hateful, except for my own crying and groaning—that was the only thing that gave me a little peace. But when I stopped crying, a heavy sadness crushed me. I knew I should have given that sadness to you, Lord, so you could lift it and lighten it. I knew this, but I didn’t want to or couldn’t do it—especially because when I thought about you, you didn’t feel real but just like an empty idea. So my mistake was making that empty idea my god. Whenever I tried to give my sadness to that idea to find rest, it just fell through and hit me even harder.
