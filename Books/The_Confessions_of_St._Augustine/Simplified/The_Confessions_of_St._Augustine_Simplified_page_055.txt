People who are tired and lost will have their tears gently wiped away. They cry even more and find joy in their crying because you, Lord, are not just a regular person. You are the Lord who can make things new again and comfort them.

Where was I when I was looking for you? You were always there, even before me. But I had wandered away, even from myself, so I couldn’t find myself or you.

Now, let me honestly share with God what happened when I was twenty-nine years old.

A man named Faustus, a bishop of the Manicheans, came to Carthage. He was a big trap set by the devil, and many people got caught by his smooth talking. Even though I thought his speaking was impressive, I wanted to find out the real truth behind his words.

Faustus was famous for being smart and skilled in many important studies. I had already read many things from philosophers and started comparing their ideas with the strange stories told by the Manicheans. It seemed to me that the philosophers made more sense because they could understand the world better, even if they didn’t know the true Lord who made everything.

You, Lord, are great and care about humble people, but you stay away from proud ones. You only come close to those who are truly sorry and humble in their hearts. The proud cannot find you, even if they are super smart and can study the stars and planets.

People use the mind and intelligence you gave them to learn about these things. They have discovered a lot, even predicting when the sun and moon will be eclipsed, sometimes years before it happens. Their predictions are right, and they wrote down rules so others can know when eclipses will happen in the future.

People who don’t understand this get amazed, and those who do feel proud. But both groups, because of their pride, turn away from you and stop following your light. They can predict an eclipse of the sun but don’t see their own pride and problems happening right now.

They don’t ask, like faithful people should, where their knowledge comes from. Even when they realize you made them, they don’t give themselves to you to be cared for. They don’t offer themselves to you like a sacrifice. They don’t kill their own pride or stop chasing after curiosity and wild thoughts, like animals wandering in the sea or on land.

Because of this, you, Lord, a powerful fire, could burn up their pride and wrong ways.
