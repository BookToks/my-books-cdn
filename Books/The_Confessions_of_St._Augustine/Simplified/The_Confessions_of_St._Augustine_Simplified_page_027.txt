My belly stuck out because I was so fat!

The law says stealing is wrong, God, and so does the feeling inside people’s hearts. Even the worst criminals don’t like it when someone steals from them. Rich thieves don’t accept poor thieves stealing just because they’re poor. But I wanted to steal anyway, not because I was hungry or poor, but because I didn’t care about doing right and I wanted to do something wrong. I took something I already had plenty of, and better quality too. I didn’t want to enjoy what I stole, I just wanted to steal and do something bad.

Near our vineyard, there was a pear tree full of fruit, but it didn’t look or taste very good. One night—after staying out late playing in the streets like we often did—a group of bad kids, including me, shook the tree and took a bunch of pears. We didn’t take them to eat, but to throw them to the pigs, only tasting a few ourselves. We liked this even more because it was forbidden. That was how my heart was, God, and you still felt sorry for me even then. Now I want to tell you honestly why I did this wrong thing when I had no reason except the pleasure of doing bad. It was disgusting, and I loved it. I loved ruining myself. I loved making mistakes—not the reasons behind them, but the mistakes themselves. I was lost, turning away from your safety to destroy myself, wanting nothing from the shameful act except the shame.

There is beauty in every good-looking body, and in gold, silver, and other things. Touch feels nice, and all our senses enjoy different things. Being respected and having power is also something special, and from these comes the wish to get back at others. But when we want these pleasures, we shouldn’t leave you, God, or break your rules. Life here is attractive because it has its own kind of beauty and matches these smaller values. Friendship is sweet and connects many people. But because of these things, people sin—they want these smaller, less important things too much and forget about the better, higher good—you, God, and your truth and law. These smaller things are fun, but they’re nothing compared to you, who made everything. The good people find joy in you, and you are the true happiness for those who are honest.

So when we ask why someone did a crime, we don’t believe an answer unless it shows they wanted these smaller things or were scared of losing them. These things are beautiful and nice, but compared to the higher, heavenly goods, they are worthless and unimportant. If a man killed another man, why? Maybe he wanted the other man’s wife or things, or stole to survive. Or maybe he was scared of losing something, or wanted revenge after being hurt. Would anyone kill without a reason?
