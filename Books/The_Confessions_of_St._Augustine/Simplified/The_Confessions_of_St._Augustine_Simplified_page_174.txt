People couldn’t see the earth at first because it didn’t have any shape or form. 

There was a huge, deep space above it with no light at all. It was completely dark because there was no light to shine anywhere. If there had been light, it would have been everywhere, lighting up everything. So the darkness was there just because the light wasn’t there yet. It’s like how there is silence when there’s no sound. 

God, you taught me that before you made everything, there was nothing – no color, no shape, no body, and no spirit. But it wasn’t exactly nothing; it was just formless, without any shape.

What should we call this formless stuff so people who don’t think deeply can understand? The closest thing to formlessness we know is the earth and the deep ocean, because they are at the lowest level and not as bright or beautiful as the higher parts of the world that shine and glow.

So, it’s okay to call this shapeless matter “the invisible and unformed earth,” since that’s what it was before being made into the shaped world we see.

When we try to imagine this formless matter, we realize it’s not like a clear idea such as life or justice, because it’s just the stuff that makes up bodies. It’s not something you can see or feel yet. Our minds might get confused, trying to understand something that can’t be understood.

But, Lord, if I’m going to tell everyone what you have taught me about this formless matter, I have to admit that when I first heard about it, I didn’t understand it. And I think others didn’t either.
