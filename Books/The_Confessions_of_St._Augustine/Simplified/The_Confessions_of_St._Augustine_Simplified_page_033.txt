6. Back then, I was studying things that people thought were important and respectable. I wanted to be really good at law, and the cleverer I was, the more people would admire me. People are so blind sometimes that they even brag about being blind. By that time, I had become really skilled in speaking and arguing, and I was proud and full of myself. But I was still calm, God, as you know, and I didn’t join in with the troublemakers called “The Wreckers.” This silly and bad nickname was actually something they were proud of. I lived around them and felt a bit embarrassed that I wasn’t like them. Sometimes I liked being their friend, even though I hated what they did—making fun of strangers and being mean just for fun. They acted almost like devils. So calling them “wreckers” fit perfectly because they were wrecked themselves and all mixed up inside. They were secretly laughed at and tricked by evil spirits while they made fun of others.

7. During this confusing time in my life, I studied books about speaking well because I wanted to be famous for it, even though my reasons were selfish and vain. While studying, I found a book by Cicero that many people liked for its style, though they didn’t like his character. This book, called Hortensius, encouraged people to love philosophy. It completely changed how I thought and made me pray to you, God. It gave me new hope and new goals. Suddenly, all my selfish dreams felt meaningless, and with a strong feeling in my heart, I wanted to be wise forever and started moving back toward you. I didn’t want to get better at arguing anymore. I was nineteen then; my father had died two years before, and my mother was paying for my studies. What touched me about this book was not how it was written but what it said.

8. How eager I was then, God, to leave behind worldly things and come to you! I didn’t realize yet how you were working on me. You are the source of all wisdom. The Greek word for love of wisdom is “philosophy,” and this book made me want it badly. But some people use philosophy in a tricky way, hiding their mistakes under a fancy name. Cicero’s book even points out many of these people from his time and before. It also includes a warning from your Spirit, spoken by your faithful servant: “Be careful that no one fools you with philosophy and empty lies, following human ideas and the world’s rules, not Christ. In Christ, all the fullness of God lives.”
