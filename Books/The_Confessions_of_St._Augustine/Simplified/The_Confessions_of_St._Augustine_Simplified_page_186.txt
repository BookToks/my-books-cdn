These words can be understood in different ways. But who can say for sure which one is the only true meaning Moses had in mind? Who can confidently say that Moses thought exactly this or that when he wrote the story, just like we confidently say something is true? I pray to you, my God, because I am your servant, and I promised to offer this book as a confession to you. Please help me keep my promise with your mercy.

Now, can I say for sure that Moses only meant one thing—my interpretation—when he wrote, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,” just like I am sure that you created everything, both seen and unseen? No, I can’t say that. I don’t know for sure what Moses was thinking. Maybe he meant the very start of creation when he said “In the beginning.” Maybe by “heaven and earth” he meant things that were just beginning and not yet formed. Either way could be true. But I don’t clearly know which meaning Moses really intended. Still, I have no doubt that whatever he meant, it was true and he said it well.

Don’t bother me by saying, “Moses didn’t mean what you say, but what I say.” If someone asks me, “How do you know Moses meant your idea?” I will answer calmly, just like I already have, or explain more if they don’t understand. But if they say, “Moses didn’t mean what you say, but what I say,” and don’t even deny that both ideas could be true, then, God, please help me stay patient with people who act this way! It’s not because they are holy or have special insight, but because they are proud and only care about their own ideas—not because those ideas are true, but because they belong to them. If they truly loved the truth, they could also love another true opinion, just like I respect what they say when it is true—not because it belongs to them, but because it is true. Truth belongs to everyone who loves it, not just to one person.

But I don’t accept it when people say Moses didn’t mean what I say, but what they say, without proof. This kind of attitude is not from knowing the truth, but from arrogance. It comes from vanity, not understanding.

So, Lord, your judgments should be respected because your truth doesn’t belong to me or to anyone else alone. It belongs to all of us whom you have invited to share it. You warned us not to treat your truth as our own special property, because if we do, we lose it. If someone tries to take what belongs to everyone and keep it only for themselves, they move away from what is shared and true.
