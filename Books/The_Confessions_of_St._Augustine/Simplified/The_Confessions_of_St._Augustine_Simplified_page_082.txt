So, I kept searching quietly, feeling sure now that what the Manicheans said—and I really disliked them—couldn't be true. I realized that when they asked where evil comes from, their answer was based on a proud idea. They would rather say that your nature can suffer evil than admit their own nature can cause evil.

I tried to understand what I was told: that free will makes us do evil, and your fair judgment makes us suffer the results. But I didn’t understand it clearly. I kept trying to think about it, but often I got confused again and again. One thing helped me move toward your light: I knew I had a will, just like I knew I was alive. When I wanted or didn’t want to do something, I was sure it was me who wanted or didn’t want it—and right there, I saw the cause of my sin. I understood that when I did something against my will, I was suffering, not doing wrong; I didn’t see those as faults but as punishments. I could admit I wasn’t unfairly punished because I believed you are most fair. But then I wondered, who put this in me? Who planted this bitterness, if I was made by my loving God? If the devil is to blame, who made the devil? And if he was an angel who became bad by his own choice, how did that bad choice get in him, since a good Creator made him a good angel? Thinking about these things confused me again. But I never thought that you suffer evil—only that people do it.

In my struggle to solve the rest of my problems, I decided to accept as true that what can’t be destroyed is better than what can, and I agreed that you, whatever you are, can’t be destroyed.

No soul has ever imagined anything better than you, the highest and best good. Since what can’t be destroyed is better than what can, I realized I couldn’t think of anything better than my God if you weren’t unchanging. So, I knew where to look for you and where to find the source of evil: in the corruption that can’t touch your being. It’s clear that corruption can’t harm our God—not by choice, necessity, or surprise—because you are God, and what you want is good, and you are that good. But being corrupted is not good.

You’re not forced to do anything you don’t want, because your will and power are the same—you can’t want more than you can do. If your will were greater than your power, then you’d be greater than yourself—which is impossible because your will and power are you. Nothing can surprise you since you know everything, and you understand all kinds of nature.

What else can we say about why God’s being can’t be corrupted? Because if it could, it wouldn’t be God.
