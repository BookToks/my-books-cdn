You have made it strong forever and ever; you have given it a rule that can never be changed. But it is not as old as you, God, because it had a beginning—it was created.

Even though we can’t find a time before it (because wisdom was created before everything else), this is not the same Wisdom that is equal and always existed with you, our God, the Father. That Wisdom is the one through whom everything was made, the one in whom you created the heaven and earth at the very start.

This is the created Wisdom, which means it is the smart and understanding nature that, when it thinks about light, becomes light. It is still called wisdom, but it was made. The difference between the Light that gives light and the light that is given is as big as the difference between the Wisdom that made everything and the wisdom that was made. The same goes for the difference between the Righteousness that makes things right and the righteousness we get from being made right. We are even called God’s righteousness because someone said, “That we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”

So, there is a kind of created wisdom that came before everything else: the clear and smart mind of your pure city. It is our mother, who is above and free, and “eternal in the heavens”—but what heavens except those that praise you, the “heaven of heavens”? This “heaven of heavens” belongs to the Lord. Even though we don’t see a time before it, since what was made first also came before time itself.

Still, the Creator’s eternity is before it, and it came from him as something created, but not in time (because time didn’t exist yet), even though time is part of its created nature.

That’s how the smart heaven came from you, our God, but it is very different from you; it is not the same being. We find that time didn’t exist before it, and isn’t even inside it, so it can look at your face forever without looking away. It doesn’t change at all. But it can change if it wanted to become dark and cold, except it stays close to you with a special love and shines like it’s always noon.

Oh, house full of light and glory! “I have loved your beauty and the place where the glory of my Lord lives,” your maker and owner. When I wander, I want to sigh for you; I ask the one who made you to hold me in you too, since he made me as well. “I have gone lost like a lost sheep; but I hope my Shepherd, who built you, will carry me back to you.”

“What will you say to me now, those who don’t agree with me and believe Moses was God’s holy servant and that his books were the words of the Holy Spirit? Isn’t it in this ‘house of God’—not as old as God but ‘eternal in the heavens’ in its own way—that you foolishly look for change over time? You won’t find that here. It is above all space and time, and it stays close to God, who is always good.”

“Yes, that’s true,” they say. “Then what about the things my heart told my God when it heard his praise inside me? What do you say is wrong with them? Is it because matter was not yet formed, and since there was no form, there was no order?”
