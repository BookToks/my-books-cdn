He felt sad and disgusted with himself, and from that time on, he tried to live a more disciplined life. I told him about men who were married but still loved wisdom, pleased God, and stayed loyal to their friends. I wasn’t as strong as they were. I was caught up in my own desires and afraid to let go of them. So, I ignored the advice given to me, acting like the help I was offered only made my pain worse. Also, I used my words to trick my friend Alypius, trying to get him caught up in the same traps I was stuck in.

Alypius was surprised that I, someone he respected a lot, was so stuck in pleasure that I said I couldn’t live without it. When I explained that the quick, secret fun he had tried was nothing compared to the long-term habit I had, and that if you added marriage to it, he wouldn’t be surprised that I couldn’t quit, he started wanting to get married too. He wasn’t driven by desire but by curiosity. He wanted to understand what I thought was so necessary for life that without it, life felt like punishment to me.

Alypius, who wasn’t tied down, was amazed by my “slavery” to pleasure. His amazement made him want to try it himself, and he might have ended up trapped like me. He was ready to take big risks, even dangerous ones. We didn’t really think much about the responsibilities of marriage or raising kids. I was mostly stuck because I couldn’t stop chasing endless desire, while Alypius was about to get caught up just because he was curious. That’s how things were until God, who never forgets us, felt sorry for our misery and helped us in amazing, quiet ways.

People were trying hard to find me a wife. I dated, got engaged, and my mom worked really hard on it. She hoped that once I was married, I would be ready to be baptized and start fresh, which she saw was happening as my faith grew. She prayed every day, asking God to show her a sign about my future marriage, but God didn’t give her one. She had some strange and confusing dreams she thought might be about me, but she wasn’t sure because they didn’t feel like true messages from God. Still, the plans moved forward, and marriage proposals were made.
