15. “Turn us back again, O Lord God of Hosts, let your face shine on us; then we will be saved.” Wherever a person’s soul turns, if it’s not toward you, it gets stuck in sadness, even if it’s surrounded by beautiful things outside of you and outside itself. Beautiful things wouldn’t even exist unless they came from you.

These things come into being and then fade away. When they start, they grow toward being perfect. But once they are perfect, they start to get old and die. Even if some don’t get old, they all eventually disappear. So, the faster they grow, the faster they move toward disappearing. This is how things work. This is the fate you gave them because they are parts of the universe, which is made up of things that don’t all exist at once but come and go.

For example, when we speak, sounds happen one after another to make meaning. One word ends so the next can come. Let my soul praise you, God, who made everything; but don’t let my soul get stuck loving these things just because of my body’s senses. These things go where they are supposed to go, to stop existing. They cause the soul to suffer because it wants to exist but also wants to feel safe in the things it loves. But these things don’t offer a real place to rest. They don’t last.

They run away, and who can catch them with their senses? Or even hold onto them when they are here? Our senses are slow because they are physical and have limits. They are good for what they were made for but can’t keep things from changing from start to end. Your word, by which all was made, sets their limits: “From there—to here!”

16. Don’t be foolish, my soul, and don’t let your empty worries block your heart’s hearing. Pay attention. The Word calls you to come back, and with him is a calm place where love never leaves unless it’s left first.

Look, these things pass away so new things can come. Even this physical world can be complete in all its parts. “But do I ever pass away?” asks the Word of God. Make your home in him. My soul, give him everything you have. At last, you are tired of being tricked.

Give back to truth whatever you have gotten from it, and you won’t lose anything. What’s broken will grow again; your sicknesses will be healed; your weak parts will be fixed and made whole again inside you.

And these things that don’t last won’t take you down with them when they disappear, but you will stand with them before God, who lasts forever.

17. So why, my stubborn soul, do you keep following your body? Instead, let your body change to follow you. What you feel through it is only part of the whole.

You don’t know the whole thing; your feelings are just pieces, but you like those pieces. If your senses could understand the whole—and weren’t punished by only getting a small part—you would want the things now to pass away so the whole could make you happier. Because what we say,
