Right now, everything we see and experience is happening in the present.

CHAPTER XIX  
25. So, O Ruler of everything, how do you teach souls about things that haven’t happened yet? You have taught your prophets, but how can you, who already know everything, teach about the future? Or do you actually teach about the present by showing signs of what’s coming? Because you can’t teach something that doesn’t exist yet. This idea is too hard for me to understand; it’s too big, and I can’t reach it. But I hope you’ll help me understand when you want to, O bright Light of my hidden eyes.

CHAPTER XX  
26. Even now, it’s clear that there’s no real future or past. So, it’s not really true that there are three times: past, present, and future. Maybe it’s better to say there are three “presents”: the present of past things, the present of things happening now, and the present of future things. These three kinds of time happen inside us, because otherwise, we couldn’t think about them. The present of past things is memory; the present of current things is what we’re experiencing now; and the present of future things is what we expect. If we talk this way, I agree there are three kinds of time. So, let people say “past, present, and future” if they want, but only if they understand that the past and future don’t actually exist right now. There are only a few things we talk about exactly right, and many things we talk about in a loose way, but we still understand each other.

CHAPTER XXI  
27. I said that we measure time as it passes, so we can say one period is twice as long as another or that two periods are the same length.

So, as I said, we measure time while it’s happening. If someone asks me how I know this, I can say, “Because we measure it.” We can’t measure things that don’t exist, and the past and future don’t exist right now. But how do we measure the present if it has no length? We measure it as it passes, but after it passes, there’s nothing left to measure. Where does it come from, where does it go, and how does it pass while we measure it? It comes from the future, moves through the present, and goes into the past. So, it moves from what doesn’t exist yet, through what has no length, into what no longer exists. But what exactly do we measure if not some amount of time? We can only talk about time being single, double, or equal if we mean the length of time. So, what length do we measure when time passes? Is it in the future, where it’s coming from? But we can’t measure what doesn’t exist yet. Or is it in the present, where it passes? But...
