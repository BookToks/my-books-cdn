I had been tricked by the Manicheans’ promises that everything was certain, but I acted like I knew many things were uncertain when really I thought they were true. Later, I realized those ideas were wrong. Still, I was sure they were uncertain, and because of that, I unfairly criticized the Catholic Church. I hadn’t yet found out that the Church taught the truth, but I did learn it wasn’t teaching the things I had angrily accused it of. In this way, I was surprised and changed my mind. I was happy, God, that the Church—your Son’s body, where I was baptized as a baby—didn’t care about silly ideas and didn’t teach anything that would try to put you, the Creator of everything, inside a limited space, like a human body has limits.

I was also glad that the old Scriptures, the Law and the Prophets, were shown to me again. Now, I read them without thinking they were silly or wrong like I used to when I judged your holy people for believing in them. I listened happily to Ambrose’s sermons, where he told people often that “The letter kills, but the spirit gives life.” He explained the deeper meaning behind the words that seemed wrong if taken literally. I didn’t find anything in what he said that upset me, but I still wasn’t sure if what he taught was true. During this time, I held back my feelings, afraid I might believe something wrong. Because of this, I felt stuck and helpless. I wanted to be as sure about things I couldn’t see as I was that seven plus three equals ten. I wasn’t crazy to think this was possible, but I just wanted to understand things clearly, whether they were physical things I couldn’t see or spiritual things I only imagined in physical ways.

If I could have believed, I might have been healed, and my soul could have been guided toward your truth, which never changes or fails. But it’s like when a person who had a bad doctor is afraid to trust a good one. My soul’s health couldn’t get better unless I believed. But because I didn’t want to believe lies, I refused to be healed and resisted your help. You had prepared faith like medicine for everyone’s sickness, and it was very powerful.

Still, from that time on, I started to like Catholic teachings more. I felt they honestly and reasonably asked people to believe things that couldn’t be proven—whether they could be proven but not to everyone or couldn’t be proven at all. This was much better than the Manicheans’ way, which tricked people by promising knowledge and then made them believe many strange and unbelievable things because they couldn’t prove them. After that, Lord, little by little, you gently and kindly helped calm and guide my heart, convincing me that, if I thought about all the things I had never...
