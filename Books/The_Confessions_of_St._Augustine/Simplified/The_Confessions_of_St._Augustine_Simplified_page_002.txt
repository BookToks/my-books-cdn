He brought together and saved all the important ideas of Latin Christianity from early thinkers like Tertullian to Ambrose. He took the beliefs of Nicene Christianity and believed in the Chalcedonian faith even before the Council of Chalcedon. He mixed all these ideas into an unsystematic but clear picture that still shows what the Christian community in the Roman Empire thought and felt. More than that, he took the religious philosophy of the Greco-Roman world and gave it a new purpose to help explain and defend Christian beliefs. But even though he gathered many traditions, he wasn’t just picking ideas randomly. The center of his thinking was the Holy Scriptures, which deeply influenced his heart and mind. Augustine always found the most important religious authority in the Bible.

At the same time, this very thoughtful and careful person changed the old traditions into a new form that shaped European Christianity for a long time. He didn’t care much about exact historical facts, but he developed the first big “philosophy of history.” Augustine saw himself more as someone who collected ideas than someone who created new ones. He wasn’t trying to reform the Church but to protect its faith. His main goal was to save Christianity from false teachings and attacks by non-Christians, and above all, to renew and honor the message of how humans need God’s grace. But what he didn’t expect was that his work would influence the Church’s beliefs and devotion for over a thousand years. In the Middle Ages, you can see Augustine’s influence everywhere—even thinkers like Aquinas were more influenced by Augustine than by Aristotle. During the Protestant Reformation, people used Augustine’s ideas to criticize the problems in popular Catholicism, but even those problems were connected to parts of Augustine’s thoughts and life. Today, Augustine’s influence is still very strong in important new theological movements.

It’s hard to describe Augustine simply because his ideas are very complicated and his way of explaining things often wanders. Also, throughout his life, he had many strong feelings and biases. His ideas about God combined the Plotinian idea of one divine unity with the Bible’s idea of a powerful God who is active in creation and saving people. Even though he loved Jesus Christ, his theology wasn’t fully focused on Christ, and this shows up in how he thought Christians should live. He didn’t create the ideas of original sin and passing guilt from parents to children, but he made them key parts of his system. He connected these ideas to infant baptism, which was believed to wash away original sin and guilt just by the act itself. He always praised God’s mercy and grace but also believed most people would be rightly condemned to a terrible punishment. He never denied that people have free will and responsibility before God, but he strongly believed in double predestination and that God’s grace cannot be resisted.

Because of all this, the Catholic Church was right to give Augustine the title “Doctor of Grace.” The main theme in all his writings is God’s power and grace.
