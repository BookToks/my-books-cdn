The sense of touch says, “If something didn’t have a body I could feel, then I didn’t touch it, and if I never touched it, I didn’t have any information about it.” But how did these things get into my memory? I don’t know. When I first learned them, I didn’t believe them just because someone else said so; I understood them myself. I saw they were true, kept them in my mind, and saved them so I could remember them whenever I wanted. So, they were there even before I learned them, but not in my memory. Where were they then? How could I agree that they were true when someone talked about them, unless they were already hidden somewhere deep in my memory? Maybe I wouldn’t have thought of them at all if someone hadn’t helped me bring them out.

  
When we learn things that we don’t see or touch but understand inside ourselves, it’s really just gathering those ideas that were already in our memory but mixed up and unclear. By paying close attention, we put them together properly. Before, these ideas were hidden, scattered, or ignored, but now they come easily to our minds because we know them better.

  
My memory has stored many things like this, which I’ve already discovered and saved for easy use. These are the things we say we’ve learned and know. But if I stop thinking about them for a while, they sink back down and hide deep in my memory again. Then I have to pull them out and collect them again to remember them. This process of gathering thoughts is what we call “cogitate.” The word comes from Latin words meaning “to collect” or “to do often.” But “cogitate” means only gathering thoughts in the mind, not just collecting things anywhere.

  
My memory also holds the basic ideas and countless rules about numbers and shapes. None of this comes from what I can sense with my body, because numbers and shapes don’t have colors, sounds, tastes, or textures. I have heard words used to talk about these things, but the sounds are just sounds—they’re different in Greek and Latin—but the real things aren’t part of any language. I’ve seen the thin lines made by craftsmen, but mathematical lines are different. They aren’t pictures of what my eyes see. People who understand these things don’t think about physical objects; they understand them inside their minds. I have seen the numbers we use for counting, but those numbers aren’t the same as the things they represent. They just exist on their own. If someone doesn’t believe me and makes fun of what I say, I will feel sorry for them while they laugh.
