We don’t have time to read. Where can I find the books? How can I get them? Who can I borrow them from? Let me make a schedule and save some time each day to take care of my soul. I feel hopeful because the Catholic faith isn’t what I thought it was, and I was wrong to blame it. Its teachers say it’s terrible to believe that God is limited by a human body. Shouldn’t I try harder to understand more? My students take up my mornings; what am I doing the rest of the day? Why don’t I use that time better? But then, when will I visit my powerful friends whose help I need? When will I prepare the speeches I sell to my class? When will I rest and relax my mind after working so hard?

Forget everything else and stop wasting time on unimportant things. Let me focus only on finding the truth. Life now is unhappy, and death is uncertain. If death comes suddenly, what state will I be in? Where will I learn what I ignored here? Shouldn’t I suffer for ignoring these things now? But what if death ends all feeling and care? That needs to be studied too. I hope not. The Christian faith has spread everywhere for a reason, and God wouldn’t have done great things for us if the soul died with the body. So why do I keep hoping for things in this world instead of fully seeking God and true happiness?

But wait. Life now is also enjoyable and sweet in its own way. I shouldn’t give it up easily because it would be embarrassing to go back to it after leaving it. Right now, it’s important to gain respect. What else do I want? I have many powerful friends. If I push hard, I might get a government job and marry a rich woman who won’t cost me much. That would be my dream.

Many great men, who are worth copying, have combined looking for wisdom with being married. While I thought about these things and my feelings went back and forth, time kept passing. I kept delaying turning to the Lord and putting my life in Him, but I couldn’t stop dying little by little inside. I wanted a happy life but was afraid to find it where it really is, so I ran away from it while trying to find it. I worried I’d be miserable without a woman’s love, and I never thought about the help God offers to heal that need, because I never tried it. I thought self-control was about my own strength, but I had no strength. Foolishly, I didn’t know what is written: “No one can be self-controlled unless you give it.” Surely God would have helped me if I had prayed sincerely and trusted Him completely.

Actually, Alypius stopped me from marrying. He said if I did, we couldn’t live together or have the free time we wanted to love wisdom fully. He was very pure, which was amazing because when he was young he had been wild but stopped. Instead, he chose a better path.
