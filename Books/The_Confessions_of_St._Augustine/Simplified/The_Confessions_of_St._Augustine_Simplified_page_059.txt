Their books were full of long stories about the sky, stars, sun, and moon. I had stopped believing that he could really show me what I wanted to know: whether the ideas in the Manichean books were better or at least as good as the math explanations I had read elsewhere. When I suggested we talk about these topics, he humbly said he didn’t dare to try, because he knew he didn’t understand them and wasn’t ashamed to admit it. He wasn’t like those talkative people who promised to teach me but then said nothing.

Faustus had a heart that wasn’t completely honest toward you, but at least he was honest with himself. He knew what he didn’t know and didn’t want to get stuck in arguments he couldn’t win or leave without looking bad. I liked him more for that. Being modest about what you don’t know is better than just having the knowledge I wanted, and that’s how he acted with all the hard questions.

Because of this, my excitement about the Manichean system slowed down, and I lost more hope in their other teachers. Faustus, who was very famous among them, didn’t do well with the questions that confused me. So I started spending time with him studying his favorite subject: literature. I was already teaching a class in rhetoric to young students in Carthage. With Faustus, I read whatever he wanted or what I thought suited his mind. But all my efforts to learn more about Manicheism stopped after meeting him. I didn’t completely leave them, but since I hadn’t found anything better, I decided to stick with what I had for now, until something better came along.

So Faustus, who had unknowingly trapped many people, now helped me get free from the trap I was caught in.

God’s hand didn’t abandon my soul. Because of my mother’s tears and prayers day and night, a sacrifice was made for me. You, God, worked in wonderful ways. You were the one who guided me, because “the steps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and he shall choose his way.” How can we be saved without your hand fixing what it already made?

You worked in me so that I agreed to go to Rome and teach there what I had been teaching in Carthage. I won’t hide how this happened because it shows your deep wisdom and mercy toward us.

I didn’t want to go to Rome just for the higher pay or the better status my friends promised me—though these things did influence me a bit.

My main reason was that I heard the students there studied more quietly and were better controlled by strict discipline, so they didn’t rush into the classroom wildly or disrespectfully.
