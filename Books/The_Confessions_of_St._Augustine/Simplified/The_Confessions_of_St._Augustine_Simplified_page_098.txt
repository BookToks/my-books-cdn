Victorinus, who had once been proud and worshiped the gods that Rome conquered, didn’t feel embarrassed to become a follower of Christ. He became like a baby at baptism, humble and ready to accept the cross.

O Lord, who bent the heavens and touched the mountains making them smoke, how did you enter his heart? Victorinus read the Holy Scriptures carefully, as his friend Simplicianus said, and studied all Christian writings. He told Simplicianus secretly, “You should know I am a Christian.” But Simplicianus replied, “I won’t believe it or call you a Christian until I see you at church.” Victorinus joked, “Are the church walls what make someone a Christian?” He kept saying he was a Christian, and Simplicianus kept saying he needed to show it. Victorinus was afraid of upsetting his pagan friends, proud idol worshipers, like tall cedar trees that hadn’t been knocked down yet. He feared they would turn against him.

But Victorinus grew stronger by reading and learning. He began to worry that Christ would deny him if he was too scared to admit his faith in front of others. He felt guilty for being ashamed of the humble Christian sacraments while not ashamed to join the proud idol worshipers and their rituals. So, he became brave against fake pride and shy toward the truth. Suddenly, he told Simplicianus, “Let’s go to church; I want to become a Christian.” Simplicianus was so happy he could hardly hold it in. Victorinus started learning the Christian teachings and soon asked to be baptized. Rome was amazed, and the Church was happy. The proud idol worshipers were angry and jealous, but Victorinus trusted God and ignored their nonsense.

When it was time for Victorinus to publicly say he believed in Christ—in front of everyone at church, using special words he had memorized—the priests offered to let him do it quietly if he was shy. But Victorinus wanted to say it in front of everyone. He had never been afraid to speak his own ideas in front of crowds, so why be scared to say he believed in God before the church family?

When he stepped up to speak, everyone recognized him and whispered his name excitedly. Who didn’t know him? The crowd was so happy to see him that they quieted down to listen. Victorinus boldly said the true faith, and everyone wanted to welcome him into their hearts. They accepted him with love and joy.
