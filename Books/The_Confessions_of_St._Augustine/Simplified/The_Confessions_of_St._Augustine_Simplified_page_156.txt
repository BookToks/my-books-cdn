3. God, please listen to my prayer and show kindness to my deep wishes. My heart doesn’t just want things for itself; it also wants to help others with love.

You know this is true. Let me use my mind and words to serve you, and give me something I can give back to you. I am poor and need help, but you are rich and care for everyone who asks. Please help me avoid saying things that are wrong or untrue. Let your words be pure joy for me. Don’t let me be tricked by them or trick others. God, please listen and have mercy! You are the light for those who can’t see and the strength for those who feel weak. Please hear my soul’s cry deep inside. If you don’t listen to us there, where else can we go? Who else can we call?

“You own the day and the night.” Time passes as you allow. Please give me time to think about the secret meanings in your law, and don’t close the door when I ask to learn. You didn’t write these deep secrets for no reason. Like animals hidden in the forest, they quietly move and rest and think. Make me better, God, and show me these secrets. Your voice brings me joy and more happiness than anything else. Give me what I love, because loving it is also your gift. Don’t forget your gifts or ignore this “grass” that thirsts for you. Let me tell you everything I find in your books, and let me hear your praises. Let me learn wonderful things from your law, from the moment you made the world until your holy city lasts forever.

4. God, have mercy on me and hear my request. I’m not praying for things like gold, silver, fancy clothes, power, fun, or even basic needs in this life. Those things come later to those who seek your Kingdom and what’s right. Look, God, at where my true desire comes from. Bad people have told me about fun things, but not like the joy in your law. This is what I really want. Please, Father, see and approve! Let it please you that I find favor with you and that the secrets in your Word open to me when I ask. I ask this through Jesus Christ, your Son, who stands by your side. He is the one who made peace between you and us. He looked for us even when we weren’t looking for you, so we could find you. He is the Word through whom you made everything, including me. He is your only Son, who calls faithful people like me to be your children. I ask this through him, who prays for us and holds all wisdom and knowledge. He is who I seek in your books.
