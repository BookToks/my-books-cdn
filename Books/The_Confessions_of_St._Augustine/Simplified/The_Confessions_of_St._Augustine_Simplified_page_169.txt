“It is God who made us, not we ourselves.” Pay attention to where the truth starts to become clear.

Imagine a voice starts to sound and keeps going—on and on—and then stops. Now there is silence. Before the voice started, it was in the future and couldn’t be measured because it wasn’t happening yet. Now that it’s stopped, it can’t be measured because it’s gone. So, while it was sounding, it could be measured because it existed then. But even while sounding, it didn’t stay still; it was moving and passing away. Could it be measured more easily just because it was passing? The time it took while passing could be measured, since the present moment has no length.

Now, if it could be measured, imagine another voice starts right after and keeps going without stopping. We can only measure it while it’s sounding because when it stops, it’s already gone and can’t be measured. Let’s measure it exactly and say how long it is. But we can only measure the time from when it started to when it stopped. We measure time by looking at a beginning and an end. That’s why a voice still sounding can’t be measured yet to say how long it will last or compare it to another voice. When it ends, it’s gone. How can we measure that? Yet, we do measure time—not the future, not the past, not the present moment, or time passing, but still, we measure time.

The phrase “Deus Creator omnium” has eight syllables that alternate between short and long. The first, third, fifth, and seventh syllables are short, and the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth are long. Each long syllable is twice as long as each short one. I know this because it makes sense and is easy to notice. But if a short syllable sounds first and then a long one, how can I hold the short one in my mind and use it to measure the long one when the long one doesn’t even start until after the short one ends? I can’t measure the long syllable while it’s sounding; I can only measure it after it ends, which means it’s already gone.

So, what exactly do I measure? Where is the short syllable I measure by? Where is the long one I measure? Both have already sounded, disappeared, and are no longer there. Still, I measure and say with confidence—if my ear is trained—that one syllable is short and the other is long. I couldn’t do this unless both had ended. So, I don’t measure them when they exist, because they don’t exist anymore.

But I measure something in my memory that stays fixed.

It is inside you, my mind, that I measure periods of time. Don’t argue that time exists outside of you; don’t get confused with that idea.
