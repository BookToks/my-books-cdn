I cried a lot during my prayers. But I was most deeply sad inside all day. I quietly asked you, as best as I could, to help me stop feeling so sad, but you didn’t. Now I think you were teaching me a lesson about how strong habits are, even in a mind that no longer believes in lies. Then I thought it might help to take a bath, because I had heard that the word for bath comes from a Greek word that means it can wash away worries from the mind. I have to admit this to you, “O Father of the fatherless”: I took a bath but still felt just as sad as before. My sadness didn’t leave my heart.

Then I fell asleep, and when I woke up, my sadness was a little less. As I lay in bed, I remembered some true words by Ambrose, because you really are, “God, creator of everything, ruler of the sky, who covers the day with beautiful light, and gives us peaceful sleep at night. Your kindness helps our tired bodies rest so we can work again, and eases the pain in our tired minds.” 

Slowly, memories of your servant came back to me: her faithful life toward you, her kindness and care for us, which had suddenly been taken away—and it made me feel better to cry in front of you, for her and for me. I let the tears flow that I had been holding back, using them like a pillow under my heart. My heart rested on them because your ears were close to me—not the ears of a person who might have made fun of my crying. Now, as I write this, I tell you honestly, O Lord! Anyone who reads this can say what they want. If someone thinks it was wrong to cry for my mother for a little while—that mother who seemed lost to me for a time, but who had cried for me so I might live in your eyes—let them not laugh at me. But if they have a kind heart, let them cry for the wrongs I have done against you, the Father of all the brothers and sisters of your Christ.
