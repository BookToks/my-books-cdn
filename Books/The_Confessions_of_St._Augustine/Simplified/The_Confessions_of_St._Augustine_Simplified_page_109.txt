All my doubts and worries completely disappeared.  

I closed the book and put my finger in it to mark the spot. Then, feeling calm, I started to tell Alypius everything. He also shared what he had been going through, which I didn’t know about.  

He wanted to see what I had read. I showed him, and he read even beyond where I stopped. I didn’t know what came next, but it said, “Accept those who are weak in faith.” He felt this applied to him and told me so. These words encouraged him, and because he was always stronger and better in this way than I was, he joined me in fully committing without any doubt.  

After that, we went to my mother and told her what happened. She was very happy.  

We explained everything to her, and she was so joyful she almost jumped for joy. She thanked God, who can do way more than we ask or imagine. She saw that God had given her more than she ever hoped for when she was sad and praying. God changed me so much that I didn’t want a wife or any other worldly things. Instead, I followed the path of faith that God had shown her in a dream about me years before. This made her sadness turn into a happiness bigger and better than she had ever dreamed of, even better than her old wish to have grandchildren from me.
