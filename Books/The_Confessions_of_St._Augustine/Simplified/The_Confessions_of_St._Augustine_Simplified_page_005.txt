Augustine was confused about religion because he believed that if God was real, God had to have a body with a shape and size, like a physical thing. He remembers how the “Platonists” helped him get past this idea and taught him about spiritual and non-physical reality. This helped him understand God in a new way. He honestly shares his experience of feeling deeply connected with the One, or God, in Book VII. The “Platonists” freed him from his wrong ideas, but he still struggled with his own weaknesses. Even though he wanted peace in the Christian faith, he kept holding on to his pride and desires.

In Book VIII, Augustine remembers stories that made him want to be like people who already had what he was searching for. First, there was Ambrose, who showed him the respect and power of Christian learning and the Bible. Then Simplicianus told him about Victorinus, a famous scholar who humbly became a Christian. After that, Ponticianus shared stories about Antony and how more people were choosing to live as monks. The story that affected Augustine the most was about two imperial police agents who suddenly left their old lives to become monks.

Augustine explains that these examples made his feelings really intense. His confusion was mostly gone; he had decided to value self-control, and he wanted the chaos inside him to stop. He wished he could be like those men who had found peace.

But his old habits were still strong, and he couldn’t fully commit to changing. Then, in a garden in Milan, something important happened—kind of like the story Ponticianus told about the garden at Treves. Augustine’s will was fighting itself. A small moment, hearing a child’s voice saying “Tolle, lege” (“Take up and read”), helped him decide. He quickly opened the Bible to Romans 13:13 and felt a new spirit in his heart.

After this big change, Augustine had one more important memory to face before understanding his life better. This was the death of his mother, which broke his strongest connection to the world. Book IX tells this story. The most important moment is the vision he had at Ostia, where he and his mother shared a powerful, joyful experience. This vision was like the one in Book VII but also different. After his mother’s death, Augustine, who had loved her deeply, went on alone, supported by a greater and wiser love.

We can see two parts in Augustine’s “conversion.” The first was breaking free from his control problems and pride that stopped him from fully committing to Christianity. The second was slowly learning about Christian faith and finally accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. The first part happened in the garden in Milan. The second part took longer and didn’t have a big moment. The writings Augustine made the year after his conversion show that he didn’t fully understand Christian theology yet. But by the time he became a church leader, he had a clear and solid understanding of Christian beliefs.
