I used to be a boy who couldn’t talk, but now I chat a lot. I remember learning to speak. My older family members didn’t just make me memorize words like they did my letters later on. When I couldn’t say everything I wanted using whines, grunts, and moving my arms and legs to show what I meant, I repeated sounds I had heard before. When people said a word and pointed to something, I saw it and understood that the thing was called by that word.

They also used body language, like faces, eye looks, hand movements, and tones, which everyone understands, to show what they wanted or didn’t want. By hearing words in different sentences a lot, I slowly figured out what the words meant. Then I learned to say those words myself, so I could tell others what I wanted. This way, I shared ideas with the people around me and got deeper into human life, always following what my parents and elders told me to do.

Oh God! I went through so much trouble and teasing when I was told I had to listen to my teachers if I wanted to do well in life and learn the ways of talking that would make people respect me and get me money. So, I was sent to school to learn things I didn’t understand the value of—poor me. If I was slow to learn, I got hit. This was seen as good by the people before us, and many had gone through the same thing, making it a tradition that added more pain and hard work to kids like me.

Around then, I saw men praying to you, God, and I started to think of you as a great Being who can hear us even though we can’t see you. So, as a boy, I began to pray to you for help and protection. I prayed hard that I wouldn’t get beaten at school. When you didn’t stop the beatings—because that would have let me stay foolish—my parents and elders treated the punishments like jokes, even though they hurt me a lot.

Is there anyone, God, with such strong faith who loves you so much that they don’t care about the punishments and torture people fear and pray to avoid? Can anyone look down on those who are scared of pain like my parents laughed at the punishments our teachers gave us? We were just as scared and prayed just as much to avoid pain. But even so, we sinned by not doing all our reading or writing or studying.

I didn’t lack memory or ability, God, because you gave me enough for my age. But my mind was filled with fun and play, and I was punished for that by people who did the same things themselves. When grown-ups waste time, it’s called work; when boys waste time, it’s punished by those same grown-ups. No one feels sorry for either boys or men. Does it make sense that I was punished for playing ball as a boy just because it stopped me from learning faster so I could, as a man, play even worse games?
