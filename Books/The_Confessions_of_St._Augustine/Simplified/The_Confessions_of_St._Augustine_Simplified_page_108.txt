He won’t hesitate, and you won’t fall. Trust him without fear, because he will catch you and heal you.” I blushed hard because I still heard those small distracting thoughts and felt stuck. Then, it seemed like she was telling me: “Block out those bad thoughts inside you, so they stop controlling you. They promise fun, but not in a way that’s right according to God.” The fight inside me was really just me battling myself. Alypius stayed close by, quietly waiting to see what would happen with my strong feelings.

 

CHAPTER XII

When I thought really hard about all the sadness deep inside me, it felt like a huge storm with a lot of tears. To cry fully, I quietly left Alypius because I felt like I needed to be alone to really let myself cry. I went far enough away so that even his being there wouldn’t hold me back. He understood how I felt. I think I said something before standing up because he noticed my voice was shaky from crying. So he stayed alone where we had been sitting, looking surprised. I dropped down under a fig tree—though I don’t know how—and let myself cry freely. My tears were like a gift to you. And, not in exact words but close to this, I prayed: “Lord, how long? How long? Will you be angry forever? Please don’t remember our past mistakes.” I felt trapped by those mistakes. I kept crying out: “How long? Tomorrow? Why not now? Why not this very moment end my mess?”  

I was saying this and crying with a broken heart when suddenly I heard a child’s voice from the nearby house, singing again and again, “Pick it up, read it; pick it up, read it.” I stopped crying right away and started thinking if kids usually sing something like that during a game, but I couldn’t remember hearing it before. Holding back my tears, I stood up because I felt this was a sign from God to open the Bible and read the first thing I saw. I had heard how Anthony, by chance hearing a Bible reading in church, felt like it was meant just for him: “Go sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come follow me.” That message changed his life right away.

So I quickly went back to where Alypius was sitting, because that’s where I had left the apostle’s book. I grabbed it, opened it, and read silently the first passage my eyes landed on: “Don’t be wild parties and drunkenness, don’t be immoral or jealous, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and don’t let your body control your desires.” I didn’t want to read more, and I didn’t need to. As soon as I finished reading, something like a bright light filled my heart.
