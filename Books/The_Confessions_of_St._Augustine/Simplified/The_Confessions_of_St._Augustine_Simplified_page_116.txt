I felt safe because I wasn’t worried about his childhood, youth, or whole life. We treated him like a friend our own age, learning and growing with us in your guidance. So, we were baptized, and all the worries about our past lives disappeared.

Back then, I could never get enough of thinking deeply about your plans to save people.

I cried freely while singing your hymns and songs. The sweet voices of the Church touched me deeply! The sounds filled my ears, and the truth filled my heart. My feelings overflowed, tears fell, and I was happy because of it all.

At that time, the church in Milan had just started a new way to comfort and lift up everyone by singing together with strong voices and full hearts. It had only been about a year since Justina, the mother of the young emperor Valentinian, had tried to hurt your servant Ambrose because of her wrong beliefs. The faithful people stayed in the church, ready to protect their bishop, your servant. My mother, your servant, was there too, praying and helping during those hard times. Even though we weren’t fully moved by your Spirit yet, the worried city made us feel excited and alert.

This was when the church began a new tradition, like the Eastern Church, of singing hymns and psalms so people wouldn’t get tired of being sad all the time. This tradition has lasted until now and has been copied by many churches around the world.

Then, through a vision, you showed your famous bishop where the bodies of Gervasius and Protasius, the martyrs, were hidden. You had kept their bodies safe and fresh for many years so they could be found at the right time to stop a queen’s anger. When the bodies were found and brought with honor to Ambrose’s church, many people troubled by evil spirits were healed. There was also a well-known man in the city who had been blind for many years. When he heard about the joyful crowd, he asked his guide to take him there. When he arrived, he asked to touch the saints’ coffin with his handkerchief. After doing this and putting it over his eyes, he could see again. Word about this spread everywhere, and your glory shone even brighter. Because of this, the angry queen’s mind was calmed and she stopped her harsh persecution, even though she didn’t fully believe.

Thank you, God. How have you helped me remember and tell you about these amazing things I had almost forgotten? Even though these things were wonderful, I didn’t follow you closely back then when your love was so strong. That’s why I cried even more bitterly.
