A disciple said that the “fruit” means doing everything in the name of a prophet, a good person, or a follower. Elijah was given food by a widow because she knew he was a man of God, so she helped him. But Elijah was also fed by a raven, which was more like a “gift.” This gift only helped Elijah’s body, not his spirit, which needed more than just food to survive.

Chapter 27: I will tell you the truth, Lord, so that people who don’t know much and those who don’t believe—who want to see big miracles to join the Church—can understand why your servants need help in this life. These people don’t really know why help is needed or what it’s for. Because of this, some don’t share their gifts with others, and others don’t appreciate gifts from those who don’t understand the “fruit.” The mind is fed and made happy by the “fruit.” Fish and whales don’t eat just any food from the earth when they live separated from the sea’s bitterness.

Chapter 28: God, you saw everything you made, and it was very good. We also see that all creation is very good. Each thing you made was good when you said, “Let it be,” and then it was made. You saw seven times that what you made was good, and the eighth time you saw everything together and said it was very good because it all fit perfectly. Each part alone was good, but together, they were even better. Just like a body made of many beautiful parts is more beautiful as a whole than any part by itself.

Chapter 29: I looked carefully to see if it was seven or eight times that you saw your works were good, but I realized that there was no real “time” in your seeing. I wondered how the Scripture could say you saw your work as good so many times if you don’t experience time like we do. I asked, “Lord, is your Scripture true since you are true? Why do you say there is no time in your seeing, but the Scripture talks about many times you saw your work was good?” You answered me, because you are my God and you speak clearly to me.
