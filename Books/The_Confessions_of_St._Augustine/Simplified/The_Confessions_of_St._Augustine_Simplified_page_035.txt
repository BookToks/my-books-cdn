Even your first work came before these material things you made, which are bright and heavenly. But I was hungry and thirsty—not for those first works, but for you, the Truth, who never changes or fades. Still, they gave me shiny, fake things instead. Honestly, it would have been better to love the sun itself, which is real to us, than those illusions that trick the mind through the eyes. But because I thought those illusions came from you, I believed in them—not eagerly, because you didn’t feel real to me then, and you weren’t those empty stories. They didn’t feed me; they made me tired. Food in dreams looks real, but it doesn’t actually nourish us because we’re asleep. The Manicheans’ fantasies were nothing like you when you talked to me. Their ideas were just made-up and false. Compared to them, the real bodies we see with our eyes—both in the sky and on earth—are much more real. Even animals can see these real bodies, and they are more sure than the pictures we make in our heads. And then we imagine even bigger, endless bodies that don’t exist at all, based on those pictures. I was fed with these empty shells, but I wasn’t truly fed.

But you, my Love, the one I longed for to be strong, you are not the bodies we see in heaven, nor the ones we don’t see. You made them all, but you don’t count them as your greatest works. So how far are you from those fake bodies I imagined, which don’t really exist? The pictures of real bodies are more sure than those fake ones. The real bodies are more sure than the pictures, but even those are not you. You’re not even the soul, which gives life to bodies; and the soul’s life is better than the body itself. But you are the life of souls, the life of life, living in yourself and never changing—oh, Life of my soul. Where were you, then, and how far from me? I was far away from you, stuck even with the useless husks that fed swine. How much better were the stories from poets and teachers than the traps of the Manicheans! Poems and verses, like the story of “the flying Medea,” were more useful than their ideas about “five elements” and “five caves of darkness” (which don’t exist, but trap anyone who believes in them). I could use poems and verses to feed my mind. I sang about “the flying Medea” but never believed it, while I did believe those other things.

Woe, woe, how I was dragged down to “the depths of hell”—working hard and angry because I lacked the truth, even when I was searching for you, my God!

Now I tell you this, because you showed me mercy before I even admitted it. I looked for you, but not in the right way, not with the thinking mind you gave me to be better than animals. I only followed my senses. But you were closer to me than the closest part of myself, and higher than my highest reach. Then I met that stubborn woman...
