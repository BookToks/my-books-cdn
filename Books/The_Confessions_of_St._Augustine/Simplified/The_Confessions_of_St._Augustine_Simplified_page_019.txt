People around me, also making mistakes, shouted: “Well done! Well done!” Friends in this world are like cheating against you; and “Well done! Well done!” is shouted until you feel embarrassed not to act tough like them. I didn’t cry for myself, but I did cry for Dido, who “chose to die by the sword,” while I was trying to be the worst of your creation, turning away from you; earth falling back to earth again. And if I wasn’t allowed to read these poems, I would have been sad that I couldn’t read what made me sad. People think this kind of crazy passion is better and more useful learning than the basic reading and writing I first learned.

But now, God, speak to my soul and let your truth tell me: “Not like that, not like that! That first learning was much better.” Because, honestly, I’d rather forget the adventures of Aeneas and stories like that than forget how to read and write.

Still, above the grammar school door, there’s a curtain. This curtain doesn’t hide a secret but hides mistakes. Let people shout against me—those I’m not scared of anymore—while I tell you, God, what my soul wants, and let me find peace. By admitting my bad choices, I might learn to love your holy ways. And don’t let those who buy and sell pretty books shout at me. If I ask them if it’s true, like the poet says, that Aeneas came to Carthage, uneducated people will say they don’t know and educated people will say it’s not true. But if I ask them how to spell Aeneas, everyone who learned will answer right, following what people agreed on. If I ask which would cause more problems if forgotten—reading and writing, or these made-up stories—who wouldn’t say reading and writing? I was wrong as a kid to prefer those useless stories instead of the useful stuff, or rather, to love one and hate the other. “One and one are two, two and two are four”: I hated hearing that. But the story of the wooden horse full of soldiers, the burning of Troy, and the ghost of Creusa were all fun but pointless shows!

So, why did I hate learning Greek, which had stories like that?

Because Homer was great at making up stories and was really fun; but when I was a kid, I didn’t like him at all. I think Virgil would feel the same to Greek kids if they had to learn him. Learning a foreign language was boring and spoiled the fun of Greek myths. I didn’t understand a word, but I was forced with threats and punishments to learn. When I was a baby, I didn’t know Latin either, but I learned it easily without fear or pain, just by listening to my nurses, people who smiled at me, and those who played with me. I learned all this without being forced; my heart wanted to learn its own way, and I could only do that by learning words—not from teachers but from people who talked to me, so I could say what I wanted. This shows that curiosity helps learning more than fear. But, by your rules, God, discipline is needed to stop too much freedom; it goes from the schoolmaster’s rod to the suffering of martyrs and mixes some bitterness that brings us back to you from the fake pleasures that first pulled us away.
