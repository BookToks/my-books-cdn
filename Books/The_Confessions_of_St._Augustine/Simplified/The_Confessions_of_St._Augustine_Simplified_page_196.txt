CHAPTER IX

But was it the Father or the Son who was “moving over the waters”? If we think of this as moving like a body moves through space, then even the Holy Spirit did not move. But if we understand that God is beyond change and above everything that changes, then Father, Son, and Holy Spirit all “moved over the waters.”

So why is it only said about your Spirit? Why does it say your Spirit was in a “place” that isn’t really a place, and that “He is your gift”? We find rest in your gift. That is where we enjoy being close to you. Our rest is like our “place.” Love lifts us up to that place, and your good Spirit lifts us from the gates of death.

Our peace comes from a good will. The body moves to its own place because of its own weight. A rock falls down, and fire goes up. They move because of their own weight, always going to where they belong. Oil poured under water rises above it, and water poured on oil sinks below it. They move because of their own weight, trying to get to their own place. If they are out of place, they feel restless; when they find their place, they are calm.

My love is what carries me. Because of your gift, we are set on fire inside and carried upward. We burn inside and keep moving forward. We climb your ladder that is in our hearts and sing songs as we go up. We glow inside with your good fire and go forward because we are going up to the peace of Jerusalem. I was happy when they said, “Let us go into the house of the Lord.” There your good will will settle us, and we will want nothing more than to stay there forever.

CHAPTER X

Happy would be the creature that was different from you but had never known any other state since it was made. It would have always had your gift, which moves over everything that changes. It would have been carried by the call when you said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.

In us, there is a difference between when we were in darkness and when we were made into light. But we don’t know what would have happened to a creature if there had been no light. It sounds like there was some change and darkness in it before so that the reason it was made different would be clear. This means that by turning to the never-failing Light, it could become light.

Let those who can understand this do so; and those who can’t should ask you. Don’t bother me as if I could “enlighten every person who comes into the world.”
