If someone tries to understand what the writer of the Holy Scripture meant, what’s the problem if a person understands what you, the Light of all truth and clear minds, show him to be true? Even if the author he reads didn’t get this part of the truth, but did understand the truth in a different way?

Chapter 19  
28. It is definitely true, Lord, that you made the heaven and the earth. It’s also true that "the beginning" is your wisdom, through which you created everything.
