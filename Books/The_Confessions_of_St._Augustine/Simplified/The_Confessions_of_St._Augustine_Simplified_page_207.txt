Changing your way of thinking is really important. It’s not about just copying someone else or living like a better person before you. You didn’t say, “Let man be made after their kind,” but instead, “Let us make man in our own image and likeness,” so we can understand what you want.

That’s why your helper said we should “be transformed by the renewing of our minds,” so we can figure out what God’s will is—what is good, acceptable, and perfect. You didn’t say, “Let man be made,” but “Let us make man.” You didn’t say, “After his kind,” but “after our image and likeness.” When a person changes their mind and understands your truth, they don’t need someone else to tell them how to act. With your help, they can see what your perfect plan is. You also teach them to understand that God is both one and three at the same time.

This is why you said “Let us make man” in plural, but also “And God made man” in singular. So it says “after our likeness” in plural, and then “after the image of God” in singular. People change by knowing God and are made more like the one who made them. Once they are spiritual, they can judge what is right and aren’t judged by others.

When it says “he judges all things,” it means people have control over fish, birds, animals, the earth, and all creatures. They do this through their mind and reason by understanding “the things of the Spirit of God.” But when humans were first given this role, they didn’t get it and acted like animals. That’s why in your Church, God, you made all people male and female, but in your grace, everyone is equal—no male or female, no Jew or Greek, no slave or free. Spiritual people, whether leaders or followers, judge spiritually. They don’t judge by the highest spiritual knowledge because it’s too big for them. They also don’t judge your Book, even though some parts are hard to understand.

Instead, they accept what it says and believe that what they don’t understand is still true. So, even though a person is spiritual and has a renewed mind like God’s image, they trust and submit to your word.
