You can see many important changes in Augustine’s thinking over these forty years, but his main ideas stayed pretty much the same throughout his life. He never tried to write a complete, organized summary of his beliefs, and he probably couldn’t have made a balanced overview of all his different teachings. So, if you want to understand him well, you need to read a lot of his work and always think about the specific goal of each piece he wrote.

For people who want to get to know Augustine directly, it’s helpful that he focused his experiences and thoughts into two big summary works—one at the start of his Christian life and one near the end. The first is called the Confessions, which is his most famous and widely read book. The second is the Enchiridion, written more than twenty years later. In the Confessions, Augustine is just beginning his Church career. In the Enchiridion, he is a strong defender of traditional Christianity. In these two books, you can find all his main ideas and get a good feel for how he thought.

Augustine was baptized by Ambrose in Milan during Easter, A.D. 387. Not long after, his mother Monica died on their way back to Africa. A year later, Augustine was living in a monastery in his hometown of Tagaste, in Roman Africa. In 391, he became a priest in the church of Hippo Regius, a nearby small coastal town. In 395, even though he had serious doubts and it broke Church rules, he was made assistant bishop to the old bishop Valerius, whom he replaced the next year. Soon after starting his bishop duties, he began writing the Confessions, finishing them around 398.

Augustine had complex reasons for writing about himself. His spiritual journey had ended in a surprising way. He felt he had to look back carefully at the important moments that led him there.

Since he believed God’s grace was the main force guiding him, he wrote his self-story as a long prayer to God.

The Confessions are not just Augustine’s life story. Instead, they are a careful effort, inspired by feeling God’s presence, to remember the key moments where he saw God’s grace working in his life. He follows his memories, showing the struggles of his youth and his search for wisdom. He leaves out many things, but he builds his story so well that the turning point in Book VIII feels real and powerful. We learn how reading Cicero’s Hortensius first made him want wisdom, how the Manicheans tricked him by promising true wisdom, and how the Academics made him doubt that knowledge is certain. They freed him from the Manicheans’ absolute beliefs but then challenged him with the opposite idea—that nothing can be known for sure. He also shows (in Book V, Chapter 10) that the main reason for his...
