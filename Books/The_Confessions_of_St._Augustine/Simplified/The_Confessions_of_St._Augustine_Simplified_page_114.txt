He promised to send the “Paraclete, the Spirit of Truth” from above. He had already sent him, but I didn’t know it. He sent him because Jesus was now honored, having risen from the dead and gone up to heaven. Before that, “the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” The prophet shouted, “How long will you be slow to understand? How long will you love useless things and chase after lies? Know this: the Lord has honored His Holy One.” He asks, “How long?” and says, “Know this.” I had spent so long loving useless things and chasing lies that when I heard this, I shook with fear because I remembered how I used to be. The things I once thought were true were actually empty and false. I spoke a lot about this when I thought back with regret. I wish those who still love useless things and lies could hear me. Maybe they would be upset and give up their mistakes, and you would hear them when they call to you. Jesus really died for us in the flesh, and now He prays for us with you.

I read more: “Be angry, but don’t sin.” This touched me deeply, God, because I had learned to be angry at myself for past mistakes so I wouldn’t sin again. Yes, it’s right to be angry for a good reason, not like some who blame others and don’t get angry with themselves. Those people are just building up trouble for the day when you judge us all. The good things I saw now weren’t outside me, and I couldn’t see them with my physical eyes in sunlight. People who only find joy outside themselves easily feel empty. They waste time on things that don’t last and chase shadows with their hungry thoughts. If only they got tired of this hunger and asked, “Who will show us any good?” We would answer, and they would hear, “O Lord, your face shines brightly on us.” We aren’t the Light that shines on everyone, but you light us up so those of us who were in darkness can now shine in you. If only people could see this inner, eternal Light! I had tasted it, and I was so frustrated I couldn’t show it to them unless they gave me their hearts and stopped looking around with restless eyes, asking, “Who will show us any good?” Even inside me—where I was angry with myself, feeling pain, making sacrifices, killing my old self, and hoping for a new life trusting in you—you started to become sweet to me and “put gladness in my heart.” As I read this, I cried out and felt its meaning deeply. I didn’t want more worldly stuff that fades away because now I had something better—true corn, wine, and oil that last forever.

With a loud cry from my heart, I read this verse: “Oh, in peace! Oh, in the Selfsame!” See how it says, “I will lie down and take my rest.” Who can stop us when this truth is clear: “Death is swallowed up in victory”? Surely you, who never change, are the Selfsame, and in you there is rest and freedom from all troubles. There is no one else but you, and we don’t need to work for all the things that aren’t you, because only you, Lord, give me hope. I read these things and felt inspired, but I still didn’t fully understand what it meant.
