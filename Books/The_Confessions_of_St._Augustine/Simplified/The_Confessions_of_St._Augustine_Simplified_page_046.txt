So, I was stuck feeling unhappy, like I was living in a place where I couldn’t stay but also couldn’t leave.  

Because where could my heart run away from itself? Where could I hide from who I really am?  

I would follow myself everywhere. Still, I ran away from my hometown so my eyes wouldn’t look for him in a place where I wasn’t used to seeing him.  

So, I left Tagaste and went back to Carthage.  

Time doesn’t just pass slowly or smoothly through what we feel. It does strange things in our minds. Day after day, time went by, and as it passed, it brought new thoughts and memories. Little by little, these helped me feel better and made my sadness less. But after this sadness came other kinds of sadness, not the same but related.  

Why did the first sadness hurt so much? Because I loved someone as if he would never die, but he had to die. What helped me most was the comfort of other friends. With them, I kept loving the things I loved instead of loving him. But this was a fake story I told myself, a lie that was hurting my soul. This lie wouldn’t leave me, especially when one of my friends died.  

There were other things in my friendships that kept my mind busy: talking and joking with friends; sharing polite conversations; reading fun books together; goofing off; being serious; sometimes disagreeing but without getting mad, like arguing with myself; and even in those disagreements, feeling happy when we agreed again. Sometimes I taught them, sometimes they taught me. I missed friends who were away and felt happy when they came home.  

These things, which happen naturally between people who love each other, showed in their faces, words, eyes, and many little kind actions. All of this bonded us together so strongly that we became like one.  

This is what we love in our friends, and we love it so much that if someone doesn’t love a friend who loves them back, their conscience feels bad. We want to love and be loved just for the feeling of love itself, not to get anything else.  

This is why we feel so sad when a friend dies—why we cry and feel pain, and why it feels like part of us is dying too because we lost someone who was alive.  

People are lucky if they love God, love their friends because of God, and even love their enemies for God’s sake. This way, they never really lose anyone they care about because everyone they love is safe with God, who can never be lost.  

Who is this God? The one who made the sky and earth, and filled them completely. No one loses God except the person who leaves Him. But if someone leaves God, where can they go? They can’t escape God because God’s rules and truth are everywhere, even in their punishment. God’s law is truth, and God is the Truth.
