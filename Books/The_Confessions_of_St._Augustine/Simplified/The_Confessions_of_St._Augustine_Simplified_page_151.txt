We should enjoy the company of good things just as much as living a good life. But unless something is missing, I don’t know if I should be happy or upset about not having it.

So, what am I really telling you, Lord, about this kind of struggle? I’m saying that I like being praised, but I like the truth even more than praise. If I had to choose between being praised by everyone even if I was wrong, or being blamed by everyone but knowing I was right, I know what I’d pick. But I wish I didn’t care if other people’s approval made me happier for the good things I do. Still, I admit it does make me happier, and if people criticize me, it makes me feel worse.

When I get upset about this problem, I come up with an excuse, and you, God, know how important it is because it makes me unsure. You didn’t just tell us what to avoid loving, but also who and what to love. You want us to love you and our neighbors. So sometimes when I’m happy about praise, it feels like I’m happy because my neighbor understands me. Or, I feel bad when someone criticizes something good or doesn’t understand it. Sometimes I’m upset about praise because people praise things in me I don’t like, or they praise small, unimportant things too much. But then I wonder if I’m only upset because I want the person praising me to agree with how I see myself, not because I care about them. I like the good things about myself more when others like them too. So, if people praise things I don’t like about myself, or praise unimportant things more, I don’t really feel praised. Am I not confused about this?

Look, Truth, I see that I shouldn’t care about praise just for myself, but for the good of others. But I don’t really know if that’s how I am. I know less about myself than you do. I ask you, God, to help me understand myself better so I can be honest with my friends, who can pray for me when I’m weak.

Let me think about this more carefully. If I care about my neighbors when I’m praised, why do I care less when someone else is unfairly criticized than when it happens to me? Why do I get more upset when I’m blamed than when someone else is blamed unfairly in front of me? Do I not understand this either? Or am I tricking myself and not telling the truth to you in my heart and words? Please, Lord, keep me from this foolishness, so I don’t use my words to make things worse for myself.

“I am needy and poor.” Still, I feel better when I quietly admit my mistakes and ask for your mercy, until what’s missing in me is fixed and I find peace that proud people don’t know. What people say and do is very important, but real peace comes from you.
