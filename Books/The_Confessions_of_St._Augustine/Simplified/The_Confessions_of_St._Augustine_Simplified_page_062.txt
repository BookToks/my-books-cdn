18. You helped me get better from that sickness, and you healed your servant’s son so he could live for you and have stronger health. After that, when I was in Rome, I joined those “saints” who fooled themselves and others. I didn’t just hang out with their followers, like the man whose house I got sick in, but also with those they called “the chosen ones.” I still thought that it wasn’t me who sinned, but some other part inside me. It made me proud to feel like I wasn’t to blame. When I did something wrong, I didn’t want to admit it—I wanted you to heal my soul because it had sinned against you. I liked to defend my soul and blame something else inside me, though I didn’t know what. But really, it was me, and it was my own disrespect to you that made me fight against myself. That sin was worse because I didn’t even think I was a sinner. It was terrible, God, that I would rather have you lose in me and destroy me than have you win and save me. You hadn’t yet stopped me from speaking evil or making excuses for sin with others. So I stayed with those “chosen ones.”

19. But then, seeing that their false teachings didn’t help me, I started to care less even about the ideas I had decided to accept if I couldn’t find anything better. I was half ready to believe that the philosophers called “The Academics” were smarter because they said we should doubt everything and that humans can’t really know any sure truth. I didn’t fully understand them, but I believed they thought what people said they did. I also tried to warn my host not to trust the lies in the writings of Mani. Even so, I was still closer friends with these people than with others who weren’t part of their heresy. I didn’t defend their ideas like before, but being with them made me slower to look for a different path. This was easy since I had no hope of finding the truth in your Church, Lord of heaven and earth, maker of everything seen and unseen. I also thought it was strange to believe you could have human flesh or be limited by a physical body. When I wanted to think about you, I only imagined a huge body because I thought anything without a body didn’t really exist. This was the main reason I kept making mistakes.

20. I also believed that evil was like a kind of substance with its own ugly, twisted body—either thick like the earth or thin and invisible like the air, which they thought was some bad spirit moving through it.
