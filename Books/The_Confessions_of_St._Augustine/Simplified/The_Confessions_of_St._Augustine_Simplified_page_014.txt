My wants were inside me and outside me, but no matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t reach my soul. So, I would move my arms and legs around and cry, making the little signs I could, even though they didn’t really show what I truly wanted. When I wasn’t happy—either because people didn’t understand me or because what I got wasn’t good for me—I got mad that the grown-ups didn’t listen to me and that people I had no right over didn’t wait on me like slaves. I got back at them by crying. I’ve learned this by watching babies; even though they didn’t know me, they showed me better what I was like than my nurses who did know me.

My baby days ended a long time ago, but I am still alive. But you, Lord, who live forever and never die—before the world began, even before anything we can call “before,” you were there. You are the God and ruler of all creatures. With you stay all the steady causes of all things that change, the unchanging sources of things that do change, and the eternal reasons for all things that don’t think or last forever. Please, God, tell me—your humble servant—tell me kindly if my baby days came after an even earlier time in my life that already ended before that. Was it a time like that when I was still in my mother’s womb? I’ve heard about something like that and have seen pregnant women. But what, God, my Joy, came before that time? Was I anywhere or anyone? No one can explain this to me—not my father or mother, not others’ experiences, not even my own memory. Do you laugh at me for asking these questions? Or do you tell me to just praise and believe what I do know?

I thank you, Lord of heaven and earth, and praise you for that first being and my baby days that I don’t remember. You have given people the ability to understand themselves through knowing others and to believe many things about themselves because of what women say. So, it’s clear that I had life and being; and as my baby days ended, I was already learning signs to show others how I felt.

Where could a creature like me come from, if not from you, Lord? Is anyone skilled enough to make themselves? Or is there any other source of life and being besides you, who made us? You are both the highest being and the highest life, all at once. You are endless and never change, and this day you keep going on without ending—though in a way it ends in you, since everything is in you and days wouldn’t pass if you didn’t keep them going. Because “your years will never end,” your years are like one never-ending day. How many of our days and our fathers’ days have gone through your day and got their life and shape from it?

All the days that will come will get their life from you and then pass away. But “you are the same”! All the tomorrows and the days yet to come, and all the yesterdays and the days that have passed, you will bring into this day of yours. What does it matter to me if someone doesn’t understand this? Let them still be happy and keep asking, “What is this?” Let them be glad and want to find you, even if they don’t find an answer, rather than look for an answer and not find you!
