Did the person who hit me act any differently? When he lost a small argument with another teacher, he got more angry and jealous than I did when I was beaten by a friend during a ball game.

 

I did wrong, Lord my God, the ruler and creator of everything natural, but only you rule over sins—I sinned by going against what my parents and teachers told me. They wanted me to learn something useful, no matter why they wanted it. I could have used that learning later on. I disobeyed not because I had a better idea, but just because I loved to play. I liked winning and hearing sweet lies that made me want to hear more. I was also really curious about the shows and sports my elders enjoyed.

But people who put on these shows are respected so much that almost everyone wants their kids to do the same. So, they are okay with their kids getting punished if playing games stops them from studying, which their parents want so they can grow up able to put on such shows. Please, Lord, look kindly on this and save us who ask for your help. Save even those who don’t ask, so they may call on you and you can save them.

 

Even as a kid, I had heard that we could have eternal life because of the humility of the Lord our God, who came down to meet us in our pride. I was marked with the sign of his cross and blessed even before I was born, because my mother trusted you a lot. Lord, you saw how once, when I was still a child, I suddenly got stomach pains and almost died. You saw how worried and faithful I was, asking my mother and your Church (which is like a mother to us all) for baptism in the name of your Christ, my Lord and God. My mother was very worried because she cared deeply about my soul’s salvation. If I hadn’t gotten better quickly, she would have immediately made sure I was baptized and washed clean by your life-giving sacraments, confessing you, Lord Jesus, to forgive my sins.

So my baptism was delayed, as if it was meant to be that if I lived, I would still get dirty with sin. Also, the guilt from sin after baptism would be even worse and more dangerous.

 

At that time, I believed in Christ along with my mother and the whole family, except my father. But he didn’t stop my mother’s faith from influencing me, and he didn’t stop me from believing in Christ, even though he didn’t believe yet. It was my mother’s wish, Lord, that I would recognize you as my Father instead of my earthly father. You helped her win over my father, even though he was the head of the family. She obeyed him, but she obeyed you too, who commands us all.

 

I ask you, Lord, if it’s okay to know why my baptism was delayed back then. Was it really for my own good that I was allowed to sin more? Or was it not? If not, then why do people always say, “Let him do what he wants, he’s not baptized yet”?
