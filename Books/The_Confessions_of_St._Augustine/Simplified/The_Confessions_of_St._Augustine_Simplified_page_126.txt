BOOK TEN

Augustine stops talking about his past and starts thinking about how memory works inside us. While doing this, he thinks about why he wrote these “confessions” and tries to explain how people come closer to God. This leads him to study how memory connects to who we are and what we can do.

After that, he talks about what real prayer means and how it works. At the end, he looks closely at our desires and the temptations that both our bodies and souls face. He finally understands why it was so important for Jesus to be both God and man to help people.

CHAPTER I

1. Let me know you, God, who knows me already; let me know you just like you know me. You are the strength of my soul. Come inside me and get me ready for you, so you can have me completely, without anything wrong or dirty. This is what I hope for, so I speak to you with joy whenever I am truly happy.

But the other things in life aren’t worth crying about too much, and some things should make us sad only if we don’t care about them enough. Because you want truth, and “those who live by truth come into the light.” This is what I want to do by confessing in my heart to you and writing it down for many people to see.

CHAPTER II

2. What could I hide from you, Lord, when you see everything inside a person’s conscience, even if I didn’t want to tell you? If I tried to hide things from you, I’d only be hiding you from myself, not myself from you.

Now that I’m upset with myself, you shine your light and make me feel better. You are loved and wanted, so I feel ashamed of myself, give up my old self, and choose you. I can’t make you happy or be happy myself except through you. So, Lord, I’m completely open to you, no matter what I am.

I confess to you not with words I speak out loud, but with the words of my soul and the thoughts you hear. When I do wrong, confessing to you means I’m unhappy with myself. But when I’m truly devoted, confessing means I don’t take credit for my goodness, because you bless good people but also forgive them even when they’re not perfect yet.

So, my confession, God, is made quietly before you — not with loud sounds, but with strong feelings that shout inside my heart. I don’t say anything to others that you didn’t first say to me, and you don’t hear anything from me that you didn’t put there first.
