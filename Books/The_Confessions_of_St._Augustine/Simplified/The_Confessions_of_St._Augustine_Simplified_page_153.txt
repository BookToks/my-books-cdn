CHAPTER XLI 66. Now I have thought about my sins, especially the three big kinds of wrong desires, and I asked for your help. Even though my heart was hurt, I saw your bright light. When I was pushed back, I asked, “Who can reach you? I feel far away from you.” You are the Truth who rules everything, but because I wanted too much, I didn’t want to lose you. Still, I also wanted to keep a lie with you—like when people don’t want to believe the truth. Because of this, I lost you, since you can't be with a lie.

CHAPTER XLII 67. Who could help me get close to you again? Should I have asked angels? What kind of prayer or special ways? I heard people who tried to come back to you but couldn’t, ended up wanting strange visions and got tricked. They were proud and tried to find you by showing off how much they knew instead of feeling sorry for themselves. Because of this, they attracted evil spirits who tricked them using magic. They wanted someone to clean them, but there was no one. The one they found was the devil, pretending to be an angel of light. He tempted their proud feelings because he didn’t have a real body like them.

They were people who made mistakes and died, but you, Lord, are perfect and live forever. A helper between God and people must be partly God and partly human. If he was only human, he would be too far from God. If only God, then too far from people. So, he wouldn’t be a good helper. The fake helper, who tricked people because of their pride, was like humans because he sinned. He seemed like God because he didn’t have a body that dies, so he said he was immortal. But since sin brings death, he is really like humans because he is also doomed to die.

CHAPTER XLIII 68. But the real helper, whom you showed only to humble people and sent so they could learn to be humble too, is the one between God and humans: Jesus Christ. He came between people who sin and the perfect God. He was human like us and good like God. Because being good brings life and peace, he could, by being connected with God, cancel the death that sinners deserve, and he was willing to take it for them.
