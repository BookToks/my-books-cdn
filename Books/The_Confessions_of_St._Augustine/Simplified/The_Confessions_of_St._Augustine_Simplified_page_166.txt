We cannot measure something that has no length. Or is it in the past where it goes? But if it no longer exists, we cannot measure it.

My soul really wants to understand this difficult mystery. Oh Lord my God, good Father, I ask you through Christ, please don’t stop me from wanting to know both the easy and hard parts. Don’t keep me from learning; let your mercy help me see the truth, Lord. Who else can I ask about these things? And who else should I tell that I don’t understand better than you, since I love studying your Scriptures? Give me what I love, because I truly love it, and you have given it to me. Oh Father, who knows how to give good gifts to your children, please give this to me. I ask this through Christ, in his name, the Holy of Holies. Please don’t let anyone interrupt me. “I have believed, and so I speak.” This is what gives me hope; this is why I live: to enjoy the happiness of my Lord. Look, my days are passing away, but I don’t understand how.

We talk about this time and that time, these times and those times: “How long ago did he say this?” “How long ago did he do that?” “How long ago did I see that?” “This sound is twice as long as that short sound.” We say and hear these words, and we understand each other. They are common and normal, but the real meaning behind them is still hidden, and we have yet to discover it.

I once heard a smart man say that the movement of the sun, moon, and stars make time. But I didn’t agree. Why shouldn’t the movement of all things make time? What if the lights in the sky stopped shining, but a potter’s wheel kept turning? Wouldn’t we still be able to measure how fast it turned, and say some turns were longer or shorter?

And while we say this, wouldn’t our words also happen in time? Some sounds would be long and others short because some take longer to say. Oh God, please help people see in small things the ideas that apply to everything, big and small. The stars and lights in the sky are definitely “for signs, seasons, days, and years.” But just like I wouldn’t call the turn of a wooden wheel a day, that smart man wouldn’t say there is no time.

I really want to understand what time is and how it works, the way we measure the movement of things and say, for example, that one movement takes twice as long as another.

I ask this because the word “day” means not only the time the sun is up (which separates day from night), but also the sun’s whole cycle.
