I eagerly started reading the old writings of your Spirit, especially those by the apostle Paul. I used to think he sometimes contradicted himself and that his teachings didn’t match what the Law and the Prophets said. But now, all those doubts disappeared.

I saw that his pure words all showed the same message, and I felt both happy and careful. I realized that the truth I had found in the Platonist books was mixed with the greatness of your grace. So, someone who understands shouldn’t brag as if they earned it themselves, because everything they have, even the ability to see, is a gift. This means they are encouraged not just to see but to be pure, so they can truly know you—who never change. Even if a person loves God’s law deep inside, what can they do about the part of them that fights against their mind and keeps them trapped by sin? You are righteous, Lord, but we have sinned and done wrong. Your hand is heavy on us, and we are rightly given over to the ancient enemy, the lord of death. He tricked our wills to be like his, which is not true to you. So what can “wretched man” do? Who can save him from this “body of death” except your grace through Jesus Christ our Lord? You brought him into being, coexisting with you forever, and created him at the start of everything. The prince of this world found nothing in Jesus that deserved death, but still killed him—and by doing that, erased the record that was against us.

The Platonist books don’t talk about any of this. They don’t mention this kind of godliness—like tears of confession, your sacrifice, a troubled spirit, or a heart that’s broken and sorry. They don’t talk about saving your people, the promised Holy Spirit, or the price we pay for freedom. In those books, no one sings, “Shouldn’t my soul obey God, because he saves me? He is my defender; I won’t be shaken.” No one hears Jesus calling, “Come to me if you are tired.” They refuse to learn from him because he is “gentle and humble.” You have hidden these things from the wise and clever and showed them to children. It’s one thing to see the peaceful land from a mountain but fail to find the way there, trying dangerous paths that lead nowhere, blocked by enemies like lions and dragons. But it’s a totally different thing to follow the safe road guarded by the heavenly Emperor’s army, where there are no traitors to attack travelers.
