During the day, light moves around me in many different ways and comforts me even when I’m busy with other things and don’t notice it. It shows itself so strongly that if it suddenly disappears, I miss it, and if it’s gone for a long time, I feel sad.

O Light, which Tobit saw even when he was blind, as he taught his son how to live—and who always led with love and never made mistakes; or the Light Isaac saw when his eyes were weak from old age, and even though he couldn’t see well, he was allowed to bless his sons and knew them through the blessing; or the Light Jacob saw, who was also old and blind but had a clear heart, and who gave light to the future nation through his sons and grandchildren—this is the true Light. It is one Light, and everyone who sees and loves it is united.

But the physical light I was talking about makes the world look beautiful and tempting to those who don’t see the deeper things. People who know how to thank you, “O God, Creator of Us All,” praise you for it and don’t get lost in it while they sleep. That’s the kind of person I want to be. I try not to be fooled by what my eyes see, so I don’t get trapped as I follow your path. I lift my invisible eyes to you, asking you to “pull my feet out of the trap.” You constantly help me because I easily get caught. You never stop watching over me, but I keep getting stuck in traps all around me. Still, you never rest or sleep.

There are so many things made by different skills and factories—clothes, shoes, containers, and many others; even pictures and statues—which go beyond what is needed or useful for a good life. People make these just to please the eyes, copying the outside look of things but forgetting the One who made everything and ruining what they themselves were meant to be!

And I, my God and my Joy, also praise you for all these things and offer thanks to you, my Holy One. The beautiful forms made by artists come from the beauty that is higher than we can understand, a beauty my soul longs for all the time. The artists and those who love these outer beauties find the standard to judge them from that higher beauty, even if they don’t fully understand their true purpose. Still, that purpose is there to keep them from going the wrong way and to save their energy for you, instead of wasting it on pleasures that soon become boring. Even though I understand this, I still get caught up in these beauties, but you will save me, Lord. You will save me because your love is always with me. I am weak and easily trapped, but you are merciful and rescue me, sometimes without me even realizing it.
