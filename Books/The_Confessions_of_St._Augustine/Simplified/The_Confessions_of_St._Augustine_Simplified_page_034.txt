Back then, as you know, my heart’s light, I didn’t know the apostle’s words. I was happy with Cicero’s advice because it inspired me to love, search for, get, keep, and hold on to wisdom itself, no matter where I found it. The only problem was that Christ’s name wasn’t part of it. By God’s mercy, the name of Christ, my Savior, was deeply loved and treasured in my heart from when I was a baby. So, no matter how smart or polished something was, if it didn’t have that name, it didn’t fully grab me.

I decided to turn my mind to the Holy Scriptures to see what they were about. I found something that proud people couldn’t understand, not even kids; it sounded simple but was really deep and mysterious. But I wasn’t able to follow or accept it yet. Back then, the Scriptures seemed less impressive compared to Cicero’s work. My pride pushed me away from them because their style didn’t appeal to me, and my sharp mind couldn’t get their deeper meaning. They seemed meant to help beginners grow, but I was too proud to be a beginner and thought I was already fully grown.

So, I ended up among people who were proud, focused on physical things, and talked a lot, but their words were traps set by the devil. They kept saying the names of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, but only as empty sounds because their hearts didn’t have truth. They kept shouting “Truth, Truth,” but didn’t actually have it. They lied about God—the real Truth—and about the world God made. I should have ignored even the philosophers, even when they spoke truth about God’s creation, because I loved God so much.

Oh Truth, even back then, my soul deeply longed for you. But the Manicheans, a group that called your name over and over, only gave me words with no real meaning. While I starved for you, they served me the sun and moon—your beautiful works—but not you yourself.
