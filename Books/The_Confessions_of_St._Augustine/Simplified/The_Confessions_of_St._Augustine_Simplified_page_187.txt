Actually, when someone lies, they are speaking their own thoughts, even if those thoughts aren’t true. Listen, God, who is the best judge and the real Truth, hear what I’m saying to this person I’m arguing with. I say it in your presence and before my friends who use the law correctly out of love. Please listen to what I’m about to say, if you want to.

I want to say something kind and peaceful to this person: “If we both agree that what you say is true, and we both agree that what I say is true, then where exactly do we see this? I don’t see it in you, and you don’t see it in me, but we both see it in the unchanging truth itself, which is bigger than our minds.” If we don’t argue about the real light of the Lord our God, then why do we argue about each other’s thoughts, which aren’t as clear as the unchanging Truth? Even if Moses himself appeared and explained what he meant, it wouldn’t be so we could see it clearly, but so we would believe him. So let’s not “go beyond what is written” and get proud against each other. Instead, let’s “love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, and mind, and love our neighbor as ourselves.” Unless we believe Moses meant everything in those books to be guided by these two commands of love, we would be making God a liar if we judged his servant’s soul any other way. See how silly it is to argue strongly that Moses only meant one specific thing and then fight each other, breaking love, even though he said all these things to teach us love!

And yet, God, you lift me up when I’m humble and give me rest when I’m tired. You hear me when I confess and forgive my sins. Since you tell me to love my neighbor as myself, I can’t believe you gave Moses less of a gift than I would want for myself. If I had lived back then and had the chance to write those books that help people all over the world, I would want to express myself clearly and arrange things so that even people who don’t fully understand how God creates wouldn’t reject my words. I would want those who do understand already to find in my simple words all the truths they have discovered on their own. And if someone else saw a different meaning in the light of Truth, that would be okay too.
