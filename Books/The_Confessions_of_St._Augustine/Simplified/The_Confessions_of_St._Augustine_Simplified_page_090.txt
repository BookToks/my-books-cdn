The sky is cloudy and windy, like nature being with itself. I wouldn’t say, “These things shouldn’t exist.” If I only saw these things, I would want something better—but I should still thank you, just for these things you made. You deserve praise because “earth, dragons, and all depths; fire, hail, snow, and vapors; stormy winds doing your will; mountains and hills, fruit trees and cedars; animals and all cattle; crawling creatures and flying birds; things on earth and all people; rulers and judges; young men and women, old people and children,” all praise your name!

I also see that in heaven all your angels praise you, God. Praise comes from “the sun and moon, all stars and light, the heavens above the heavens, and the waters above them,” all praising your name. Because of this, I don’t want a better world anymore. I thought about everything carefully and understood that things in the sky are better than things on earth, but all creation together is even better than just the things above.

People who complain about any part of your creation are not healthy, just like I wasn’t healthy when I complained about many of your works. My soul didn’t want to be unhappy with you, so it wouldn’t believe the things that bothered me came from you. This made me confused and restless, and I thought there were two different gods, which was wrong. Then I imagined a god spread out everywhere in space and thought that was you, but that was just me making an idol in my heart, which was wrong. But you calmed my mind, even when I didn’t notice, and closed my eyes so I wouldn't see false things. This helped me stop thinking only about myself, and my confusion went away. Then I woke up in you and saw you as infinite, but not in the way I had imagined—and this understanding didn’t come from my body.

I looked at other things and saw that everything exists because of you, and everything is limited inside you. But they aren’t inside you like in a space; instead, you hold everything by your truth. Things are true as long as they exist, and falsehood is just thinking about things that aren’t real. I saw that everything fits together perfectly, not just in where they are but also in their time. I saw that you, who are eternal, didn’t start working after a long time—because all time, past and future, happens only through your work and presence.

I saw that it’s not strange that bread tastes bad to someone sick but good to someone healthy. Light hurts sore eyes but is nice to healthy ones. Your fairness bothers bad people, and they complain even more about small creatures like snakes and worms, which you made good and fit well with the smaller parts of creation. The wicked...
