15. Also, I read that people turned the glory of your perfect nature into idols and different pictures—into an image made like a corruptible human and into birds, animals, and crawling creatures. This was like the cheap food from Egypt that Esau traded his birthright for. So, your first people ended up worshiping the head of a four-legged animal instead of you, turning their hearts back to Egypt and bowing down to the image of a grass-eating ox instead of to you, their own soul. I found these things written down, but I didn’t accept them.

It pleased you, Lord, to take away the shame of Jacob being younger, so the older brother would serve the younger, and you could call the Gentiles too. I worked hard to find that gold you let your people take from Egypt because wherever it was, it belonged to you. You told the Athenians through your apostle that in you “we live and move and have our being,” just like one of their poets said. These books came from there, but I didn’t focus on the Egyptian idols made of gold, which “changed the truth of God into a lie” by worshiping creatures instead of the Creator.

16. These books told me to look inside myself, so I went into my inner soul, guided by you. I could do this because you helped me. Inside, I saw with my soul’s eye—what I had of it—that above it and above my mind was the unchanging Light. It wasn’t the normal light everyone sees, and it wasn’t just a brighter kind of sunlight flooding everywhere. It was very different from any light on earth. It wasn’t above my mind like oil floats on water or like the sky is above the earth, but it was higher because it made me, and I was below it because it was my creator. Anyone who knows the Truth knows that Light, and anyone who knows that Light knows forever. Love knows it too, Eternal Truth and True Love and Beloved Forever! You are my God, and I long for you night and day.

When I first met you, you lifted me up so I could see that there was something to see, even though I wasn’t ready yet. You pushed away my weak sight by shining your bright light on me, and I shook with love and fear. I knew I was far from you in a place of unlikeness, as if I heard your voice from above saying, “I am the food for strong people; grow up and you will feed on me. You won’t change me like you change the food your body eats, but you will be changed to be like me.” I understood that you correct people for their wrongs and that my soul feels like it’s being eaten away like by a spider. I asked, “Is Truth nothing because it doesn’t spread through space—not finite or infinite?” And you answered me from far away, “I am who I am.”
