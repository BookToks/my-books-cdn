Your true self knows and wants things in a way that never changes. Your knowledge and your will are always the same. And it doesn’t seem right to you that the unchanging Light should be understood by people, who change, in the same way it understands itself.

So, to you, my soul is like dry land with no water; just like it can’t light itself up on its own, it can’t satisfy itself either. That’s why the source of life is with you, and “in your light, we will see light.”

Who has brought together all the “bitter ones” into one group? They all want the same thing: happiness that only lasts for a little while and is all about this world. This is why they do everything, even if their concerns are very different. Who else but you, Lord, gathered them, just like you said, “Let the waters come together and let dry land appear”—because they are thirsty for you? The sea belongs to you, and you made it, and your hands formed the dry land.

It’s not the bitterness of people’s wills that makes the sea, but the gathering of waters. Yet, you control the bad desires in people’s souls and decide how far they can go, and where their waves crash into each other. This way, you make it a “sea” by ruling over everything.

But for the souls that thirst for you and come to you—separate from the “bitter sea” because they want something different—you give them water from a secret and sweet spring. This lets “the earth” bring forth fruit, and you help our souls grow by doing kind acts.

So, we love our neighbors by helping with their basic needs. The soul has its own kind of seed when, even though we are weak, we feel for those in need and help them, just like we would want help if we were in their place. We help not only with small problems (like a plant making seeds) but also by giving our best strength to protect them (like a tree bearing fruit). This means we try to save people who are being hurt by powerful others, giving them protection through fair judgment.

So, Lord, I ask you: let what you planned happen, and give us joy and the ability to be joyful. Let truth grow from the earth, let fairness come down from heaven, and let there be lights shining in the world.
