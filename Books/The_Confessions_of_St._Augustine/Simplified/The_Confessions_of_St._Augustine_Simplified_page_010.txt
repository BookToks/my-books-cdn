So, my son, read my Confessions like a good person should—not just quickly, but with a kind and caring heart like a Christian. Here, see me as I really am and don’t think I’m better than I am. Believe only what I say about myself.

Look at who I was on my own and how I changed. If you like something about me, praise God with me—He is the one I want to be praised, not myself. “For it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves.”

We were lost before, but God who made us, made us new again. So, as you read about me in these pages, please pray for me that I don’t mess up and that I keep getting better. Pray for me, my son, pray for me!
