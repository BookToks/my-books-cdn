It's good because you have given them to us—we can find our rest in you in the eternal Sabbath of life.

Then, you will rest in us just like you work in us now; your rest will be through us, just as your works are done through us. But, Lord, you always work and are always at rest. You don’t see or move in time, and you don’t rest in time. Yet, you make everything that happens in time—even time itself.

We see all the things you made because they exist—but they exist because you see them. We see with our eyes that they are here, and we understand with our minds that they are good. But you saw them as made when you saw they would be made.

Now, in this time, your Spirit has moved our hearts to do good; but before, when we turned away from you, we were moved to do bad. But you, the one good God, have never stopped doing good! We have done some good things because of your gifts, and even though these good works are not forever, we hope to find our rest in your great holiness after this life. You are the Good, you don’t need rest, and you are always at rest because you are your own rest.

Who can teach people to understand this? Who can teach angels? Or can angels teach people? We have to ask you; we have to look for the answer in you; we have to knock on your door. Only then will we receive; only then will we find; only then will your door open.
