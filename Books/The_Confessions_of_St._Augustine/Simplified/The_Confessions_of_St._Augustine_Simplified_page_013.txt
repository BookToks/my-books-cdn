What do you mean to me? Please be kind so I can talk. Why do you expect me to love you, and then get mad and threaten me if I don’t? Is it no big deal to not love you? To me, it really is a big deal. Please tell me, God, what you mean to me. “Say to my soul, I am your salvation.” Speak so I can hear. My heart is ready to listen, God; open it and “say to my soul, I am your salvation.” I will run after that voice and grab hold of you. Don’t hide from me. Even if I die, let me see your face before I go.

My soul is too small for you to come in; please make it bigger. It’s broken; please fix it. I know there’s a lot about me that you don’t like; I admit that. But who else can clean me? Who else can I ask but you? “Cleanse me from my hidden faults,” God, “and keep me from doing wrong.” I believe this and so I say it. But you, God, you know everything. Haven’t I told you about my mistakes, and haven’t you forgiven me? I won’t argue with you, because you are the truth. I don’t want to lie to myself either. I won’t argue because “if you, Lord, kept track of sins, who could ever survive?”

Even though I’m just dust and ashes, please let me talk to your mercy. Let me speak, because I’m talking to your kindness, not to someone who would make fun of me.

Maybe you could even make fun of me, but when you listen to me, you will be kind. What I want to say, God, is that I don’t know where I came from to get into this life that feels like dying. Or maybe it’s a kind of death while still alive? I don’t know. But your mercy has kept me alive from the very start, as I’ve heard from my parents who gave me life—you made me through them, even though I can’t remember it myself. Even though my mom and nurses fed me, it wasn’t really from them, but from you, who gave them the ability to feed me according to your plan and kindness that controls everything.

You made sure I didn’t want more than what you gave, and you made those who fed me want to give me what you gave to them. They cared for me naturally because you gave them love to share. It was good for them to help me, but really it was you helping me through them. All good things come from you, God. My health comes from you. I’ve learned this because you’ve shown me so clearly by all the good things you’ve given me and those around me. Even from the very beginning, I knew how to suck milk, lie quietly when full, and cry when in pain—nothing more.

Later, I started to laugh—first in my sleep, then when I was awake. I’ve been told this about myself, and I believe it, even though I can’t remember it. I see other babies do the same. Then, little by little, I realized where I was and wanted to tell people what I wanted, but I couldn’t!
