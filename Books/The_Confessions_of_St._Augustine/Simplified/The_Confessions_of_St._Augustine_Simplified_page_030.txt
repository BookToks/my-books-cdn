I liked hanging out with the people I did it with. But I didn’t love being with them for its own sake—I actually only loved the stealing itself. That sounds strange, right? Who can explain this except God, who knows my heart and all its hidden parts? What made me think about this, talk about it, and really think it through? If I had really loved the pears I stole and wanted to enjoy them, I could have done it alone. I could have just stolen and been happy with that. I didn’t need my friends to get excited about it with me. But the fun wasn’t from the pears—it was from the stealing itself, made better by doing it with my friends who were also breaking the rules.

What made me feel this way? It was definitely bad and a big problem for me to feel like that. But what exactly was it? Who really understands their own mistakes? We laughed because we were excited about tricking the owners, who didn’t know what we were doing and would have been really upset. But still, why did I enjoy this so much, something I wouldn’t have done alone? Is it just that people don’t laugh easily by themselves? Sometimes they do, if something really funny happens, but I wouldn’t have done this alone—actually, I couldn’t have done it alone.

God, look at my life’s story laid out clearly for you.

I wouldn’t have stolen by myself. What I liked wasn’t the stuff I took but the act of stealing. And I wouldn’t have enjoyed it alone—I just wouldn’t have done it! Oh, friendship that’s really not friendly! You strange trickster of the soul, who wants trouble just for fun and excitement, who wants someone else to lose without wanting anything for yourself—not even revenge—so when someone says, “Let’s do it,” we feel embarrassed if we don’t join in.

Who can figure out such a messy, tangled problem? It’s dirty. I hate thinking about it. I hate looking at it. But I really want you, Righteousness and Innocence, so beautiful to all good people—I want you more than anything. With you comes perfect peace and a steady life. Anyone who follows you shares in the happiness of God and has no fear, becoming the best they can be. I moved away from you, God, when I was young and lost my way. I stopped trusting you, and I became empty inside.
