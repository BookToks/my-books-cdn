When we are awake, even if things happen to us, do we stay calm and unmoved? Does our reason stop working when we close our eyes? Does it go to sleep with our body’s senses? But if that were true, how come sometimes even when we’re dreaming, we can still resist bad thoughts and stay true to what we believe is right, not giving in to temptation? Yet there is one big difference: when bad things happen in dreams, we feel peaceful again once we wake up.

Because of this difference between sleeping and waking, we realize that it wasn’t really us who did those things in the dreams. Still, we feel sorry because it happened to us somehow.

Isn’t your hand, God, strong enough to heal all the bad things in my soul? Can you, with your great kindness, stop even the tempting thoughts that come to me in sleep? Lord, please give me more and more of your gifts, so my soul can follow you, free from the sticky trap of lust. Let my soul not fight against itself, even in dreams, and not do or agree to these dirty thoughts that come from my senses and harm my body. It’s not too hard for you, God, who can do way more than we can imagine, to make sure that no bad feelings can give pleasure to a pure person, even while sleeping. This can happen not just someday, but even now, at my age. But since I’m still struggling with these bad things, I have told you everything, my good Lord. I’m happy and thankful for what you’ve given me but sad for what I still do wrong. I trust that you will finish your work in me, so I can have complete peace inside and out, especially when death is overcome forever.

There is another “problem of the day” I wish I could handle better.

By eating and drinking, we fix the daily wear and tear on our bodies until the day you will get rid of food and hunger, when you will give us something amazing and eternal, and change our weak bodies into perfect ones.

But right now, I enjoy the habit of eating and drinking, and I have to fight against this pleasure so it doesn’t control me. So I fight a daily battle by fasting, always “bringing my body under control.” After this, my pain is replaced by pleasure. Hunger and thirst really hurt, like a fever, and they destroy us unless food comes to make us better. And since the food we eat comes from your gifts—like land, water, and air—that help our weakness, even this trouble can feel like a kind of pleasure.

You have taught me that I should think of food as medicine. But when I go from feeling empty to feeling full, that moment is a trap for me. The change is nice, and there’s no other way to go through it because we have to eat. Even though we eat and drink for health, there is a tricky pleasure that comes along. It tries to take over and make me want to eat just for fun, not just for health. The two don’t have the same limits. What’s enough for health is not enough for pleasure. Often, pleasure wants more than health does.
