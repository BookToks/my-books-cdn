What do we really want? Why do we work in public service? Can we hope for more than just being ‘friends of the emperor’? But that pride is weak and full of danger! We have to go through so much risk to reach even bigger risks. When will we ever succeed? But if I choose to be a friend of God, look, I can do that right now.” He said this, and while struggling with his new life, he looked back at the book and kept reading. Inside, he was changing, as you saw, and the world seemed to fade from his mind, which soon became clear to others. As he read with a heart full of storms, he groaned more than once. Finally, he found a better path and decided to follow it. Then, becoming your servant, he said to his friend: “Now I have let go of those old hopes, and I am determined to serve God; I start this service right here and now. If you don’t want to follow me, please don’t stop me.” His friend said he would stay loyal and join in this great service for such a big reward. So both became yours and started to “build a tower,” counting the cost—giving up everything they had to follow you. 

Shortly after, Ponticianus and his friend, who had been walking in another part of the garden, came looking for them and found them in the same place. They reminded them it was getting late and time to go back. But the first two told Ponticianus about their decision and how their choice had grown strong. They asked him not to be upset if they didn’t join them. Ponticianus and his friend, though not changing their own plans, felt sad but also happy for their friends’ godly choice and asked them to pray for them. Then, with their minds turning back to worldly things, they returned to the palace. But the other two, thinking about heavenly things, stayed in the cottage. Both had fiancées who, when they heard what was happening, also promised to stay pure for you.

CHAPTER VII

16. That’s the story Ponticianus told. While he was talking, Lord, you made me look at myself honestly. You took me away from hiding behind excuses and made me face myself so I could see how ugly and messed up I really was. I looked and hated what I saw. But I didn’t know where to run from myself. When I tried to look away, the story kept going, and you forced me to face my sins and hate them. I had known about my faults but acted like I didn’t—I ignored them and forgot about them.

17. The more I admired those who gave themselves fully to you to be healed, the more I hated myself when I compared myself to them. Many years—maybe twelve—had passed since I was nineteen, when reading Cicero’s Hortensius made me want wisdom. And here I was, still putting off changing and stuck in spying and secret police work. They were everywhere and usually feared by the people.
