When the sound of the hatchet was heard, the silversmiths downstairs started whispering to each other and sent people to catch whoever was making the noise. The thief heard them and ran away, leaving his hatchet behind because he was scared of getting caught with it. Alypius, who hadn’t seen the thief come in, caught a quick glimpse of him rushing out. Curious about what was going on, Alypius went up to where the hatchet was and stood there thinking. Suddenly, the men sent to catch the thief found him alone, holding the hatchet that had made the noise. They grabbed him and dragged him away, gathering the market tenants around them and bragging that they had caught a famous thief.

Then, he was taken to face the judge.

But that’s where the lesson stopped. Right away, Lord, you came to prove his innocence because you were the only one who truly knew the truth. As he was being taken to jail or punishment, the master builder in charge of public buildings showed up. The captors were happy to see him because they had once thought he was stealing things from the market. Now, they hoped to prove to him who the real thief was. But the builder had met Alypius before at a senator’s house, where Alypius often went. He recognized him immediately, took his hand, and pulled him aside to find out what had happened. After hearing the story, he told the noisy and angry crowd to follow him to the young man’s house where the theft happened.

Outside the house was a very young slave boy who wasn’t afraid to tell the truth. He had followed his master to the market. Alypius knew the boy and whispered to the builder. The builder showed the boy the hatchet and asked whose it was. “Ours,” the boy said right away. When asked more, the boy told the whole story.

So the blame was put on that household, and the crowd that had been celebrating Alypius’s capture felt ashamed. Alypius went home wiser and more experienced—a man who would later become a leader and judge in the Church.

I found Alypius in Rome, and we were very close. He went with me to Milan so he wouldn’t be separated from me and so he could get some legal experience. He had trained in law mainly to please his parents but had already worked three times as an assistant judge. He was honest, which surprised many people, though he thought it was strange when others cared more about money than doing the right thing.

His character was tested not only by the temptation of money but also by fear. In Rome, he worked as an assistant to the Italian Treasury secretary. At that time, a very powerful senator, feared by many, demanded a favor that was against the law. Alypius refused to agree. They offered him a bribe, but he completely rejected it. They threatened him too, but he didn’t back down. Everyone was amazed by his courage because he didn’t want the friendship or fear the anger of such a powerful man, who was known for helping friends and harming enemies. Even the official Alypius advised didn’t want to say no openly and tried to pass the responsibility to Alypius, saying he wouldn’t let him approve the illegal favor.
