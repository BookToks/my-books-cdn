I always try to free myself whenever I want. But because words are so important to them, they get inside me and try to find a special place in my heart. I can hardly find the right spot for them. Sometimes, I think I respect them too much when I see that our minds feel more deeply moved by holy words when they are sung than when they are just spoken. I realize that different feelings in our spirits match perfectly with the voice and song, connected by some secret link I don’t understand. But the pleasures of my body—which the mind should never give in to or be weakened by—often trick me. When my senses don’t listen to reason, they try to take charge and lead instead of following carefully. So, I make mistakes without realizing it, but later I understand what I’ve done wrong.

On the other hand, when I try really hard to avoid this kind of mistake, I go too far in being strict. Sometimes, I even wish all the beautiful melodies used with David’s Psalms would be taken away from me and the Church. When I’m in this mood, I remember a story about Athanasius, a bishop of Alexandria, who made people read psalms almost like speaking instead of singing.

But then I think about the tears I cried at the songs in your Church when I first found my faith again, and how even now I’m moved—not by the singing itself but by the words sung clearly and skillfully. So, I see that singing has a good purpose. I go back and forth between enjoying it too much and using it in a healthy way. I tend to agree—though I’m not sure— that singing in church is good because it helps people with weaker faith feel more devoted by pleasing their ears. But when I find myself moved more by the singing than by the words, I admit I’ve done wrong, and I wish I hadn’t heard the singing at all. See how confused I am! Cry with me, and cry for me, those who can control their feelings and get good results. If you don’t do that, this doesn’t matter to you. But you, Lord my God, please listen, look, have mercy, and heal me—you who see that I’m confused even to myself. This is my weakness.

There are also the pleasures of my eyes that I need to confess here, in front of kind and understanding ears. This will finish the list of bodily temptations that still attack me while I long to be clothed with my heavenly home. My eyes love beautiful shapes and bright, nice colors. I don’t want these to control my soul! Instead, I want God to have it—He made all these things very good. He is what’s truly good, not these pleasures. The things I see affect me all the time I’m awake. I don’t get a break from them like I sometimes do from music, which I can escape by being quiet. Daylight, the queen of colors, fills everything I look at wherever I go.
