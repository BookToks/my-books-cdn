Augustine talks about how the visible things in the sky and on earth come from an earlier, unseen source. He looks closely at the idea of “unformed matter” and the original “possibility” that God created out of nothing. He finds a clue about this in the confusing Bible phrase “the heaven of heavens.” 

He realizes that his way of understanding Genesis 1:1-2 isn’t the only possible one. So, he discusses how there can be many ways to interpret the Bible. During this, he explains different true interpretations of the Scripture. He says it’s important to be open to different ideas when there are many options, but also to be sure about the main Christian beliefs.

Chapter I  
My heart feels deeply moved, Lord, when Your Holy Scripture speaks to me in this simple life. Because human minds are limited, we often use many words to ask questions. Asking takes longer than getting answers, and knocking is more active than opening the door. But You promised, and who can break that promise? “If God is for us, who can be against us?” “Ask, and you will receive; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened.” These are Your promises, so why should anyone be afraid of being tricked when truth is promised?

Chapter II  
I humbly praise You because You made heaven and earth. This heaven I see and the earth I walk on — and the “earth” I carry inside me — You made all of them.

But where is that “heaven of heavens,” Lord, which the Psalm talks about? “The heaven of heavens is the Lord’s, but the earth He gave to humans.” Where is the heaven we can’t see, compared to the earth we see? Everything we can see was beautifully made — though not perfectly everywhere — and our earth is the lowest part. Still, compared to that “heaven of heavens,” even our sky is just like earth. It’s not wrong to call both the earth and sky “earth” when you compare them to that highest heaven, which belongs to the Lord.
