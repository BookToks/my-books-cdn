I heard a voice inside my head, talking about my deafness and crying out: “Man, what my Scripture says, I say. But it talks about time, while my Word is not affected by time—it has always existed with me. So, the things you see through my Spirit, I see too; and what you say through my Spirit, I say as well. But while you see these things happening in time, I don’t see them that way; and when you speak about them in time, I don’t speak about them in time.”  

And I heard this, Lord my God, and felt a little bit of sweetness from your truth. I understood that some people don’t like your works. They say you made many things because you had to—like the pattern of the stars and the sky—but didn’t make them from yourself. They think these things were created somewhere else and you just put them together, like building walls from defeated enemies so they can’t rebel again.  

They also say that you didn’t make or arrange other things, like animals, tiny creatures, and plants rooted in the earth. They believe a hostile mind, not made by you and against you, created all these things deep in the world. These people are crazy because they don’t see your works through your Spirit and don’t recognize you in them.  

But for those who see these things through your Spirit, it is really you who sees them in those things. So when they see that these things are good, it is you who sees they are good. And when something pleases us because of you, it is you who makes us happy with those things. The things that please us through your Spirit also please you in us.  

“For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit? In the same way, no one knows God’s thoughts except the Spirit of God. We haven’t received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit of God, so that we can understand the gifts freely given to us by God.”  

I was told to say: “Yes, no one knows God’s thoughts except God’s Spirit. But how do we know what God gives us?” The answer is: “We know these things through His Spirit, because only the Spirit of God knows them.” Just like people who speak through God’s Spirit don’t actually speak by themselves, those who know through God’s Spirit don’t truly know by themselves, and those who see something is good through God’s Spirit aren’t the ones really seeing—it is God who sees it is good.  

So, it’s one thing to think something is bad when it is actually good, like the people I mentioned before. It’s another thing when someone sees that something is good—as many people do when they like your creation because it is good—but what they really enjoy is not you. They prefer to find their happiness in your creations instead of in you. It’s still another thing when a person sees that something is good, but...
