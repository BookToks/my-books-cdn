You hear things through your body, but you don’t want the words to stay with you forever. Instead, you want them to pass by so others can hear them too. When something is made of many parts that don’t happen at the same time, the whole thing is more enjoyable than just the parts on their own. But even better than all of this is the One who made everything. He is our God and He never goes away, because nothing can take His place.

If you like physical things, thank God for them, but make sure your love goes back to their Creator. Otherwise, you might upset Him by loving the things more than Him. If you love people’s souls, love them in God. Souls change on their own, but in God, they are strong and steady. Without God, souls wouldn’t even exist. So love souls through Him, and bring as many people as you can to Him. Tell them: “Let’s love God, because He made everything and is always near. He didn’t just make us and leave. We belong to Him and are in Him. Look, He is everywhere truth is known. He is deep inside our hearts, even if our hearts have wandered away from Him. Come back to your heart, everyone who has gone wrong, and hold on to the One who made you. Stand with Him and you will be strong. Rest in Him and you will find peace. Where are you going on these hard paths? The good things you love come from Him, and if you love them for Him, they are good and pleasant. But if you don’t love Him and turn away from Him to love created things, those good things will turn bitter. So why keep wandering on these difficult roads? There is no rest where you are looking. Keep searching, but remember, what you want isn’t there. You want a happy life in a place of death. That’s impossible. How can life be happy where there is no life?”

But our Life came down to earth, faced death, and beat it by giving His own endless life. He called us loudly to come back to Him, the secret place He came from—first coming into a virgin’s womb, joining with human flesh so it wouldn’t stay mortal forever. He came like a bridegroom leaving his room, joyful and strong, ready to run a race. He didn’t wait but ran through the world, calling us with His words, actions, death, life, going down and rising up—calling us to come back to Him. Then He left our sight so we could return to our hearts and find Him there. Though He couldn’t stay long with us, He didn’t leave us. He went back to the place He never left, because He made the world. He was here in the world and came to save sinners. I admit to Him, and He heals my soul because I’ve sinned against Him. People, how long will your hearts be slow? Even now, after Life itself has come to you, won’t you rise up and live? But where will you climb if you’re already on top and have looked against the sky? First come down so you can climb up—to God. You fell trying to climb without Him. Tell this to the people you love so they can cry and come with you to God. It’s by His spirit that you say these things, if you speak with the fire of love.
