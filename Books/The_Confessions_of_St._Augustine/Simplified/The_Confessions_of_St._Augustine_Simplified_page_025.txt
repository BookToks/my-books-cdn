If a person is not married, they can focus on serving the Lord and trying to please Him. But someone who is married has to care about things in the world and pleasing their spouse. I should have paid more attention to these words. If I had, and chosen to live like a “eunuch for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake,” I would have been much happier waiting for your love.

But I was foolish. I let my bad desires take over like a wild sea, and I left you behind, following my own selfish ways. I broke all your rules. Still, I couldn’t escape your punishments. Who could?

Everyone praised my father because he spent more than he could afford to help me study far away. Many richer people didn’t do that for their kids. But this same father didn’t care at all about whether I was growing closer to you or living a pure life. All he wanted was for me to be good at talking, even if my heart, which belongs to you, was empty and uncared for.

When I was sixteen, I lived with my parents and had a break from school because we didn’t have enough money. The bad desires grew strong around me, but no one tried to stop them.
