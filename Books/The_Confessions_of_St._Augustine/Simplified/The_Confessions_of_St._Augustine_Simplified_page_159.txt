CHAPTER VII  
9. You want us to understand the Word — the God who is always with you — which has been spoken forever and by which everything else has been spoken forever too. What was spoken first wasn’t just finished and then something else was said later; all things were spoken at the same time and will be forever. If it weren’t like this, then there would be time and change, and there wouldn’t be a true forever or true immortality.

I know this, God, and I thank you. I know it and confess it, Lord, and anyone who isn’t ungrateful for these truths knows and praises you with me. We know this much: whenever something stops being what it was and becomes what it wasn’t before, it disappears or comes into being. But nothing in your Word ever disappears or goes back to where it was before because it is really eternal and immortal. So, with the Word that has always been with you, you say everything at the same time and forever.

And whatever you say will be made, and you make nothing except by speaking. Still, not everything you make by speaking happens at the same time or lasts forever.

CHAPTER VIII  
10. Why is this, Lord my God? I kind of understand it, but I don’t know how to explain it well except by saying that everything that starts to exist and then stops exists and stops because it is known in your eternal Reason that it should start or stop — in your eternal Reason where nothing actually starts or stops. This is your Word, which is also “the Beginning,” because it speaks to us.  

In the gospel, he spoke through a human body, and people heard it so they would believe and look for the truth inside themselves, where it can be found in eternal Truth. This is where the good and only Master teaches all his followers. There, Lord, I hear your voice, the voice of someone speaking to me, because the one who teaches us truly speaks to us. But if someone doesn’t teach us, they don’t really speak to us, even if they talk.  

Who teaches us except the unchanging Truth? Even when we learn from the changing world around us, it leads us to the unchanging Truth. That’s where we truly learn when we listen, and we’re very happy “because of the bridegroom’s voice,” which brings us back to where we came from. If the Beginning wasn’t unchanging, there wouldn’t be a place for us to return to when we’ve gone the wrong way. But when we come back from mistakes, it’s because we learn and gain knowledge. To help us learn, he teaches us, since he is the Beginning and speaks to us.

CHAPTER IX  
11. In this Beginning, God, you made heaven and earth — through your Word, your Son, your Power, your Wisdom, your Truth — all wonderfully speaking and creating. Who can understand these things or explain them?

What is it that shines through me and hits my heart without hurting it, making me both shake and burn? I shake because I’m not like it; I burn because I am like it.
