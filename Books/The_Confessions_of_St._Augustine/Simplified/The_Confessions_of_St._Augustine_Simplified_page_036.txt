There was a fool, without good sense, who in Solomon’s strange story sat at the house’s door and said, “Stolen water tastes sweet, and bread eaten in secret is nice.” This woman tricked me because she found my soul open and focused only on my body’s feelings and on the things I had experienced through my senses.

I didn’t understand the real, deeper truth, the true Being. So, I was easily fooled by people asking me tricky questions like: “Where does evil come from?” and “Is God limited like a body, with hair and nails?” and “Should we admire the old heroes who had many wives, killed men, and sacrificed animals?” I was confused by these questions and thought I was moving toward the truth, but I was actually moving away from it. I didn’t know that evil isn’t a real thing but just the absence of good. How could I know this when I only saw physical things and my mind was full of illusions?

I didn’t understand that God is a spirit without a body or parts like length or width. God doesn’t have a size or shape because if something has parts, each part is smaller than the whole. If God is infinite, He can’t be broken into smaller parts. God is everywhere as a spirit. I also didn’t know about the part inside us that makes us like God, which the Bible calls being made “in God’s image.”

I also didn’t know what true inner goodness is. It’s not about following customs but about following God’s perfect law. Different places and times have different rules, but God’s law stays the same everywhere and always. Because of this, people like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and David were truly good. Only foolish people judged them as bad because they used human rules instead of God’s law. It’s like someone who doesn’t know how armor works putting a leg guard on their head and then complaining it doesn’t fit. Or like complaining about not being allowed to sell things in the afternoon when it was allowed in the morning. Or getting upset because one person in a house can do something another isn’t allowed to do.

Some people can’t accept that things that were allowed for good people in the past aren’t allowed now. Or that God commanded one thing before and something different now, but both follow God’s good will. They should understand that in one person, one day, or one house, different rules can apply to different people. Something that was allowed before might not be allowed later. And something allowed in one place might be forbidden and punished in another.
