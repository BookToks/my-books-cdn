CHAPTER XIII

34. Now that my heart has healed from that pain—as much as it can be blamed on human feelings—I’m crying different tears to you, God. These tears come from a spirit that’s broken because I think about how every soul that dies in Adam is in danger. Even before she was free from her body, she was “made alive” in Christ and lived in a way that praised your name through her faith and actions. But I can’t say that after you made her new through baptism, she never spoke against your rules. Your Son, who is the Truth, said, “Whoever calls his brother a fool risks going to hell.” Even a good person could be judged if your mercy didn’t cover their faults. But since you don’t look too hard for our mistakes, we hope we can be with you. And if someone talks about their good deeds, they are really just talking about gifts you gave them. Oh, if only people really understood themselves, then anyone proud of their good deeds would be proud because of you!

35. So now, my Praise and my Life, God of my heart, I forget her good deeds for a moment, even though I thank you happily for them. Instead, I ask you to forgive my mother’s sins. Please listen to me through the Healing of our wounds—Jesus, who hung on the cross and now sits next to you, praying for us. I know she was kind and forgave those who owed her. I ask you to forgive her for all the wrongs she has done since she was saved by baptism. Please forgive her, Lord; don’t judge her. Let your mercy be greater than your justice, because your words are true and you promised mercy to those who show mercy. This is your gift—you have mercy on whoever you want and show compassion to whoever you choose.

36. I believe you’ve already done what I ask, but please accept my words as a gift, Lord. When her death was near, she didn’t worry about having her body wrapped in fancy cloth or spices. She didn’t want a fancy tomb or even to be buried in her own country. She didn’t give any orders about these things. She only wanted her name remembered at your altar, where she served every day without missing one. She knew that at your altar, the holy sacrifice wiped away the debts against us and defeated the enemy who tried to bring charges against us. 

Who can pay back the innocent blood? Who can repay the price to take us back from him? Your handmaid tied her soul to this sacrifice with faith. Let nothing separate her from your protection. Let no “lion” or “dragon” block her way.
