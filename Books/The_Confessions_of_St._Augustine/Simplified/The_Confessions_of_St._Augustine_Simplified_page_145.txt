Thanksgiving is important; and eating certain foods doesn’t make us better or closer to God; no one should judge others for what they eat or drink. Those who eat shouldn’t look down on those who don’t, and those who don’t eat shouldn’t judge those who do. I have learned these lessons, and I thank God for opening my mind and heart. Please help me stay strong against temptation!

I’m not afraid of eating meat itself, but I worry about having too much desire or craving for food. I know that God allowed Noah to eat any kind of meat, Elijah was given meat to eat, and John the Baptist ate locusts without being harmed. But I also know that Esau made a mistake because he wanted lentils too much, David felt bad for just wanting water, and Jesus was tempted with bread, not meat. So, the people in the desert didn’t do wrong because they wanted meat, but because they complained about God while wanting food.

Right now, I am fighting my desire for food and drink every day. It’s not something I can just stop all at once like I did with other bad habits. I have to find a balance, not too loose and not too strict. And honestly, who can say they never want more than they should? If someone can, they are amazing and should praise God. But I’m not like that—I’m a sinner. Still, I praise God because Jesus, who overcame the world, prays for me, accepting me even though I’m weak. God knows everything about me and writes it down.

I’m not really tempted by nice smells. When there aren’t any, I don’t miss them; when they are there, I don’t refuse them; and I’m ready to live without them if I have to. At least, that’s how I see myself. But maybe I’m wrong. Our minds can trick us because we don’t always understand our own strength until we face real challenges. No one should feel completely safe in this life, which is like a test. People who have gotten better can also get worse again. Our only hope and trust is God’s mercy.

Music and sounds used to attract me a lot, but God helped me break free. Now, I still find comfort in songs inspired by God’s words, sung beautifully, but I don’t hold onto them too tightly.
