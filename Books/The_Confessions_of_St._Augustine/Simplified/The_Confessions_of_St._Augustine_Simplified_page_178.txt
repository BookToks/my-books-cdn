After this: that it may live in your house all its life (and what is its life but you? And what are your days but your forever, like your years that never end, since you are the same always?)—from this, I say, let the soul understand (as much as it can) how much higher than all time you are in your forever; and how your house has never left you; and even though it wasn't made at the same time as you, it always stays close to you and never changes with time. This is clear to me when I think about you; may it become clearer and clearer, I ask you, and may I live calmly under your protection.

Now, I don’t know what kind of shapelessness exists in the changes of these lowest creatures. But who will tell me, except someone who, feeling empty inside, gets confused by their own thoughts? Who else would say that if all shape disappeared, only shapelessness would remain, which would change things from one kind to another, meaning pure shapelessness would also change with time? That can’t be true, because without movement, there is no time, and without shape, there is no change.

I have thought about these things as you have helped me, O my God, as you made me want to seek and opened the door when I tried. I find two things you made, not inside time, although both were not made at the same time as you. One of them is made so that, without any breaks or changes, it can fully enjoy your forever and unchanging nature. The other has no shape at all, so it can’t change from one form to another, and time doesn’t affect it. But you did not leave it shapeless, because before any “day” at the start, you made heaven and earth—these are the two things I talked about.

But “the earth was invisible and unformed, and darkness was over the abyss.” These words tell us about its shapelessness—so that people who can’t fully imagine having no shape at all won’t think it means nothing. From this shapelessness, a second heaven and a second earth could be made—visible and well formed, with the beauty of the waters and everything else that was created (though not without days) when this world was made. And all this happens because these things are arranged so that changes over time can happen through movement and shape.

Meanwhile, this is what I understand, O my God, when I hear your Scripture say, “In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth, but the earth was invisible and unformed, and darkness was over the abyss.” It does not say on which day you made these things. For now, I understand that “heaven of heavens” means the heaven we understand with our minds, where understanding means knowing everything all at once—not in parts, not unclear, not like looking through a foggy window—but all at the same time, clearly, “face to face.” It’s not this thing now and another thing later, but knowledge all at once without any change over time.

And by the invisible and unformed earth, I understand something that doesn’t change with time. Changes over time usually mean having one thing now...
