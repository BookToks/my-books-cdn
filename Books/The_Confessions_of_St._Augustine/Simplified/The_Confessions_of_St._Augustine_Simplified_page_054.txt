BOOK FIVE  
A year of big decisions. Faustus comes to Carthage, but Augustine is disappointed because he can’t find clear proof that the Manichean beliefs are true. He decides to leave the problems he knows in Carthage and face new, unknown problems in Rome. His time in Rome is also disappointing, so he applies for a teaching job in Milan.

There, he meets Ambrose. Ambrose impresses him with his strong faith in Catholic Christianity and shows him how to understand the Bible in a deeper, symbolic way. Augustine decides to start learning about Christianity.

CHAPTER I  
1. Please accept my honest confession as a gift from my mouth. You made me and helped me praise your name. Heal me completely and let my whole being say, “O Lord, who is like you?” It’s not that I’m teaching you anything by confessing, because you know everything inside me already. My closed heart doesn’t hide anything from you, and you can soften it whenever you want, either by kindness or punishment. No one can hide from your power.

But I want my soul to praise you because it loves you, and I want to thank you for your mercy. Everything you made praises you all the time: people praise you with their words, while animals and even lifeless things praise you through those who think deeply about them.

Our souls can rise above their tiredness and lean on the things you created, and through them, reach you, the one who made them so wonderfully. With you, there is rest and true strength.

CHAPTER II  
2. Let those who are restless and do wrong go away and run from you. Still, you see them clearly, even when they hide in darkness. They live in a beautiful world but are dirty inside. How have they hurt you? How could they make your perfect power less? They run away so they won’t see you, but you see them. They want to be blind and stumble into you anyway.

You don’t forget anything you made. The unrighteous trip over you because they deserve punishment, running from your kindness and crashing into your justice, falling on their own rough paths. They don’t realize that you are everywhere; no place can hold you, and you are close even to those who try to run far away.

So let them turn back and look for you, because even if they have left you, their Creator, you have not left them. Let them come back and find you—in their hearts, where you live in those who confess to you. Let them come to you and cry on your shoulder after all their mistakes.
