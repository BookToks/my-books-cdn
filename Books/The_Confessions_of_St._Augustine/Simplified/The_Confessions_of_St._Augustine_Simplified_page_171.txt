But “your loving kindness is better than life itself,” so notice how my life is just stretching out, and how your right hand has held me up through my Lord, the Son of Man, the one who connects you, the One, with all of us—in many ways and by many means. Through him, I can hold on to you, the one who also holds on to me; and I can leave my old life behind to follow him and forget what’s past, no longer stretched out but pulled together again—reaching not for things that will come and go but for what is ahead. Now, I follow with focus, aiming for the prize of my heavenly calling, where I can hear your praise and enjoy your joys, which never begin or end.

But now my years are filled with sadness. And you, Lord, are my comfort, my eternal Father. I have been caught between times, not knowing their order, and my thoughts—even the deepest parts of my soul—are confused by many troubles until I flow into you, purified and shaped by the fire of your love.

And I will be steady and fixed in you, and your truth will shape me.

I won’t have to deal with the questions from people who, like a sickness, want more than they can handle and ask, “What did God make before he made heaven and earth?” or, “How did he even think to make something when he had never made anything before?” Help them, Lord, to think carefully about what they say; help them understand that where there is no time, they can’t say “never.” So when it’s said God “never made” something, it just means it was made outside of time. Let them see that time couldn’t exist without the created world, and stop saying silly things like this. Let them focus on what’s in front of them and realize that you, the eternal Creator, are before all time, and nothing exists alongside you in time—not even things that seem “above time.”

Oh Lord my God, what a huge mystery is in your deep secret! How far my sins have pushed me away from it! Heal my eyes so I can enjoy your light. Surely, if there is a mind that knows everything, past and future, as clearly as I know a song I have sung, that mind would be amazing and unbelievable. Because everything past and future would be as clear to that mind as the parts of the song I have sung and the parts still left to sing.

But far be it from you, Creator of the universe and of our souls and bodies, that you only know all things past and future. You know them in a far more wonderful and mysterious way—not like someone who just remembers a familiar song.
