There was someone who couldn’t be talked about directly, only as “moving over.” But why couldn’t he be introduced in any other way besides “moving over”?

Now, if you can, try to understand what the apostle means when he says, “Your love is poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who is given to us.” The Holy Spirit teaches us about spiritual gifts and shows us a better way to love. The Spirit also prays for us, so we can truly understand the amazing love of Christ. From the very start, the one above everything was “moving over” the waters.

Who can I tell this to? How can I explain the strong pull of desire that drags us down into darkness, and the love that lifts us up by your Spirit, who moved over the waters? Who can I tell this to? How can I explain it?

Desire and love aren’t just places we fall into or are lifted out of. They’re both feelings and types of love. Our own unclean spirit pulls us down with a love for worldly things. But your Spirit lifts us up with a love that frees us from worry—so we can lift our hearts to you, where your Spirit “moves over the waters.” This way, we reach the highest peace where our souls have passed through the waters that don’t support us.

The angels fell, and so did the human soul. This shows us the deep darkness of the abyss, which could have swallowed all spiritual creation if you hadn’t said at the beginning, “Let there be light,” and it appeared. Also, if every obedient mind in your heavenly city hadn’t stayed with you and rested in your Spirit, which moved unchanging over everything that changes. Without this, even the highest heaven would just be a dark shadow, not the bright place it is now because of the Lord.

Even in the sad misery of the fallen spirits, who show their own darkness when they lose your light, you still show how great you made the reason and soul. Nothing but you can bring true peace and happiness to them. And certainly, they can’t be truly happy by themselves.

You, God, will light up our darkness. From you will come our clothes of light, and then our darkness will be like bright noon. Give yourself to me, God. Come back to me! Look, I love you, and if that’s not enough, let me love you even more. I can’t measure my love to know how far I am from being ready to be in your arms and not be turned away until I’m safe in “the secret place of your presence.” I only know this: my life is full of sadness without you—not just on the outside, but deep inside. Everything I have that isn’t you is really nothing.
