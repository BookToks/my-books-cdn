I felt deep in my heart that there was no doubt about this. I should have been more surprised that I’m alive than that the Truth exists—the Truth that is clearly seen and understood from everything around us.

I looked at everything else that is below you, and I realized they are not completely real but not completely fake either. They are real because they come from you, but not real in the same way as you are. What is truly real never changes. It is good for me to hold on to God because if I don’t stay connected with him, I won’t really stay connected with myself. But God, who always stays the same, makes everything new. You are my God because you don’t need me to be good.

It became clear to me that everything is good, even if it can be damaged or corrupted. Things couldn’t be corrupted if they were the highest kind of good; but if they weren’t good at all, they couldn’t be corrupted either. Corruption hurts, but it can only hurt if it takes away some good. So, if something gets corrupted, it loses some good. If something loses all its good, it will stop existing. Things that can’t be corrupted will only get better because they stay good. It’s crazy to think that losing all good makes something better. So, as long as something exists, it is good. 

That means evil, which I was trying to understand, isn’t really a thing. If evil was a thing, it would be good. Either it would be a perfect and unchanging good, or a thing that could be corrupted only if it was good. I understood that you made everything good, and there is nothing that you didn’t make. Since everything you made is not the same, each thing is good in its own way, and all of them together are very good because our God made everything very good.

To you, there is no such thing as evil, and even in all your creation together, there isn’t any evil. Nothing from outside your creation can come in and mess up the order you set for it. But inside creation, some things don’t fit well with others and seem evil. Yet those same things fit well with other parts and are good in themselves. Even the things that don’t fit together still fit with the lower parts of creation, like the earth, which has its own order.
