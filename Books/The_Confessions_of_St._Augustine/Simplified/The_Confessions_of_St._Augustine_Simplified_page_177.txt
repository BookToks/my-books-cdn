It stays the same and sticks to you without ever changing from the moment it was made, going beyond all the constant changes of time. But this shapelessness—this invisible, formless earth—was not counted as part of the days themselves. Because where there is no shape or order, nothing really comes or goes, and where this doesn’t happen, there are no days or any passing of time.

  
CHAPTER X 10. Oh Truth, oh light of my heart, please don’t let my own darkness talk to me! I had fallen into that darkness and felt lost because of it. But even there, deep inside, I came to love you. I got lost, but I still remembered you. I heard your voice behind me, calling me back, even though it was hard to hear over the noise of my wild emotions. And now, look, I am coming back, burning and thirsty for your fountain. Don’t let anyone stop me; here I will drink and find life. Don’t let me live for myself, because living for myself has been bad. I was like death to myself; in you, I have come alive. Talk to me; be with me. I have trusted your books, and their words feel very deep.

  
CHAPTER XI 11. You have already told me, Lord, with a strong voice inside me, that you are eternal and alone have immortality. You don’t change by any shape or movement, and your will doesn’t change over time, because any will that changes is not immortal. This is clear to me when I see you; please make it clearer and clearer. In that light, let me live calmly under your protection.

You also told me, Lord, with a strong voice inside me, that you created all natures and all things, which are not what you are, but they still exist. Only what is nothing at all is not from you, and turning your will away from you—who are—is a sin. No one’s sin hurts you or messes up your rule, not at the start or the end. All this is clear to me when I see you; please make it clearer and clearer, and let me live calmly under your protection.

12. Also, you told me, with a strong voice inside me, that this creation—whose joy is only you—is not eternal with you. It depends on you completely and never changes its own nature, because you are always with it; it sticks to you with all its love, having no future to wait for and no past to remember; it doesn’t change and isn’t stretched by time.

Oh blessed one—if there is such a thing—holding on to your blessedness! It is blessed in you, its forever home and its light. I can’t find a better name for “the heaven above all heavens” than “Your house”—which looks at your joys without turning to anything else and which, with a pure and steady mind, brings everything together in the peace of holy spirits who live in your city in the heavens above this visible sky.

13. From this, a soul that has wandered far from you should understand—if it now thirsts for you; if its tears have become its daily food, while people keep asking, “Where is your God?”; if now it asks you for just one thing and seeks you.
