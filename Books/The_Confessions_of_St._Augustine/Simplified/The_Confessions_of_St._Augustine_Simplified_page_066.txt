BOOK SIX  
Trouble in the twenties. Monica follows Augustine to Milan and finds him learning about the Catholic Church. Both like Ambrose, but Augustine doesn’t get help from him with his personal problems. Driven by ambition, Alypius and Nebridius join Augustine in a confused search for a happy life. Augustine gets engaged, ends things with his first girlfriend, starts seeing another, and keeps looking for the truth without success.

CHAPTER I  
1. Oh hope from my youth, where were you when I needed you? You made me different from animals and birds, smarter than they are. But I was lost, wandering in the dark, looking for you outside myself and not finding the God inside my heart. I had gone very deep down, lost my faith, and felt hopeless about ever finding the truth.

By then, my mother had come to me. She bravely followed me across the sea and land, trusting in you through all the dangers of the trip. During the scary moments on the ship, she comforted the sailors—people who were used to calming worried travelers—and told them we would arrive safely because you showed her that in a vision.

She found me in great danger because I had given up hope of ever finding the truth.

When I told her I was no longer a Manichean, but not yet a Catholic, she didn’t get wildly excited like it was a surprise. She had already been comforted about that part of my struggle, which made her sad as if I were dead but also hopeful that I would be raised up again. She had carried me in her thoughts like a mother carrying her son’s body, waiting for you to say, “Young man, get up!” Then he would wake and speak, and you would give him back to his mother. So, she wasn’t upset or overly happy when she heard that a big part of what she prayed for had already happened—that even though I hadn’t found the full truth, I was saved from false ideas. Instead, she strongly believed that you, who promised everything, would give her the rest. Calm and with full trust, she told me she believed that before she died, she would see me a true Catholic. She said no more than that.

But to you, O Fountain of mercy, she prayed even more with tears, asking you to help me quickly and clear my darkness. She went to church more often and listened closely to Ambrose, praying for the life-giving water that never runs out. She loved Ambrose like an angel because she knew he had helped me get this far to the shaky place I was in now. She was sure I would get better, even if it would be after a harder struggle, which doctors call “the crisis.”
