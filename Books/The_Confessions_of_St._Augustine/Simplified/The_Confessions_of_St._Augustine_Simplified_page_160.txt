It is Wisdom itself shining through me, clearing away the confusion that often overwhelms me and makes me feel lost and tired in the darkness and burden of my punishment. My strength feels weak and I can’t even enjoy my blessings until you, Lord, who have been kind to all my wrongdoings, also heal all my weaknesses. You are the one who “will save my life from decay, crown me with love and kindness, and satisfy me with good things so that my youth will be renewed like an eagle’s.”  

Because of this hope, we are saved, and through patience, we wait for your promises. Let anyone who can hear you speak to their inner mind. I will shout with confidence because of your own words: “How wonderful are your works, Lord; in wisdom you made them all.” This Wisdom is the Beginning, and through it, you made heaven and earth.

Now, some people who are still stuck in their old selfish ways ask: “What was God doing before he made heaven and earth? If he was doing nothing, why didn’t he just stay that way forever? If God suddenly decided to create something new, how can that be true eternity if something new happened that wasn’t there before? God’s will isn’t created; it exists before anything else because nothing could be made without God’s will. So, the will of God is part of his very being. But if something new appeared in God’s being, then God can’t really be eternal. And if God’s will to create was eternal, why isn’t the creation itself eternal too?”  

Those who say these things don’t yet understand you, God’s Wisdom, the Light of our souls. They don’t understand how things are made by and through you. They try to understand eternal things, but their hearts are still focused on the past and future, which belong to created things, so they are unstable. Who can help them calm down and stay still long enough to see a little bit of the glory of eternity that never ends? Then, by comparing eternity with time, where nothing lasts, they can understand they are very different. A long time only feels long because many things happen one after another, never all at once. But in eternity, nothing passes away and everything is there all at once. No time process happens all at once.  

So, they need to realize that all past time is pushed forward by the future coming in.
