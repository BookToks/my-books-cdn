Even now, you pull from that deep place the soul that looks for you and really wants to be close to you. That soul says, "I have searched for your face; Lord, I will keep looking for you." I was far from you, lost in the dark shadows of my own desires. It’s not about where we walk or go that makes us turn away from you or come back to you. The younger son didn’t take horses, chariots, ships, or fly away with wings to waste everything he had. He just left and wasted what you gave him. You were kind when you gave, and even kinder when he came back with nothing! To be wild or dark in heart is to be far from your face.

Look down, Lord God, and patiently see how people work hard to follow the rules of reading and writing, taught by others who learned before them, but they ignore the real rules of forever salvation that you teach. They care so much about how words sound that if someone says “human” wrong, people get more upset than if someone hates another person, which goes against your commandments. It’s like they think making a mistake in language is worse than hurting someone. But really, the most important writing is the one in our conscience, telling us not to treat others badly.

You are so mysterious, living high above in silence. You are the great God who punishes blind desire that’s wrong! When a person wants to sound smart in front of a judge and a big crowd, and they speak angrily against their enemy, they are very careful not to make a grammar mistake, but they don’t care if their anger hurts someone else deeply.

These were the kinds of things happening around me when I was an unhappy boy. I was more scared of making a language mistake than of being jealous of others who didn’t. I admit this to you, God. People I wanted to please praised me, but I didn’t realize I was falling far from your sight.

In your eyes, I was already shameful because I upset everyone around me and lied endlessly to my tutor, teachers, and parents—all because I loved fun, exciting shows, and wanted to copy what I saw. I stole from my parents’ cellar and table, sometimes because I was greedy, sometimes just to trade with other boys for their toys, which they liked as much as I did. I also tried to win unfairly in these games because I wanted to be the best.

And when I caught others doing what I did, I was so angry and couldn’t stand it. But when I was caught and scolded, I chose to fight back instead of admitting I was wrong. Is this not true?
