They wanted to feel enlightened, but not because of God—they wanted to feel that way on their own. They thought the soul was the same as God, but that only made things more confusing for them. Because of their pride, they moved even farther away from God, who is the true Light that shines on everyone in the world. Think about what you say and feel ashamed; come closer to God and you will be truly enlightened, and you won’t be ashamed anymore.

While I was thinking about whether I should serve God now, like I had planned for a long time, I found myself both wanting and not wanting to do it. It was me who wanted and me who didn’t. I wasn’t completely sure either way.

So, I was fighting with myself and felt torn inside. This fight wasn’t because of someone else, but because of my own mistakes. It wasn’t really me doing this, but the sin inside me—the result of a sin Adam committed long ago, and I am Adam’s child.

If there were as many different natures as there are different desires, then there would be many, not just two. For example, if someone is trying to decide whether to go to a religious meeting or to the theater, some people say, “See, there are two natures—one good pulling one way, the other bad pulling the other way.” But I say both choices can be bad—going there or going to the theater. Yet, they don’t believe the will to go to their meeting can be bad.

Imagine if someone had to choose between going to the theater or to our church. Wouldn’t they also struggle with the decision? They would have to admit, even if they don’t want to, that the desire to go to our church is just as strong as the desire to go to their meeting. Or else, they would have to believe there are two bad natures fighting inside a person, which would prove them wrong because they say one is good and the other is bad. So, they should accept the truth that when someone is deciding, their soul is just torn between different desires.

They shouldn’t say that when two wills fight inside a person, it’s because there are two different minds or two different kinds of people inside, one good and one bad. God shows them they are wrong.

Both choices can be bad. For example, someone might be deciding whether to kill a person by poison or by sword, or whether to take one field or another that belongs to someone else. Or they might be deciding whether to waste money on fun or keep it because they are greedy. Maybe they have to choose between going to the circus or the theater on the same day, or even whether to rob a house or commit adultery if they have the chance—all these desires can pull a person in many directions at the same time, even more than just two.

Even those who believe in two opposing forces don’t say there are many different kinds of forces inside a person. The same idea applies to good desires.

I ask them, “Is it good to enjoy reading the apostle, or to enjoy a serious psalm, or to talk about faith?”
