Everything comes from God, and everything is really good—because we believe that things that are created and given shape are better; and even things that can be created and given shape, though not as good, are still good. But the Bible doesn’t clearly say that God made the formless stuff—just like it doesn’t clearly say He made many other things, like the angels called ‘cherubim’ and ‘seraphim,’ or other kinds of angels the apostle talks about: ‘thrones,’ ‘dominions,’ ‘principalities,’ and ‘powers.’ Still, it’s clear that God made all of these.

When the Bible says ‘He made heaven and earth,’ it means everything. So what about the waters that the Spirit of God moved over? If the waters are part of the ‘earth,’ how can ‘earth’ mean formless stuff when the waters look so beautifully formed? Or if the waters are from the formless stuff, why does the Bible say the firmament (sky) was made from that same formlessness but doesn’t say the waters were made? The waters we see flowing are not formless or invisible. But if the waters got their shape when God said, ‘Let the waters under the sky be gathered together,’ meaning that gathering was their forming, then what about the waters above the sky?

If those waters above the sky are formless, they don’t deserve to be in such an important place. But the Bible doesn’t say exactly how they were made. So if Genesis is quiet about some things God made, and we believe without doubt that God made them, we shouldn’t say those waters have always existed with God just because Genesis doesn’t say when they were made. If Truth teaches us, then we can understand that the formless, invisible stuff called earth and the dark deep were made by God from nothing and didn’t exist forever with Him, even if the story doesn’t say exactly when.

I have heard and thought about these ideas as much as I can, and I admit I don’t fully understand, Lord, though You already know that. I see that there are two kinds of disagreements when things are told, even by reliable people. One is about whether what’s said is true; the other is about what the person telling it meant. It’s one thing to ask what really happened when Creation was made. But it’s another to ask what Moses, your faithful servant, wanted people to understand when he wrote these words.

About the first question, I want to be with those who believe Moses spoke the truth. And I want to be close to You, Lord, and enjoy Your truth with those who love You. Let’s look carefully at Your words and try to understand their meaning through Moses, the one You used to give us these words.

But among all the truths that people who explain the Bible find...
