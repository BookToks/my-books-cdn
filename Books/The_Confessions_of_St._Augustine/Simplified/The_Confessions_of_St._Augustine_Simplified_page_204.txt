Even though angels are perfect, little ones who live in darkness aren’t completely ignored. Let them shine all over the earth, with the sun lighting up the day and sharing wisdom through its light. At night, the moon lights up and shows knowledge. The moon and stars shine at night; the darkness doesn’t stop them, and they shine in their own way. It’s like God said, “Let there be lights in the sky,” and suddenly there was a strong sound from heaven, like a rushing wind, and flames appeared and rested on each of them. Then they became lights in the sky, carrying the Word of life. Move everywhere, holy and beautiful fires, because you are the light of the world and shouldn’t be hidden. Whoever you follow is lifted up, and they have lifted you too. Go everywhere and let everyone see you!

Also, let the sea bring forth your creations, and let the waters be full of living creatures. By separating what is valuable from what is worthless, you become like the mouth of God, who said, “Let the waters bring forth life.” This doesn’t mean the creatures the earth brings, but the living things that crawl and the birds that fly over the earth. Through your holy people, your secrets have spread across the troubled seas of the world, teaching nations about you through Baptism. Many amazing and big things, like huge whales, have been done. The words of your messengers have flown all over the earth, high in the sky like your Book that covers them and gives them authority to go wherever they want. There is no place where their voice isn’t heard because their message has spread everywhere, all thanks to your blessing, Lord.

Am I lying? Am I mixing up the knowledge of things in the sky with the physical things in the sea and on the earth? Some knowledge is solid and clear. It doesn’t change from generation to generation and stands like lights of wisdom. But many physical things show these same ideas in different ways. One thing grows from another, multiplied by your blessing, God, who refreshes our tired human senses so that one idea can be shown in many ways through different physical actions.

“The waters” have brought these mysteries to life, but only because you said so. People who didn’t know your eternal truth needed these things, but they only came through your gospel. It was these “waters,” bitter and still, that brought them up because of your word.
