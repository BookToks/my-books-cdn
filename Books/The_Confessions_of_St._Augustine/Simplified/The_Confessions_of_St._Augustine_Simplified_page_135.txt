Thinking about feelings is like pulling them up from your memory. But why, when someone thinks about emotions, don’t they actually feel the happiness or sadness again? Maybe it’s because the experience isn’t exactly the same.

Who would want to talk about sadness or fear if just saying the words made them feel sad or scared? Yet, we can talk about these feelings because we remember them—not just the sound of the words or pictures in our mind, but the actual experience of those emotions. Our mind knows them from what we’ve felt before and keeps them in memory.

Sometimes, it’s hard to say if all this remembering happens because of images or something else. For example, when I say “stone” or “sun,” those things aren’t in front of me, but I can picture them in my mind. I can talk about pain even when I’m not hurting because I remember what pain feels like. If I didn’t have that memory, I couldn’t tell pain from pleasure. When I’m healthy, I know what that means because I have the memory of being healthy. Even sick people understand “health” because they remember it, even if they don’t feel it now. I can also remember numbers, and those aren’t just images—they’re actual ideas in my mind. When I think of the sun’s image, I’m not thinking of a picture of a picture, but the image itself.

When I say “memory,” I know what I’m talking about. But where do I know it from, if not from memory itself? Does memory know itself through an image, or just as it really is?

If I say “forgetfulness” and understand what it means, how can I do that without remembering it? If I think about the meaning, I have to remember it. So, when I remember memory, memory is aware of itself. But when I remember forgetfulness, both memory and forgetfulness are there—the memory remembering that it forgot something. Forgetfulness means not remembering. So how can something I forget be in my memory? If I remember forgetfulness, then forgetfulness must be stored in memory too. It’s there so I don’t forget what it means, even though I still forget things.

This means that when we remember forgetfulness, it’s not really there by itself, but through an image. If forgetfulness was fully present, it wouldn’t make us remember—it would only make us forget.

Who will figure this out someday? Who can really understand how it works?

Honestly, I struggle with this a lot. Trying to understand it feels like hard work that makes me sweat and stress.
