What is the nature of the eternal life of the saints? It is something no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no heart has ever imagined. We opened our hearts wide, thirsty for the pure and amazing life that comes from you, the “fountain of life.” We hoped to be touched by its waters as much as we could, trying to understand this deep mystery.

When we talked about it, we realized that even the strongest senses and the brightest light couldn’t compare to the sweetness of that life to come. So, with even more love, we lifted ourselves up and passed beyond all physical things, even beyond the sky where the sun, moon, and stars shine. We flew higher by thinking deeply and admiring your works.

At last, we reached our own minds and went beyond them, trying to reach the endless place where you feed your people forever with truth. This life is Wisdom, the one who made everything—past and future. Wisdom was never made and will never end; she just is, forever. 

While we were reaching for her, we barely touched her with all our heart’s effort. Then, with a deep sigh, we left that joyful feeling and came back to our own language, where words have a beginning and an end. But what can be compared to your Word, Lord, who never gets old and “makes all things new”?

What we said was something like this: If a person could quiet all the noise of the body, and silence the sounds of earth, water, and air; if even the poles were silent; if the soul stopped thinking about itself and quieted all its thoughts and visions; if every tongue, sign, and temporary thing could say, “We were not made by ourselves, but by the one who lives forever”—and then all went silent, listening only to Him; if He spoke directly, not through any sound or vision but clearly so we could hear Him—the one we love through everything—if we could hear Him like that, as we tried to do, then we might quickly touch the Eternal Wisdom that watches over all. 

If this could last, and other visions disappeared, and this joy completely filled someone so that their life was always like that one perfect moment of knowing, wouldn’t that be what it means to “Enter into the joy of your Lord”?
