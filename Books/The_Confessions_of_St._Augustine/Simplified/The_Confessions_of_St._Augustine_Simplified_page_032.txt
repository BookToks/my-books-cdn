Even though nobody wants to be unhappy on purpose, sometimes we actually feel glad to be kind and caring because we feel sorry for people’s pain. Without their pain, we wouldn’t have anyone to feel sorry for. This feeling comes from a kind of friendship.

But where does this feeling go? Why does it sometimes turn into something ugly, like bad desires that change it completely? It gets twisted and loses its pure goodness because of our own choices. Should we then stop feeling sorry for others? Definitely not! We should love the sorrows of others, but we must be careful not to let those feelings lead us into bad things. I haven’t stopped feeling sorry for others. Back when I watched plays, I felt for the lovers acting on stage, even though it was all pretend. When they lost each other, I felt sad with them, and I actually enjoyed feeling both sad and caring.

Now, I feel more sorry for people who enjoy doing bad things than for those who are sad because they can’t get some harmful pleasure or lose some fake happiness. This kind of pity is more real, but it doesn’t make me happy. Even though it’s good to feel sorry for unhappy people, the best kind of care would be if nobody was ever unhappy. If kindness could ever turn into meanness—which it can’t—then maybe someone who really cares would want there to be unhappy people just so they could feel sorry for them. Some sadness is okay, but we should never love sadness.

This is how you act, Lord God, because you love people more purely than we do and care without being hurt by sadness. Who can really understand these things? Back then, when I was miserable, I actually liked to feel sad and looked for reasons to be sad. Even when other people’s pain was fake, like in plays, the parts that made me cry were the ones I liked the most. So it’s no surprise that, like a lost sheep, I got caught up in bad stuff and got hurt. I loved feeling sad because it didn’t go too deep inside me—I didn’t want to suffer like that myself. It was just the kind of sadness from hearing stories, only on the surface of my feelings. But even so, it was like scratches from poison that caused swelling and sickness inside me. That was my life! But was that really living, God?

And still, your loyal kindness stayed close to me. I wasted myself on bad things because I was curious in the wrong way. I left you and got dragged down into terrible traps, following evil things and doing wrong deeds as if I was giving gifts to devils. And even then, you didn’t stop punishing me. I was so bold that, while your holy ceremonies were happening in the church, I was planning things that deserved death. You punished me hard, but it was nothing compared to how wrong I was, my greatest mercy, my God, my safe place from the dangers I faced while I stubbornly turned away from you, loving my own bad ways instead of yours—loving a wild kind of freedom!
