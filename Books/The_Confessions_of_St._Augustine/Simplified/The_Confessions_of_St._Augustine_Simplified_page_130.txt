People can see and hear things, but they can’t really understand what those things mean because their senses don’t have the reason needed to judge what they experience. But humans can ask questions about what they see, so “the invisible things of God are clearly understood through what has been made.”  

However, people often love these created things too much and become controlled by them. When this happens, they can’t judge properly. None of these created things can answer questions unless the person asking can think clearly. The world looks the same to everyone, but it only “speaks” to those who compare what they see with the truth inside themselves. The truth tells me, “Neither heaven, nor earth, nor anyone else is your God.” Their nature shows this to anyone who looks carefully. “They are a part less than the whole.”  

Now, my soul, you are the best part of me, and I talk to you because you give life to my whole body, but no body gives life to another body. Your God is the life of your life.  

What do I love when I love my God? Who is beyond the highest part of my soul? Yet I will use this very soul to reach up to him. I will rise above the power that connects me to my body and keeps it alive. But it’s not through this power alone that I find God. If it were, then horses and mules, which have the same life power, would find him too.  

Besides the power that gives life, there is another power that gives my body senses—a power God gave me. He made it so that the eye doesn’t hear and the ear doesn’t see, but that I see with my eye and hear with my ear. Each sense has its own job, and I, with my single mind, use all of them. I will also rise beyond this power because horses and mules have senses too.  

So I will rise beyond this natural power and keep going higher toward the one who made me. I enter the wide fields and big halls of my memory, where countless images from all kinds of things are stored, brought in by my senses. In memory, I also keep what I think about, whether I make my perceptions bigger or smaller, or change them in some way. Everything that hasn’t been forgotten is kept there.  

When I go into this storehouse, I ask for what I want to come out. Some things appear right away, but others take longer and have to be searched for in hidden places. Sometimes many things come out all at once, even while I’m still looking for something else.
