I used to listen closely and excitedly to what he said. Even though he spoke simply, his words were full of energy, life, and honesty. He noticed that I liked reading books about horoscopes, but he kindly told me to stop wasting time and effort on these useless things. He said that when he was younger, he had also studied astrology because he wanted to make a living from it. Since he already understood medicine, he could understand astrology too. But he gave it up because he realized astrology was completely false, and being an honest man, he didn’t want to trick people to earn money.

“But you,” he said, “have the job of teaching speaking skills to support yourself, so you are following this wrong idea by choice, not because you have to. That’s why you should trust me, since I worked hard to learn astrology well because I wanted to make a living from it.” When I asked him why astrology sometimes seemed to predict true things, he explained that it was just luck spreading through nature. Sometimes, by chance, when someone reads a poem, a line might strangely fit what they are going through, even though the poet meant something else. “It’s not surprising,” he said, “that the human mind, without really knowing it, might accidentally come up with an answer that fits what the person wants to know.” So, either through him or by him, you were watching over me.

And I hadn’t yet found clear proof to show without any doubt that the true predictions were just accidents, not real magic.

When I first started teaching speaking skills in my hometown, I had a close friend about my age who studied with me. We grew up together, went to school and played together. But he wasn’t really my true friend, because real friendship only exists between those joined by the love given through the Holy Spirit. Still, it was a nice friendship, based on our shared studies. Sadly, I led him away from the true faith—he hadn’t fully understood it when he was young—and made him believe in superstitions and harmful stories, which my mother was sad about. This man and I wandered together in error, and I couldn’t live without him. But you were right behind us—both a God who punishes and a God who shows mercy—turning us to yourself in amazing ways. So, you took that man out of this life when he had...
