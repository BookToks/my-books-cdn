You will guide us like a steady hand. When our strength comes from you, it is truly strong; but when we rely on ourselves, it is weak and shaky. Our good life is always with you, and when we turn away from you, we mess things up.

Now, Lord, help us come back so we don’t get lost. With you, our good life is perfect because you are the source of all good. We don’t need to worry about having nowhere to go if we stray, because our home—your forever place—is always waiting for us.
