Heaven and earth are connected, but their shapes are different. You made everything from nothing, but you gave the world its shape from formless stuff. Both happened at the same time, so the shape came right after the stuff without any delay.

We have thought about what you wanted to show us when you created everything and put it all in order.

We see that each thing on its own is good, and all things together are very good, both in heaven and on earth. This was done through your Word, your only Son, who leads the Church like its head and body. This shows your plan made before time began, without any start or end. But when time started, you showed us what you had planned all along. You made hidden things clear and fixed our mess because we had sinned and were lost in darkness away from you. Your Spirit helped us at the right time. You made the ungodly right and separated them from the wicked. You set your Book as a barrier between those who obey you above and those who obey them below. You gathered the unbelievers together so the faithful could show their passion and do good things by giving their earthly riches to the poor to get heavenly riches.

Then you lit up the sky with your holy people, who have the Word of Life and shine with special authority because of their spiritual gifts. To teach the unbelievers, you made miracles and signs from physical things that match your Book, so the faithful could be blessed. After this, you gave the faithful a "living soul" by helping them control their desires with self-control. Then you renewed their minds in your image, faithful only to you and not copying any human authority. You made thinking follow higher wisdom, just like a woman follows a man.

Finally, in all your work to make the faithful better in this life, you wanted them to produce good things that help them now and in the life to come. We see all this, and it is very good because you see it that way in us—you gave us your Spirit so we can see it and love you through it.

Lord God, please give us your peace—for you have given us everything. Give us the peace of calm, the peace of rest, the peace that never ends.

All these beautiful things, all so very good, will pass away when their time is done—for they have a beginning and an end.

But the seventh day has no end, no setting, because you made it holy and everlasting. After creating everything, which was very good, you rested on the seventh day, even though you had made them all in perfect rest. This shows us that after our work—and it is very good too—there will be rest forever.
