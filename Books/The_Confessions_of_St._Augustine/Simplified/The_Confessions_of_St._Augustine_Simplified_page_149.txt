I really hate using disrespectful promises. But, God, who I serve with all my heart, the enemy still tricks me into wanting some kind of sign from you! I pray that any thoughts like this stay far from me now and always get farther away. When I ask you to save someone, I want more than just to ask—I want to follow your will gladly as you do what you want.

Every day, I’m still curious about tiny, unimportant things, and I don’t even know how many times I give in to that.

Sometimes when people tell silly stories, we listen at first just to not upset anyone, but then we start enjoying them! I don’t go to circuses to watch a dog chase a rabbit, but if I see it happen outside, it easily distracts me from serious thoughts. I don’t stop my horse, but my mind turns to it. Unless you quickly remind me to focus on you or ignore it, I get caught up in it, which shows how weak I am.

Even when I’m sitting at home, watching a lizard catch flies or a spider trap them in its web, I get stuck thinking about it. Is curiosity really different just because these are small creatures? These things make me praise you, the amazing Creator of everything. But that’s not what first grabs my attention. It’s one thing to get up quickly and another not to fall—and both happen all the time in my life, and I only hope in your great mercy. When my heart fills with all these useless thoughts, my prayers get interrupted and disturbed. Even when I’m talking to you, these silly thoughts break in and distract me.

So, should we think of this useless curiosity as something not that important? Can anything give us hope except your total mercy since you’ve already started changing me? You know how much you’ve changed me. First, you healed me from wanting to defend myself, so you could forgive all my other sins and heal all my problems. You saved me from decay, showed me kindness, and gave me good things. You stopped my pride with your fear and made me accept your “yoke.” Now I carry it and it feels “light” because you promised it would and made it that way. It really is true, even though I didn’t know it when I was afraid to accept it.

But, Lord—You alone are the true King without pride, with no one above you—have I stopped wanting people to fear and love me just to feel a joy that’s not real? It’s actually a sad life and a showy way to live. It’s a big reason why we don’t love you as we should.
