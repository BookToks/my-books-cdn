They agree that the phrases “The earth was invisible and unformed” and “The darkened abyss” might refer to this unformed matter. From this, as the story explains later, everything we can see was made and organized during those “days.”

But what if someone said, “This same formless and chaotic matter was first called heaven and earth because everything we see, which we usually call heaven and earth, was made and finished from it”? Or what if another person said, “Invisible and visible things are rightly called heaven and earth. So, everything God created in the beginning fits under these two names”?

Since everything was made not from God’s own being but from nothing, and because these things aren’t the same as God, they can change like people do. The basic stuff of all invisible and visible things (which is still formless but can get a shape) from which heaven and earth were made was talked about using the same words as the invisible and unformed earth and the darkness over the abyss. The difference is this: the invisible and unformed earth had physical matter before it had any shape, while the darkness over the abyss was spiritual matter, before it was controlled and lit up by Wisdom.

Someone might also say, “The fully made invisible and visible things aren’t what ‘heaven and earth’ means in ‘In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.’ Instead, those words mean the unformed beginning stuff that could get a shape and be made. This was chaos that hadn’t been sorted yet into forms and qualities. Now, these have been put in order and are called heaven and earth—heaven being spiritual and the earth physical.”

After thinking about all this, I don’t want to argue over words because arguing doesn’t help and only confuses people. The law helps us grow if we use it right: its goal is love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and true faith. Our Teacher knew this well because he said all the Law and Prophets depend on these two commandments.

How could it hurt me, God, my secret light, if I explain these ideas differently from someone else? We all try to understand what the writer meant, and since we believe he tells the truth, we don’t think he said anything false. So everyone reading is trying to figure out the true meaning.
