I always thought about death and what would happen to me after, even though my ideas kept changing. I talked with my friends, Alypius and Nebridius, about what is good and bad. I believed Epicurus had good ideas, except he didn’t believe in life after death or any kind of reward or punishment for the soul.

I asked them, “What if we never die and always feel good without ever losing it? Wouldn’t that make us happy? Why would we want anything else?” I didn’t realize that this was the problem: I was so lost and confused that I couldn’t see the true beauty and goodness that you can only understand inside your heart, not just with your eyes. I also didn’t understand why I enjoyed talking about these hard questions with my friends. I couldn’t be happy without friends, even with all the fun things in life. But I really loved my friends for who they were, and I knew they loved me too.

Oh, twisted ways! It’s sad when a brave soul thinks leaving you behind will bring something better. It tries to find comfort but only feels restless and uncomfortable. But you are close, and you save us from our struggles. You guide us, comfort us, and say, “Run, I will carry you; I will lead you home and set you free.”
