CHAPTER VI

8. I don’t just kind of feel that I love you, Lord—I know it for sure. Your Word has touched my heart, and I love you.

Look around at the sky, the earth, and everything in them—they all tell me to love you, and they never stop telling everyone this, so no one has an excuse not to love you. That’s why you show mercy and kindness to whoever you want, because if not, heaven and earth would be praising you but no one would listen.

But what do I actually love when I love you? It’s not your physical beauty, or the cool stuff that lasts only a little while, or the bright light that looks nice, or the nice songs, or the smells of flowers and spices. It’s not things like honey or food, or hugs with people. These aren’t what I love when I love God.

Still, I do love some kind of light, sound, smell, food, and hugs when I love God—but it’s different. It’s the light and sound and smell and food and hugs that fill my soul, not my body. This kind of light shines inside me in a place no space can hold, time can’t take away the beautiful sound, no wind can blow away the sweet smell, the food never runs out, and the hug never ends. This is what I love when I love God.

9. So, what is God? I asked the earth, and it said, “I’m not God.” Everything on earth said the same. I asked the sea, the deep waters, and the creatures that crawl, and they said, “We’re not God; look above us.” I asked the wind and the air and everything in it, and they said, “Anaximenes was wrong; I’m not God.” I asked the sky, sun, moon, and stars, and they said, “We are not the God you want.”

Then I said to all these things around my body, “You told me you’re not God. Can you tell me something about him?” They all shouted, “He made us.” I had asked because I was watching them, and they answered because they are so nicely ordered.

Then I thought about myself and asked, “Who are you?” I answered, “I’m a human.” I have both a body and a soul; the body is outside, the soul is inside. Where should I look for God—the body or the soul? I had already looked with my body from earth to sky as far as I could see.

The inside part, the soul, is the better part. All the senses in the body tell the soul what heaven, earth, and all things say: “We are not God, but he made us.” My soul learned this through my body’s senses. I asked the whole earth about God, and it said, “I’m not God, but he made me.”

10. Isn’t this beauty visible to anyone who can see well?

Then why don’t all creatures understand the same thing? Animals, big and small, see...
