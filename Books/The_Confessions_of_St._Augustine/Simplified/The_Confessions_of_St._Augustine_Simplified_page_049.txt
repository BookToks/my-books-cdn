CHAPTER XIII  
20. I didn’t understand these things back then, and I liked less important kinds of beauty. I was going down deep into confusion. I asked my friends, “Do we only love things that are beautiful? What exactly is beautiful? What is beauty?  

What makes us connect with the things we love? If they weren’t graceful or beautiful, how could they attract us?” I thought about this and realized that some things are beautiful because they are complete, and others are beautiful because their parts fit well together—like how one part of the body works with the whole, or how a shoe fits a foot.  

This idea came from deep inside me, and I wrote a few books about beauty and what fits well together. But I don’t remember those books now, and I’ve lost them somewhere.  

CHAPTER XIV  
21. God, why did I decide to dedicate those books to Hierius, a famous speaker from Rome? I never met him, but I liked him because people said he was really smart. Also, I heard some of his words and liked them.  

He was praised a lot because people were amazed that a Syrian who first learned Greek speaking could become such a great Latin speaker and philosopher. We can love someone we never met because others say good things about them. But love doesn’t just come from hearing praise. Instead, we catch the feeling of love from someone who truly loves that person. That’s why we love someone when the praise is honest.  

22. So, I loved people because of what others said, not because of You, God, who never makes mistakes. But why did I feel differently about those men than about famous chariot racers or gladiators that many people loved? I admired the speaker in a different, more serious way, the way I wanted to be admired.  

I didn’t want people to like me like they like actors, even though I liked actors too. I would rather be unknown than loved that way, or even hated than loved like that. How can one person feel so many different kinds of love inside?  

What do I love in another person that, if I didn’t hate it, I wouldn’t dislike or push away in myself, since we are both human? Just because a good horse is admired by someone who wouldn’t want to be that horse, doesn’t mean we should admire an actor the same way—because actors are like us.  

Do I love something in a person that I would hate to have myself? People are very complicated. God, you even count every hair on our heads, and none fall without your knowing. But it’s even harder to understand what’s in our hearts and feelings.  

23. But the speaker I admired was the kind of person I wanted to be. So I made a mistake because of pride and got carried away.
