3. Why does it matter to me if people hear me confess my mistakes, like they are the ones who will fix all my problems? People are curious about others’ lives but slow to fix their own. Why do they want to know about me, but don’t want to hear the truth about themselves? And how can they know if I’m telling the truth about myself, since no one truly knows what’s inside a person except their own spirit? But if they heard the truth about themselves from you, they couldn’t say, “God is lying.” Because hearing from you about themselves means really knowing themselves. And who knows themselves well enough to say, “That’s not true,” unless they’re lying to themselves? Since love trusts everything—at least among people who care about each other—I confess to you, God, so others can hear. Even if I can’t prove to everyone that I’m honest, those who listen with love will believe me.

4. But, God, my inner healer, will you help me understand what good comes from doing this? When I confess my past sins (which you have forgiven and covered so I can be blessed by faith and your help), hearing and reading these confessions can wake up hearts that are stuck in despair, saying, “I can’t do it.” Instead, they will feel your mercy and grace, which make weak people strong, as long as they realize their own weakness. And good people will be happy to hear about the mistakes of someone who is now free from them.

They won’t be happy because of the mistakes themselves, but because those mistakes are gone. So, God, to you, who I confess to every day with hope in your mercy more than in my own goodness, what’s the point of confessing to people, through this book, both what I am now and what I was before? I’ve talked about my past. But what about me right now, as I’m confessing? Many people want to know, both those who know me and those who don’t. Some have heard about me, but they don’t really understand what’s in my heart, where I truly am. They want to hear what’s inside me, even though they can’t see or hear or fully understand it. They want to believe me—and the love inside them helps them trust that I’m not lying.

5. But why do they want this? Will they wish me happiness when they learn how close I’ve come to you with your gifts? Will they pray for me when they see how much I’m still held back by my own struggles? To those people, I’ll share myself. It’s a big blessing, God, if many people thank you because of me and pray for me. Let a brotherly spirit love what you teach us to love in me, and be sad about what you teach us to be sad about in me. Let it be a brother, not a stranger or someone who lies and speaks nonsense. But let my brother be the one who, when he accepts me, is happy for me.
