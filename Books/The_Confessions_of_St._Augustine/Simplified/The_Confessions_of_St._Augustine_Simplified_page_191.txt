Surely when he wrote these words, he fully understood all the truth we have found in them, and even more that we haven’t figured out yet but is still there to discover.

Finally, O Lord—who are God and not human—if anyone sees less than this, can anything be hidden from your good Spirit who will guide me to the right path? You revealed this to future readers through those words, even though the person who first spoke them focused on only one meaning out of many possible ones. If that’s true, then the meaning he saw must be higher than the others. But please, Lord, show us either that same meaning or any other true one, as you want.

So, whether you reveal to us what you showed that man, or some other true meaning through the same words, please feed us with your truth and don’t let us be fooled by error. Look, Lord my God, how much we have written about just a few words—so much! What kind of mind or how much time would be enough to explain all your books like this? So now, in these last words, let me confess simply and choose one true, certain, and good meaning that you will inspire in me, even though many meanings are possible. This is my faith: if I can say what your servant meant, that is the best and truest meaning, and I will try for that. But if I fail, may I at least say what your Truth wanted to tell me through these words, just like it told Moses.
