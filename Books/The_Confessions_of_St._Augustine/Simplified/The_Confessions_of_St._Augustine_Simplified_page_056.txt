People don’t know the path that is your word, the word by which you made everything, including people who measure things, the senses they use to notice what they measure, and the intelligence that helps them understand these measurements. Because of this, they don’t realize that your wisdom can’t be measured.

But the Only Begotten has been “made for us wisdom, righteousness, and holiness” and has lived among us and even paid taxes to Caesar. They don’t know this “Way,” the path where they can come down from themselves to him and then rise up to him. Since they don’t know this “Way,” they thought they were so great they reached the stars and shining heavens, but actually, they fell to the earth, and “their foolish heart was darkened.” They understood some true things about creatures but didn’t search with true respect for the Truth, the Creator of everything, so they didn’t find him. And if they did find him and knew he was God, they didn’t honor him or thank him. Instead, they became proud and thought they were wise, taking credit for what belongs to you. They even tried to give you their own bad qualities, putting their lies on you, who are the Truth. They changed the glory of the immortal God for images of people and animals, “exchanging your truth for a lie, and worshiping and serving the created things instead of the Creator.”

Still, I remembered many true things that philosophers said about creation, and I saw proof in the order of the seasons and the stars. I compared this with the teachings of Mani, who wrote many foolish books on these topics.

But I couldn’t find anything about solstices, equinoxes, or eclipses of the sun and moon in Mani’s books—things I had learned from science and my own eyes. Yet I was told to believe Mani, even when his ideas didn’t match or even went against what math and my own eyes showed me, and were very different.

Chapter IV

Lord God of Truth, is anyone pleasing to you just because they know these things? No, because a person who knows these things but doesn’t know you is unhappy. The person who knows you is happy, even if they don’t know these things. Knowing both you and these things doesn’t make someone more blessed because the only real blessing is knowing you as God, praising you, thanking you, and not becoming proud.

It’s like a person who knows how to enjoy a tree and thanks you for it—even if they don’t know how tall or wide it is—is better than someone who can measure every branch but doesn’t own the tree or know or love its Creator. Just like a faithful person who lives as if they have nothing but actually has everything through their connection with you, whom everything serves.
