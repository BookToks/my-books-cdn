God, you are everywhere. I wouldn’t even exist if I weren’t part of you, because everything comes from you and depends on you. Yes, Lord, that’s true. Where could I call you to, since I am already in you? Or where could you come into me from? Where else could I go besides heaven and earth where you might come to me—when you said, “I fill heaven and earth”?

Since you fill heaven and earth, do they actually hold you? Or do you overflow them because they can't hold all of you? And if heaven and earth are full, where do you pour out what’s left? Or maybe you don’t need to be contained by anything, because you hold everything by being in everything. The things you fill don’t trap you; even if they broke, you wouldn’t spill out. When you pour yourself out on us, you don’t go down; instead, we are lifted up. You don’t scatter; you bring us together. When you fill everything, do you fill it with all of yourself? Or maybe nothing can hold all of you at once. Does each thing hold a part of you? Do bigger things hold more, and smaller things less? Or are you fully everywhere, but nothing holds all of you completely?

So, what is my God? I mean, who else but the Lord God? He is the highest, strongest, most powerful, most loving, and most fair. He is hidden but truly present. He is beautiful and strong, steady but doesn’t need support. He never changes, yet changes everything. He is never new or old, but makes everything new and brings down the proud without them knowing. He is always working but always at rest. He gathers us but needs nothing. He holds everything, protects us, creates, feeds, and helps us grow. He seeks everything but already owns all. He loves without wild emotions, is jealous but calm, regrets without sadness, is angry but peaceful. He changes how he acts but keeps his plans the same. He gets back what he never really lost. He never needs anything but still celebrates when he gains something. He isn’t greedy but expects rewards. People give more than needed so he owes them, but who can really own anything that isn’t already his? He owes us nothing but pays us as if he does, and when he forgives, he loses nothing. Oh God, my life and joy, what have I said? How can anyone describe you? But it’s sad when people stay quiet—because even those who say the most don’t say enough.

Who will bring me peace in you? Who will put you in my heart so fully that my sins disappear and I can hold you close, my only God?
