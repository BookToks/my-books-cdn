Following his mother’s wishes and to keep peace in the family, he had the servants she pointed out punished. She also promised a reward to anyone else who, trying to please her, said something bad about her daughter-in-law. After that, no one dared to speak badly, and they all lived together happily and kindly.

God also gave another great gift to that good woman who carried me in her womb. Whenever she could, she helped make peace between people who didn’t get along. When she heard harsh words from one side or the other, she only shared things that could help them make up. This might seem like a small thing, but many people make fights worse by repeating angry words or even making up things that weren’t said. A truly kind person should not only avoid making fights worse but also try to stop them with kind words. She was that kind of person, and God taught her to be that way deep in her heart.

In the end, she helped her own husband turn to God too. After that, she had no reason to complain about his faithfulness, which she had before he believed. She also served God’s followers. Everyone who knew her respected, loved, and honored God because they saw God’s love in her good life. She was faithful to her husband, respected her parents, ran her home with faith, was known for good deeds, and raised her children carefully, guiding them whenever they started to stray from God. Before she died, she cared for all of us like a mother would and served us like she was one of us.

As the day came near when she was going to leave this life—a day God knew but we didn’t—it happened that she and I stood alone by a window. From there, we could see the garden of the house we stayed in at Ostia. We were resting after a long trip.

We talked quietly, happily leaving behind the past and looking forward to what was coming. We were in the moment, and in the presence of Truth—that is, God—talking together.
