My mind is huge inside, but who really understands how deep it goes? It’s part of who I am, but even I don’t fully get everything about myself. My mind is actually too small to hold all of itself. So where is the part it doesn’t hold? Is it outside or inside? How can my mind not understand itself? It’s amazing and confusing to me. People love to be amazed by big mountains, huge waves, wide rivers, the ocean, and stars, but they don’t stop to be amazed by themselves. And they don’t think about how I can talk about all these things without actually seeing them right now. Instead, I see them in my memory—the same mountains, waves, rivers, ocean, and stars I’ve seen before, with the same wide spaces between them. But when I saw them outside, I didn’t actually take them inside me; only their pictures are inside me. Still, I know which senses helped me experience them.

But my memory holds more than just pictures. It also keeps everything I’ve learned about subjects like science and logic, tucked away in a deep place that isn’t really a place. For these, it’s not just pictures stored, but the actual ideas themselves. It’s not like hearing a sound that fades away but leaves a faint memory; or smelling a scent that’s gone but you can still remember how it smelled; or tasting food that’s gone but you remember the flavor; or touching something that’s gone but you remember the feeling. Those are just memories of the experience, not the real thing. But the real ideas I’ve learned stay in my memory, stored super fast and organized perfectly, ready to be remembered whenever I want.

Now, when I hear about three kinds of questions—“Does something exist? What is it? What kind is it?”—I remember the sounds of those words. I know the sounds moved through the air and are now gone. But I never experienced the actual things they mean with my body; I only understand them with my mind. What I keep in my memory isn’t just the words, but the real ideas behind them.

How these ideas got into me, I don’t know. I check all my body’s doors. My eyes say, “If something had color, I saw it.” My ears say, “If there was sound, I heard it.” My nose says, “If there was a smell, I smelled it.” My tongue says, “If it had taste, I tasted it.” But none of these senses can explain how these ideas came in.
