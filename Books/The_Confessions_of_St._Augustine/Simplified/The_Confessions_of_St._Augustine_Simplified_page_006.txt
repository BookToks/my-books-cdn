Augustine doesn’t tell us what was going on in his mind between 385 and 391. He was busy thinking about other questions that interested him more.

When you start reading the Confessions, you quickly see that the word “confess” has two meanings. First, it means honestly admitting your sins to God. But it also means recognizing and praising the truth about God. So, confessing is not just about admitting mistakes—it’s also about praising God and understanding yourself better while feeling close to Him.

The Confessions don’t just end when Augustine finishes his personal story in Book IX. There are two big questions left: How does a limited human find or get found by the infinite God? And what does God’s creation of the world mean for our lives and stories? Book X looks at how people come to God, starting from what they can see and feel, but then going deeper into memory and finally into a deep meeting between God and the soul. But this journey isn’t finished until we also understand the mystery of creation itself. So, in Book XI, Augustine talks about why time is confusing and explains how “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” is a key idea for Christian beliefs. In Books XII and XIII, he carefully explains the first chapter of Genesis, verse by verse, to show how God’s work in creation connects to human history and the whole universe. God is both the Creator and the one who saves us. Our beginning and our end come together in Him.

The Enchiridion is a shorter book about God’s grace and shows Augustine’s mature thinking after writing big works like De Trinitate and De civitate Dei, and after dealing with big arguments about grace. Around 421, a Christian man named Laurentius asked Augustine for a short handbook that sums up Christian teaching. Augustine said the shortest answer is that people should serve God with faith, hope, and love. But since that was too short, he wrote a longer essay, even though it was a bit messy and hard to follow. Still, the Enchiridion is very important because it shows Augustine’s final thoughts on Christian truth.

Augustine uses the Apostles’ Creed and the Lord’s Prayer as the guide for this book. It starts by talking about God’s work in creating everything. He makes a clear difference between just knowing about nature and truly recognizing the Creator who made nature. But since creation is affected by sin and evil, Augustine also talks about his famous idea that evil isn’t a thing on its own but the absence of good.
