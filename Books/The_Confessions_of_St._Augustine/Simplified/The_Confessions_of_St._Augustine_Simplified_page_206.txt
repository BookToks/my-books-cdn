Lord, you are the true joy for those with pure hearts.

Now, let your helpers do their work here on “the earth”—not like before when they worked in “the waters” of doubt. Back then, they had to use miracles, mysteries, and confusing words to get people’s attention. People listened because they were scared of strange and hidden things.

This is how people start to believe, especially those who forget about you, hide from you, and feel lost like a dark pit. But now, let your helpers work like they are on “dry land,” safe from the dangers of that dark pit.

Let them be good examples to the faithful by showing how to live and encouraging others to do the same.

In this way, people will listen not just to hear but also to act. Look for the Lord, and your soul will live. The earth can bring forth “living souls.” Don’t be like the world around you; separate yourself from it. The soul lives by avoiding things that lead to death if you love them. Control pride, stop being lazy and selfish, and don’t trust false knowledge.

These things are like wild animals inside us: pride is a wild beast, lust is like a restless cow, and curiosity is a poisonous snake. These feelings belong to a dead soul—not completely dead, but dead because it left the source of life and got caught up in this temporary world.

But your Word, God, is a never-ending source of life. It stops us from leaving you when it says, “Don’t be like the world.” This way, “the earth” can bring forth a “living soul” that is guided by your Word, your messengers, and those who follow Christ. This is what “after his kind” means—a person follows the example of their friend. Paul said, “Become like me, because I have become like you.”

In this “living soul,” good animals will live peacefully. You have told us to “work with gentleness, and people will love you.” The cattle will be good—they won’t get sick from eating too much or starve if they eat little. The snakes will be good too—they won’t poison or harm but will be smart and careful, only exploring as much of this temporary world as needed to understand the eternal one.

All these animals will follow reason and live well after they stop being harmful.

So, Lord, when we stop loving the world, where we died by living badly, and start to be “living souls” by living well; and when we truly follow your words, “Don’t be like the world,” then what you said next will happen.
