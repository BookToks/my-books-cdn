Sometimes, people act like they’re giving good advice, but really, they’re just hurting the things they say they care about.

You had touched our hearts with your love, and your words felt like they went deep inside us. The stories of your followers, who changed from dark to bright and from death to life, filled our minds and burned away our lazy attitudes so we wouldn’t fall back into bad habits. These stories inspired us so much that even when others lied about us, it only made our passion stronger instead of killing it.

Even though some people might praise our promise to follow you loudly, it seemed like bragging if we didn’t wait until the right time, like during vacation. If I had quit my public job too early, people would have thought I was trying to show off. What good would it do if they talked about my change in a bad way?

Also, that summer my lungs started getting weak from working too hard on my studies. It became hard to breathe and speak loudly without pain. This was tough because it meant I almost had to stop teaching or at least take a break. But once I really wanted to be still and focus on knowing you are the Lord, I was happy to have this reason to rest. It wasn’t fake, and it helped calm those who didn’t want me to have any freedom.

So, I kept going for about twenty more days. It was hard because the excitement that kept me going was gone, but patience helped me get through. Some of my friends might say I did wrong because after fully choosing to serve you, I let myself rest a bit. I won’t argue with them.

But haven’t you, kind Lord, forgiven this mistake along with all the others, no matter how bad they were?

Verecundus was really upset about my new happiness because he was still stuck in his old ways and knew he would lose my company.

He wasn’t a Christian yet, even though his wife was, and she had a stronger influence on him than anything else. He didn’t want to become a Christian unless the conditions were impossible. Still, he kindly invited us to use his country house while we stayed there. Lord, you will reward him someday because you’ve already given him a good place in your heart.
