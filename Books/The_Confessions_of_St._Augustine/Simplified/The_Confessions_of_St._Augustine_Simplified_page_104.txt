I gave up all the fun and happiness of this world to focus on finding the truth. Not just finding it, but even searching for it is better than all the riches and pleasures you could ever get. But, when I was young and foolish, I asked for self-control and purity—but not right away. I was scared that if I got it too soon, it would stop me from enjoying lust, which I wanted to satisfy, not get rid of. I wandered down wrong paths, believing in false ideas, not really sure if they were true, but liking them more than the right way because I was against it.

I thought I was waiting day by day to give up my worldly hopes and follow God because I didn’t see any clear way to do it. Then the time came when I was forced to face myself, and my conscience asked, “Where are you now? You said you didn’t want to give up your pride for something uncertain. But now it’s clear, and you still carry that weight. Others who didn’t spend so long searching have already been freed and are flying.” I felt so confused and ashamed while Ponticianus kept talking. When he finished and left, I kept arguing with myself inside.

I punished my soul to try to follow God, but it pulled back. It refused to try.

Even though all its excuses were proven wrong, my soul was restless and scared to lose the bad habits that were slowly killing it, acting like losing them was the same as dying.

Then, as this fierce fight was going on inside me, I grabbed my friend Alypius and said, “What’s wrong with us? What’s going on? People who don’t know much suddenly start following God, but we, with all our knowledge and little courage, are stuck in our weakness! Just because others went before us, are we too embarrassed to follow? Shouldn’t we be ashamed for not following?” I barely knew what I was saying, and I suddenly walked away from him, while he looked at me, shocked. My face, eyes, and voice showed how I really felt more than my words did.

There was a small garden near where we lived, which we could use because the landlord didn’t live there. My inner struggle was so strong that I ran out into the garden where no one could stop me from fighting with myself until it ended the way you knew, even though I didn’t. I was desperate for health and life, knowing how bad I was but not yet understanding how good I was about to become.

I ran into the garden, with Alypius following me because I had no secrets from him, and he couldn’t leave me in such pain. We sat far from the house. I was very upset with myself, angry that I hadn’t accepted God’s will yet, even though every part of me was shouting to join Him and praising Him.
