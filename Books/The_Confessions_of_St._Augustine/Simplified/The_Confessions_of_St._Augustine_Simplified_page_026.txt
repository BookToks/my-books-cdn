My mom was already trying to build a special place for you in her heart, while my dad was just starting to learn about you. She was scared and worried because even though I wasn’t baptized yet, she feared the wrong paths I might take by turning away from you.

Oh no! Can I really say that you stayed quiet, God, while I drifted further from you? Did you really stay silent?

But the words I heard from my mom were actually from you. She warned me carefully not to have sex outside of marriage and especially not to hurt another man’s wife. I thought her advice was just what a woman would say, and I was embarrassed to follow it. I didn’t realize those words were from you. I thought you were silent, and only she was talking. But by ignoring her advice, I was ignoring you—her son, your servant. I didn’t see this and kept going blindly. Among my friends, I was ashamed not to be as wild as they were. They bragged about their bad deeds, and the worse they were, the prouder they were. I liked their stories, not just because they were fun, but mostly because I wanted their approval. What’s bad is bad, but I made myself sound worse than I really was just to get praise. When I hadn’t done as badly as they had, I still pretended I did, so I wouldn’t seem weak or less cool.

Look at the kind of friends I had in the city! I was stuck in its dirt, but I acted like I was lying on a bed of spices and perfumes. My hidden enemy pulled me closer to the heart of that city and tricked me because I was easy to fool. My mom had already left the city and was moving slowly away from it. She wanted me to stay pure, but she didn’t fully understand my dangerous passions or think they could be controlled by love. She didn’t want a wife to get in the way of my future. This wasn’t her hope for heaven, which she had in you, but the hope for me to get a good education—my dad hoped this too, but he didn’t think much about God. My mom thought studying wouldn’t keep me from coming back to you. I remember this because I know my parents well. Meanwhile, there were few rules to stop me, so I could do whatever I wanted, even if it was bad. All this made me blind to the truth of you, God, and I kept doing wrong.
