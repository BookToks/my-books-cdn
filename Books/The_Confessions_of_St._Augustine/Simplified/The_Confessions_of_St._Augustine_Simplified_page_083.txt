Chapter 5

I kept asking myself, “Where does evil come from?” I looked for the answer in the wrong way and didn’t realize that searching like that was part of the problem.

I imagined everything created: the earth, sea, air, stars, trees, animals, and even things we can’t see, like the sky and angels. In my mind, I pictured all these things as one big group made of different kinds of stuff—some real, some just imagined. This big group was huge, but still limited in size. But I pictured God as being everywhere around and inside all of it, infinite in every direction—like an endless ocean filling a giant sponge. The sponge was the universe, and God was the infinite sea filling it.

I thought, “Look at God and what He made!” God is good, way better than anything He created. And since God is good, everything He made is good too, because He surrounds and fills it all. So where does evil come from? How did it sneak in? What is its source?

Does evil even exist? If it doesn’t, why do we fear it? If we fear something that doesn’t exist, then that fear itself is evil because it causes pain for no reason. So either evil is real, or the act of fearing is evil. But if God made everything good, and is the greatest good, then where does evil come from?

Could evil be some bad stuff God used to make everything? But if God is all-powerful, why didn’t He turn all of it into good? And if He is so powerful, why didn’t He just destroy the bad stuff instead of using it?

Does evil exist against God’s will? If evil has always existed, why did God let it be gone for so long before creating anything? And why would He suddenly decide to create something from it? If God wanted to create now, wouldn’t He get rid of evil first and live alone as the perfect Good? Or if it’s good that God made good things, why didn’t He get rid of the bad stuff first? God would not be all-powerful if He couldn’t create good things without needing some bad stuff that He didn’t make.

I struggled with these confusing questions, worried I’d never find the truth before I died. But I still believed in Christ, our Lord and Savior, as the Catholic Church had taught me. Even though some parts of my faith were unclear or didn’t fully match the rules, I held on to it in my heart.
