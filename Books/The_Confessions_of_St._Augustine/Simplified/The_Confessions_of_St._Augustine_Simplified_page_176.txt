You didn’t make anything from something else because there was nothing else. So, God, how could you create everything—heaven and earth—if there was nothing to create them from? You made everything from nothing because you are all-powerful and good. You made both the huge heaven and the small earth. At first, there was only you, and nothing else existed to make heaven and earth from. One is close to you, and the other is almost nothing; only you are above the first, and nothing else is below the second.

The highest heaven belonged to you, Lord, but the earth you gave to people to see and touch wasn’t like it is now. Back then, it was invisible and didn’t have a shape. There was a deep, dark abyss with no light at all. The darkness was more than just in the abyss; it covered everything. This deep water, which we can now see, has some light in it that fish and creatures at the bottom can sense. But back then, the abyss was almost nothing because it wasn’t shaped yet. Still, even then, there was a chance for it to be formed.

You, Lord, made the world from unformed stuff that was nothing, almost nothing. From that, you made all the amazing things we see now. The sky we see, the space between the waters, is really amazing. You made it on the second day after creating light, saying, “Let it be,” and it happened. You called this space heaven—the heaven of the earth and sea you made on the third day—giving shape to the unformed stuff you made before any days started. Before any day, you already made a heaven, but that was the heaven above this heaven. In the beginning, you made heaven and earth.

But the earth you made was unformed and invisible, covered in darkness over the deep abyss. From this formless, almost nothing earth, you made all the things we see that change all the time. Even though the world changes, it isn’t completely made of itself. We can tell time by watching how things change, and the shapes of things come from this invisible earth which changes and shifts.

Because of this, the Spirit, who teaches your servant, says, “In the beginning you made heaven and earth,” but doesn’t mention times or days. This is because the highest heaven you made at the start is kind of like a thinking being. It isn’t as old as you, Trinity, but it shares in your eternal life.

Because it enjoys happily thinking about you, it is very close to you.
