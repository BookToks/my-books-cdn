People want to be happy and wish things were that way for themselves. But they wouldn’t be happy if they didn’t have some inside understanding of happiness. And they wouldn’t want to be happy unless they had already felt happy before. But when it comes to a happy life, we can’t see or feel it in other people through our senses.

Do we remember happiness the same way we remember joy? Maybe. I remember feeling joy even when I’m sad, just like I remember being happy when I’m feeling bad. I have never seen, heard, smelled, tasted, or touched my joy with my body. But I have felt it in my mind when I was happy. That feeling stayed in my memory, so I can think about it sometimes with dislike and other times with wanting, depending on what I remember making me happy. Sometimes, I felt joy even from bad things that I now hate when I think about them. Other times, I remember good and honest things I miss and feel sad because I can’t have them now.

Where and when did I ever live my happy life so I can remember and love it? It’s not just me or a few people who want to be happy—everyone wants that. If we didn’t know for sure what happiness was, we wouldn’t want it so strongly. For example, if two men were asked if they want to be soldiers, one might say yes and the other no. But if they were asked if they want to be happy, both would say yes without hesitation. One might want to be a soldier and the other might not, but both want to be happy. Maybe they find happiness in different things, but they both agree they want joy. Is this joy what people call a happy life? Even if people choose different kinds of joy, they all want the same thing—to have joy. Since everyone has experienced this joy, we remember it and understand what “a happy life” means.

Chapter 22  
Please, Lord, don’t let me think I’m happy just because of any joy I’ve had.  

There is a joy that bad people don’t get, only those who worship you with thanks do—and this joy is you. A happy life means being joyful in you, with you, and for you. That’s the only kind of happiness. But some people think there is another kind and chase after other joys, not the true one. Still, their desire is moved only by a fake or shadow of joy.

Chapter 23  
Is it really true that everyone wants to be happy, since those who don’t want their joy to come from you—the only real happy life—don’t really want to be happy? Or maybe everyone does want this, but because “the body fights against the spirit and the spirit fights against the body,” they stop themselves from doing what they want. So they do what they can and settle for that. They don’t want to do what they can’t do badly enough to make it happen.
