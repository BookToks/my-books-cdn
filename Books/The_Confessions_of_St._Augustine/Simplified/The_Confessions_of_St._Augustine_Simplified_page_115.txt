I used to be part of those stubborn and lost Manicheans, and I was really harsh and blind when I spoke against these writings that were full of heavenly sweetness and glowing with your light. I felt deeply sad about those who were against this Scripture.

When I think back to what happened during those holidays, I haven’t forgotten it, and I won’t stay quiet about how tough your punishment was, and how quickly your mercy came. At that time, you made me suffer with a bad toothache. It got so painful that I couldn’t even talk. Then, I asked all my friends who were there to pray to you, the God who heals everything. I even wrote it down on a tablet and gave it to them to read.

Right after we all knelt down and prayed, the pain disappeared. But what pain? How did it just go away? I admit I was scared because I had never felt pain like that before. Your plans were clear to me, and happily, I praised your name with faith. But that faith didn’t let me feel peaceful about my past sins, which hadn’t been forgiven yet by your baptism.

After the holiday ended, I told the people in Milan that they could find someone else to teach them words. I said this because I wanted to serve you better and because I wasn’t strong enough for the job anymore, with trouble breathing and chest pain.

I also wrote to your bishop, the holy man Ambrose, telling him about my past mistakes and my new decision. I asked him which of your books I should read to prepare myself for receiving such a great gift. He suggested the prophet Isaiah, probably because Isaiah talks about the gospel and how the Gentiles will be called. But I couldn’t understand the first part, and I thought the rest would be the same, so I put it aside to read later when I knew more about your words.

When it was time to officially sign up, we left the countryside and went back to Milan. Alypius decided to be born again in you at the same time.

He already had the humility needed for your sacraments and was very strong, even walking barefoot on the frozen Italian ground, which took real courage. We took with us Adeodatus, my son from my past mistakes. You had made him a wonderful boy. He was just fifteen, but he was smarter than many serious, educated men. I thank you, Lord my God, creator of everything, who can fix what’s broken in us—for there was nothing of me in that boy except sin. You inspired us to raise him with your guidance, not anyone else—I thank you for your gifts. I wrote a book called De Magistro, which is a conversation between Adeodatus and me, and you know that everything he says there is really his, even though he was only sixteen then. I found many other amazing gifts in him. His talent amazed me. And who else but you could create such wonders? You took his life away from this world quickly, and I still think about him.
