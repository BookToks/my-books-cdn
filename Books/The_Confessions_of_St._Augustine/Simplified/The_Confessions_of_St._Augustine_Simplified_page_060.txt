Students weren’t allowed to enter a class without the teacher’s permission, especially if the teacher wasn’t theirs. But in Carthage, students acted badly and without respect. They would rush in loudly and make angry gestures, ruining the order the teacher tried to keep for the students’ benefit. They did many awful things boldly, things that would be illegal if people didn’t accept them as normal. This shows that following bad customs is even worse because it lets people do things that should never be allowed. They think they won’t get in trouble, but their foolish behavior actually hurts them more than anyone else.

I didn’t like those bad habits as a student, but as a teacher, I had to put up with others acting that way. So I was happy to go somewhere people said such behavior wasn’t allowed. But God, “my refuge and my portion in the land of the living,” pushed me to go to Carthage so I could leave it behind and save my soul. At the same time, God tempted me with promises in Rome, using the crazy behavior of some people in Carthage and empty promises in Rome. God used their bad actions and my own mistakes to guide me.

The people who disturbed my peace were acting foolishly, and those who tried to tempt me to go elsewhere were only using tricks from this world.

I hated real suffering in one place but chased fake happiness in another.

God, you knew why I moved from one country to another, but you didn’t tell me or my mother. She was very sad when I left and came with me to the sea. She held me tightly, wanting to keep me or go with me, but I lied to her. I said I had a friend I couldn’t leave until the wind was good for sailing. I tricked my loving mother and escaped. You forgave me for that and kept me safe at sea with your kindness. My mother cried every day and prayed for me, and one day I convinced her to stay near the ship for the night at a shrine of the blessed Cyprian. That night, I quietly left while she prayed and cried. What was she asking God for with all those tears? She hoped I wouldn’t sail away. But God had a secret plan and didn’t grant her wish because He wanted to give her something better.

The wind blew and our sails filled. The shore disappeared. My mother stayed behind, sad and crying loudly, but God didn’t listen to her complaints. At the same time, God used my feelings to move me toward what I truly wanted. My mother’s strong love was tested by sorrow. Like all mothers, she loved having me with her and didn’t know the happiness God was preparing for her by letting me leave. Not knowing this, she cried and mourned, feeling the pain that comes from sorrow and loss. Even after she called me unkind and cruel, she kept praying for me.
