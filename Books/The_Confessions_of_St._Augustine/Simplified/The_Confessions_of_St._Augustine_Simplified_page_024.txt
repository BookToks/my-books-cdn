BOOK TWO  
He focuses on his sixteenth year, a time when he was lazy, full of strong feelings, and got into trouble like a typical teenager. Remembering how he once stole some pears makes him think deeply about why people do bad things. “I became to myself a wasteland.”  

CHAPTER I  
1. Now, I want to think back about all the bad things I did and the selfish desires in my soul — not because I still like them, but so I can love you, God. I do this because I want to love your love. I look back at my mistakes with sadness so that you, who are true and good, can become sweeter to me! You are a happiness that never lies!  

You can take me back from the broken pieces of my life, even though I turned away from you, God, and lost myself among many distractions. When I became a teenager, I wanted to be happy with things in this world and I let myself go wild, chasing after different kinds of love that didn’t last. I wasted away and became corrupt in your eyes, but I still liked how I looked and wanted others to like me too.  

CHAPTER II  
2. But what really made me happy was just loving and being loved. Still, I didn’t keep a healthy kind of love, like a true friendship between minds. Instead, I got caught up in confusing feelings and desires that came from my body and my growing imagination. These mixed feelings made it hard for me to tell the difference between pure love and bad desire. Both were mixed up inside me and pulled me down into sinful actions.  

Your anger was upon me, but I didn’t realize it. I was trapped by the chains of being human, which punished my proud soul, and I drifted further away from you. You let me do this. I was tossed around and wasted, living in sin, but you stayed quiet, my slow-to-anger Joy! You stayed quiet while I wandered into more sadness and tiredness, feeling proud but unhappy.  

3. If only someone had helped me control my wild feelings and use the beauty around me in a good way, setting limits so that my youthful feelings could have been spent in marriage! Then, I could have been calm and happy with having children, just like your law says, Lord — you who make life and can gently take away the pain that came after we left paradise!  

Your power is never far from us, even when we are far from you. Now, I wish I had listened better to the warnings like: “People who marry will have troubles, but I protect you,” and, “It’s good for a man not to touch a woman,” and, “Those who can control themselves should do so.”
