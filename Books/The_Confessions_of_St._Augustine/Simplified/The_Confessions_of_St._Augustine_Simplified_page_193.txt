All things exist because they come from you, the one true good. Nothing would even begin to exist without you.

What has physical matter done to deserve existing—even when it’s invisible and shapeless—since it wouldn’t even be there if you hadn’t made it?

And if it didn’t exist, it couldn’t earn its existence from you.

What about the formless spiritual world that shines without its own light? It wouldn’t exist at all if it weren’t created and illuminated by your Word, which made it like a reflection of your true light. Just like a body can exist without being beautiful, a created spirit can live without being wise. But the best thing for everything you made is to stay close to you. If it turns away, it loses the light it got from you and falls back into darkness.

As for us, who have souls, when we turned away from you, O Light, we lived in darkness. We struggle in that darkness until—through your Son—we become right and strong like the mountains. Like the deep abyss, we have been judged by you.

When you said at the start of creation, “Let there be light,” I think you meant the spiritual world. It already had life but wasn’t ready to be fully enlightened by you. It didn’t deserve light just because it existed.

Its shapelessness didn’t please you until it became light. It became light not just by existing, but by turning toward your light and holding on to it. Its life and happiness come only from your grace, because it moved closer to something that never changes for better or worse. You alone exist without any change. For you, living and being happy are the same because you are pure happiness.

So, what could your goodness have needed if these things had never been made or stayed unformed?

You didn’t create them because you lacked anything, but because your goodness is overflowing.
