Right now, we’re not trying to figure out the paths of the sky, measure how far stars are, or find out how heavy the earth is. It’s me—my mind—that remembers things.

This isn’t surprising if what I really am is close to me. And what could be closer than myself? I can’t fully understand how strong my memory is, even though I couldn’t say my own name without it. But what about when I remember forgetting something? Should I say that what I remember isn’t really in my memory? Or that forgetfulness is in my memory so I don’t forget? Both ideas don’t make sense. So what else could it be? How can I say I remember forgetfulness without really remembering it? For an image to be in my memory, the thing itself has to have been there first.

I remember places like Carthage and all the other places I’ve been. I remember faces of people I’ve seen and things I heard or felt. I remember when I was healthy or sick. When these things happened, my memory took pictures of them so I can think about them later when they’re gone. If forgetfulness was kept in my memory just by an image and not really itself, then forgetfulness must have been there first to leave that image. But when forgetfulness was there, how could it leave its image if it erases what’s already written? Still, even though it’s hard to understand, I know I remember forgetfulness because it shows me that something is missing.

Memory is really powerful. It’s amazing, God, so deep and endless! This is my mind, this is who I am. So, what am I, God? I am a life that is mixed and huge. In my memory, there are endless rooms and caves, fields and spaces full of all kinds of things—either as pictures like bodies, or as actual thoughts, or as feelings that stay even when I don’t feel them anymore. I can explore all these as much as I want, but there’s no end.

Memory is so strong, and human life is short! So what should I do, God, my true life? I want to go beyond this memory power—I want to go beyond it to reach you, the beautiful Light. What are you telling me? I fly in my mind toward you, who are above me. I want to go even beyond this memory power to find you where you can be found, and stay close to you where that’s possible. Even animals have memory; otherwise, they wouldn’t find their homes or do many things they know how to do by habit. They couldn’t form habits without memory. But I want to go beyond memory to reach you, who made me wiser than animals. I will go beyond memory; but where can I find you, the true Good and the steady Sweetness?
