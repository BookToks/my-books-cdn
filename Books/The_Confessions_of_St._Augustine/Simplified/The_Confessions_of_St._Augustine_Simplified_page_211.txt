What really matters isn’t just the gift itself, but the feeling and spirit behind giving it. So, someone who serves God and not just themselves can be happy about these gifts. I understand why, and I’m really happy with him.

Paul got the things the Philippians sent through Epaphroditus. I see why he was so glad. He found joy in what they gave him. He said, “I’m really happy in the Lord because your care for me has grown again, even though before it had become tiring for you.” The Philippians had been tired from doing good things for a long time and had become weak, like dried-up plants that stopped producing fruit. But now Paul is happy—not just for himself—because they are active again in helping him.

Paul also said, “I’m not talking about my needs, because I’ve learned to be okay no matter what. I know how to be humble and how to be successful; I’ve learned how to be full and hungry; I can handle everything through Christ who gives me strength.”

Where does Paul find joy in everything? What makes him happy? What does he feed on? It’s joy! He says, “You did well by sharing with me when I was having a hard time.” That’s what gives him joy. They helped him not just because he needed it, but because he knew how to handle both good and tough times with God’s help. He reminded them that when he first left Macedonia to spread the gospel, no church helped him except them. Even in Thessalonica, they sent help again and again when he needed it. Now he’s happy because they are helping again, like a field becoming fertile and producing fruit once more.

Did Paul say, “You sent me gifts because I needed them” just for himself? No, not only for that.

How do we know? Because he also said, “It’s not because I want a gift, but because I want fruit.” I’ve learned from God how to understand the difference. A “gift” is the actual thing given, like money, food, clothes, or help. But the “fruit” is the good and kind attitude of the person giving.

Jesus said, “Whoever welcomes a prophet because they are a prophet will get a reward,” and “Whoever welcomes a good person because they are good will get a reward.” He also said, “Whoever gives even a cup of cold water to someone in need because they follow me will not lose their reward.” So, the gift is important, but the spirit and reason behind giving is what really counts.
