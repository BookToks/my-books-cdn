There are many things we can’t see directly, but we can understand them through signs we can observe and by thinking about them in our minds.

When we talk about “The generation of the waters,” it means the signs we see with our bodies, because they show how connected we are to the physical world. But the power to create in humans also happens in the mind, shown by how our reason and thinking grow and create new ideas.

So, we believe that God told both kinds, “Be fruitful and multiply.” This means He gave us the ability not only to express one idea in many ways but also to understand many meanings from just one statement. Like how the sea is full of water and waves that show many different meanings, the earth is full of people. The dry earth shows it’s thirsty for truth, and it’s ruled by reason.

Now, I want to share what the next Scripture means to me. I will speak honestly because God helps me know what to say. I believe I can only speak the truth if it comes from Him, because He is the Truth, and people lie on their own. So, if I want to tell the truth, I must tell God’s truth.

God gave us all plants that produce seeds for food, and trees with seeds too, not just for us but also for birds, animals, and insects. But He didn’t give these to fish and whales. We said these plants show mercy through a story: the earth gives us what we need to live. A good example of this “earth” was Onesiphorus, who helped Paul and was not ashamed when Paul was imprisoned. The brothers in Macedonia also helped Paul when he needed it.

But Paul was sad when some people didn’t help him. He said, “At my first answer no one stood with me, but all left me; I pray God it won’t be counted against them.” We owe “fruits” or thanks to those who teach us about God’s mysteries. We owe them as people.

We also owe these “fruits” to “living souls” because they show us good examples by controlling themselves. And finally, we owe “fruits” to “flying creatures” because their blessings spread all over the earth, and their voices reach everywhere.

Those who enjoy these “fruits” are nourished by them, but people who only care about their stomachs don’t find joy in them. For those who give these “fruits,” it’s not about food alone.
