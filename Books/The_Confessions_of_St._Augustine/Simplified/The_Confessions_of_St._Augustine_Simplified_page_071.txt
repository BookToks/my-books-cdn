Now that you have saved her from the sticky trap of death.

She was really miserable! And you made her pain worse so she would leave everything else behind and turn to you—who are above everything and without whom nothing would even exist—so she could change and get better. I remember how miserable I was back then, and how you made me realize my own misery. It happened one day when I was getting ready to give a speech praising the emperor. In that speech, I was going to tell many lies, and people would even clap knowing I was lying. My heart felt heavy with guilt, and I was really uneasy.

While walking down a street in Milan, I saw a poor beggar who, I think, had just eaten, joking and having fun. I sighed and told my friends about how crazy we are. Even with all our hard work—like my own, trying to reach happiness by chasing after fame and success—I realized we were only trying to get the kind of happiness that this beggar already had. But there was a good chance we’d never get it! The beggar got his happiness from a few coins he begged for, while I was chasing after it through many difficult and sad paths. He didn’t have real joy, but with all my ambitions, I was chasing something even less real. Still, he was happy and I was worried. He was free from problems, and I was full of fear.

If someone asked me if I’d rather be happy or worried, I’d say “happy.” But if they asked me if I’d rather be like the beggar or like myself back then, I’d choose myself—even though I had so many worries. But was that a true choice? Was it fair?

Actually, I shouldn’t have chosen myself just because I was more educated than him. I didn’t get much joy from my learning; I just wanted to impress people with it—not to teach, but to please them. So, you corrected me harshly.

Let my soul say goodbye to those who say, “It matters where a person gets their joy. The beggar was happy because of drinking; you wanted to be happy because of fame.” What fame, Lord? The kind that isn’t from you. Just as his joy wasn’t real, mine wasn’t real glory either, but it made me feel even more proud. The beggar would get over his drunkenness that night, but I had lived with mine many nights and would live with it many more. It does matter where a person’s joy comes from. I know that, and I know that the joy from true hope is way better than empty things. Still, the beggar was happier than me—not only because he was fully enjoying his fun while I was torn apart by worry, but because he got his drink by wishing well to people passing by. Meanwhile, I was chasing pride by lying. I told my friends this, and they agreed. I saw that things were bad for me, and I worried even more. If something good happened to me, I didn’t want to grab it because it would almost immediately disappear.

Those of us who lived like close friends often complained about our situation together. But I talked about it especially with Alypius and Nebridius, and we spoke openly. Alypius was from the same town as me; his parents were very important there, but he was a little younger than me.
