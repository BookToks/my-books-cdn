BOOK THIRTEEN  

This book talks about the hidden meanings and stories behind the days of creation. Augustine tries to explain Genesis 1:2-31 in a special, symbolic way to show how powerful, wise, and loving God is. He also wants to share his ideas about how to understand the Bible, using creation as his main example.

He sees the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) in the creation story and thinks about the Spirit moving over the waters. The sky represents the Bible, and the dry land and salty sea show the difference between God's people and those who don’t believe. He talks about how humans are made to be like God. He finishes by thinking about how everything God made is good and about the promise of eternal rest, like God’s own peaceful “Sabbath.”

CHAPTER I  

1. I call on you, my God, my Mercy. You made me and didn’t forget me, even though I forgot you. I call you into my soul, which you prepared by making me desire you. Don’t leave me when I call on you, because you knew I would call before I even did. You kept trying to get me to hear you from far away and turn to you.

Lord, you erased all the bad things I deserve and didn’t punish me for what I did wrong. You also gave me good things before I earned them because you made me.

Before I existed, you were there, and I wasn’t anything that you had to create. But I exist now because of your kindness, which made everything about me. You didn’t need me, and I’m not something that could help you, my Lord and God. I don’t serve you because you get tired or need help, or like a field that needs planting. Instead, I serve and worship you so I can find my own good from you, who gives me everything good.

CHAPTER II  

2. Everything that exists comes from your goodness. You made the world so that good things would continue to exist, even though they can’t help you or be like you, because they came from you.

What did the sky and earth deserve from you when you made them at the start? Let these things, both spiritual and physical, show what they earned from you. Even though they started without shape or order, you kept them alive. A spiritual thing without shape is better than a physical thing with shape, and a physical thing without shape is better than nothing at all. Still, even these shapeless things are kept in their state.
