Everything that will happen comes from what has already happened, and both the past and the future come from something that is always right now. Who can stop and really understand that this “always now” isn’t about the future or the past, but shows itself in both? Can my hand do this, or can my words make it happen, even if I try really hard?

  
CHAPTER XII  
14. So, what should I say to someone who asks, “What was God doing before he made heaven and earth?” I don’t answer like someone who joked, “He was getting hell ready for those who ask too many questions.” That’s just making fun of the question. It’s one thing to know the answer, but it’s not right to laugh at someone who’s asking something serious. I’d rather say, “I don’t know what I don’t know,” than give a silly answer just to seem smart.

Instead, I say that God made everything. And if “heaven and earth” means everything, then I’m sure that before God made heaven and earth, he didn’t make anything else. Because if he did, it would have been some kind of creature. I really wish I knew everything I want to know, but I do know that nothing was made before anything else was made.

  
CHAPTER XIII  
15. If someone thinks about the past and wonders why God, who made everything, waited so long before making the world, they should realize that they’re getting confused. Because if God made all time, where could those “long ages” have happened before he made the world? What kind of time would that be, if God didn’t create it? How could time have passed if it didn’t even exist yet? Since God made all time, if there was time before heaven and earth, then why say God was waiting? God made that time too, and time couldn’t pass before he made everything. But if there was no time before heaven and earth, then how can someone ask, “What were you doing then?” There was no “then” because there was no time.

16. Also, God doesn’t come before one time by another time.

If he did, then there would always be some time before all time. But God is always present, beyond all past and future times, because the future hasn’t happened yet, and once it does, it becomes past. But God stays the same forever and never changes. God’s “years” don’t come and go like ours do. Our years come and go so moments can happen. God’s years all exist at once because they never end. Past years don’t stop future years from existing, because God’s years never disappear. All our years will be with God, even after they’re over. God’s years are like one day, but it’s not a day that repeats—it’s always “today.”
