My lamp; the Lord my God will light up my darkness. We have all received from His fullness because He is the true Light that shines on everyone who comes into the world. In Him, nothing changes or shifts like a shadow.

But I kept trying to reach You, and You pushed me back so I could understand what death feels like, because You resist proud people. What could be more prideful than me, foolishly claiming to be like You? I knew I could change because my desire to become wise came from wanting to get better. Still, I chose to believe that You could change rather than admit that I was not like You.

That’s why You pushed me back; You resisted my unstable pride. So I kept imagining physical things, and since I was flesh, I blamed the flesh. Since I was like “a wind that passes away,” I didn’t return to You but wandered after things that don’t really exist—in You, in me, or in the body. These ideas were not given to me by Your truth but made up by my own useless pride based on what I sensed.

I used to ask Your faithful followers—my own people, though I didn’t realize I was separated from them—foolishly, “If God made the soul, why does it make mistakes?” But I wouldn’t let anyone ask me, “Then why would God make mistakes?” I chose to believe that Your unchanging nature had to be involved in error rather than admit that my own changeable nature had gone wrong by choice and fallen into error as a punishment.

I was about twenty-six or twenty-seven when I wrote those books, thinking hard about the images my senses brought to my heart. I tried to listen for Your inner music, O sweet Truth, thinking about what is beautiful and right, wanting to stay and hear You and be happy at the “Bridegroom’s voice.” But I couldn’t, because my own mistakes were too loud inside me, and my pride kept pulling me down. You didn’t make me hear joy and gladness, nor did my bones rejoice because I was not yet humble.

What good was it that when I was about twenty years old, I found a book by Aristotle called The Ten Categories? Just the title sounded great and divine to me because my rhetoric teacher in Carthage and others who were known for their learning always talked about it with pride. I read it by myself and understood it. And what did it matter that when I talked about it with others, they said even with teachers explaining it and drawing diagrams in the sand, they barely understood it and couldn’t tell me more than I learned on my own? The book seemed clear to me when it talked about substances, like a man, and their qualities, like the shape of a man.
