When he disapproves of me, he still feels sorry for me because whether he agrees or disagrees, he loves me. To those people, I will show who I really am. Let them feel happy about my good actions and feel sad about my bad ones. My good actions come from you and your gifts; my bad actions come from my own mistakes and your judgment. Let them enjoy the good and feel sorry for the bad. And let songs and tears rise to you from their loving hearts, which are like holy containers.

O Lord, who likes the prayers from your holy place, please have mercy on me because of your great kindness. Please don’t ever give up on the work you started in me. Instead, keep helping me finish what’s not yet perfect in me.

This is what my confessions show—not what I used to be, but what I am now. I don’t want to say this only to you in secret, feeling both happy and scared, but also to the other believers—my friends who share my joys and struggles. They are my brothers and sisters, those who have gone before me, those walking with me now, and those who will come after. They are your servants, whom you want to be your children. They are my leaders, whom you told me to follow if I want to live with you. But your words wouldn’t mean much if you didn’t help me feel them inside. So I do this in both action and word. I do this under your protection, even though it’s risky, because under your wings my soul belongs to you, and you know my weaknesses. I’m not enough on my own, but my Father lives forever, and my protector is enough for me. He is the same one who created me and watches over me. You are my good, the all-powerful one who is with me even before I am with you. So to those you want me to serve, I will tell not what I was, but what I am now and will keep being. But I won’t judge myself. So, please let me be heard.

You, Lord, are the one who judges me. Even though no one really knows a person except their own spirit inside them, there is still something about a person that even their own spirit doesn’t fully understand. But you, Lord, who made us, know us completely. And even though I see myself as nothing but dust and ashes before you, I know something about you that I don’t know about myself. It’s true that “now we see through a dark glass,” not clearly “face to face.” So, while I’m still far from you, I understand myself better than I understand you. I know you can’t be harmed, but I don’t know what temptations I can resist or not. But there is hope because you are faithful and won’t let us be tempted more than we can handle. You will always make a way to escape so we can bear it.

So, I will confess what I know about myself, and I will also admit what I don’t know. What I do know comes from your light helping me, and what I don’t know I will have to wait to understand until the time when everything is clear to you.
