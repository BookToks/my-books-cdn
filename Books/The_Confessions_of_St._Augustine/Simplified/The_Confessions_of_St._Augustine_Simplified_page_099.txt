CHAPTER III

6. Oh good God, why does a person feel happier when a lost soul is saved after being in great danger, compared to someone who was never in trouble or never lost hope? You, merciful Father, “are happier when one person says sorry than when ninety-nine good people don’t need to say sorry.” We love hearing stories about the lost sheep being carried home by the shepherd while angels celebrate, or when a lost coin is found and the neighbors are happy with the woman who found it. The big celebration in your house makes us cry when we hear about the younger son who “was dead but is alive again, was lost but is found.” You are the one who rejoices in both us and your angels, who are holy because they love. You never change because you know everything, even though everything else changes.

7. So, what happens inside a person when they feel more happiness in getting back something they love than if they had always had it?

Many things show this is true. A commander is happy about winning a battle, but he couldn’t have won without fighting first; the harder the fight, the sweeter the victory. When a storm shakes a ship and everyone is scared they might die, they feel so happy when the sea and sky calm down. If someone you love is very sick and in danger, everyone worries a lot. When that person gets better, even if they aren’t as strong as before, the happiness is greater than before when they were healthy. Even fun things in life come after hard times. You only enjoy eating and drinking because you were hungry and thirsty before. Some drunk people even eat salty food to make themselves thirsty, and then drinking feels nice. Also, a bride and groom don’t get married right away so the groom will appreciate the bride more after waiting.

8. This idea is true even for bad pleasures, but it’s also true for good pleasures. In honest friendships and for someone who was lost and then found, bigger joy always comes after bigger pain. What does this mean, Lord my God, since you are always happy in yourself, and some creatures always enjoy you? Why do these creatures go back and forth between wanting and having enough? Is this the way things were made to be? From the highest heaven to the lowest earth, from the start of the world to the end, from angels to worms, from the first moment to the last, did you give everyone their own place and time for good things and right works? Wow, you are so high above and so deep below! You never leave us, but it is hard for us to come back to you.
