Even if the judge had agreed, Alypius would have just walked out of the court.

But there was one thing that caught his interest because he loved learning, and it almost made him make a bad choice. He found out he could get books copied for himself for free, using public money. But his sense of what was right won out, and he decided not to do it. He thought following the rule against it was better than using his position to get a special privilege. These might seem like small things, but being honest in little matters shows you can be honest in big ones. Alypius was that kind of person. He stuck close to me back then and, like me, wasn’t sure what kind of life to choose.

Nebridius had also come to Milan just to live with me while we both searched hard for truth and wisdom. He left his hometown near Carthage—and Carthage itself—where he usually lived. He left behind his big family estate, his house, and his mom, who wouldn’t come with him. Like me, he sighed and felt unsure. He was a passionate seeker of the true life and very sharp when thinking about hard questions. So there were three of us, all struggling and hoping that you would give us what we needed at the right time. Even though life brought us many troubles, we tried to understand why we suffered—and all we found was confusion! We turned away feeling sad and asking, “How long will this last?” We asked a lot, but didn’t give up our struggles, because we hadn’t found anything sure to hold on to instead.

I especially thought about how much time had passed since I was nineteen, when I first fell in love with wisdom and promised myself to leave behind useless hopes and crazy desires as soon as I found her. Now I was almost thirty, still stuck in the same mess, still wanting to enjoy things that don’t last and distract me. I kept telling myself, “Tomorrow I’ll figure it out; soon it will be clear, and Faustus will explain everything.” Or I would ask, “O wise Academics, is there no sure thing that people can hold on to for guidance in life? No, let’s keep searching harder and not give up. Look, the things in the Church’s books that seemed so strange before don’t seem that way now, and maybe they can be understood honestly. I’ll stand firm where my parents placed me as a child until the true answer is found. But where and when will that be? Ambrose is too busy...”
