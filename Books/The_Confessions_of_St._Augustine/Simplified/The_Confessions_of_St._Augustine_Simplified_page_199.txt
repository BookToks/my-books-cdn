Sometimes I feel sad because things get worse again and it feels like a deep, endless pit. But my faith talks to my soul—it’s like a light that guides me in the dark. It says, “Why are you feeling down, my soul? Why are you upset? Keep hoping in God.” His word is like a lamp that shows the way.

Keep hoping and don’t give up until the hard times pass—the night that belongs to bad things. Wait until God’s anger goes away—that anger we once caused because we lived in darkness and still carry some of that inside us because of sin. Keep hoping and stay strong until the day comes and the shadows disappear. Hope in the Lord: in the morning I will stand before Him and watch; I will always praise Him. In the morning I will see God, who gives me strength and will bring life to our bodies through His Spirit because He showed mercy when we were lost and restless inside.

Right now, during this journey we’re on, we have proof that we are in the light because we are saved by hope. We are children of the light and the day—not of the night or darkness, which we used to be. Only God can truly tell the difference between those who live in darkness and those who live in the light, because He knows our hearts and calls light “day” and darkness “night.” Who can see us clearly except Him? Everything we have is a gift from God, who made some people noble and others not so noble.

Now, only God made His holy Scripture like a sky stretched over us. One day, “the heavens will be rolled up like a scroll,” but for now, God’s Word covers us like a skin. His Scripture is even more powerful now that the people who shared it with us have died. Just like God gave humans skin when they became mortal because of sin, He has spread out His Book over us through those who have passed away. Their deaths made their words stronger and more powerful than when they were alive. God hasn’t finished spreading this protective sky over us—it’s still growing as more people hear about these faithful ones.

Let us look at “the heavens, the work of your fingers,” and see clearly God’s amazing creation.
