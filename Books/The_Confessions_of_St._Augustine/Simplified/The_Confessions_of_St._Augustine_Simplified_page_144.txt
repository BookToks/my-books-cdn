Sometimes, I’m not sure if I really need food to take care of my body or if I just want it because I’m craving something fun or tasty. In that confusion, my unhappy soul feels a little happy and uses it as an excuse to do what it wants.

I’m glad it’s not clear how much food is just right for good health, so I tell myself it’s okay to eat more for my health, even when I’m really just looking for pleasure. Every day, I try to fight these urges and ask for your help, throwing all my worries onto you because I still don’t know what’s best.

I hear your voice telling me, “Don’t let your heart be weighed down by overeating or drinking too much.” Drinking too much isn’t a problem for me, and I trust you to keep it that way. But sometimes, I do eat too much, and I ask you to help me stop. No one can control themselves without your help.

You give us many good things, sometimes even before we ask, so we know they come from you. I’ve never been a drunk, but I know you’ve helped people stop being drunkards. You’ve also kept some people from ever getting drunk and helped others change. And through all this, we learn that everything comes from you.

I also heard you say, “Don’t follow your desires and control your pleasures.” I like this part: “Eating or not eating won’t really make us better or worse.” That means eating a lot won’t make me stronger, and eating less won’t make me weaker. I heard another voice saying, “I have learned to be happy in any situation. I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength.” That’s like a soldier fighting with God’s power, not just an ordinary person.

But please, Lord, remind me that “we are dust” and you made us from dust, and even though we get lost, you find us again. The apostle Paul, who said these things, wasn’t strong by himself. He was made from dust too, but he said, “I can do all things through him who strengthens me.” Please give me strength too, so I can do what’s right.

Give me what you command, and command what you want. Paul said he got the gift of your grace and when he was proud, he was proud of you. I also heard someone praying, “Take away my greediness.” This shows, God, that you help us when we obey your commands.

You taught me, good Father, that “to pure people, everything is pure,” but it’s wrong to upset others by what we eat. You said, “Every creature you made is good, and nothing should be refused if it’s accepted with thanks.”
