matter of doubt whether it is the needful care of the body that still calls for food or whether it is the sensual snare of desire still wanting to be served. In this uncertainty my unhappy soul rejoices, and uses it to prepare an excuse as a defense.
 
 It is glad that it is not clear as to what is sufficient for the moderation of health, so that under the pretense of health it may conceal its projects for pleasure. These temptations I daily endeavor to resist and I summon thy right hand to my help and cast my perplexities onto thee, for I have not yet reached a firm conclusion in this matter.
 
 45. I hear the voice of my God commanding: “Let not your heart be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness.”353 Drunkenness is far from me.
 
 Thou wilt have mercy that it does not come near me. But “surfeiting” sometimes creeps upon thy servant. Thou wilt have mercy that it may be put far from me. For no man can be continent unless thou give it.354 Many things that we pray for thou givest us, and whatever good we receive before we prayed for it, we receive it from thee, so that we might afterward know that we did receive it from thee. I never was a drunkard, but I have known drunkards made into sober men by thee. It was also thy doing that those who never were drunkards have not been—and likewise, it was from thee that those who have been might not remain so always. And it was likewise from thee that both might know from whom all this came.
 
 I heard another voice of thine: “Do not follow your lusts and refrain yourself from your pleasures.”355 And by thy favor I have also heard this saying in which I have taken much delight: “Neither if we eat are we the better; nor if we eat not are we the worse.”356 This is to say that neither shall the one make me to abound, nor the other to be wretched. I heard still another voice: “For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. I know how to be abased and I know how to abound. . . . I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me.”357 See here a soldier of the heavenly army; not the sort of dust we are. But remember, O Lord, “that we are dust”358 and that thou didst create man out of the dust,359 and that he “was lost, and is found.”360 Of course, he [the apostle Paul] could not do all this by his own power. He was of the same dust—he whom I loved so much and who spoke of these things through the afflatus of thy inspiration: “I can,” he said, “do all things through him who strengtheneth me.” Strengthen me, that I too may be able.
 
 Give what thou commandest, and command what thou wilt. This man [Paul] confesses that he received the gift of grace and that, when he glories, he glories in the Lord. I have heard yet another voice praying that he might receive. “Take from me,” he said, “the greediness of the belly.”361 And from this it appears, O my holy God, that thou dost give it, when what thou commandest to be done is done.
 
 46. Thou hast taught me, good Father, that “to the pure all things are pure”362; but “it is evil for that man who gives offense in eating”363; and that “every creature of thine is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with 353Cf. Luke 21:34.
