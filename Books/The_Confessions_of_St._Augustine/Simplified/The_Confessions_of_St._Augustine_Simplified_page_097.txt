Life was full of inner struggle and feeling unsure, because many people were pushing me—even though I didn’t want to—to agree to get married, which felt like being tied up and trapped. I had heard from Truth that “there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake,” but he said, “If you can accept this, then accept it.” It’s true that all people are proud if they don’t know God or haven’t been able to find Him through the good things they see. But I was no longer caught in that pride. I had overcome it, and through everything around me, I had found you, our Creator, and your Word—God with you, and together with you and the Holy Spirit, one God—who made everything.  

There are also bad people who “knew God but didn’t honor Him or thank Him.” I had fallen into that too, but your strong hand held me up and helped me recover. You said to people, “Respect the Lord, that is true wisdom,” and, “Don’t be wise in your own eyes,” because “those who think they are wise become fools.” But now I had found the precious pearl, and I should have sold everything I had to buy it—yet I still hesitated.  

So, I went to Simplicianus, the spiritual father of Ambrose (who was a bishop then), and Ambrose loved him like a father. I told him all about my confusing struggles. When I mentioned that I had read some books by the Platonists, which Victorinus—once a teacher of speaking in Rome, who later became a Christian like me—had translated into Latin, Simplicianus was happy. He said it was good I hadn’t read other philosophers’ writings, which are full of mistakes and lies, “after the basic things of this world,” while the Platonists always pointed the way to believing in God and His Word.  

To encourage me to be humble like Christ, which only the simple really understand, he told me about Victorinus himself, whom he knew well in Rome. I have to share what he said because it shows God’s grace clearly and should be praised: Victorinus was an old man, very smart and skilled in many subjects; he had read, explained, and critiqued many philosophers’ works; he taught many important senators; and because of his achievements, he had a statue in the Roman Forum—a big honor in the world.  

But this man, who had been an idol worshiper and took part in false religious ceremonies common among Rome’s nobles, and who had inspired people to love gods like Osiris, Anubis, and other strange gods fighting against Neptune, Venus, Minerva, and Mars, had changed completely.
