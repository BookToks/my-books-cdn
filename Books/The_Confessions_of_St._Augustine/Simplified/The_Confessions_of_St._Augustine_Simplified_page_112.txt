When he was away from Rome, he got very sick. During that time, he became a Christian and died as a faithful believer. So, you showed mercy to him, and not just him but to us too. Otherwise, we might have been overwhelmed with sadness, missing our friend and feeling lost without him. Thank you, God; we belong to you. Your encouragement, comfort, and promises give us hope that you will reward Verecundus for that country house at Cassiciacum—where we found peace away from the chaos of the world—with the everlasting beauty of your paradise. There, you have forgiven his sins, in that rich, flowing place—your own.

Verecundus was very sad, but Nebridius was happy. He wasn’t a Christian yet and believed wrongly that your Son’s body was just an illusion. But he left that wrong belief behind and believed like we did. Even though he hadn’t yet taken part in any Church ceremonies, he seriously wanted to find the truth.

Not long after we became Christians through baptism, he also joined the Catholic Church. He lived a pure and faithful life among his people in Africa and brought his whole family to Christianity. Then you took him from this life, and now he lives with Abraham, in what we call “Abraham’s bosom.” I don’t know exactly what that means, but that’s where my friend Nebridius is now, your son by adoption, no longer a servant. That’s where he belongs. He is in the place he asked me so many questions about—back then, I didn’t know much. Now, he doesn’t need to ask me; he drinks wisdom straight from you—happy forever. But I don’t think he’s so full of joy that he forgets about me, because you, Lord, remember us all.

So, we were trying to comfort the sad Verecundus—our friendship stayed strong—helping him accept our faith and encouraging him to believe in a way that fit his life as a married man. We waited for Nebridius to join us, since he was so close to doing so, but then the waiting time ended.

The days felt long because I was excited to have free time, so I could sing to you from my heart, “My heart has said to you, I have sought your face; your face, O Lord, I will seek.”

Finally, the day came when I was free from my teaching job, which I had already planned to leave. It happened. You freed my speech just like you freed my heart, and I thanked you happily. Then I went with my friends to the villa. My books show what I wrote there, now hopefully for your service; though at that time, it still felt like I was recovering from the pride I had in my old job.
