Chapter VI

For almost nine years, I listened to the Manichean teachings with a confused mind, always excited for Faustus to arrive. Whenever I asked questions that others couldn’t answer, they told me to wait for him. They said he would easily clear up all my doubts, no matter how big. When he finally came, he was a pleasant speaker who talked about the same things as the others but spoke more smoothly and nicely. But what good was his fancy way of talking if he couldn’t give me the deep answers I was looking for? I had already heard so much like this before, and it didn’t seem better just because it sounded nicer or was well said. I couldn’t think he was truly wise just because he looked good and spoke well. The people who praised him didn’t really know what they were talking about.

They liked him because his speaking was beautiful, but I realized there’s also a kind of person who doesn’t trust the truth if it’s said too smoothly. But God, you had already taught me amazing things, so I believed—because it’s true—that you were the only real teacher of truth wherever truth is found. I had learned from you that just because something is said beautifully doesn’t mean it’s true; and just because something is said awkwardly doesn’t mean it’s false.

Also, something isn’t always true just because it’s said roughly, nor false because spoken well. Wisdom and foolishness are like good and bad food, and fancy or simple words are like fancy or plain dishes—both good and bad ideas can be said in any kind of words.

I was really excited to meet Faustus, and I liked how he acted and spoke during arguments. I enjoyed his smooth and clever words. I even praised him more than others did. But it annoyed me that during his talks, I wasn’t allowed to ask the hard questions that bothered me. When I finally got the chance to talk to him privately with some friends, I asked him my doubts. I quickly found out he only knew a little about the arts, just some basic grammar.

He had read some speeches by Tully, a few books by Seneca, some poets, and a few books from his own group written in good Latin.

With this small amount of learning and his daily practice speaking, he had become a smooth and charming speaker, helped by quick thinking and natural talent. Isn’t that how it really was, Lord my God, Judge of my heart? You were guiding me secretly, showing me my shameful mistakes so I could see and hate them.

Chapter VII

As soon as I saw that Faustus didn’t know much about the subjects I thought he was good at, I started to lose hope that he could explain my confusing questions. Still, I knew that his lack of knowledge wouldn’t have mattered if he hadn’t been a Manichean.
