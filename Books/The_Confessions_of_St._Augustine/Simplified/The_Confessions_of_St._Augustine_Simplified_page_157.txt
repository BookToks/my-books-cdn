Moses wrote about him. He even says so himself; the Truth tells us this too.

Let me hear and understand how you made heaven and earth in the beginning. Moses wrote about this and passed it on from one to another, but now he is not here with me. If he were, I would hold him and ask him seriously to explain these things to me in your name. I would listen carefully to every word he said. But if he spoke in Hebrew, I might not understand it, and the words would not reach my mind. If he spoke in Latin, I would understand, but how would I know if what he said was true? Even if I knew, would I know it just because he said it? Deep inside me, Truth itself—without any language or sounds—would say, “He speaks the truth,” and then I would be sure. Then I could confidently tell your man, “You are telling the truth.” But since I cannot ask Moses, I ask you, O Truth, from whom he spoke truth. I ask you, my God, to forgive my sins, and just as you gave your servant the gift to speak these things, please give me the gift to understand them.

Look around; there are heaven and earth. They shout out that they were made because they change and are different over time. Anything that wasn’t made but still exists has nothing new inside it. Being changed or different means having something new. Heaven and earth clearly say they didn’t make themselves: “We exist because we were made; we didn’t exist before we came to be, so we couldn’t have made ourselves!” Their visible presence is their voice. It was you, Lord, who made these things. You are beautiful, so they are beautiful. You are good, so they are good. You are, so they are. But they are not as beautiful, good, or real as you, their Creator.

Compared to you, they are neither beautiful nor good, and they don’t truly exist.

We know these things, and we thank you. But our knowledge is like ignorance compared to your knowledge.

But how did you make heaven and earth? What tool did you use for such a powerful work? It wasn’t like a human making a body from other bodies, shaping it by what he imagines in his mind—though even he couldn’t do that if you hadn’t made his mind first.
