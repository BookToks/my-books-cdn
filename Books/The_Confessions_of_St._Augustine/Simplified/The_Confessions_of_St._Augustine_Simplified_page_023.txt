Is childhood really innocent? No, Lord, it’s not. I ask for your mercy, God, because as we get older, the same wrong things we learn from teachers and parents don’t just disappear. Instead, they change and come from leaders and rich people, just like how punishments get harsher as we grow up. It was the humble attitude of children that you, our King, liked when you said, “The Kingdom of Heaven belongs to people like these.”

But, Lord, thank you for being so good, the Creator and Ruler of everything. I would still thank you even if I hadn’t lived past being a child. Even then, I was alive and aware of myself. I cared about what happened to me—that shows a deep connection to where I come from. I watched over my feelings and senses, and even in small things and thoughts, I learned to enjoy what was true. I didn’t like being tricked; I had a good memory; I could talk well, was kind because of friends, and stayed away from sadness, meanness, and ignorance. Isn’t it amazing to be a living person like this? But all these good things are gifts from my God—I didn’t make them myself.

These gifts are good and make up who I am. So God, who made me, is good too, and I will be very happy and thankful to him for every good thing I had even as a boy. But here’s my mistake: I looked for happiness, respect, and truth not in God, but in myself and other things around me. Because of this, I went through sadness, problems, and made mistakes. Thank you, my joy, my pride, my hope, my God—thank you for your gifts. Please keep them safe in me. If you do, you will keep me safe, and these gifts will grow and get better. I will be with you because I come from you.
