A person who made another person must follow the law, not decide if others are following it. A spiritual person doesn’t judge the difference between spiritual and non-spiritual people, because only God truly knows them. God has already separated and called people before the world was made. Even a spiritual person doesn’t judge the messy state of the world. It’s not their job to judge those outside, since they don’t know who might later find God’s grace or who might stay away from it forever.

Even though humans were made in God’s image, they don’t control the sun, moon, stars, or sky. They don’t control day or night, or the seas. But humans do have power over fish, birds, animals, the land, and all creatures that crawl on the ground.

People decide what’s right and wrong about how others celebrate religious mysteries. These mysteries include the sacraments, like the one where the fish, which comes from the sea, is eaten by believers (the Church). Words from the Bible are spoken out loud because our minds can’t see thoughts directly. So, words fly out like birds under the sky, explaining and praising God, so people can say “Amen.” Even though birds are many, they all come from water.

A spiritual person also judges if the faithful are doing good things, like giving to the poor, which is like the earth producing fruit. They judge how a person’s soul lives through self-control, fasting, and prayer. They also judge anything we can sense with our bodies. Basically, they should judge things they can help correct.

But here’s a question: Why did God bless humans to be “fruitful and multiply” and fill the earth, but didn’t bless the light, sky, stars, earth, or sea? The answer is that God made humans in His image and wanted to bless them especially. He also blessed fish and whales so they could multiply too.
