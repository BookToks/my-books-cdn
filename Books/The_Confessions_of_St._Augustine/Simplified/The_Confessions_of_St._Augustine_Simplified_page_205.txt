28. Everything you made is beautiful, but you, who made everything, are even more beautiful. If Adam hadn’t turned away from you, the human race—like a salty sea, always restless and changing—would never have come from him. Because of this, your helpers had to use physical signs in the midst of many “waters” to show their spiritual actions and words. This is how I understand the phrases “creeping creatures” and “flying birds.” But people who have been taught and brought into your physical mysteries can only benefit if their soul has a higher life and looks beyond to become perfect.

This soul no longer needs baptism like the non-believers did or like it did when covered by water—and baptism is the only way into the Kingdom of Heaven, as you decided.

The first preachers came because people didn’t believe, but they also encourage and bless believers every day. “The living soul” comes from “the earth,” because only believers gain from holding back from loving this world, so their soul can live for you. This soul was dead while enjoying pleasures that lead to death—whereas you, O
