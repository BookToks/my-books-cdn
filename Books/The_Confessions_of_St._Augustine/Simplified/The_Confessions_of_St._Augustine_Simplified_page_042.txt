She was the only one who really understood me, and I stayed loyal to her. With her, I learned from my own experience how different it is to be in a marriage that’s meant for having kids, compared to a relationship based only on strong physical desire, where kids might come even if the parents don’t want them—but once the kids are born, they make us love them anyway.

I also remember when I decided to enter a theater contest. Some magician—I don’t even remember who—asked me what I would give him to make sure I won. But I hated and feared those dark tricks, and I said, “Even if the prize was made of gold that never fades, I wouldn’t let anyone kill a fly for me to win it.” Because that would mean killing living things as sacrifices and inviting evil spirits to help me. I refused that, but it wasn’t because I truly loved God yet—I didn’t know how to love Him because I only thought about physical things. And doesn’t a soul that chases after fake things end up cheating on God, trusting lies, and “feeding on the winds”?

Still, I didn’t want evil sacrifices made for me, though I was unknowingly making my own kind of sacrifices through my false beliefs.

What else is “feeding on the winds” but feeding on evil spirits, letting them control and make fun of us?

CHAPTER III

Even so, I openly asked advice from other tricksters called “astrologers” because they didn’t use sacrifices or call on spirits for their predictions. But real Christian faith must reject and condemn their practice.

It’s good to confess to God and say, “Have mercy on me; heal my soul; I have sinned,” not to use God’s kindness as an excuse to keep sinning. We should remember what Jesus said: “You are healed; don’t sin anymore, or something worse might happen to you.” The astrologers try to ruin this message by saying, “Your sin is fixed by the stars,” or “It’s because of Venus, Saturn, or Mars”—trying to make us think we aren’t responsible and that God is to blame for our problems. But God is the Creator, the source of all goodness, who judges everyone by their actions and loves even those with broken and humble hearts.

At that time, there was a wise and famous doctor. He was a proconsul and personally put a crown on my troubled head when I won a speech contest. But he didn’t do this as a doctor. For my sickness, only God can heal—the One who opposes the proud and gives grace to the humble. Did God fail me through that old man or refuse to heal me? Actually, when I got to know him better...
