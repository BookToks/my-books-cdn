Is justice something that changes all the time? No, but the times we live in are different, so the way justice works can seem different too. People don’t live very long, so they can’t really understand the reasons behind what happened in the past or in other places they haven’t experienced. But they can see that what works for one person, time, or group might not work for another. Sometimes people disagree with one thing, but accept another.

Back then, I didn’t understand these ideas or how important they were. I saw many things around me, but I didn’t really notice them. I wrote poems that had strict rules about how the rhythm and beats had to go, and these rules didn’t change even though the poems were different. Still, I didn’t realize that the same kind of fairness and goodness that good people followed was really part of a bigger, better plan from God. This plan didn’t change in its core, but it gave different rules for different times and situations. While I was blind to this, I unfairly criticized those faithful people for following what God told them to do and for predicting things that would happen later.

Can it ever be wrong for someone to love God with all their heart, soul, and mind, and to love others like themselves? No. Bad actions that go against nature, like what happened with the people of Sodom, are always wrong and should be punished. Even if every nation did those bad things, they would all be guilty because God made us not to harm each other in those ways. When we break the connection with God by acting on twisted desires, it’s wrong.

But when it comes to rules about how people behave, these depend on what each society agrees on. What a city or country decides is right should be followed by everyone, whether they live there or are visiting. If any part of society doesn’t fit well with the whole group, that’s not okay. However, if God commands something that goes against what a nation usually does, even if it’s never been done before, people should still follow it. If a king makes a new law that helps the country, people have to obey it, even if it’s new. And since obeying human leaders helps keep peace, we should obey God, who is the highest leader of all.

This also applies when people try to hurt others on purpose, either by embarrassing them or causing harm. This can happen because of revenge, like enemies fighting, or to get something from someone, like a robber attacking a traveler.
