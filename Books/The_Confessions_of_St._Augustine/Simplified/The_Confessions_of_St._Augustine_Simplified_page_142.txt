More pain and hard work will come for me, but my life will be real because it will be completely filled by you.

But since you only fill those you lift up, I still feel like a burden to myself because you haven’t filled me yet. Happy and sad feelings fight inside me, and I don’t know which one will win.

Oh no! Lord, please have mercy on me; my bad sorrows fight with my good joys, and I don’t know which side will win. Oh no! Lord, please have mercy on me.

Oh no! Look, I don’t hide my wounds. You are the doctor, I am the sick person; you are kind, I need kindness. Isn’t life on earth a tough test? Who wants problems and hard times? You tell us to bear them, not to love them. No one loves what they have to go through, though some may choose to endure it. But even if they are okay with it, they would still rather not have to go through it. When things are bad, I want things to be good; when things are good, I’m scared bad things will come.

So, is there any place in the middle where life isn’t a test? There is sadness in being successful; there is sadness in being afraid of trouble; there is sadness when happiness gets twisted. There is sadness in hard times — a second sadness, and a third one from wanting good times — because hard times are tough and can break our strength. Isn’t life on earth a never-ending test?

My whole hope is in your great mercy and only that. Give what you ask and ask what you want. You tell us to be pure, and when I learned that no one can be pure unless God gives it, that was smart to know whose gift it is. By being pure, we are brought back together in the One, instead of being scattered everywhere. He who loves you but also loves other things more than you does not love you enough, O Love, who burns forever and never stops. O Love, O my God, light me up! You tell me to be pure; give what you ask, and ask what you want.

You clearly tell me to stay away from “the lust of the body, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.” You tell me not to have sex outside marriage, and for marriage itself, you have suggested something even better than what you allow. And since you allowed it, it happened — even before I became a minister of your sacrament. But I still remember — and I have talked about this a lot — the images my habits have left in my mind. These things come into my thoughts without control when I’m awake; but when I sleep, they come not only to give pleasure but even to get my agreement and feel almost like the real thing. The image is so strong in both my soul and body that it tricks me when I’m sleeping to do what I can’t do when I’m awake. Am I not still myself then, O Lord my God? And is there really much difference between me awake and me in the moment I fall asleep or wake up?

So, where is the power of reason that fights these thoughts when I am...
