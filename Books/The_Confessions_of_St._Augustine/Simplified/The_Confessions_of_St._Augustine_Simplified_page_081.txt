I also thought about you, Life of my life, as being everywhere in space, filling the whole world and reaching out endlessly in every direction. So the earth, the sky, and everything else would have you, and all things would be limited by you, even though you wouldn’t be in any one place. Just like the air above the earth doesn’t stop sunlight from passing through, but lets the light fill it completely, I imagined that the sky, air, sea, and earth were all open to you. Every big and small part was ready to have you inside it, guiding everything you created. This was my guess because I couldn’t think of anything else, but it wasn’t true. 

If that were the case, then bigger things would have more of you, and smaller things less—like an elephant having more of you than a sparrow just because it's bigger. That would mean parts of you are spread out in pieces, bigger parts in big things and smaller parts in small things. But you are not like that. Still, you hadn’t yet shown me the truth.

CHAPTER II  
But it wasn’t enough, Lord, just to argue against the tricksters and their silent speakers—silent because your Word didn’t come from them. I remembered what Nebridius said back in old Carthage, shaking us all: “What could this made-up army of darkness, which the Manicheans say fights against you, really do to you if you didn’t fight back?” If they said it could hurt you, that would mean you could be harmed and changed. But if the darkness couldn’t hurt you, then why fight at all? And why should a part of you, like a child of your own being, get mixed up in this fight, get corrupted, and change from happy to miserable, needing your help to be saved? They said this child was the human soul, which your Word—pure and free—helps when it’s trapped and dirty. But if their idea is true, then your Word is also corruptible because it’s made of the same stuff as the soul.

So, if they admit that your nature—whoever you are—is unchangeable, then their ideas are false and should be rejected completely. But if your nature can be changed, then that’s obviously wrong and should be hated right away. This argument was enough to defeat those tricksters who couldn’t escape this problem without saying terrible things about you.

CHAPTER III  
Even though I believed and was sure that you, our Lord, the true God, who made not only our souls but our bodies too—and made everything—were pure and unchanging, I still didn’t fully understand where evil came from. Whatever the answer was, I knew it couldn’t be something that would make me believe that an unchangeable God could change, or else I would become the very thing I was trying to understand.
