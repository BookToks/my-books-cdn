When everything first began, God created the heaven and the earth. Some people think this means that at the very start, God made a kind of raw, unformed stuff that included both heaven and earth. This stuff wasn’t shaped or clear yet, but later on, heaven and earth came out of it and now we can see them and everything in them.

Different people understand the phrase “the earth was invisible and unformed, and darkness was over the abyss” in different ways. One person says it means that what God made first was just a formless, physical matter without any order or light.

Another person thinks it means that the whole thing called heaven and earth was just unformed and dark matter at first. From this, the physical heaven and earth were made with everything we can see and touch.

Someone else believes it means that the unformed and dark matter was the starting point for both the invisible, spiritual heaven and the physical earth. The spiritual heaven is like the highest heaven where all invisible and visible things come from.

Another view is that the word “heaven and earth” doesn’t mean that the formless stuff itself was called that. Instead, this formless, invisible “earth” and dark “abyss” already existed before God made the spiritual and physical heaven and earth from them.

Yet another opinion says that the unformed matter already existed, and from it, God made heaven and earth as two big parts—one above and one below—with all the creatures we know living in them.

Now, if someone argues against the last two ideas by saying, “If you don’t agree that the formless matter is called ‘heaven and earth,’ then it means God didn’t create this matter, and Scripture doesn’t say that God made it. The Bible only says God made heaven and earth, so when it talks about the earth being invisible and unformed, it must mean the stuff God created,” those who believe the last two ideas would answer: “We agree that this unformed matter was made by God.”
