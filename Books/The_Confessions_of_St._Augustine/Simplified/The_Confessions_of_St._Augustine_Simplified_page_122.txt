When she died, I closed her eyes, and a deep sadness filled my heart. I almost cried, but I forced myself to hold back my tears. Inside, I felt a strong pain. As soon as she breathed her last, the boy Adeodatus started crying loudly, but we all stopped him, and he became quiet. I also wanted to cry because of my young feelings, but I held back. We didn't think it was right to mourn her with loud crying and wailing. People usually do that when someone dies unhappy or completely gone. But she didn’t die unhappy, nor was she truly gone. We knew this because of her good life, her true faith, and many clear signs.

What hurt me most wasn’t just her death, but the sudden loss of living with her every day. I felt happy because she praised me during her last illness, calling me kind and remembering that I never spoke harshly to her. But, God, how can the honor I gave her compare to what she did for me? Now, I was left without her comfort, and my soul was deeply hurt. Our lives, once joined as one, felt torn apart.

When Adeodatus was quiet, Evodius started singing from the Psalms, and everyone joined in. When others heard, many friends and religious women came together. While some prepared for the funeral, I talked in another room with people who thought I shouldn’t be alone. I tried to find comfort in truth and shared what was fitting for the moment. They didn’t realize my pain and thought I was calm. But in my heart, I blamed myself for not feeling sad enough. I held back my grief, even though inside it shook me. I was annoyed that these feelings had such power over me, but I knew it was natural. So, I felt sad about feeling sad, and my sadness doubled.

When the body was taken away, we went and came back without tears. In the prayers we said to God, while offering thanks for her salvation, and when her body was placed beside the grave before burial, we didn’t cry.
