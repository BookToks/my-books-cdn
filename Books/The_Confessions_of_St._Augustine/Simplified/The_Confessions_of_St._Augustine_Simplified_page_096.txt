BOOK EIGHT Conversion to Christ. Augustine is really impressed by Simplicianus’ story about how the famous speaker and thinker, Marius Victorinus, became a Christian. Augustine wants to be like him, but he still feels trapped by his bad habits and worries about everyday life. Then, a court official named Ponticianus visits him and Alypius and tells them stories about how Anthony and two secret agents became Christians. These stories shake Augustine up a lot, and he feels torn inside. He almost decides to live a pure life, but something still holds him back. Then, by chance, he hears a child singing, which leads him to read the Bible. A passage from Paul helps him make up his mind, and he truly changes. Alypius also decides to follow Christ, and they both happily tell Monica the good news.

But my life in this world was still confusing, and my heart needed to be cleaned of old habits. I liked “The Way” — Jesus himself — but I wasn’t ready to fully follow him yet.

Then you put the idea in my mind to visit Simplicianus. He seemed like a true servant of yours, and your grace shone through him. I had heard he had been devoted to you since he was young. He was old now, and because of his long faith, he seemed very wise — and he was. From his experience, I wanted him to help me figure out the best way to live like I wanted.

2. I saw the Church was full of people going in different directions. Still, I wasn’t happy with the life I was living. My desires for honor and money didn’t excite me anymore, and it felt like a heavy burden to keep living that way. Compared to your sweetness and the beauty of your home — which I loved — those things no longer made me happy. But I was still tied down by my love for women. The apostle didn’t forbid marriage but encouraged something better, wishing everyone could live like he did.
