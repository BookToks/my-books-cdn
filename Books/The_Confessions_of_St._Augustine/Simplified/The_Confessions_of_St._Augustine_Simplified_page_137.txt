But where can I find you? If I find you but don’t remember you, then I won’t actually remember finding you. How could I find you if I don’t remember you at all?

The woman who lost her small coin and looked for it with a light wouldn’t have found it if she didn’t remember it. When she found it, how would she know it was the same coin if she didn’t remember it? I’ve lost and found many things, and I learned this: when I was looking for something and someone asked, “Is this it?” I said “No,” until I finally saw what I was actually looking for.

But if I didn’t remember the thing, even if it was shown to me, I still wouldn’t have found it because I wouldn’t recognize it. That’s how it is when we look for lost things. If something disappears from our sight but not from our memory, like a visible object, we keep an image of it inside us and keep searching until we see it again.

When we find it, we recognize it because of the image inside us. We don’t say we found something unless we recognize it, and we can’t recognize it unless we remember it. The lost thing stays in our memory while it’s out of sight.

But what if we forget something and try to remember it? Where do we search? In our memory itself. If something wrong comes up, we reject it until we find the right thing. When we do, we recognize it as what we were looking for. But we couldn’t do this unless we remembered it, even though we forgot it at first.

Maybe we didn’t forget everything. Part of the memory stays and helps us look for the missing part. Our memory knows it’s not working right and wants us to find what’s missing.

For example, if we see someone we know but forget their name, and think of other things, those things don’t help us remember because they aren’t connected to that person. We ignore them until we find the right clue. Where does the name come from? From our memory. Even if someone reminds us, it’s our memory that accepts it because it feels familiar. But if the name was completely erased, we wouldn’t remember it, even if someone told us. We haven’t totally forgotten something if we can remember that we forgot it. We can’t look for something we have completely forgotten.
