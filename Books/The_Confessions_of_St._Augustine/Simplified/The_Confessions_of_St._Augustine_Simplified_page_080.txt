BOOK SEVEN The change to Neoplatonism. Augustine starts to realize that the Manichean ideas about God and evil don’t make sense to him anymore. He begins to understand that God can’t be broken or changed. But he still thinks about things only in physical, material ways.

He stops believing in astrology and starts studying Neoplatonism. Then, he looks closely at the differences between Platonism and Christianity. He shares an amazing story about how he learned from Plotinus’ teachings and had a deep spiritual experience like Plotinus described.

Because of this, he begins to study the Bible carefully, especially the letters written by the apostle Paul. His journey is getting closer to the finish, as he starts to know Jesus Christ and feels a cautious faith pulling him toward Him.

CHAPTER I  
1. That bad and shameful time of my youth was over, and I was becoming a full-grown man. As I got older, I became more proud. I couldn’t imagine anything except the kind of things I could see with my own eyes. I didn’t think of God as a human body anymore. Since I started listening to philosophy, I avoided that mistake—and I was happy to find the truth about this in the faith of our spiritual mother, the Catholic Church. But I still didn’t know how else to picture God. And I, a man—and what kind of man!—tried to understand you, the one true God. Deep inside, I believed that you can’t be broken or changed because—even though I didn’t know how or why—I clearly saw that things that can rot or break are worse than things that last forever, and things that can’t be changed are better than things that change.

My heart fought hard against all fake ideas, and with this one clear truth, I tried to get rid of all the confusing thoughts buzzing in my mind. But as soon as I pushed them away, they came back and made my mind cloudy again. I didn’t think of God as a human body anymore, but I still felt like God had to be some kind of body in space, either inside the world or spread out beyond it. And this body was the one that couldn’t be broken or changed, which I thought was better than anything that could break or change. Because if something didn’t take up space, then to me it was nothing at all—not even an empty space. If you take a body out of space, or if space is empty of things like earth, water, air, or sky, space is still empty space—a kind of empty nothing.

2. Because I was still thinking in a very physical way and wasn’t even clear with myself, I thought that anything that didn’t have length, width, thickness, or solidity, or couldn’t have these things, was absolutely nothing. Back then, my mind only dealt with ideas that looked like the shapes I saw with my eyes. I couldn’t see that the act of thinking, which made those ideas, was itself not physical, and yet it had to be something real enough to create those ideas.
