So, like I was saying, sound comes before the tune. That doesn't mean sound can make a tune on its own. The sound isn’t the one who creates the tune; instead, the sound comes from the body and the soul of the singer organizes it to make a tune. The sound doesn’t happen before the tune in time either—they happen together. And sound isn’t better than a tune, because a tune is a beautiful kind of sound. But sound is first because the tune is made from the sound, not the other way around.

From this example, anyone who gets it can see that the basic stuff of everything came first and was called “heaven and earth” because the heaven and earth were made from it. This original formless stuff wasn’t made first in time, since form actually creates time. But now, in time, we understand it with its form. We can only talk about this formless stuff like it came first in time, even though it’s less important than things with form—because formed things are better than unformed ones. Also, it came after the Creator, who made something from nothing so that something else could be made.

CHAPTER XXX 41. In all these different opinions, may Truth bring us together, and may God help us use the law properly, since the law is all about pure love. If someone asks me what Moses really meant, I have to admit I don’t know for sure. But I do believe most of these ideas are true—except for the selfish ones I’ve already talked about. The people who have hope aren’t scared by these words in the Book, because it talks about big ideas in simple ways and repeats basic things in many different ways. Let all of us who want to speak the truth love each other and God, the source of Truth—especially if we aren’t chasing after pointless things but want the real Truth. Let’s also respect Moses, the writer of this Scripture, who was full of God’s Spirit, and believe that he meant to help us find truth and grow closer to God.

CHAPTER XXXI 42. So, when one person says, “Moses meant what I mean,” and another says, “No, he meant what I mean,” I think I’m being honest when I say, “Why couldn’t he have meant both if both are true?” And if there’s even a third or fourth truth, or someone finds a totally different meaning, why not believe Moses saw all those truths? God made the Scriptures so many different people can understand different things from them. Honestly, if I had to write about something this important, I would want my words to make sense to many people, not just one, even if it means some opinions are left out but aren’t really wrong. So, I don’t want to be stubborn and refuse to believe that Moses got at least this much from God.
