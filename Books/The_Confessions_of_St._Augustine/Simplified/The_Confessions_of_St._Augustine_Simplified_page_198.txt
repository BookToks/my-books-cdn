Even though we can’t see everything clearly, we still believe and live by faith. We are saved by hope, but if we already see what we hope for, then it’s not really hope. Deep feelings call out to even deeper feelings, like the sound of waterfalls.

The person who said, “I couldn’t talk to you like mature people, only like kids,” still says he hasn’t fully reached his goal. He forgets the past and looks forward to what’s ahead, pushing himself forward. He feels heavy inside and his soul is thirsty for God, like a thirsty deer panting for water. He asks, “When will I be with God?” and hopes to be fully ready for heaven.

He tells us not to just fit in with the world but to change by renewing our minds. He says don’t be childish in understanding, even if you act like kids sometimes, so you can become mature and wise. He asks, “Who tricked you, Galatians?” This isn’t just his voice but yours too, because God sent his Spirit from above through Jesus, who went up to heaven and opened the way for gifts that bring joy to God’s city.

The friend of the Bridegroom (Jesus) sighs for that city. He already has the first gifts of the Spirit but still waits and hopes for the full gift of being saved completely. He sighs to Jesus because he belongs to the Bride (the Church). He cares deeply and fears that, like the serpent tricked Eve, his mind might stray from the pure love we have in Jesus, God’s Son. What a beautiful moment it will be when “we see Jesus as he really is” and all the tears and sadness will be gone, even though they have been with him day and night, asking, “Where is your God?”

I also ask, “God, where are you? Where can I find you?” I feel alive for a moment when I praise and celebrate with joy. But still...
