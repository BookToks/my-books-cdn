If there was no order, then time couldn’t change. But even this “almost nothing,” since it wasn’t completely nothing, really came from the one who made everything that exists in any form.

They say they don’t deny this either.

Now, I want to talk a little more, with you, God, and with those who agree that everything your Truth has shown me is true. Let those who don’t believe say whatever they want and make as much noise as they like. I will try to quiet them and help your words reach their hearts.

But if they refuse and push me away, I ask you, God, not to be silent with me. Speak honestly in my heart; if you do, I will send those people away, making them feel ashamed.

As for me, I will go into my quiet place and sing songs of love to you, groaning in ways I can’t explain on my journey, thinking of Jerusalem with my heart lifted up to my true home—Jerusalem, my mother.

And I will think of you, the ruler of the source of Light, its Father, Protector, and Lover; its pure and strong joy, its steady happiness, and all its wonderful gifts—all at once, because you are the one true Good!

I won’t give up until you bring all of me back from confusion and brokenness to the peace of that dear mother, where the first fruits of my spirit are found, and from where all these promises come, which you make sure will last forever, God, my Mercy.

But for those who don’t say these true things are false, who still respect your Scripture given through holy Moses, and who agree that it is the highest authority for us to follow, yet still disagree with us in some ways, I say this: “God, be the judge between my beliefs and their opposition.”

They say, “Even if these things are true, Moses didn’t mean these two things when he said, ‘In the beginning God created heaven and earth.’ By ‘heaven’ he didn’t mean the spiritual or invisible world that always sees God. And by ‘earth’ he didn’t mean unformed matter.”

“What do those words mean then?” They answer, “Moses meant what we mean. He was talking about the whole visible world, in a simple and general way. Then, by listing the days, he could explain, one by one, the things the Holy Spirit wanted to reveal.

The people he spoke to were simple and focused on physical things, so he wisely decided to speak only about the works of God that they could see.”
