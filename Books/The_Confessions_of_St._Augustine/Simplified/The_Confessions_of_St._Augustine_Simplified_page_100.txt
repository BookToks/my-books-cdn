9. Go ahead, Lord, and take action: wake us up and bring us back to you; set our hearts on fire and pull us closer; excite us and make you feel sweet to us; let us love you now, let us run to you. Aren’t there many people who, even from a darker place than Victorinus, come back to you—who get close and are lit up by that light that gives them power from you to become your children? But if they aren’t famous, fewer people celebrate them. When many people celebrate together, everyone’s happiness grows because they share it and get excited from each other. Also, famous people inspire many others to be saved and lead the way so others follow. So even those who came before them are happy for them, because they don’t celebrate alone. 

But it should never be that in your house rich people are welcomed before poor people, or important people before others—because “you chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong; and you chose the lowly and despised things to ruin the powerful.” It was even “the least of the apostles” who said these words. When Paulus, the governor, had his pride beaten by the apostle’s words and accepted the easy rule of Christ, he became a servant of the great King. He wanted to be called Paul instead of Saul to show his big change. The enemy loses more control over someone he once fully held. But proud people are easier for the enemy to control because they care too much about their status, and the enemy uses their influence to control others too. So the more the world admired Victorinus’ heart (which the devil once held like a fortress) and his powerful words (which the devil used to hurt many), the more joyfully should God’s children celebrate because our King has defeated the enemy and took away his weapons from him, cleaned them, and made them useful for good work.

10. When Simplicianus, your man, told me Victorinus’ story, I wanted to be like him. That was why Simplicianus told me. But then he told how, when Emperor Julian ruled, he made a law stopping Christians from teaching subjects like literature and speaking skills. Victorinus obeyed and gave up his “school of words” instead of giving up your Word, which makes even the quiet speak well. He didn’t seem just brave to me, but happy, because he found a reason to spend all his time with you. That’s what I wanted to do, but I was still stuck in the strong chains of my own will. The enemy held my will tight like a chain. Wrong desires came from my stubborn will, and serving those desires became a habit, and habits that I didn’t fight became a must. These links made a chain that held me like a slave. But a new will started to grow in me to freely worship and enjoy you, God, my only true joy. Still, this new will couldn’t yet beat my old stubborn will, made strong by lots of bad habits. So I had two wills—the old, selfish one and the new, spiritual one.
