They were organized and shaped, but not because your joy needed them to be perfect. You are already perfect, and their imperfection is unpleasant to you.

So, they became perfect through you and pleasing to you—but not because you were imperfect before and needed them to make you perfect. Your good Spirit moved over the waters, not resting on them like they were holding him up. When your Spirit rests on someone, you actually make that person rest in you. Your unchanging and perfect will moved over the life you had created. This life is not the same as living happily because it still lives in its own darkness. But it needs to turn toward you, who made it, to live more like “the fountain of life,” and in your light “to see light,” to become perfect, enlightened, and blessed.

Now, see how the Trinity shows up to me as a mystery. You are the Trinity, God. The Father, at the start of our wisdom, created heaven and earth through your Son, who is equal and eternal with you. We have talked about the heaven above heavens, the invisible and unformed earth, and the dark abyss. These are all like a confused, twisted spiritual mess unless they turn to you, the source of life. By your light, that life becomes beautiful. This lower heaven was made between the waters. Now I recognize God the Father who made all things, and the Son, called “the Beginning,” through whom everything was made. Since I believed God is the Trinity, I looked deeper in your holy Word and saw, “Your Spirit moved over the waters.” So here is the Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the Creator of everything!

But why, O truthful Light, do I ask? I lift up my heart to you—don’t let me believe false ideas. Clear away the darkness and tell me, please, by that Love which is like our mother, why after talking about heaven, the invisible earth, and darkness over the deep, does your Scripture finally mention your Spirit? Was it because it made sense to show the Spirit first as “moving over” something? You couldn’t say this unless something was already there for the Spirit to move over. The Spirit didn’t move over the Father and Son, and it wouldn’t make sense to say the Spirit moved over nothing. So, what the Spirit was moving over had to be mentioned first.
