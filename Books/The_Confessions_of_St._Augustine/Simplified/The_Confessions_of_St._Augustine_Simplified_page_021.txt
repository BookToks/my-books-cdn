Look at how he gets himself worked up with desire, almost like it’s some kind of heavenly power, when he says: “Great Jove, who shakes the highest heavens with his thunder; shall I, a poor mortal man, not do the same?

I’ve done it, and I’m really happy about it.” These words aren’t easier to understand because they’re bad, but the badness is made worse by how boldly it’s shown. I don’t blame the words themselves—they are like valuable containers—but I’m sad about the wrong ideas that were given to us by teachers who were already confused. And if we didn’t believe them, we got punished without a chance to explain ourselves to someone fair. Still, God, I remember learning these things happily, and people said I was a promising boy.

Please be patient with me, God, while I talk about the talents you gave me and how I wasted them. I was given a lesson that shook me because it promised both praise and fear of punishment. I had to act out the words of Juno, who was angry and sad because she couldn’t stop Italy from being reached by the Trojan king. I knew Juno never actually said those words, but we had to follow these made-up stories and turn the poet’s verses into plain speech. The boy who showed the strongest anger and sadness while using the best words got the most applause. But what does that matter to me now, God, my true Life? Wasn’t all that just empty noise? Couldn’t I have used my mind and voice for something better? Your praise, Lord, your praises could have helped my heart grow strong through your Scriptures, instead of me being dragged away by these silly, useless things. There are many ways people worship evil spirits without realizing it.

It’s no surprise I got caught up in pride and drifted away from you, God, when people I looked up to were praised for telling stories about their bad behavior—things that weren’t even wrong by themselves—but felt ashamed if they made a small mistake in speaking. They could talk about their wild actions and get applauded, as long as they used fancy words. You see all this, Lord, and stay quiet—patient, full of mercy and truth as you are. But will you stay quiet forever?
