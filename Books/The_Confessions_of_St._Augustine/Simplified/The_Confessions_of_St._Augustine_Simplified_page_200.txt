Take away the fog that covers our eyes. In the Scriptures is the proof that gives wisdom, even to little kids. Oh God, help us praise you perfectly, even from the mouths of babies and toddlers. We don’t know any other books that can break down people’s pride and stop those who defend themselves from your forgiveness by making excuses for their sins. I don’t know, Lord, any other words so pure that make me want to confess and accept your guidance, inviting me to serve you just because I want to. Please help me understand these things, good Father. Give me this gift since you gave these teachings to everyone who follows them.

There are other waters above the sky, and I believe they are eternal and free from any earthly decay. Let those beings praise your name—your angels, who don’t need to look up at the sky or read your Word to know you. They always see your face and understand your eternal will without words or time. They read, choose, and love you forever. Their book never closes, and their scroll never folds because you are everything to them, forever. You placed them above the sky you made strong over the weaknesses of people below, so they could look up and learn about your mercy, which shows your love through time. “Your mercy, Lord, is in the heavens, and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.” Clouds disappear, but the heavens stay.

The preachers of your Word leave this life, but your Scripture spreads everywhere, even to the world’s end. Heaven and earth will pass away, but your words will never disappear. The scroll will roll up, and the grass beneath it will fade, but your Word lasts forever—your Word, which now we see only like shadows in the clouds and through a glass, not as it really is. Even if we are loved by your Son, we don’t yet know what we will be. He has seen us trapped in our flesh, speaks kindly to us, lights a fire in our hearts, and we follow after his scent. But “when he appears, we will be like him, because we will see him as he really is.” That time hasn’t come yet, Lord, but when it does, we will see him just as he is.

You are the only true reality. You alone fully know everything because you never change. You always know and want what is true and unchanging.
