Now I ask everyone if they would rather be happy because of the truth or because of a lie.

They wouldn’t hesitate to say “the truth,” just like they wouldn’t hesitate to say they want to be happy. A happy life means finding joy in the truth. This joy comes from you, God, who are the Truth and my light, the one who makes me well and strong. Everyone wants this happy life; it’s the only true happiness: joy in the truth is what everyone wants.

I have met many people who want to trick others, but I have never met anyone who wants to be tricked themselves. So where did they learn about this happy life except from knowing what the truth is? They love the truth too because they don’t want to be fooled. If they love happiness, which is joy in the truth, then they must also love the truth. But they wouldn’t love it if they didn’t remember something about it inside themselves.

So why don’t they enjoy it? Why aren’t they happy? It’s because they are too focused on other things that make them unhappy, and they forget about the truth. But there is still a little bit of light inside people. They should follow that light so the darkness won’t catch them.

Why does the truth make people angry, and why do those who teach the truth become enemies to people who also want to be happy? It’s because people love other things more than the truth. They don’t want to be fooled, so they don’t want to admit they were fooled before. That’s why they hate the truth when it shows them they were wrong. They love the truth when it feels good, but hate it when it makes them feel bad or shows their mistakes. They want to trick others but don’t want to be tricked themselves. The truth will punish them by showing who they really are, even if they don’t want to see it, but it won’t fully reveal itself to them.

This is how it is: the human mind is blind and sick, and it wants to hide, but it doesn’t want anything to be hidden from it. But actually, it is not the mind that hides from the truth, it’s the truth that hides from the mind. Still, even though the mind is weak and bad, it prefers to be happy because of the truth rather than a lie it knows is false. It will only be truly happy when it focuses on the one true Truth that makes everything else true.

Look at how much I have searched my memory to find you, Lord! But I haven’t found you anywhere else except in what I already remembered from the time I first learned about you. Wherever I found the Truth, I found my God, who is the Truth. Since I learned about you, I have never forgotten. You have stayed in my memory, and I find you there whenever I think of you and feel joy. These are the special joys you have given me because you are kind and remember how weak I am.
