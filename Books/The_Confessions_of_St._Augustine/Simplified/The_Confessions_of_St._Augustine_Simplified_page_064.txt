My heart didn’t like those people, but not completely; I guess I hated them more because they would hurt me than because of what they actually did. Still, those people are really bad; they do wrong against you because they love temporary and fake things, and they chase dirty money that stains their hands. They care about the short-lived world and ignore you, even though you stay with us and invite us to come back to you. You forgive the human soul when it finally returns to you.

Now, I hate those twisted and wrong people, but I also love them if they can change and start to value learning more than money, and most of all, if they choose you, God, the truth and the real good, and our pure peace. But back then, I wanted to avoid getting hurt by them more than I wanted them to become good for your sake.

When the leaders of Milan asked Rome to send a teacher of rhetoric for their city, I applied for the job through those same people, even though I wanted to leave the Manichean nonsense I was involved in—though neither they nor I knew that at the time. They recommended that Symmachus, the prefect, should hire me after hearing me.

So I went to Milan, to Ambrose the bishop, who was famous everywhere as a good man and your devoted servant. His powerful speeches gave your people the best of your teachings, the joy of your help, and a strong but clear feeling of your presence. You brought me to him without me knowing so that he could lead me to you with full understanding. That man of God welcomed me like a father and was glad I came, as a good bishop should be.

I began to like him, but at first not as a teacher of truth because I had lost hope of finding that in your Church—I liked him as a friendly person. I listened carefully to him, but for the wrong reasons—I was checking if his speaking skills were as good as people said, and if he was better or worse than others. So I paid close attention to his words, but I didn’t care about what he was really saying. I liked how he spoke—it was smarter but less fun and soft than Faustus’ style. But what he taught was totally different, because Faustus was full of Manichean lies, while Ambrose was teaching real salvation.

But “salvation is far from the wicked,” and I was wicked when I first stood before him. Still, I was slowly and unknowingly coming closer to it.

Even though I didn’t try to really understand what he said, I only cared about how he said it.
