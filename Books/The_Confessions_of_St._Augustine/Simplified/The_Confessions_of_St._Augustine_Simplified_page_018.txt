When it comes to taking care of our bodies, no one says, "Leave him alone; let his wounds get worse because he’s not healed yet!" So, it would have been much better if I had been healed right away. Then, with the careful help of my friends and myself, my soul’s health could have stayed safe with you, the one who gave it to me in the first place.

That would have been the best thing. But as I grew older, many strong temptations felt like waves crashing down on me. My mother saw this coming and thought it was better to risk me when I was still like soft clay, not yet shaped into the image of Christ.

When I was a child—which I feared less than my teenage years—I didn’t like learning and hated being forced to do it. But I was forced anyway, and it helped me, even if I didn’t do well because I didn’t want to learn. No one does well when they don’t want to, even if what they do is good. The people who made me study didn’t do well either, because they only wanted me to satisfy selfish desires for money and fame. But you, God, who know everything about us, used their mistakes to help me. My own refusal to learn was a punishment from you, and I deserved it because I was a sinner even as a small boy. So, through those who didn’t do well, you did good for me; and through my own sin, you punished me fairly. Every wrong desire brings its own punishment, just as you decided.

But why did I dislike Greek literature so much, which I studied since I was a kid? Even now, I don’t fully get it. I loved Latin a lot—not just the basics, but what the teachers explained.

The first lessons in reading, writing, and math felt just as hard and annoying as Greek. Why was that? Maybe because of the sin and emptiness of life. I was just “flesh, like the wind that blows and never comes back.” Those first lessons were better because they were clearer, and I still have the ability to read and write because of them. But in other subjects, I had to learn about the travels of a guy named Aeneas, while I ignored my own troubles, and feel sad for Dido, who killed herself because of love. Meanwhile, I didn’t cry at all for myself, who was dying inside for not loving you, God.

What’s worse than someone who feels no pity for themselves, who cries for Dido’s death because of love but sheds no tears for their own death by not loving you, God? You are the light of my heart and the food for my soul, the power that connects my mind with my deepest thoughts. I didn’t love you, and by that, I was unfaithful to you.
