He said it—and this empty worry stayed with me as long as I was hopeless about finding a clear way from people to God. Along with the powerful words I admired, I also thought about ideas I had ignored before, but I couldn’t separate them. While I opened my heart to admit how well he spoke, I also slowly realized how true his words were. At first, his ideas started to seem reasonable to me. I used to think nothing could defend the Catholic faith against the Manicheans, but now I saw it could be defended without being arrogant.  

This became especially clear after I heard some parts of the Old Testament explained in a symbolic way. Before, when I took those parts literally, they had made me spiritually sad and confused. But when these parts were explained differently, I blamed myself for being so hopeless and thinking that no answers could be given to people who hated and made fun of the Law and the Prophets. Still, I didn’t think this was enough reason to follow the Catholic religion just because it had good defenders who could answer objections clearly. I also didn’t think that what I had believed before should be rejected, because both sides seemed equally believable. That way of thinking didn’t seem defeated, but it also wasn’t clearly better.  

But now I seriously tried to find any way to prove the Manicheans were wrong. If I could have believed in a spiritual substance, all their arguments would have fallen apart in my mind. But I couldn’t believe in that. Still, when I thought about the physical world and nature more carefully, I decided that most philosophers had the better ideas. So, using a method where I doubted everything and kept switching between ideas, I decided to leave the Manicheans. I thought I couldn’t stay in a group that some philosophers agreed with. But I also refused to trust the philosophers to heal my troubled soul because they didn’t have the saving name of Christ. So, I decided to become a learner in the Catholic Church, which my parents had strongly encouraged, until something certain appeared to guide me.
