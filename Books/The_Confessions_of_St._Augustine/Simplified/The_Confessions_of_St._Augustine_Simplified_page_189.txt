The word “beginning” can mean different things to different people. One person thinks it just means the start of everything being made. He reads it like this: “In the beginning, God made…” as if saying, “At the very first moment, God created…”

Some people who explain “In the beginning” as God making the heaven and earth think the phrase “heaven and earth” means the stuff that God used to make them. But others believe the heaven and earth were already there, just separate things. Some see “heaven” as a spiritual thing that’s already formed, and “earth” as physical stuff that’s not yet formed.

Even those who think “heaven and earth” means the unformed stuff don’t all agree. One person thinks it’s the source of both things we can see and things we can only understand with our minds. Another thinks it’s only the stuff that makes the physical world, which holds everything we can see.

People also disagree about whether “heaven and earth” means things that are already made and arranged. Some say it means both invisible and visible things. Others say it only means the visible things, like the bright sky and the dark land, and everything in them.

If someone thinks “In the beginning he made” means “At first he made,” then “heaven and earth” refers just to the matter—the basic stuff—that makes up both the spiritual and physical universe. If he tried to say it meant the universe already made, then people might ask, “If God made that first, what did He make after?” But there’s nothing after the universe.

This would make us wonder, “How can this be the first if there’s nothing else after it?” But if he says God made matter first without form, and then later shaped it, it’s not silly. He can understand what comes before forever and what comes after in time; what comes from choice, and what comes from the source.

God exists forever, before anything else. In time, the flower comes before the fruit. When choosing, the fruit comes before the flower. When something starts, sound comes before the tune.

Of these ideas, the first and last are harder to understand. The middle two are easier. It’s a deep thing to think about, Lord, how you exist forever and create things that change, always being before them.

Who can easily understand how sound comes before a tune? A tune is made of sounds put together. A sound that isn’t formed can exist, but something that doesn’t exist can’t be made.

In the same way, matter comes before what’s made from it. Matter isn’t first because it makes the thing; matter was made too. Its being first isn’t about time.

When we talk or sing, we don’t first make random sounds and then shape them into a song, like making a chest from wood. Wood comes first in time, then the chest.

But a song is different. When it’s sung, the sound is heard at the same time. There isn’t first a random sound that later becomes a song. Once the sound is made, it’s gone, and you can’t grab it or shape it.

So, the song is part of its own sound, and the “sound” is like the “matter” of the song. The sound is shaped to become a tune.
