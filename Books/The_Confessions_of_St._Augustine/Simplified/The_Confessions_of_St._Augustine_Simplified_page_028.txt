Why would someone enjoy killing just for the fun of it? Who would believe that?

Even for Catiline, a cruel and violent man, people say he had a reason for what he did. He said he acted so his hands and heart wouldn’t get lazy. But why? Because if he took over the city by doing bad things, he could get power, money, and respect. That way, he wouldn’t have to worry about the law or money for his family, or feel bad about what he did. So, even Catiline didn’t love being evil itself; he wanted something else, and that was why he did those bad things.

Chapter 6

What was it about my theft, when I was just sixteen, that I loved so much? Stealing wasn’t pretty or good. Were those pears we stole nice? Yes, they looked good because they were made by God, who is the most beautiful and good of all. But I didn’t want the pears because they were tasty—I already had better ones. I stole them just to steal, and then I threw them away. The only thing I enjoyed was the sin itself, the fact that I was doing something wrong. Even if I ate the pears, the only thing that tasted good was the sin.

Curiosity makes us want to learn, but only God knows everything perfectly. Sometimes, being dumb or foolish pretends to be simple or innocent, but no one is truly simple or innocent like God. So, when sinners do bad things, they only hurt themselves.

Lazy people say they want rest, but real rest can only be found in God. Luxury tries to look like having plenty, but God is the true source of endless joy. Wastefulness tries to seem generous, but God gives the best gifts to everyone. Greedy people want a lot, but God already owns everything. Envy says it wants to be the best, but no one is better than God. Anger wants to get even, but no one is fairer than God. Fear shies away from the unknown and sudden changes, but...
