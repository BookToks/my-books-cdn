I hadn’t seen or been there for many things in history, or for the stories about places and cities I hadn’t visited. I also hadn’t experienced everything my friends or doctors had. If I didn’t believe anything, I wouldn’t do anything in life. I was sure of one thing: that two people were my parents, even though I only knew this because others told me. Thinking about this, you helped me see that it wasn’t the people who believed your books—books that almost everyone accepted—but those who didn’t believe them who were wrong. Also, I ignored people who asked, “How do you know these Scriptures really come from the one true God?” That was the most important thing to believe, because no matter what confusing or disrespectful questions I read from philosophers, I never stopped believing that you exist—even if I didn’t understand exactly who or what you are—and that you control what happens to people.

I believed this sometimes more strongly, sometimes less. But I always believed that you exist and care about us, even though I didn’t know what you were made of or how to find you. Since we aren’t strong enough on our own to find the truth, and since we need the Holy Scriptures to guide us, I started to believe that you wouldn’t have given such great authority to the Scriptures everywhere if they didn’t help us believe in you and seek you. Some parts of the Scriptures used to confuse or upset me, but after hearing them explained, I saw that their meaning was deeper and spiritual. The Scriptures seemed even more worthy of belief because, while anyone could read them easily, their full wisdom was hidden inside. They used simple language to reach everyone, but also needed serious attention to understand their deeper meaning. This way, many people could be drawn to them, and some could be led closer to you through their difficult parts. I kept thinking about all this, and you were with me. When I sighed, you heard me. When I wavered, you guided me.

I traveled the wide path of the world, and you never left me.

I still wanted fame, money, and marriage, and you made fun of me. Chasing after these things, I went through tough times, and you were even kinder by not letting anything else feel good to me. Look into my heart, Lord, because you make me remember all this and confess it to you. Now let my soul stick to you.
