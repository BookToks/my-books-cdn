She won’t say she owes nothing, because that would mean she was tricked by a clever liar. Instead, she will say her sins are forgiven by the one who can’t be paid back—the one who didn’t owe us anything but gave everything for us all.

So, let her rest peacefully with her husband. She was married only to him before and after, and she obeyed him patiently, doing good things to bring you more people, hoping to help him too. And please, my Lord, inspire your servants, my brothers, your sons and my leaders, who I serve with my voice, heart, and writing. Let those who read these words remember Monica, your servant, along with Patricius, her husband. Through their bodies, you brought me to life in a way I don’t fully understand.

May they lovingly remember my parents in this short life, remember my brothers under you, our Father, and remember my fellow citizens in the eternal Jerusalem. Your people long for that place from the moment they are born until they return to you. Let what my mother wanted for me happen, especially through the many prayers gained for her by these confessions, more than by my prayers alone.
