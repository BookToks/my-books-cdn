BOOK NINE  
This is the last part of Augustine’s life story. He talks about quitting his teaching job and spending time at Cassiciacum getting ready to be baptized. He gets baptized with Adeodatus and Alypius. Soon after, they start heading back to Africa. Augustine remembers the happy time he shared with his mom in Ostia, then tells about her death, burial, and how sad he was. The book ends with a heartfelt prayer for the souls of Monica, Patricius, and all his fellow citizens in heaven.

CHAPTER I  
1. “O Lord, I am your servant; I am your servant and the son of your handmaid.  

You have freed me. I will thank you. Let my heart and my words praise you, and let my whole body say, ‘Lord, who is like you?’ Let them say this, and you answer me and say to my soul, ‘I am your salvation.’ Who am I, and what am I? What bad things aren’t in me and what I do? Or, if not in my actions, then in my words? Or, if not in my words, then in my will? But you, Lord, are good and kind. Your hand reached down into my deepest darkness and took out all the bad stuff from my heart. Because of this, I stopped wanting to do what I used to want, and I started wanting to do what you want.  

But where was my free will all those years, and how was it suddenly called out in a moment so I could accept your “easy yoke” and “light burden,” O Christ Jesus, “my Strength and my Redeemer”? How sweet it suddenly became to me to live without the little things I used to enjoy! And it was now a joy to give up what I was once afraid to lose.  

You threw those things away for me, O true and highest Sweetness. You threw them away and took their place—sweeter than any pleasure, though not for the body; brighter than any light, but hidden like a mystery; more honorable than any fame, but not for those proud of themselves. Now my soul was free from the painful worries of chasing and grabbing, from sinking in dirt, and from scratching the itch of lust. And I talked like a child to you, O Lord my God—my light, my treasure, and my salvation.

CHAPTER II  
2. And it seemed right to me, in your sight, not to stop speaking all at once, but to slow down quietly, so that young people who didn’t care about your law or peace, but only about lies and arguments, wouldn’t use my words as weapons for their anger.  

Luckily, there were only a few days left before the “vintage vacation,” an imperial holiday from late August to mid-October. I decided to get through those days so I could quit properly and, now owned by you, not be for sale again.  

You knew my plan, but only my close friends did; others didn’t. We agreed to keep it private. Even though, as we moved up from the “valley of tears” and sang “the song of steps,” you gave us sharp arrows and burning coals to stop that lying tongue.
