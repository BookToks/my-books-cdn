I couldn’t ask him what I wanted exactly when I wanted because he was always surrounded by busy people who needed his help. And when he wasn’t helping others—which didn’t happen often—he was either eating to refresh his body or reading to refresh his mind.

When he read, his eyes moved over the pages while his heart tried to understand the meaning, but he didn’t say anything out loud. Often, when we visited him—anyone could come into his room without telling him—we would find him quietly reading alone. After sitting silently for a long time—we didn’t want to interrupt someone so focused—we would leave, knowing he didn’t want distractions during the little free time he had to study without dealing with other people’s problems. Maybe he was worried that if the author was unclear, someone might ask him to explain or discuss difficult ideas, which would slow him down. Another real reason might have been to protect his voice because it got tired easily. Whatever the reason, it was probably a good one for a man like him.

But I couldn’t find a chance to ask him the deep questions I wanted unless they could be answered quickly. I needed his full attention to tell him everything on my mind, but he was never free like that. I did listen to him every Sunday as he taught the Bible to the people.

This made me even more sure that all the lies and tricks people used against the holy books could be proved wrong.

I soon realized that when people said humans were made in God’s image, many didn’t really understand it. Some thought God had a human shape, but I didn’t even know what a spiritual being was like. I felt happy but also embarrassed that for so many years I had fought not against the true Catholic faith but against wrong ideas made up by people. I had been disrespectful and careless by judging something without trying to understand it first. God, who is highest and closest, is not made of parts like a body, but is everywhere and nowhere at once, without a physical shape. He made humans in His image, and yet we live in space with heads and feet.

Since I didn’t understand how this image of God could exist, I should have asked questions and shared my doubts instead of arguing against it like it was something people actually believed without thinking.

Because of this, I felt more and more anxious about what I could truly believe, and I was ashamed that I had acted that way for so long.
