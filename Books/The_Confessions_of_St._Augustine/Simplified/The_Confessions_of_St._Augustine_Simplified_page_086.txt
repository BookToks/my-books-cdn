How could I even explain to my closest friends what I was feeling inside? My heart was so full and confused that no amount of time or talking could help me share it with them.

But all of it went straight to you because I shouted out from my aching heart. I wanted you more than anything, but the light in my eyes wasn’t with me; it was inside, while I was outside. That light wasn’t anywhere I could find; I kept thinking about things that exist in places, but I couldn’t find a place where I could feel calm. The world didn’t accept me enough for me to say, “This is enough; I’m okay.” They didn’t let me go back to where I might feel better. I was above those things, but still below you. You are my true happiness if I rely on you, and you put everything below me that you created. The right way for me to be saved was to stay like your image and serve you, having control over my body. But when I got proud and acted against you, even the low things became more important than me and weighed me down so much I couldn’t catch my breath.

These things crowded my vision from every side, and when I tried to think, they blocked my way back to you like they were saying, “Where do you think you’re going, unworthy and dirty?” All of this came from my wound because you had humbled me like someone who is hurt. My pride made me separate from you, and my swollen pride blinded my eyes.

But you, Lord, always stay the same. You don’t stay angry forever because you feel sorry for us, like dust and ashes. You wanted to fix what was wrong with me, and you disturbed me inside with pain so I was restless until I could clearly see you inside my heart. By your secret healing, my pride was calmed, and my confused and dark mind slowly got better day by day through the sharp but healing pain of good sadness.

At first, wanting to show me how you “resist the proud but give grace to the humble,” and how kindly you revealed the way to be humble by becoming human yourself, you helped me get certain books written by proud philosophers called Platonists. These books were translated from Greek into Latin. In them, even if they didn’t say it in the same words, I found the same idea: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.”
