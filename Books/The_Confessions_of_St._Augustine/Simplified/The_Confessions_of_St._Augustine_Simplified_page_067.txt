CHAPTER II

My mother used to bring porridge, bread, and wine to small chapels built to remember the saints, just like she did back in Africa. But one day, the doorkeeper stopped her from doing this. When she found out that the bishop was the one who said no, she accepted it quietly and obeyed without arguing. I was surprised at how easily she gave up her old habits instead of questioning the bishop.

She didn’t drink much wine and wasn’t addicted to it like some people are. She only drank a little bit, diluted with water to make it mild, and shared it with others to help them feel closer to the saints, not to enjoy the taste. Even when she visited many chapels, she carried the same small cup with her, and by the time she got around, the wine was watered down and warm.

But when she learned that the bishop, who was very respected and holy, forbade even this small custom because it might encourage gluttony or seem like pagan superstition, she stopped doing it right away. Instead of bringing food, she started bringing prayers and gave more to the poor. She wanted to honor the martyrs properly, as they had sacrificed their lives for their faith.

I think she only obeyed so easily because she loved the bishop Ambrose and trusted him. He loved her too because she was faithful and active in the church. He often praised her to me, saying I was lucky to have such a mother—though he didn’t know I was still doubtful about these things and unsure if this was the right way to live.

CHAPTER III

At that time, I hadn’t yet asked God for help in my prayers. I was more focused on learning and arguing about ideas. I thought Ambrose was lucky because important people respected him. The only thing I saw as hard was his choice to stay single.

I didn’t understand the hope he had, the struggles he faced, or the comfort he found in his faith. I couldn’t imagine or feel the joy he got from his secret spiritual life.

And Ambrose didn’t know how lost or troubled I was inside.
