At the same time, the slave was still stuck in his hard life and kept serving his masters, as Firminus, who knew him, could tell.

When I heard and believed what such a trustworthy person said, all my doubts disappeared. First, I tried to help Firminus stop believing in superstitions by telling him that if I really could predict the future by looking at his horoscope, I should have seen that his parents were important people, from a noble family, with a good background and education. But if that servant had asked me about his horoscope, since it was the same one, I would have to say the opposite—that he came from a low background and a hard life. So, if I gave two opposite predictions from the same horoscope, either I was lucky sometimes or just guessing. That meant horoscopes don’t really work by skill but just by chance.

With this new understanding, I thought more about what this meant. What if someone said Firminus lied to me or his father did? Then I thought about twins, who are born very close together in time—so close that it’s almost impossible to tell who was born first by looking at the stars. But if horoscopes were true, the same horoscope would have to predict the same future for both twins, Esau and Jacob. But their lives turned out very different. So horoscopes must be wrong. If they were right sometimes, it was just luck, not skill.

You, Lord, the fair ruler of everything, work in secret ways—whether people asking or being asked understand it or not—so that each person hears what they are meant to hear based on their soul’s true worth. So no one should question you with “Why this?” or “Why that?” because they are only human.

By now, you, my Helper, had freed me from those chains. But I still asked, “Where does evil come from?” and found no answer. Yet you didn’t let me lose my faith because of my confusing thoughts. I still believed you exist, that you never change, that you care for everyone and will judge all people. I believed that through Christ, your Son, and the Holy Scriptures, which the Catholic Church taught me, you have planned a way for people to be saved and live after death.

With these strong beliefs in my heart, I kept asking, “Where does evil come from?” My heart hurt so much because of these questions!

Oh God, how I sighed! But even then you listened, though I didn’t know it. When I quietly prayed and searched inside, my soul’s silent pain was like a loud cry to your mercy. No one else knew what I was going through, but you did.
