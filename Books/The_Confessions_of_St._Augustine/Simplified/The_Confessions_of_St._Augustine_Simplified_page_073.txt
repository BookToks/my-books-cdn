There was a kind of self-control that didn’t make sense and tricked people who weren’t ready to be truly good. They got fooled by a fake version of being virtuous.

  
CHAPTER VIII  
13. He had gone ahead of me to Rome to study law because his parents kept pushing him to do something practical. But once there, he got caught up in a crazy obsession with gladiator fights. Even though he hated those violent shows, one day he ran into some friends who had just finished dinner. They forced him, even though he strongly said no, to go with them to the arena on a day when those brutal fights were happening.  

He told them, “You can drag me there, but you can’t make me watch or care about it. I’ll be there but not really paying attention.” They were curious if he could really do it, so they took him in. When they got to their seats, the whole place went wild with excitement. Alypius kept his eyes closed and tried not to think about what was happening. He wished he had covered his ears too!  

But then, when one fighter fell, the loud cheer from the crowd made him curious. Thinking he could still stay strong and not be affected, he opened his eyes. That moment hurt him inside more than the fighter’s injuries outside. He was more hurt than the man who fell, because the noise got in through his ears and made him look, which let the violence hurt his soul.  

At first, he thought he was stronger than the crowd, but instead, seeing the blood made him feel angry and wild. He didn’t look away but stared at the fight, unknowingly enjoying the madness and bloodlust. He wasn’t the same person who came in; he became like the crowd that had dragged him there.  

Why say more? He watched, shouted, got excited, and left with a craving to come back again. Not just with the friends who brought him but even on his own, pulling others in too. But from all this, with a strong and kind hand, God saved him and taught him not to trust himself but to trust Him — though it took a long time.

  
CHAPTER IX  
14. All these things were stored in his memory to help him later.

Another time, while he was still learning with me in Carthage, he was thinking about his lessons at noon in the market. You know how students practice by reciting out loud? God allowed him to be arrested by the police there as a thief. I believe God did this so that this future great man would learn that when people make decisions, they shouldn’t believe everything they hear without checking carefully.

As he waited alone near the judge with his writing tablets and pen, a real thief — another student — secretly came up and started cutting into the metal bars protecting a silversmith’s shop without Alypius noticing.
