When I first heard about it, I couldn’t really understand it either—I imagined it had all kinds of different shapes. So, I wasn’t thinking about it the right way. My mind, when it was upset, would picture all sorts of ugly and scary “shapes,” but they were still “shapes.” I still called it formless, not because it had no shape, but because it had a kind of shape that my mind didn’t want to accept, because it seemed weird and confusing. Even what I thought had no shape wasn’t really without any shape, but just less perfect compared to nicer shapes. So, I figured I had to get rid of all ideas of shape if I wanted to think about something truly shapeless—but I couldn’t do that. It was easier for me to imagine that something without any shape didn’t exist at all than to imagine something that was neither shaped nor nothing—something unshaped but almost nothing.

So, my mind stopped questioning my spirit—it was filled with images of shaped bodies, changing and mixing them as it wanted. I then focused on the bodies themselves and looked closely at how they change, how they stop being what they were and start being something new. I thought this change from one shape to another involved something like a shapeless state, but not total nothingness. But I wanted to know for sure, not just guess. If I told you all the tricky parts you helped me understand about this, most readers wouldn’t want to hear it all. Still, my heart won’t stop honoring you or singing your praise about things I can’t fully explain. The fact that things can change means they can become any shape they want. But what is this ability to change? Is it a soul? A body? The outside of a soul or body? Could we say, “Nothing was something,” and “What exists now did not exist before”? If that could happen, I’d say that’s what it was, and it had to be like this to get these visible and mixed-up shapes.

Where did this come from, if not from you, from whom everything that exists comes? But the farther something is from you, the less it’s like you—and this isn’t about distance or place.

So, you, Lord, who are not one thing here and another thing somewhere else but always the same—“Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty”—in the beginning, through your Wisdom, which comes from you and is part of you, you made something out of nothing. You made the heaven and the earth—not from yourself, because then they would be equal to your only Son and to you. And it wouldn’t make sense for anything to be equal to you.
