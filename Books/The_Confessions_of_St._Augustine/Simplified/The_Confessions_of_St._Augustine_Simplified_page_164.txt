Have you ever thought about time—like the past, present, and future? Some people say only the present is real because the past is gone and the future hasn’t happened yet. But maybe the past and future also exist in some way. When the future becomes the present, it comes from somewhere hidden. And when the present becomes the past, it goes back to that hidden place. Think about people who say they can predict the future. Where do they see these things if they don’t exist yet? And when people talk about the past, they remember it in their minds. If those things didn’t exist, they couldn’t be seen or remembered. So, the past and present do exist.

Let me keep thinking about this. If the past and future exist, where are they? Even if I don’t know exactly, I do know that wherever they are, they aren’t really past or future—they’re actually present. That’s because the future is “not yet,” and the past is “no longer.” So, whenever and wherever they exist, they only exist as present.

When we talk about the past, we don’t see the actual events again. Instead, we remember them like pictures in our mind. For example, my childhood is in the past and doesn’t exist now, but I can still remember it and think about it in the present. I don’t know exactly how people can predict the future, but I do know that when we plan what we’re going to do, that planning happens now—in the present—even though the action itself is still in the future. When we start doing the action, then it moves from future to present.

No matter how people predict the future, they can only see what actually exists now. Future events don’t exist yet, so people don’t see the events themselves. Instead, they might see signs or causes that already exist, which help them guess what will happen.

So, when people see these signs or causes, those things are in the present. From those, they imagine or predict future events. These ideas about the future happen now, in the present, inside their minds.

Here’s an example: I see the sky starting to get light at dawn. I predict the sun is about to rise. What I see—the dawn—is happening now, in the present. The sun already exists, but its rising is still in the future because it hasn’t happened yet. I can’t predict the sun rising unless I have a picture of it in my mind. The dawn and the idea of the sun rising both happen in the present, so I can guess what’s coming next.

Future events aren’t here yet. Since they’re not here, they don’t exist now. And if they don’t exist, we can’t actually see them. But we can still predict them.
