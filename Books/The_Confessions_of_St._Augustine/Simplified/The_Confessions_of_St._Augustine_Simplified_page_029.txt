Things you love can be threatened, and you worry about your own safety; but what could happen that’s totally new or sudden to you? Or who can take away what you love?

Where is there real, unshakable safety except with you? People feel sad about losing things they wanted because they don’t want to lose anything, just like nothing can be taken from you.

14. So the soul cheats when it turns away from you and looks for things apart from you that aren’t pure or clean until it comes back to you. Everything tries to be like you—but in a messed-up way—when they separate from you and go against you. But even then, they admit you made everything and know they can’t fully separate from you. What was it that I loved in that stealing? How was I copying my Lord, even in a wrong way? Did I want to rebel against your rules, even though I couldn’t really?

Who is so proud that they think their goodness is from themselves, and so love you less, thinking they don’t need your mercy that forgives everyone who comes back to you? And to anyone who heard you and obeyed and avoided the things I’m confessing here, don’t look down on me—I was sick, but I was healed by the same Doctor who helped you not get sick, or be less sick than me. So love him just as much—or even more—because you see me fixed from big sin by the same Savior who keeps you from falling.

CHAPTER VIII  
16. What good came from those shameful things I did—especially that stealing, which I loved only because it was stealing? And since the stealing itself was nothing, I was even more miserable for loving it. But I couldn’t have done it all by myself—I still remember how I felt then—I couldn’t have done it alone. I loved it because of the...
