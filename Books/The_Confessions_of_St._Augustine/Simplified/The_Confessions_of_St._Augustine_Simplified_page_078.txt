There was a girl who was still about two years too young to get married. Because I liked her, I agreed to wait for her.

Many of my friends, fed up with the crazy problems of life, talked about living a peaceful life away from all the chaos. We thought we could do this by pooling everything we owned into one shared home, so nothing really belonged to just one person. We planned that everyone would share one money pot, and everything would belong to all of us. We wanted about ten people in this group, some of whom were very rich—especially Romanianus, a close friend from my hometown. He had important court experience and was the most serious about the idea. His opinion mattered a lot because he had way more land and money than the rest of us. We also decided that every year, two people would manage things and provide what was needed, while the others could relax.

But when we thought about whether our wives would allow this—since some of us already had wives and others hoped to get some—the whole plan, which was really good, fell apart. We gave up on it completely. So, we went back to feeling frustrated and followed the usual paths of life. We had many thoughts in our hearts, but “Your plan lasts forever.” You laughed at our plan and made your own instead, planning “to give us food at the right time, to open your hand, and to fill us with blessings.”

Meanwhile, my mistakes kept piling up. My mistress was taken away from me because she was blocking my chance to marry. My heart, which loved her, was broken and hurting badly. She went back to Africa, promising never to be with another man, leaving me with my natural son by her. But I, sad and weak, couldn’t wait the two years before I could marry the girl I wanted. Since I wasn’t really looking for a wife but was a slave to my desires, I got another mistress—not a wife though. I kept feeding my bad habit, letting my soul’s sickness grow stronger until it could lead me into marriage.

The pain from losing my first mistress didn’t go away; it just stopped burning and started to fester, which was worse because it didn’t hurt as much.

Praise to you; glory to you, O Source of mercy. I became more miserable, but you came closer. Your right hand was always ready to pull me out of the mud and clean me, but I didn’t realize it. Nothing stopped me from sinking deeper into selfish pleasures except fear.
