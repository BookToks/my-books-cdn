People also fit in here, and even more so when they become different from you—but they get along better with higher things when they become more like you. I asked what evil was, and I learned that it isn’t a real thing, but a wrong choice of the will turning away from you, God, the highest reality, toward lower things. It throws away its deepest treasure and fills itself with shallow, outside things.

I was amazed that I now loved you, and not just an illusion of you, but I wasn’t strong enough to always enjoy being close to you. Sometimes your beauty pulled me toward you, but then I was pulled away by my own weight, sinking sadly into lower things. This weight was bad habits of the body. But I remembered you, and I never doubted that there was someone I could hold on to; I just wasn’t ready to hold on tightly yet. Because the body, which can be corrupted, drags the soul down, and the earthly home weighs down the mind, which thinks about many things.

The thing I was most sure about was that “the invisible qualities of God have been seen clearly since the world was made, understood through what was made, like God’s eternal power and divine nature.” When I wondered how I could see the beauty in things in the sky and on earth, and how I knew what was right or wrong about changing things, I realized that I had found something true and unchanging above my changing mind.

Step by step, I was led from looking at bodies to the soul that understands them through the senses. From there, I moved to the soul’s inner part, which senses report to—and even animals have this—and then higher to reason, which judges what the senses experience. When my reason saw that it could change too, it reached up to its own higher mind, pulling away from confusing thoughts to look for the light it lived in. Without any doubt, it shouted that the unchanging is better than the changing.

Because of this, the mind somehow knew the unchanging, since it wouldn’t prefer it otherwise. So, with a quick, shaky glimpse, it reached what truly is. And I saw your invisibility understood through the things that are made.
