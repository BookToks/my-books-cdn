His kind, his height—how tall he is—and his family, his status, when he was born, whether he is sitting or standing, wearing shoes or carrying weapons, or doing something or having something done to him—and all the many things that fit into these nine groups (of which I gave some examples) or under the main group called substance.

What did all this help me with, since it actually stopped me when I thought that everything that exists fit into those ten groups? I tried to understand them, O my God, so that even your amazing and unchanging oneness could be seen as having size or beauty, as if these things existed in you like they do in bodies—where you have size and beauty. But you are your own size and beauty. A body is not big or beautiful just because it is a body, since even if it were smaller or less beautiful, it would still be a body. But my idea of you was wrong, not true. It was a creation of my own sadness, not the firm truth of your happiness. For you had said, and it happened to me, that the earth would grow briars and thorns for me, and that I would have to work hard to get my food.

And what good was it that I could read and understand all the books I could find about the “liberal arts,” when I was really a worthless slave to bad desires? I enjoyed them, not knowing the real source of what was true and sure in them. I had my back to the light, and my face toward the things the light shines on, so my face, which looked at the lit things, was not lit itself. Whatever was written in fields like speech, logic, math, music, or numbers, I could understand easily without someone teaching me. You know this, O Lord my God, because quick thinking and sharp insight come from you. But I never thanked you for these gifts. So, my abilities did me no good but actually hurt me, because I tried to control so much of myself. I didn’t save my strength for you, but went far away from you to waste my gifts on wrong desires. And what good were these abilities if I didn’t use them well? I didn’t realize these arts were hard to understand, even for smart people, until I tried to explain them and saw that even the best learners followed me slowly.

And yet what did this help me, since I still thought you, O Lord God, the Truth, were a bright and huge body, and I was just a tiny part of that body?

What a terrible mistake! But that’s how I was. And I’m not ashamed, O my God, to admit your kindness to me now, or to ask you for help—just like I wasn’t ashamed when I openly said bad things about you in front of people, and howled like a mad dog against you. What good was it that my quick mind could understand those studies and untangle those hard books by myself, since all the while I was wrong in my faith? And what kind of problem was it for your little ones to have slower minds, since they didn’t use them to leave you, and stayed safe inside your Church to grow strong and feed their love with true faith?

O Lord our God, under your protection let us hope—please defend and support us. You will hold us up when we are small and even when we are old.
