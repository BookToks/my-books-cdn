Time doesn’t wait for tomorrow and doesn’t follow yesterday. Your “today” is forever.

That’s why you created the Everlasting One, to whom you said, “Today I have made you.” You made all time, and before time, you existed. There was never a time when there was no time.

There was never a time when you hadn’t made anything, because you made time itself. No times last forever like you do, because you live forever; but if times lasted forever, they wouldn’t really be times.

What is time? Who can explain it easily? Who can really understand it or put it into words? But we talk about time all the time, and we think we understand it when we hear it.

So, what is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. But if I try to explain it, I get confused. I do know this: if nothing ever ended, there wouldn’t be a past; if nothing ever started, there wouldn’t be a future; and if nothing existed at all, there wouldn’t be a present.

But how can there be past and future when the past is gone and the future hasn’t come yet? If the present lasted forever and didn’t turn into the past, it wouldn’t be time—it would be forever. So, present time only exists because it changes into past time. How can we say it really exists if it only exists by moving toward not existing? Time is only real as it moves toward disappearing.

We talk about long and short times, but only about past and future. For example, we say a hundred years ago was a long time, and a hundred years from now will be a long time. Ten days ago was a short time, and ten days from now will be a short time. But how can something that doesn’t exist be long or short? The past isn’t now, and the future isn’t here yet. So, instead of saying “It is long,” we should say “It was long” for the past, and “It will be long” for the future. 

But wait, was that long time really long when it was already past, or only when it was happening? It could only be long when it was happening, but once it was past, it wasn’t long anymore. So, something that doesn’t exist can’t be long. Let’s not say “Past time was long,” because it doesn’t exist anymore. Instead, let’s say “Present time was long,” because when it was happening, it was long. But after it passed, it stopped being long because it stopped existing.

So, human soul, think about whether present time can be long, because you can feel and measure time periods. What do you think?
