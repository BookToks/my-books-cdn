Is a hundred years a long time right now? But first, think about whether a hundred years can all be happening at once. If the first year in the hundred years is happening now, then it is the present, and the other ninety-nine years are still in the future. So, they aren’t happening yet. If the second year is happening now, then one year is already past, the second year is present, and the rest are still in the future. If we pick any year in the middle of the hundred years as now, the years before it are past, and the years after it are future.

So, a hundred years can’t all be happening at the same time.

Now, let’s see if the current year can be all present at once. If its first month is happening now, the rest of the months are still in the future. If the second month is happening now, the first is past, and the rest are still coming. That means the whole year isn’t all present at once. Since the year is made of twelve months, only one month at a time is truly present, while the others are either past or future.

This shows that the present time, which we thought could be “long,” is actually just about as long as one day.

But even one day isn’t all present at once. A day has twenty-four hours, split between night and day. If the first hour is happening now, the rest are future. If the last hour is happening, the others are past. Any hour in the middle has some hours that already passed and some still to come. Even one hour quickly passes in tiny moments. The part that already passed is past; what’s left is still future. If there is any moment in time that can’t be split into smaller parts, that moment is the only real “present.” But it moves so fast from future to past that it can’t last longer. If it did, it would be divided into past and future.

So, the present doesn’t last at all.

Then where is the time that we call “long”? Is it the future? Actually, we don’t say the future “is long” because it hasn’t happened yet.

Instead, we say, “It will be long.” When will it be long? Since it’s still future, it isn’t long now. It will only be long when it stops being future and starts being present. But then, this present time can’t be long either.

And yet, we do notice times passing, and we say some times are longer or shorter than others. We even measure how much longer one time is than another. We say one time is twice or three times as long as another. But we only measure time while it’s happening. Who can measure past times that are gone or future times that haven’t come yet? Maybe no one can measure what doesn’t exist. So, time can only be noticed and measured while it’s passing; once it’s past, it can’t be measured because it’s gone.

I want to find the truth, God. Please guide me.

Who can say there aren’t three kinds of time—as we learned?
