CHAPTER XV  
24. Listen to my prayer, Lord. Don’t let me get tired or give up when you discipline me. Help me always to remember your kindness, the way you saved me from my worst mistakes until loving you became more important to me than anything else. Let me love you completely and hold on to you with all my heart so you can help me avoid every temptation, even the hardest ones.  

Lord, my King and God, I want to use everything I learned as a kid to serve you. Let me now speak, write, and think for your service. When I was learning useless things, you corrected me and forgave me for enjoying those silly things. Some useful words I learned could have been learned in better ways, and that’s the safer path for young people to follow.  

CHAPTER XVI  
25. But wow, human customs are like a wild flood! Who can stop it? When will it ever end? How long will it keep pulling people into a huge, scary ocean that even those with a safe boat can barely cross? Don’t I see stories about Jupiter, the thunder god, who is also called a cheater? How can that be? But that’s what the stories say, and the fake thunder was just a cover so he could cheat.  

But which wise teacher will listen to someone trained in their own schools who says, “These are just made-up stories. Homer made gods act like humans. I wish he had done the opposite”? It would be more true to say, “These stories are fake, but they make sinful people seem like gods, so their crimes don’t seem so bad and they look like they are copying gods, not just bad people.”  

26. Still, people keep getting pulled into this flood, and they pay to learn these things. It’s a big deal when this happens in the public place, supported by laws that pay teachers extra money for it.  

The flood crashes on the rocks and shouts, “Here you can learn words! Here you can get the skill to convince others to believe what you want and explain your ideas well.” They even say we wouldn’t understand words like “golden shower,” “bosom,” “intrigue,” or “highest heavens” if the playwright Terence hadn’t put a useless young man on stage who showed Jupiter as a bad example. He told the story of Jupiter coming down as a golden shower into Danae’s bosom to trick a woman.
