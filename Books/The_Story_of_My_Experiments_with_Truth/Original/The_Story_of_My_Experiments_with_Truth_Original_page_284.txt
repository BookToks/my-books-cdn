But it may be said that God has never allowed any of my own plans to stand.
 
 He has disposed them in His own way.
 
 Just when I seemed to be settling down as I had intended, I received an unexpected cable from South Africa: 'Chamberlain expected here. Please return immediately.' I remembered my promise and cabled to say that I should be ready to start the moment they put me in funds. They promptly responded, I gave up the chambers and started for South Africa.
 
 I had an idea that the work there would keep me engaged for at least a year, so I kept the bungalow and left my wife and children there.
 
 I believed then that enterprising youths who could not find an opening in the country should emigrate to other lands. I therefore took with me four or five such youths, one of whom was Maganlal Gandhi.
 
 The Gandhis were and are a big family. I wanted to find out all those who wished to leave the trodden path and venture abroad. My father used to accommodate a number of them in some State service. I wanted them to be free from this spell. I neither could nor would secure other service for them; I wanted them to be self-reliant.
 
 But as my ideals advanced, I tried to persuade these youths also to conform their ideals to mine, and I had the greatest success in guiding Maganlal Gandhi.
 
 But about this later.
 
 The separation from wife and children, the breaking up of a settled establishment, and the going from the certain to the uncertain, - all this was for a moment painful, but I had inured myself to an uncertain life. I think it is wrong to expect certainties in this world, where all else but God that is Truth is an uncertainty. All that appears and happens about and around us is uncertain, transient. But there is a Supreme Being hidden therein as a Certainty, and one would be blessed if one could catch a glimpse of that www.mkgandhi.org Page 283 An Autobiography or My Experiments with Truth Certainty and hitch one's wagon to it.
