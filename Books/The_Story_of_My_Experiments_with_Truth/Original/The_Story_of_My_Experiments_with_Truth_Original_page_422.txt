WITH GOKHALE IN POONA The moment I reached Bombay Gokhale sent me word that the Governor was desirous of seeing me, and that it might be proper for me to respond before I left for Poona. Accordingly I called on His Excellency. After the usual inquiries, he said: 'I ask one thing of you. I would like you to come and see me whenever you propose to take any steps concerning Government.' I replied: 'I can very easily give the promise, in as much as it is my rule, as a Satyagrahi, to understand the viewpoint of the party I propose to deal with, and to try to agree with him as far as may be possible. I strictly observed the rule in South Africa and I mean to do the same here.' Lord Willingdon thanked me and said: 'You may come to me whenever you like, and you will see that my Government do not willfully do anything wrong.' To which I replied: 'It is that faith which sustains me.' After this I went to Poona. It is impossible for me to set down all the reminiscences of this precious time. Gokhale and the members of the Servants of India Society overwhelmed me with affection. So far as I recollect, Gokhale had summoned all of them to meet me. I had a frank talk with them all on every sort of subject.
 
 Gokhale was very keen that I should join the Society, and so was I. But the members felt that, as there was a great difference between my ideals and methods of work and theirs, it might not be proper for me to join the Society.
 
 Gokhale believed that, in spite of my insistence on my own principles, I was equally ready and able to tolerate theirs.
 
 'But,' he said, 'the members of the Society have not yet understood your readiness for compromise. They are tenacious of their principles, and quite independent. I am hoping that they will accept you, but if they don't, you will www.mkgandhi.org Page 421 An Autobiography or My Experiments with Truth not for a moment think that they are lacking in respect or love for you.
