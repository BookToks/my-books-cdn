It was considered degrading to serve as a waiter in a hotel. The belief persists even today among many.
 
 On the whole I liked Abdulla Sheth's advice. I wrote to the press about the incident and defended the wearing of my turban in the court. The question was very much discussed in the papers, which described me as an 'unwelcome visitor'. Thus the incident gave me an unexpected advertisement in South Africa within a few days of my arrival there. Some supported me while others severely criticized my temerity.
 
 My turban stayed with me practically until the end of my stay in South Africa.
 
 When and why I left off wearing any head-dress at all in South Africa, we shall see later.
