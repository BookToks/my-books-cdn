As the General Editor of these Volumes, I have tried to make a representative selection of all the writings of the Mahatma which are of permanent value and have a universal appeal. The first two Volumes cover his Autobiography, which he called The Story of My Experiments with Truth. The third Volume of the series is Satyagrah in South Africa. In the fourth Volume I have collected most of the ‘basic works’ of Gandhiji, including Ethical Religion, Unto This Last, Hind Swaraj, From Yeravda Mandir, Constructive Programme and Key to Health. The fifth Volume contains a rich selection of letters which are either of historical interest or contain notable ideas on a variety of important subjects. The sixth Volume incorporates all the essential ideas of Mahatma Gandhi on philosophy, religion, culture, economics, politics, sociology and education. I earnestly hope that these Selected Works will be found useful by all those who are keenly interested in the study of Gandhian thought on different aspects of life.
 
 I take this opportunity of thanking the Navajivan Trust for giving me the privilege of placing these Volumes in the hands of a large mumber of readers wihin India and outside. I am grateful to Shri H. M. Vyas, Dr. Raman Modi and others who have actively helped me in editing this series.
