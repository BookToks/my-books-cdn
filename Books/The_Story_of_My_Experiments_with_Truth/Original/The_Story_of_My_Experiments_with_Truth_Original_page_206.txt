Pestonji Padshah, however, not only refused to aid me, but even advised me not to return to South Africa.
 
 'It is impossible to help you,' he said. 'But I tell you I do not like even your going to South Africa. Is there lack of work in our own country? Look, now, there is not a little to do for our language. I have to find out scientific words. But this is only one branch of the work. Think of the poverty of the land. Our people in South Africa are no doubt in difficulty, but I do not want a man like you to be sacrificed for that work. Let us win self-government here, and we shall automatically help our countrymen there. I know I cannot prevail upon you, but I will not encourage anyone of your type to throw in his lot with you.' I did not like this advice, but it increased my regard for Mr. Pestonji Padshah. I was struck with his love for the country and for mother tongue. The incident brought us closer to each other. I could understand his point of view. But far from giving up my work in South Africa, I became firmer in my resolve. A patriot cannot afford to ignore any branch of service to the motherland. And for me the text of the Gita was clear and emphatic: Finally, this is better, that one do His own task as he may, even though he fail, Then take tasks not his own, though they seem good.
 
 To die performing duty is no ill; But who seeks other roads shall wander still.
