In the constitution I shared, the goal of the Congress was to achieve Swaraj (self-rule) within the British Empire if possible, and outside it if needed. Some members wanted the goal to be only Swaraj within the British Empire. This idea was supported by Pandit Malaviyaji and Mr. Jinnah, but they didn’t get many votes.

The draft also said that the ways to reach this goal had to be peaceful and fair. Some people disagreed and said there should be no limits on the methods used. But after a clear and honest discussion, the Congress kept the original plan.

I believe that if the people had worked on this constitution honestly, smartly, and with passion, it could have been a powerful tool to teach and unite the masses. Just working on it might have helped us achieve Swaraj. But talking more about this isn’t important here.

The Congress also passed decisions about Hindu-Muslim unity, ending untouchability, and promoting Khadi (handmade cloth). Since then, Hindu members have promised to help end untouchability in Hinduism, and the Congress has connected with the poorest people in India through Khadi.

Choosing non-cooperation to support the Khilafat movement was a big effort by the Congress to bring Hindus and Muslims together.

Now, it’s time to finish these chapters.
