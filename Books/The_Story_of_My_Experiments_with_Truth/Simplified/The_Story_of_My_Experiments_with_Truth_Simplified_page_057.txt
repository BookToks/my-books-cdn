When I was young, I used to kill bugs and other insects because I thought it was the right thing to do.

But one important idea stayed with me – that being good and moral is the foundation of everything, and that truth is the most important part of being moral. I made truth my main goal. Every day, it became more important to me, and my idea of what truth meant kept growing.

There was a saying in Gujarati that really stuck with me. It taught me to always return good for evil, and this became my main rule in life. I cared about it so much that I tried it out many times. The saying goes like this: For a bowl of water, give a big meal; for a kind hello, bow down with respect; if someone gives you a penny, pay back with gold; if someone saves your life, don’t hold back your own.

So, listen to the wise and their actions; they repay small favors ten times over.

But the truly great people see everyone as one, and happily return good for any bad done to them.
