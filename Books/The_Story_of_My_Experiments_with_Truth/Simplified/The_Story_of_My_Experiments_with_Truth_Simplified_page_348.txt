It wasn’t that we couldn’t have found a European friend to help, but Polak didn’t like that idea. So the three of us went to the Registrar of marriages. He wasn’t sure if the people getting married, with me as the best man, were white. He wanted to delay the registration to check. The next day was Sunday, and the day after that was New Year’s Day, a holiday. Delaying the wedding for such a weak reason was too much to accept. I knew the Chief Magistrate, who was in charge of the Registration Department. So I went to see him with the couple. He laughed, gave me a note for the Registrar, and the marriage was officially registered.

Before this, I already knew most Europeans living with us. But now, an English lady who was a complete stranger joined our family. I don’t remember any fights with the newly married couple, and even if Mrs. Polak and my wife had some problems, they were probably no worse than what happens in any normal family. Remember, my family was very mixed, with all kinds of people and personalities accepted. When you think about it, the difference between mixed and uniform families is just made up. We are all one family.

I should also mention West’s wedding here. At this time in my life, I hadn’t fully understood brahmacharya (self-control), so I was trying to get all my single friends married. When West went to Louth to visit his parents, I told him to come back married if he could. Phoenix was our shared home, and since we were all supposed to be farmers, marriage and its usual results didn’t scare us. West came back with Mrs. West, a beautiful young woman from Leicester. Her family were shoemakers working in a factory there.

Mrs. West had worked in that factory herself. I said she was beautiful because her good heart was what really caught my attention. True beauty is really about having a pure heart. Mr. West also brought his mother-in-law with him.
