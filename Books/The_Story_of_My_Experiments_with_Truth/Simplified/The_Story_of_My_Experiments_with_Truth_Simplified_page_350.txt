A LOOK INSIDE OUR HOME

We already saw that even though household costs were high, people in Durban started living more simply. But in Johannesburg, things changed even more because of Ruskin’s ideas.

I tried to make our barrister’s house as simple as possible. We couldn’t get rid of all the furniture, but the real changes were inside, not outside. I also liked doing physical work myself and wanted my kids to learn that too.

Instead of buying bread from the store, we started making our own unleavened wholemeal bread at home using a recipe from Kuhne. Regular flour wasn’t good for this, so we thought grinding our own flour by hand would be healthier, simpler, and cheaper. I bought a hand-mill for £7. It was too heavy for one person to turn alone, but two people could handle it easily. Polak, the kids, and I usually worked it together. My wife helped sometimes, even though she usually started kitchen work then.

When Mrs. Polak came to live with us, she joined in too. Grinding flour became a fun activity for the kids. We never forced them to do any work; it was their choice to help and they could stop whenever they wanted. But most of the kids, including some I’ll tell you about later, almost always helped happily. There were a few who didn’t, but most never tried to avoid work or say they were too tired.

We had a servant to help look after the house, and he lived with us like family. The kids helped him with his tasks. The city cleaner took away the waste at night, but we cleaned the toilet ourselves instead of making the servant do it. This was good training for the children. None of my sons ever felt disgusted by dirty jobs, and they learned a lot about keeping things clean. We hardly ever got sick in our Johannesburg home, but when someone was ill, the kids took good care of them without complaint.
