THE TEST

So, the ships came into the dock and the passengers started getting off.

But Mr. Escombe sent a message to the captain saying that the white people were very angry with me and my life was in danger. He said my family and I should get off the ship at dusk, and that Mr. Tatum, the Port Superintendent, would take us home. The captain told me this, and I agreed.

But about half an hour later, Mr. Laughton came to the captain. He said, "I want to take Mr. Gandhi with me, if he doesn’t mind. As the legal adviser for the Agent Company, I tell you that you don’t have to follow Mr. Escombe’s message." Then he spoke to me and said something like, "If you’re not scared, I think Mrs. Gandhi and the kids should go to Mr. Rustomji’s house by car, while you and I walk behind them. I don’t like the idea of you sneaking into the city at night. I don’t think anyone will hurt you because everything is calm now and the white people have left. But I still believe you shouldn’t enter quietly." I agreed right away.

My wife and kids drove safely to Mr. Rustomji’s house. With the captain’s permission, I went ashore with Mr. Laughton. Mr. Rustomji’s house was about two miles from the dock.

As soon as we got off, some kids recognized me and shouted, "Gandhi, Gandhi." About six men ran over and started shouting too.

Mr. Laughton was worried the crowd might get bigger, so he called a rickshaw. I had never liked rickshaws before, and this was my first time using one.

But the kids wouldn’t let me get in. They scared the rickshaw driver so much that he ran away. The crowd kept growing, and it became impossible to move forward. They grabbed Mr. Laughton and separated us. Then they threw stones, bricks, and rotten eggs at me. Someone took off my turban, and others started hitting and kicking me. I fainted and held on to the railings of a house to catch my breath. But it was no use.

They kept on hitting and attacking me.
