As if all this wasn’t enough to make me look like the right kind of person, I started focusing on other things that were supposed to help me become a proper English gentleman. I was told I needed to take lessons in dancing, French, and speaking clearly. French wasn’t just the language of nearby France, but it was also the common language used all over Europe, and I wanted to travel there. So, I decided to join a dance class and paid £3 for a term. I took about six lessons in three weeks.

But I just couldn’t move to the rhythm. I couldn’t follow the piano, so I found it impossible to keep time. What was I supposed to do then? Like the story of the recluse who kept a cat to scare away rats, and then a cow to feed the cat, and a man to take care of the cow, my goals kept growing too. I thought I should learn to play the violin to get better at Western music. So, I spent £3 on a violin and paid more for lessons. I also got a third teacher for speaking lessons and paid him a guinea upfront. He told me to use Bell’s Standard Elocutionist book, which I bought. I started practicing a speech by Pitt.

But then Mr. Bell’s book made me realize something.

I didn’t have to spend my whole life in England, I thought. So why bother learning to speak like an Englishman? And how would dancing make me a gentleman? I could learn the violin later in India. I was a student and should focus on my studies. I wanted to join the Inns of Court (a place for law students). If my character made me a gentleman, great. If not, I would give up on that dream.

These thoughts kept running through my mind, and I wrote a letter to my speaking teacher, asking to stop the lessons. I had only taken two or three. I wrote a similar letter to the dancing teacher and went to the violin teacher in person to ask him to sell the violin for whatever price he could get.
