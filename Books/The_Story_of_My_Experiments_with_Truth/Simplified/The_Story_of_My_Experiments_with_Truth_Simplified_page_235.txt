BRAHMACHARYA - I

Now, in this story, I started seriously thinking about taking the brahmacharya vow. Since my marriage, I believed in being faithful to my wife because that was part of being truthful. But it was in South Africa that I understood how important it is to practice brahmacharya even with my wife.

I’m not sure what exactly made me think this way—maybe a situation or a book—but I remember that Raychandbhai, someone I had written about before, had a big influence on me. I can still remember a talk we had.

One time, I praised Mrs. Gladstone for being so devoted to her husband. I had read that she always made tea for him, even in the House of Commons, and that this was a rule in their regular life. I talked about this to Raychandbhai and praised their married love.

He asked me, “Which do you value more—the love Mrs. Gladstone showed as a wife or her care if she wasn’t his wife but his sister or servant? Would you feel the same way if a servant showed the same devotion? Would you be as impressed?”

Raychandbhai was married too. At first, his words seemed harsh, but they stuck with me. I thought the devotion of a servant was much more impressive than that of a wife because a wife and husband have a natural bond. The wife’s love is normal, but it takes real effort to have a servant show that kind of love.

Slowly, I started to agree with the poet’s point of view.

Then I asked myself, what kind of relationship should I have with my wife?
