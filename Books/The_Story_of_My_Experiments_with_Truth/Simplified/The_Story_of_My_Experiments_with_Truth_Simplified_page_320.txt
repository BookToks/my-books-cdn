It wouldn't be honest if I didn’t share what I know about her.

She worked so hard for the cause that she didn’t even notice day or night. She went out alone at night to run errands and didn’t like the idea of anyone escorting her. Thousands of strong Indians looked up to her for guidance. When almost all the leaders were in jail during the Satyagraha days, she led the movement all by herself. She managed thousands of people, handled a huge amount of mail, and took care of Indian Opinion, but she never got tired.

I could keep talking about Miss Schlesin forever, but I’ll end this chapter by sharing what Gokhale said about her. Gokhale knew all my co-workers and liked many of them. He often shared his opinions. He put Miss Schlesin first among all the Indian and European co-workers. He said, “I have rarely seen the sacrifice, purity, and fearlessness that Miss Schlesin has. Among your co-workers, she is the best in my eyes.”
