His friend praised him, saying: 'Our buddy is just a tailor. But he’s so good at his job that he easily makes Rs. 15 a month – exactly what he needs – by working just one hour a day, and spends the rest of his time helping the community. He leads us all and makes us feel ashamed of our education.'

Later, I got to know Motilal better, and I realized his friend wasn’t exaggerating. He made sure to spend a few days every month at the new Ashram to teach kids tailoring and to do some tailoring work himself. He would talk to me every day about Viramgam and how tough the travel conditions were, which bothered him a lot. Sadly, he died young from a sudden illness, and Wadhwan’s public life missed him a lot.

When I got to Rajkot, I told the Medical Officer about myself the next morning. I wasn’t a stranger there. The Doctor felt bad and was angry at the inspector, but that wasn’t fair because the inspector was just doing his job. He didn’t know me, and even if he did, he still had to follow the rules. The Medical Officer wouldn’t let me go to the inspector again and said he would send someone else to check on me.

Checking third class passengers for health reasons is very important at times like these. If important people choose to travel third class, no matter who they are, they must follow the same rules as the poor people, and officials should treat everyone equally. From what I’ve seen, officials don’t treat third class passengers as equals. They act like passengers are just animals, speak to them rudely, and don’t allow any complaints. Third class passengers have to obey officials like servants, and the officials often cause them big problems, even making them miss their trains. I have seen all this myself. Nothing will change unless some educated and rich people choose to travel third class, give up the benefits the poor don’t have, and instead of just accepting the unfair treatment, fight to end it.
