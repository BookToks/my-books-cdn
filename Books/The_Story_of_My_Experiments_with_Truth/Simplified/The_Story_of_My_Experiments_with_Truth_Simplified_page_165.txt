THE PLAN CHANGED

After my case was finished, I had no reason to stay in Pretoria. So, I went back to Durban and started getting ready to go home. But Abdulla Sheth didn’t want me to leave without a proper goodbye. He threw a farewell party for me at Sydenham.

We planned to spend the whole day there. While I was flipping through some newspapers, I saw a small article titled 'Indian Franchise.' It talked about a new law being discussed that wanted to take away Indians’ right to vote for members of the Natal Legislative Assembly. I didn’t know about this law, and neither did the other guests.

I asked Abdulla Sheth about it. He said, “What can we understand about these things? We only care about stuff that affects our business. You know, we lost all our trade in the Orange Free State. We complained, but it didn’t help. We are kind of powerless because we don’t have much education. We mostly read newspapers to check market prices. We rely on the European lawyers for legal stuff.” I said, “But there are many young Indians born and educated here. Don’t they help you?” He sighed and said, “They don’t come to us, and honestly, we don’t really trust them either. They are Christians, controlled by white church leaders, who follow the government.” 

This made me think. Shouldn’t these young Christians be part of our community? Is this what Christianity means? Do they stop being Indians just because they became Christians?

I was about to go home and didn’t want to say too much. So, I just told Abdulla Sheth, “If this law passes, life will get really hard for us.”
