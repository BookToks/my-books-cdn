The operation was supposed to be done by a famous surgeon from Bombay. But God had other plans. When someone is about to die, it’s hard to think clearly about what to do. My father came back from Bombay with all the tools for the operation, but they couldn’t be used anymore. He felt hopeless and weaker every day. In the end, he had to be helped with basic needs in bed. But he didn’t want that. He always tried to get out of bed because of his strict beliefs about cleanliness.

Cleanliness is very important, no doubt. But Western medicine shows that everything, even bathing, can be done in bed without making the bed dirty or causing pain. I think this kind of cleanliness fits with Vaishnavism too. Still, I was amazed by my father’s strong will to get out of bed, and I admired him for it.

The terrible night came. My uncle was in Rajkot. I vaguely remember he went there after hearing my father was getting worse. The brothers loved each other a lot. My uncle stayed by my father’s bed all day and insisted on sleeping next to him after we all went to sleep. Nobody thought this night would be the last one, but we knew the danger was real.

It was around 10:30 or 11 p.m. I was giving a massage. My uncle said he would take over, so I went to the bedroom. My wife was sleeping deeply, but I woke her up because I couldn’t rest while my father was so sick. After a few minutes, the servant knocked on the door. I was shocked. “Get up,” he said, “Father is very ill.” I already knew, and I guessed what that really meant. I jumped out of bed.

“What is wrong? Tell me!” I asked. “Father is no more,” he said. It was all over.
