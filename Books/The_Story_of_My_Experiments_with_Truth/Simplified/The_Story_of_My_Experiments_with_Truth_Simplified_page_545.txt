The demand surprised her a lot. But she handled it well. In less than a month, she sent me two Khadi dhotis that were 45 inches wide. This saved me from a tough problem I would have had.

Around the same time, Sjt. Lakshmidas brought Sjt. Ramji, the weaver, and his wife Gangabehn from Lathi to the Ashram. They made Khadi dhotis at the Ashram. This couple played an important role in spreading Khadi. They taught many people in Gujarat and beyond how to weave hand-spun yarn.

Watching Gangabehn work at her loom is inspiring. Even though she can’t read or write, she is very confident. When she works, she gets so focused that it’s hard to get her attention or make her look away from her loom.
