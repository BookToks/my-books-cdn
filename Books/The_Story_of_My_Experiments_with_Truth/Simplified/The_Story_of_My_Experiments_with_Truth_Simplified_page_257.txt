What am I before you? You have grown old working for the Congress, and you are like an elder to me. I am just a young person with little experience. You have done me a big favor by trusting me with this work. I want to work for the Congress, and you have given me a rare chance to learn the details.

To tell you the truth, said Sjt. Ghosal, that is the right attitude. But young people today don’t understand that. I have known the Congress since it started.

In fact, I helped Mr. Hume start the Congress. That’s how we became good friends. He always invited me to have lunch with him.

Sjt. Ghosal used to have his servant button his shirt. I offered to do that job, and I liked doing it because I always respected older people.

When he found out, he didn’t mind me helping him with small things. Actually, he was happy. He would say, “See, now the Congress secretary is so busy he can’t even button his own shirt.” Sjt. Ghosal’s simple way of thinking made me smile, but I didn’t mind helping him. I learned a lot from doing this.

After a few days, I understood how the Congress worked. I met many leaders and watched important people like Gokhale and Surendranath.

I also saw a lot of wasted time. It made me sad to see how much the English language was used in our work.

People didn’t care about saving energy. Sometimes more than one person did the same work, and many important tasks were not done by anyone.

Even though I noticed these problems, I was kind enough to think that maybe it was impossible to do better in those conditions. That stopped me from thinking any work was useless.
