I met Maulana Mazharul Haq in London when he was studying law, and later, in 1915 at the Bombay Congress, where he was President of the Muslim League, he invited me to visit him in Patna. I remembered his invitation and sent him a note about my visit. He quickly came to pick me up in his car and insisted I stay with him. I thanked him and asked for help to find my way by train, since I didn’t know the area. He talked with Rajkumar Shukla and suggested I first go to Muzaffarpur. There was a train that evening, and he sent me off on it.

Principal Kripalani was in Muzaffarpur at the time. I had heard about him from Dr. Choitharam, who told me about Kripalani’s sacrifices, simple life, and the Ashram he supported with his own money. Kripalani used to be a professor at the Government College there but had just resigned when I arrived. I sent him a telegram, and he met me at the station with a group of students, even though it was midnight. He didn’t have his own place and was staying with Professor Malkani, who became my host. It was unusual back then for a government professor to host someone like me.

Professor Kripalani told me about how bad things were in Bihar, especially in the Tirhut area, and warned me about the hard work ahead. He was very close to the people there and had already talked to them about the mission I was on.

The next morning, a small group of lawyers came to see me. I still remember Ramnavmi Prasad because he was very serious and committed.

He said, “It’s not possible for you to do the work you came for if you stay here,” meaning at Professor Malkani’s place.
