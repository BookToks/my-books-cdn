I told everyone to 'Return soon.' Then, I wrote a letter to the newspapers explaining why I had to leave Calcutta so quickly. After that, I headed to Bombay.

Before leaving, I sent a message to the Bombay agent of Dada Abdulla & Co. to book a ticket on the first boat to South Africa. At that time, Dada Abdulla had just bought a steamship called the Courland. He wanted me to travel on his ship and even offered to take me and my family for free. I happily said yes.

At the start of December, I set sail for South Africa again, this time with my wife, two sons, and my widowed sisterâ€™s only son. Another ship named Naderi also left for Durban at the same time. Both ships were run by Dada Abdulla & Co.

Together, these boats carried about eight hundred passengers, and about half of them were going to the Transvaal.
