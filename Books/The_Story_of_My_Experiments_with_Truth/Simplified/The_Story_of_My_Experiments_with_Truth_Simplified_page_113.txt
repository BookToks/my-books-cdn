Mehta introduced me to several friends, including his brother Shri Revashankar Jagjivan, and I became lifelong friends with him. But the introduction I really need to talk about was to the poet Raychand, also called Rajchandra. He was the son-in-law of an older brother of Dr. Mehta and a partner in a jewelry business called Revashankar Jagjivan.  

He was not more than twenty-five years old then, but when I first met him, I could tell he was a man with great character and knowledge. People also called him Shatavadhani, which means someone who can remember or pay attention to a hundred things at once. Dr. Mehta told me to watch some of his memory skills.  

I tested him by saying words in all the European languages I knew and asked him to repeat them. He repeated the words exactly in the same order. I was amazed by his ability but wasn’t completely caught up by it. What really impressed me was something I learned later—his deep knowledge of religious books, his perfect character, and his strong passion for finding God or self-realization. I found out that this last thing was the most important thing in his life.  

He often said these lines by Muktanand, which were very important to him: “I will feel blessed only when I see God in everything I do every day; He is the thread that holds my life together.”  

Raychandbhai handled business deals worth hundreds of thousands. He was an expert in pearls and diamonds, and no tough business problem was too hard for him. But these things were not the main focus of his life. The main thing was his desire to see God face to face.  

On his business desk, there were always religious books and his diary. As soon as he finished work, he would open a religious book or write in his diary. Many of his published writings came from this diary. The fact that he would switch from serious business talks to writing about spiritual things showed he wasn’t just a businessman but a true seeker of Truth.  

I saw him focused on his godly pursuits during business time many times, not just once or twice.
