I think we spent no more than three thousand rupees in total, and if I remember right, we saved a few hundred rupees from the money we collected.

My friends lived in strange ways at first, and we often joked about it. Each lawyer had a servant and a cook, so they had their own kitchens, and sometimes they ate dinner as late as midnight. Even though they paid their own bills, their weird habits worried me. But since we were good friends, they didn’t get upset when I made fun of them.

In the end, we agreed to get rid of the servants, combine all the kitchens into one, and eat at regular times. Because not everyone was vegetarian and having two kitchens was expensive, we decided on one shared vegetarian kitchen. We also agreed to keep the meals simple.

These changes saved us money, time, and energy, which we really needed. Lots of farmers came to talk to us, followed by many friends who filled up the house and garden. My friends tried to keep people from bothering me, but it didn’t work, so I had to meet visitors at certain times. We needed five to seven volunteers just to write down the statements, and even then, some people had to leave without being heard. Not all statements were really important since many repeated the same things, but the people wouldn’t be happy otherwise, and I understood how they felt.

The people writing the statements had to follow rules. They asked each farmer many questions, and if the answers weren’t good enough, the statement was rejected. This took a lot of extra time, but it made sure most statements were true.

A police officer from the C.I.D. was always there when we recorded these statements. We could have stopped him, but we decided from the start not to mind the C.I.D.’s presence.
