So, if you have stopped drinking milk because of my ideas, I suggest you don’t keep doing it unless it helps you in every way or a doctor tells you to.

From what I’ve seen so far, people who have weak digestion or are stuck in bed don’t have a better, easy-to-digest food than milk.

I would really appreciate it if anyone who knows from personal experience—not just from books—about a plant-based food that can replace milk and is just as healthy and easy to digest, would let me know.
