Things were happening in Johannesburg that made me realize I needed to clean up my own life first before starting Satyagraha. Looking back, I can see that many important moments in my life, including my promise to live simply and purely, were actually getting me ready for it.

The idea of Satyagraha came before we even had the name for it. At first, I didn’t even know how to explain what it really was. In Gujarati, we used the English term "passive resistance" to talk about it. But when I spoke to Europeans, I noticed they misunderstood it. They thought passive resistance was just for weak people, that it was full of hate, or that it could turn violent. I had to correct them and explain what the Indian movement was really about. It was clear we needed a new word to describe our fight.

I couldn’t think of a new name myself, so I offered a small prize in the Indian Opinion newspaper for anyone who could suggest one. Maganlal Gandhi came up with the word "Sadagraha" (which means truth and firmness) and won the prize. To make it clearer, I changed it a little to "Satyagraha," and that name stuck in Gujarati to describe our struggle.

The story of this struggle is basically the story of the rest of my life in South Africa and my experiments with truth there. I wrote most of this story while I was in Yeravda jail and finished it after I got out. It was published in Navajivan and later as a book. Valji Govindji Desai has been translating it into English for Current Thought magazine, and I’m now planning to publish the English version as a book soon. This way, anyone interested can learn about my most important experiences in South Africa. I suggest reading my history of Satyagraha in South Africa if you haven’t already. 

I won’t repeat what I wrote there, but in the next few chapters, I will share some personal stories from my time in South Africa that I didn’t include before.
