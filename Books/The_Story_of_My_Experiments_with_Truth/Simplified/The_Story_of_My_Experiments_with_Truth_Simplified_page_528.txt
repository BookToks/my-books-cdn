Now, we need to move away from the bad events happening in Punjab for a while.

The Congress had just started investigating what happened there when I got a letter inviting me to a meeting in Delhi. This meeting was for both Hindus and Muslims to talk about the Khilafat issue.

Some important people like Hakim Ajmal Khan and Mr. Asaf Ali signed the invitation. It said that Swami Shraddhanandji would also be there and might even be the vice-president of the meeting, which I think was in November that year. The meeting was supposed to talk about the problems caused by the Khilafat betrayal and whether Hindus and Muslims should join the peace celebrations. The letter also said that the meeting would discuss cow protection, hoping to solve that problem too. I didn’t like mixing these two topics. So, in my reply, I said I would try to come but suggested that the Khilafat and cow protection issues should be handled separately, not together like a bargain.

With these thoughts, I went to the meeting. Many people came, but it wasn’t as big as later meetings with tens of thousands. I talked about this with Swami Shraddhanandji, who agreed with me and let me share my views at the meeting. I also talked with Hakim Saheb. Before the meeting, I said that if the Khilafat issue was fair, and the Government had really done something wrong, then Hindus should support Muslims in fixing that wrong. It was wrong to mix the cow question with this or to use it as a way to make deals. Just like it would be wrong for Muslims to promise to stop cow slaughter only if Hindus helped them with the Khilafat issue.
