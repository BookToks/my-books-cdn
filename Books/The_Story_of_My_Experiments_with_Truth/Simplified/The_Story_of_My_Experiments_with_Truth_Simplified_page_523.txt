I know that Mr. Horniman never wanted people to break the law. He didn’t like that I broke the Punjab Government’s order without asking the Satyagraha Committee first. He agreed with the decision to stop civil disobedience. He even sent me a letter telling me to stop before I announced it. But because Bombay and Ahmedabad are far apart, I got the letter after I already said it. So, when he was suddenly sent away, it was painful and surprising for me.

Because of these events, the directors of The Bombay Chronicle asked me to take charge of the paper. Mr. Brelvi was already working there, so I didn’t have much to do. But knowing me, I would have felt that the responsibility was another burden.

Then the Government helped me in a way, because they ordered The Chronicle to stop publishing.

The friends running The Chronicle, Mr. Umar Sobani and Mr. Shankarlal Banker, were also in charge of Young India. They said that since The Chronicle was stopped, I should become the editor of Young India. They also wanted Young India to change from a weekly paper to one that comes out twice a week. I agreed because I wanted to explain the real meaning of Satyagraha to people. I also wanted to help people understand what was happening in Punjab. Behind everything I wrote, there was a strong idea of Satyagraha, and the Government knew this too. So, I accepted their idea.

But how could people learn about Satyagraha if it was only in English? Most of my work was in Gujarat. At that time, Sjt. Indulal Yajnik was working with Mr. Sobani and Mr. Banker. He was running a Gujarati monthly magazine called Navajivan, which these friends supported with money. They gave me control of the magazine, and Sjt. Indulal offered to work on it. We changed the monthly magazine into a weekly one.

In the meantime, The Chronicle started publishing again.
