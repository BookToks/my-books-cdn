I left Manilal with his mother and went for a walk on Chaupati to clear my mind. It was about ten o’clock, and there were only a few people around. I was lost in my thoughts and hardly noticed them. I kept saying to myself, "My honor is in Your hands, Lord, during this tough time." The name of Rama was on my lips. After a short walk, I came back, my heart beating fast.

As soon as I entered the room, Manilal said, "You’re back, Bapu?" "Yes, dear." "Please help me get out. I’m burning up." "Are you sweating, my boy?" "I’m soaked. Please take me out." I felt his forehead—it was covered with sweat. The fever was going down. I thanked God.

"Manilal, your fever will go away now. Just a little more sweating, then I’ll take you out." "No, please. Get me out of this heat now. You can wrap me up later." I distracted him and kept the pack on for a few more minutes. Sweat kept running down his forehead. Then I took off the pack and dried him. Father and son fell asleep in the same bed.

Both of us slept very deeply. The next morning, Manilal’s fever was much lower. For forty days, he lived on watered-down milk and fruit juices. I wasn’t afraid anymore. The fever was stubborn, but we had it under control.

Today, Manilal is the healthiest of my sons. Who knows if his recovery was because of God’s help, the water treatment, or the careful food and care? Everyone can believe what they want. For me, I was sure God saved my honor, and I still believe that today.
