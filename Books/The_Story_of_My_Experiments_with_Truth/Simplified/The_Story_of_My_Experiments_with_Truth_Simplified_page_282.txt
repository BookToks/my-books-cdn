I left Manilal in the charge of his mother, and went out for a walk on Chaupati to refresh myself. It was about ten o'clock. Very few pedestrians were out. Plunged in deep thought, I scarcely looked at them. 'My honour is in Thy keeping, oh Lord, in this hour of trial,' I repeated to myself. Ramanama was on my lips. After a short time I returned, my heart beating within my breast.
 
 No sooner had I entered the room than Manilal said, 'You have returned, Bapu?' 'Yes, darling.' 'Do please pull me out. I am burning.' 'Are you perspiring, my boy?' 'I am simply soaked. Do please take me out.' I felt his forehead. It was covered with beads of perspiration. The temperature was going down. I thanked God.
 
 'Manilal, your fever is sure to go now. A little more perspiration and then I will take you out.' 'Pray, no. Do deliver me from this furnace. Wrap me some other time if you like.' I just managed to keep him under the pack for a few minutes more by diverting him. The perspiration streamed down his forehead. I undid the pack and dried his body. Father and son fell asleep in the same bed.
 
 And each slept like a log. Next morning Manilal had much less fever. He went on thus for forty days on diluted milk and fruit juices. I had no fear now. It was an obstinate type of fever, but it had been got under control.
 
 Today Manilal is the healthiest of my boys. Who can say whether his recovery was due to God's grace, or to hydropathy, or to careful dietary and nursing? Let everyone decide according to his own faith. For my part I was sure that God had saved my honour, and that belief remains unaltered to this day.
