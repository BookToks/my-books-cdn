During this month, I convinced the Muslim kids to fast for Ramadan. I had decided to fast for Pradosha myself, but I also asked the Hindu, Parsi, and Christian kids to join me. I told them it’s always good to join others when giving something up.

Many people at the Farm liked my idea. The Hindu and Parsi kids didn’t copy the Muslims exactly, and that was okay. The Muslim kids had to wait to eat breakfast until sunset, but the others didn’t. This way, they could make special food for their Muslim friends and serve them. The Hindu and others didn’t have to stay up early with the Muslims for their last meal before sunrise. Also, only the Muslims didn’t drink water during fasting.

Because of these experiments, everyone saw how valuable fasting was, and a great team spirit grew between them.

We were all vegetarians at Tolstoy Farm, and I’m thankful that everyone respected my feelings about this. The Muslim kids probably missed eating meat during Ramadan, but they never told me. They enjoyed the vegetarian food, and the Hindu kids often made tasty vegetarian dishes for them, keeping things simple on the Farm.

I’ve gone off-topic a bit to talk about fasting because I couldn’t share these nice memories anywhere else. I also showed something about myself: I always liked having my friends join me in things I thought were good. Fasting was new to them, but thanks to the Pradosha and Ramadan fasts, it was easy to get them interested in fasting as a way to practice self-control.

So, a feeling of self-control naturally started on the Farm. Everyone began joining us in fasting sometimes, and I believe this was a good thing. I can’t say exactly how much this self-denial helped them, but it surely helped in their effort to control their desires.
