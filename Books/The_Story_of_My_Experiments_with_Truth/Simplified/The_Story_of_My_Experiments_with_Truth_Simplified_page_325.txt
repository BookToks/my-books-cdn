These people didn’t know much about how to keep their town clean and healthy, so they needed help and guidance from the local government. If everyone who went there had been like Robinson Crusoe, the story would have been different. But there has never been a colony of people like Robinson Crusoe anywhere. Usually, people move to other countries to find money and business, but most of the Indians who went to South Africa were poor farmers who needed a lot of care and protection. Only a few traders and educated Indians came after them.

The local government ignored their responsibilities, and the Indian settlers didn’t know much about keeping their area clean. Because of this, the place became very dirty and unhealthy. Instead of fixing the problem, the government used the mess, which they caused by not helping, as an excuse to destroy the settlement. They got permission from the local lawmakers to take away the settlers’ land. This was the situation when I arrived in Johannesburg.

Since the settlers owned the land, they had the right to get paid for it. A special court was set up to handle these land cases. If a tenant didn’t want to accept the government’s offer, they could ask the court to decide. If the court’s payment was higher than what the government offered, the government had to pay the extra legal costs.

Most tenants asked me to be their lawyer. I didn’t want to make a lot of money, so I told them I would only take the costs the court decided if they won, plus a fee of £10 for each lease no matter what happened. I also said I would use half the money they paid to help build a hospital or a similar place for poor people. They all liked this idea.

Out of about 70 cases, we only lost one. So the fees added up to a decent amount. But the Indian Opinion newspaper, which kept asking for money, used up about £1,600 from that money, as far as I remember. I worked really hard on these cases. The clients were always around me. Most of them had been indentured laborers from Bihar and nearby areas, and from South India.
