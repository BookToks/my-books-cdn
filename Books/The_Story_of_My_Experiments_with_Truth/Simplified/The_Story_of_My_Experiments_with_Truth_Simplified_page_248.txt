I earned the respect of the leaders. They saw that even though I worked hard to speak up about problems and fight for rights, I also cared a lot about improving myself.

But there was still one important thing to do: to make Indian people living in South Africa feel responsible for helping their homeland. India was poor, and Indians had gone to South Africa to find money. They needed to send some of what they earned back to help their people in India during hard times. 

The Indian settlers did this during the terrible famines in 1897 and 1899. They gave a lot of money for famine relief, even more in 1899 than in 1897. We also asked English people for help, and they gave generously. Even the indentured Indians, who were workers bound by contracts, gave their share. This way of helping started during those famines and has continued since then. We know Indians in South Africa always send good donations to India when the country faces big problems.

Serving the Indians in South Africa showed me new lessons about Truth all the time. Truth is like a big tree that gives more fruit the more you take care of it. The more you explore Truth, the more valuable things you find, like new chances to help in different ways.
