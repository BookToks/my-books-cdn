I’m sorry, but I have to keep talking about a different topic until the next chapter. While I was working on earth treatment experiments, I was also trying out different diets. It’s a good time to share a few thoughts about diet, even though I’ll talk more about it later.

I can’t give a full explanation of my diet experiments here because I already wrote about them in a series of Gujarati articles a long time ago. These were published in Indian Opinion and later became a book called A Guide to Health. This little book has been read a lot in both the East and West, which surprises me. I wrote it for the readers of Indian Opinion, but many people who never even saw the magazine have told me how much the book helped them.

Because of this, I think it’s important to say something about the book now. I still believe in the ideas I shared there, but I have made some big changes in how I actually live. Not everyone who read the book knows about these changes, so I want to explain.

Like all my writing, the book was written with a spiritual goal in mind, which motivates everything I do. So, it makes me sad that I can’t follow some of the ideas in the book today.

I strongly believe that people don’t need to drink milk after they stop being babies. Instead, people should eat only sun-dried fruits and nuts. Fruits like grapes and nuts like almonds give enough nutrition for the body and mind. When someone eats this way, it’s easier to control desires and emotions. My friends and I have learned from experience that the old Indian saying is true: as a person eats, so they become.
