TREATMENT OF PLEURISY

I was worried because my pleurisy didn’t go away, but I knew the cure wasn’t from taking medicine inside. Instead, it needed changes in my diet and some treatments from outside.

I called Dr. Allinson, who was famous for treating people by changing their diet. I had met him in 1890. He checked me carefully. I told him I promised not to drink milk. He was happy and said, “You don’t need milk. In fact, don’t eat any fat for a few days.” He told me to eat plain brown bread, raw vegetables like beet, radish, onion, and other roots and greens, plus fresh fruit, mostly oranges. The vegetables shouldn’t be cooked but just grated finely if I couldn’t chew them well.

I tried this for about three days, but raw vegetables didn’t really agree with me.

My body wasn’t ready to handle this diet well. I felt nervous about eating raw vegetables.

Dr. Allinson also told me to keep my room’s windows open all day and night, bathe in warm water, get oil massages on the sore parts, and walk outside for 15 to 30 minutes. I liked all these ideas.

My room had French windows that would let rain in if opened wide.

The small window above couldn’t be opened. So, I broke the glass to let fresh air in and opened the windows a little to keep the rain out.

These things made me feel a bit better but didn’t fully cure me.

Lady Cecilia Roberts visited me sometimes. We became friends. She really wanted me to drink milk. But I refused. So, she looked for a milk substitute. Someone told her about malted milk, wrongly saying it had no milk and was a chemical with all milk’s benefits. Lady Cecilia knew I respected my religious beliefs, so I trusted her completely.
