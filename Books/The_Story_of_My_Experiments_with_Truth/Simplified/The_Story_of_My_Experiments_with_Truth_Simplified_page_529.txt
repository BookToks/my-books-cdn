But it would be something really special and respectful if the Muslims chose on their own to stop killing cows because they care about the feelings of the Hindus and want to be good neighbors who live on the same land. I believed it was their responsibility to do this, and it would make them look honorable. But if Muslims wanted to stop cow slaughter as a way to be good neighbors, they should do it no matter if the Hindus helped them with the Khilafat issue or not. So, I said the two topics should be talked about separately, and the meeting should only focus on the Khilafat issue. The people there agreed with me, so we did not talk about cow protection at that meeting.

Still, despite my warning, Maulana Abdul Bari Saheb said that Muslims should stop killing cows out of respect for the Hindus’ feelings, whether or not the Hindus helped them. At one point, it almost seemed like they would actually stop it.

Some people suggested adding the Punjab problem to the Khilafat issue. I didn’t like this idea. I said the Punjab problem was local and shouldn’t affect our decision about joining the peace celebrations. Mixing the Punjab issue with the Khilafat issue, which was about the peace talks, would be a big mistake. Everyone agreed with me easily.

Maulana Hasrat Mohani was at this meeting. I had met him before, but only here did I see how strong a fighter he was. We disagreed on many things right from the start, and still do.

At this meeting, many decisions were made, including one asking both Hindus and Muslims to promise to support Indian-made goods and to refuse buying foreign products.
