Day by day, I realized how hard it was to raise and teach boys and girls the right way. If I wanted to be a true teacher and protector, I had to reach their hearts. I needed to share their happiness and sadness, help them solve their problems, and guide their strong hopes and dreams.

When some of the Satyagrahis were let out of jail, Tolstoy Farm had very few people left. Most of them were from Phoenix, so I moved them there. This was a very tough time for me.

Back then, I had to travel between Johannesburg and Phoenix. One time, while I was in Johannesburg, I heard that two people from the Ashram had done something wrong. I wasn’t shocked by bad news about the Satyagraha struggle, but this news hit me like lightning. That same day, I took a train to Phoenix. Mr. Kallenbach saw how upset I was and insisted on coming with me. He was carrying the bad news that had upset me so much.

During the trip, I understood my responsibility. I felt that a teacher or guardian is partly responsible if their student makes a mistake. So, I accepted that this was my fault too. My wife had warned me before, but I trusted those people and didn’t listen. I decided the only way to show them how sad I was, and how much they had let me down, was to do a penance. I fasted for seven days and promised to eat only one meal a day for four and a half months. Mr. Kallenbach tried to stop me, but couldn’t. In the end, he agreed it was the right thing and joined me. His support made me feel better. My anger faded, and I felt deep pity for those who had made the mistake.
