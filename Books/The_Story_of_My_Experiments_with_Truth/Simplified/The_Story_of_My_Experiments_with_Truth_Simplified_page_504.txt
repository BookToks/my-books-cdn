My friends and doctors told me that I would get better faster if I went to Matheran, so I went there. But the water in Matheran was very hard, which made my stay really hard. Because of the dysentery I had, the area around my bottom became very sore. I had painful cracks, and it hurt a lot when I went to the bathroom. This made me scared to eat anything. Before the week ended, I had to leave Matheran.

Shankarlal Banker took care of my health and told me to see Dr. Dalal. The doctor came, and I liked how quickly he made decisions. He said, "I can’t help you get better unless you drink milk. If you also take iron and arsenic injections, I promise you will get strong again." I said, "You can give me the injections, but I won’t drink milk. I have a promise that stops me."

The doctor asked, "What kind of promise is that?" I told him everything about my vow and why I made it. I said that I found out cows and buffaloes were treated badly to get milk, so I felt disgusted by milk. I also believed that milk is not a natural food for humans. That’s why I stopped drinking it. Kasturbai was standing near my bed and listening to all of this.

She said, "But you don’t mind goat’s milk, do you?" The doctor agreed and said, "If you drink goat’s milk, that will be enough for me." I gave in. I really wanted to live and take part in the Satyagraha fight, so I followed the exact words of my vow but not its full meaning. When I made the vow, I was thinking only about cow and buffalo milk, but it really meant all animal milk.
