Champaran is the land of King Janaka. It has many mango trees and used to have lots of indigo farms until 1917. The farmers in Champaran had to plant indigo on three out of every twenty parts of their land for their landlords. This was called the tinkathia system because three kathas out of twenty (which make one acre) had to be planted with indigo.

I must admit, I didn’t even know the name Champaran or where it was, and I didn’t really understand indigo farming. I had seen indigo packets but didn’t realize it was grown in Champaran by many farmers who worked very hard.

Rajkumar Shukla was one of these farmers who suffered a lot, and he wanted to help others like him who were having a hard time because of indigo farming.

He found me in Lucknow during the 1916 Congress meeting. He said, “Vakil Babu will tell you about our problems,” and asked me to visit Champaran. ‘Vakil Babu’ was Babu Brajkishore Prasad, who later became my important helper in Champaran. Rajkumar Shukla brought him to my tent. Brajkishore Babu wore a black coat and pants. At first, he didn’t impress me, and I thought he might be a lawyer taking advantage of the farmers. After hearing about Champaran from him, I said, “I can’t say anything without seeing for myself. Please ask the Congress to pass a resolution, but leave me free for now.” Rajkumar Shukla wanted the Congress to help. Babu Brajkishore Prasad made the resolution, showing support for Champaran’s people, and everyone agreed.

Rajkumar Shukla was happy but still wanted more help.
