‘CALLED’ – BUT THEN?

I didn’t talk about why I went to England before, which was to become a lawyer. Now, I want to explain it a little.

Before a student could officially become a lawyer, two things had to happen: 'keeping terms' and passing exams. 'Keeping terms' meant going to at least six dinners out of about twenty-four in a term, and twelve terms added up to about three years.

'Eating' didn’t mean actually eating the food. It meant showing up at the right time and staying for the whole dinner.

Most people did eat and drink the good food and wines provided. A dinner cost between two and six to three and six, which was about two to three rupees. This was not expensive because if you ate at a hotel, you’d pay that much just for the wine. In India, we were surprised that drinks cost more than food. At first, this shocked me, and I wondered how people could spend so much money on drinks.

Later, I understood why. I often didn’t eat at these dinners because the food was mostly bread, boiled potato, and cabbage. At first, I didn’t like these, so I didn’t eat them. Later, when I started to enjoy them, I also got brave enough to ask for other dishes.

The dinners for the teachers were better than the students’ dinners. A Parsi student who was also vegetarian and I asked if we could have the vegetarian dishes from the teachers’ dinners. They said yes, and we started getting fruits and other vegetables from their table.

Each group of four was allowed two bottles of wine. Since I didn’t drink, people wanted me in their group so the other three could share the two bottles. There was also a special ‘grand night’ each term when extra fancy wines, like champagne, port, and sherry, were served.
