I have rarely met anyone who loved the British Constitution as much as I did. Now I realize that my love for truth was the main reason for this loyalty.

I have never been able to fake loyalty or any other good quality. In Natal, the National Anthem was sung at every meeting I went to. I felt I had to join in singing too. I knew British rule had problems, but I thought it was mostly okay. Back then, I believed British rule was mostly good for the people it controlled.

The racism I saw in South Africa seemed very different from British traditions, and I thought it was only temporary and local. So, I tried to be as loyal to the British crown as the English people. I worked hard to learn the national anthem’s tune and sang it whenever it was played. Whenever there was a chance to show loyalty quietly, I joined in without making a big deal about it.

I never used this loyalty for my own benefit or to get anything for myself. For me, it was a duty, and I did it without expecting anything back.

When I got to India, people were preparing to celebrate Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee. I was asked to join the committee in Rajkot, and I said yes, but I suspected the celebrations would mostly be for show. I found a lot of fake excitement about the event, and it made me sad. I wondered if I should stay on the committee but decided to just do my part.

One idea was to plant trees. I noticed many people did it just to look good and please the officials. I told them that tree planting was not required, only suggested, and it should be done seriously or not at all. I think they laughed at me. I remember being serious when I planted my tree and carefully watered and took care of it.
