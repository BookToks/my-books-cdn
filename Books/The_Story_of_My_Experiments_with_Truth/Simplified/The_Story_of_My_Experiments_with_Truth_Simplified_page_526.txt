The railway station was packed with people from one end to the other. Everyone had come outside, excited and happy, like they were about to see a close family member after a long time. I stayed at the old Pandit Rambhaj Dutt's house, and Shrimati Sarala Devi had to take care of me. It was a big job because the place was always full of visitors.

Since the main leaders from Punjab were in jail, I found that Pandit Malaviyaji, Pandit Motilalji, and the late Swami Shraddhanandji had taken their place. I already knew Malaviyaji and Shraddhanandji well, but this was my first time meeting Motilalji closely. All these leaders, and some local ones who weren’t jailed, made me feel very welcome, so I never felt like a stranger.

We all agreed not to give evidence before the Hunter Committee. This decision was explained at the time, so I don’t need to repeat it. Looking back now, I still believe we made the right choice by boycotting the Committee.

Because we boycotted the Hunter Committee, we decided to create our own group to investigate things on behalf of the Congress. Pandit Motilal Nehru, the late Deshabandhu C. R. Das, Sjt. Abbas Tyabji, Sjt. M.R. Jayakar, and I were chosen for this group, mostly by Pandit Malaviyaji. We split up to visit different places for our inquiries. I had the job of organizing the group’s work, and since I visited the most places, I got a great chance to see the people and villages of Punjab up close.

While doing my inquiries, I also met many women in Punjab. It felt like we had known each other for a long time. Wherever I went, they came to me with lots of stories to tell.
