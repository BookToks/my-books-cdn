After winning that, we can think about other things. Right now, that one goal takes up all my time and energy. You could tell how much he respected Ranade all the time. Ranade’s word was final in every issue, and he mentioned it constantly. During my stay with Gokhale, we marked the anniversary of Ranade’s death (or maybe his birth—I can’t remember). Gokhale always observed this day.

Besides me, his friends Prof. Kathavate and a Sub-Judge were there. Gokhale invited us to join the celebration and shared memories of Ranade in his speech. He also talked about Ranade, Telang, and Mandlik. He praised Telang’s nice style and Mandlik’s importance as a reformer. He told a story about how once Mandlik missed his usual train but arranged a special one to reach court on time for his client. But Ranade, he said, was above them all—a true genius. He was not only a great judge but also a top historian, economist, and reformer. Even as a judge, he bravely joined the Congress, and everyone trusted his wise decisions without question. Gokhale was really happy as he described these wonderful qualities of his teacher.

Back then, Gokhale had a horse-carriage. I didn’t know why he needed it, so I asked, “Can’t you just use the tramcar to get around? Doesn’t riding a tramcar fit a leader better?” He looked a little hurt and said, “You don’t understand me! I don’t spend my Council money on myself. I wish I could ride the tramcar like you, but because I’m so well-known, it’s almost impossible for me to do that. People watch everything leaders do, and not everything is for comfort. I like your simple ways and live simply too, but some expenses are just necessary for someone like me.” He answered my question well, but there was one more complaint I had that he couldn’t fully explain to me.
