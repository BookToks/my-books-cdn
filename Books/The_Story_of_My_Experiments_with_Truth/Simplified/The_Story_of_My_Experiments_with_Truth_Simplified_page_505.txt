I knew it wasn’t right for me to drink milk at all because I believed milk isn’t natural for humans. But even knowing this, I agreed to drink goat’s milk. My will to live was stronger than my commitment to the truth. For once, I broke my own rule because I really wanted to join the Satyagraha fight. I still feel bad about this choice and keep thinking about how to stop drinking goat’s milk. But I can’t let go of the strongest temptation of all—the desire to help others—that still holds me back.

My experiments with diet are important to me because they are part of my studies on Ahimsa (nonviolence). They make me happy and give me something to enjoy. But drinking goat’s milk now bothers me more because it breaks my promise, not just because of diet or nonviolence. I think I understand the idea of truth better than Ahimsa, and my experience shows me that if I lose my grip on truth, I won’t be able to figure out Ahimsa.

The ideal of truth means that promises should be kept both in spirit and in action. In my case, I kept only the outside part of my promise but lost its true meaning inside, and that really bothers me. Even though I know this clearly, I don’t see an easy way forward. Maybe I just don’t have the courage to follow the right path. Both ideas are the same because doubt comes from a lack of faith. So I pray every day and night, “Lord, give me faith.”

Soon after I started drinking goat’s milk, Dr. Dalal successfully operated on me for fissures. As I healed, my will to live grew stronger, especially since I felt God had work planned for me.

I had just started feeling better when I read in the papers about the Rowlatt Committee’s report, which surprised me. Shankarlal Banker and Umar Sobani came to me, suggesting I should act quickly. About a month later, I went to Ahmedabad. I told Vallabhbhai, who visited me almost every day, about my worries.

“Something must be done,” I told him.
