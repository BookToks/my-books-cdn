He had almost finished studying at Grant Medical College but didn’t get his degree. Later, I found out he was part of the Brahmo Samaj. His name is Sjt. Kelkar, and he is a strong-willed and stubborn person. He really believes in ice treatment and wanted to try it on me. We jokingly called him the 'Ice Doctor.' He is sure he has found things that regular doctors missed. It’s too bad for both of us that he couldn’t make me fully believe in his method. I agree with some parts of his system, but I think he made some quick decisions.

Still, no matter how good his ideas were, I let him try his treatment on me. I didn’t mind the outside treatment. The treatment was putting ice all over my body. I can’t say if his treatment helped me a lot, but it did give me new hope and energy. My mind started to feel better, and that helped my body too. I got an appetite and could take short, gentle walks for five to ten minutes. Then he told me to change my diet. He said, ‘If you eat raw eggs, you’ll have more energy and get strong faster. Eggs are as safe as milk. They’re not meat. And not all eggs have babies in them. There are sterilized eggs you can buy.’ But I wasn’t ready to eat even the sterilized eggs. Still, I got better enough to be interested in public work again.
