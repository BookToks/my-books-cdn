"There is a surprise for you."  
"Now, what is this?" I asked. "You have to tell me what it is. How can I leave the office at this hour to go and see it?"  
"You will regret it if you don’t come. That is all I can say."  

I felt he was serious. I went home with a clerk and the cook, who walked ahead of us. He took me straight to the upper floor, pointed to my companion’s room, and said, "Open this door and see for yourself."  

I saw everything. I knocked on the door, but no one answered! I knocked harder to shake the walls. The door opened. I saw a prostitute inside. I told her to leave the house and never come back.  

To my companion, I said, "From now on, I want nothing to do with you. You have tricked me and made a fool of me. Is this how you repay my trust?"  

Instead of understanding, he threatened to tell others bad things about me.  

"I have nothing to hide," I said. "Tell whatever you want. But you must leave my house right now."  

This made him even angrier. I had no choice. So I told the clerk downstairs, "Please go and tell the Police Superintendent that someone living with me has behaved badly. I don’t want to keep him here, but he won’t leave. I would be grateful if the police could help me."  

This showed him I was serious. He felt guilty and scared. He said sorry, begged me not to call the police, and agreed to leave immediately, which he did.  

This event was a warning for me. Only now did I understand how badly I had been fooled by this bad person. By keeping him, I had chosen a wrong way to reach a good goal. I had hoped for something good but got something bad instead. I knew he was a bad character, but I still trusted him.
