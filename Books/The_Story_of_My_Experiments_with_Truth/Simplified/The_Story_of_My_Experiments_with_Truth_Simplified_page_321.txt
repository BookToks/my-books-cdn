Before I talk about other close European connections, I need to mention a few important things. One of these should be said right away. Just appointing Miss Dick wasn’t enough for what I needed. I needed more help. I had already mentioned Mr. Ritch in earlier chapters. I knew him well. He managed a business firm. He agreed with my idea to leave the firm and work under me, and he helped me a lot.

Around this time, Sjt. Madanjit came to me with an idea to start a newspaper called Indian Opinion and asked for my advice. He was already running a press, and I liked his idea. The newspaper started in 1904, and Sjt. Mansukhlal Nazar was the first editor. But I ended up doing most of the work and was almost always in charge of the paper.

It’s not that Sjt. Mansukhlal couldn’t run it. He had done some journalism in India, but he didn’t want to write about the complicated South African problems while I was there. He trusted my judgment and let me handle the important editorials. The paper has been a weekly since it started. At first, it was printed in Gujarati, Hindi, Tamil, and English. But I saw the Tamil and Hindi parts were just for show. They didn’t really help, so I stopped them because I felt it would be dishonest to keep them going.

I didn’t think I would have to spend any money on the paper, but I soon found out it couldn’t run without my financial support. Both Indians and Europeans knew that even though I wasn’t officially the editor, I was really responsible for running Indian Opinion. It wouldn’t have been a big deal if the paper was never started, but stopping it after it began would have been a loss and an embarrassment. So, I kept putting in my money until I was almost using all my savings to keep it going.
