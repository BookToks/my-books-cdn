The name 'Tapovan' felt a bit too fancy because, even though we cared about tapas (discipline), we didn’t think we were really tapasvins (people who live very strict lives). What mattered most to us was being devoted to the truth and always searching for it. I wanted to introduce the way I used in South Africa to India and see how well it could work here. So, my friends and I chose the name 'Satyagraha Ashram' because it showed both our goal and how we wanted to serve.

We needed rules to run the Ashram properly.

So, we made a first draft of these rules and asked friends to share their thoughts. One opinion I remember well came from Sir Gurudas Banerji. He liked the rules but said we should add humility as a rule because he thought young people didn’t have enough of it. I agreed but worried that if humility became a rule, it wouldn’t really be true humility anymore.

Real humility means putting yourself aside. Putting yourself aside is like moksha (freedom or salvation). You can’t just make it a rule, but there might be other rules that help you get there. If someone trying to reach moksha or serve others doesn’t have humility or selflessness, they don’t really want moksha or to serve. Serving without humility is just selfishness and ego.

At that time, there were about thirteen Tamilians with us. Five young Tamil people came with me from South Africa, and the others were from different parts of India. Altogether, we were about twenty-five men and women.

This is how the Ashram began. Everyone ate together in one kitchen and worked hard to live like one big family.
