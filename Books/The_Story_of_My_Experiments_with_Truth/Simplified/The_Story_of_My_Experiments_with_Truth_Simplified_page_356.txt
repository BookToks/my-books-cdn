The Zulu 'rebellion' was a new experience for me and made me think a lot. The Boer War didn’t show me how terrible war really is like this 'rebellion' did. This wasn’t really a war but more like a manhunt, not just to me but to many English people I talked to. Every morning, I heard soldiers’ guns firing like fireworks in quiet villages, and living through that was hard. But I accepted it, especially because my job was only to care for the wounded Zulus. I knew that without us, the Zulus wouldn’t have anyone to help them. This made me feel better.

There was a lot more to think about. The area had very few people. The small villages of the simple and so-called 'uncivilized' Zulus were spread out in hills and valleys. Walking through these quiet places, sometimes carrying the wounded, I often thought deeply.

I thought about brahmacharya and what it meant, and my beliefs grew stronger. I talked about it with my coworkers. I didn’t realize then how important brahmacharya was for really understanding yourself, but I saw clearly that anyone wanting to serve people with their whole heart couldn’t do it without brahmacharya. I understood that I would have many chances to serve like this, and I wouldn’t be able to do it well if I was busy with family life and raising children.

In short, I couldn’t live for both the body and the spirit at the same time. For example, I wouldn’t have been able to fully help if my wife was about to have a baby. Without brahmacharya, serving your family and serving the community don’t fit together. But with brahmacharya, they can work perfectly.

Thinking this, I felt a bit eager to take a final vow.
