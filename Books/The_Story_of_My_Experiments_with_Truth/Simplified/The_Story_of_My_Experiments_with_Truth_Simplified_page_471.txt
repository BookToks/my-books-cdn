I visited a small village nearby and saw some women wearing very dirty clothes. So, I asked my wife to find out why they didn’t wash their clothes. She talked to them. One woman took her inside her hut and said, "Look, there is no box or cupboard here with other clothes. The sari I’m wearing is the only one I have. How can I wash it? Tell Mahatmaji to get me another sari, and I promise I will bathe and wear clean clothes every day." This kind of hut was not just one example; many Indian villages had houses like this. In many homes in India, people live without furniture and without changing clothes, just covering themselves with a rag.

I want to share one more story. In Champaran, there is plenty of bamboo and grass. The school hut at Bhitiharva was made from these materials. One night, someone—maybe men from nearby plantations—set it on fire. So, they decided not to build another hut with bamboo and grass. The school was managed by Sjt. Soman and Kasturbai. Sjt. Soman chose to build a strong brick house. Because of his hard work, many people helped, and soon the brick school was ready. Now, no one worried about it being burned down.

Because of this, the volunteers with their schools, cleaning work, and medical help gained the trust and respect of the villagers. They were able to positively influence the people.

But I have to say sadly that I couldn’t make this good work last forever. The volunteers only stayed for short times. I couldn’t get more help from outside, and there were no permanent workers from Bihar. When my work in Champaran ended, other work called me away. Still, the few months I worked there made a strong impact, and you can still see its effects today.
