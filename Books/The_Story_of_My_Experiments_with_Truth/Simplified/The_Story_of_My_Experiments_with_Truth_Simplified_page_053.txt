I just kept wringing my hands. I felt really ashamed and miserable. I ran to my dad’s room. I realized that if I hadn’t been blinded by my feelings, I could have avoided the pain of being away from my dad during his last moments. I should have been taking care of him, and he would have died in my arms. But instead, it was my uncle who got to do that. He loved his older brother so much that he had the honor of being there for him at the end. My dad had a feeling he was going to die soon. He asked for pen and paper and wrote, "Prepare for the last rites." Then he took off his amulet and his gold necklace made of tulasi beads and threw them away. A little while later, he passed away.

The shame I mentioned before was about my selfish desire even when my dad was dying, a time when I should have been fully there for him. This is something I have never been able to forget or erase. Even though I loved my parents deeply and would have done anything for them, my love was weak because my mind was clouded by lust. That’s why I have always thought of myself as a lustful but faithful husband. It took me a long time to break free from lust, and I had to go through many tough experiences before I could control it.

Before I finish talking about this double shame, I want to say that the little baby my wife had only lived for three or four days. Nothing else could have been expected. Let everyone who is married learn from my example.
