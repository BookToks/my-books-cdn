Let anyone who wants to understand how strong my belief has become try out what I have done and see if they can feel the same way. I’ve come to believe even more that if I can do it, then a child can do it too, and I have good reasons for saying this. The tools needed to find the truth are simple but also hard to use. They might seem impossible to someone who is proud or even to a pure, innocent child. 

Someone who wants to find the truth needs to be humbler than dust. The world steps on dust without care, but a truth seeker should be so humble that even dust could step on them. Only then will they get a small glimpse of the truth. The conversation between Vasishtha and Vishvamitra makes this very clear. Christianity and Islam also show this idea clearly.

If anything I write here sounds proud, then that means something is wrong with my search and what I see is just an illusion. Even if hundreds like me fail, let the truth win. We shouldn’t lower the standards of truth by even a tiny bit just to excuse people like me who make mistakes.

I hope no one thinks the advice I give in the next chapters is the final word. The stories I tell are examples to help others try their own experiments based on what they want and can do. I believe these examples will be helpful because I won’t hide or soften any bad things I have to share. I want the reader to know all my mistakes and faults. My goal is to explain my experiments with Satyagraha, not to show how good I am. When judging myself, I will be as harsh as the truth, and I want others to be the same. Using that standard, I must say with Surdas: Where is there a person as bad and awful as me?

I have turned away from my Maker; I have been so unfaithful.
