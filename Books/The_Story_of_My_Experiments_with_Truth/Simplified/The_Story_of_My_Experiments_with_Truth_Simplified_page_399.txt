MINIATURE SATYAGRAHA

Even though I joined the war because I felt it was my duty, I couldn’t actually take part in it directly. Instead, I had to do what you might call a small version of Satyagraha during that important time.

I already said that once we were accepted and signed up, an officer was put in charge of our training. We all thought this officer would only be in charge of technical stuff, and that I would still be the leader when it came to discipline and other internal matters. In other words, the officer was supposed to work through me.

But from the start, the officer made it clear he wasn’t going to let us think that way.

Mr. Sorabji Adajania was a smart guy. He warned me, “Watch out for this man. He seems like he wants to boss us around. We won’t listen to his orders.

We’re okay with him being our teacher, but the young instructors he picked also act like they’re our bosses.” These young instructors were Oxford students who had come to teach us, and the officer had chosen them to be our section leaders.

I had noticed the officer’s bossy attitude too, but I told Sorabji not to worry and tried to calm him down. Still, Sorabji wasn’t easy to convince.

“You trust too much. These people will fool you with fancy words, and when you finally realize it, you’ll want us to protest with Satyagraha. But that will only cause trouble for you and all of us,” he said with a smile.

“What else can I expect after joining with you?” I replied. “A Satyagrahi is meant to be fooled sometimes. Let the officer trick us. Haven’t I told you many times that in the end, a liar only ends up tricking himself?” Sorabji laughed out loud.
