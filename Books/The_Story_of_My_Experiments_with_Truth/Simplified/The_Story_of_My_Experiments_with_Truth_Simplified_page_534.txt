His room looked like a free hotel for poor people. It was so crowded that you could barely walk from one side to the other. Visitors could come at any strange hour and spend as much time as they wanted with him. In one corner of the room was my simple bed, resting quietly.

But I can’t spend this chapter talking about how Malaviyaji lived. I need to get back to my main story.

Because of this, I was able to have daily talks with Malaviyaji. He kindly explained to me, like an older brother, the different opinions of the various groups. I realized I had to join in the discussions about the resolution on the reforms. Since I had helped write the Congress report on the problems in Punjab, I felt I needed to keep working on it. We also had to deal with the government about this. There was also the Khilafat issue. At that time, I believed Mr. Montagu would not betray India’s cause. The release of the Ali Brothers and other prisoners seemed like a good sign too. So, I thought the right choice was to accept the reforms, not reject them. But Deshabandhu Chittaranjan Das strongly believed the reforms were not good enough and should be rejected. The late Lokamanya was mostly neutral but planned to support whatever decision Deshabandhu approved.

The idea of disagreeing with such respected and experienced leaders was really hard for me. But my conscience was clear. I even tried to avoid the Congress and told Pandit Malaviyaji and Motilalji that it would be better if I stayed away for the rest of the session. That way, I wouldn’t have to openly disagree with such respected leaders.

But these two seniors did not agree with my idea.
