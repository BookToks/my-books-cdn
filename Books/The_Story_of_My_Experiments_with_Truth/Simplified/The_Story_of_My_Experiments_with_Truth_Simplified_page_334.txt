I became their banker. Lots of money came into my office. I couldn’t ask for any fees during such a crisis. I managed the work somehow. I knew my bank manager well and told him I needed to deposit this money with him. The banks didn’t want to take large amounts of copper and silver. People were also scared that bank workers might refuse to handle money from a plague area. But the manager helped me in every way. We decided to clean all the money before sending it to the bank. I think almost sixty thousand pounds were deposited. I told people with enough money to put it in fixed deposits, and they agreed. Some of them got used to saving their money in banks.

The people from the location were moved by special train to Klipspruit Farm near Johannesburg. The city paid for their food. This place, with tents everywhere, looked like a military camp. People not used to camp life were upset and surprised by the setup, but they didn’t have many problems. I used to ride my bike to visit them every day. Within a day, they forgot their troubles and started having fun. When I visited, I saw them singing and laughing. Staying outside in the fresh air for three weeks made them healthier.

As far as I remember, the location was burned down the day after everyone left. The city didn’t try to save anything from the fire. Around the same time, the city also burned all its wood in the market and lost about ten thousand pounds. They did this because they found some dead rats in the market.

The city had to spend a lot of money, but it stopped the plague from spreading. The city could finally breathe easy again.
