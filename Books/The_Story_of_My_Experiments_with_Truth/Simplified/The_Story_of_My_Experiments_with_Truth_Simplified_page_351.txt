I won’t say I didn’t care about my sons’ education in books and literature, but I did choose to give it less importance sometimes. My sons have reasons to be upset with me because of this. They have told me how they feel, and I admit I’m partly to blame. I wanted to teach them literature and even tried to do it myself, but there were always some problems. Since I didn’t arrange for any other private teachers, I made them walk with me every day to my office and back home—a total of about 5 miles. This helped us all get some exercise.

During these walks, I tried to teach them by talking to them, as long as no one else needed my attention. All my children except the oldest, Harilal, who stayed in India, grew up this way in Johannesburg. If I had been able to spend at least one hour every day teaching them literature regularly, I think they would have had a perfect education. But it’s sad for both them and me that I couldn’t give them enough literary learning. My oldest son has often shared how upset he is about this, both with me and in public. The other sons have forgiven me because they know it couldn’t be helped.

I’m not heartbroken about it, but I do regret not being an ideal father. Still, I believe I chose to give up their literary education to focus on what I thought was important service to the community. I’m sure I did everything needed to help build their character. I think every parent must make sure they do this well. When my sons didn’t do as well as they could have, I’m sure it wasn’t because I didn’t care, but because of flaws from both their parents.

Kids get their qualities from their parents, just like physical traits. The environment around them also matters, but the main things a child starts life with come from their ancestors. I’ve also seen kids overcome bad family traits, thanks to the natural goodness of their soul.

Polak and I often had strong arguments about whether it was a good idea to give children an English education or not.
