LAKSHMAN JHULA

It felt really good to arrive at the Gurukul and meet Mahatma Munshiramji, who was a big and strong man. Right away, I noticed how peaceful the Gurukul was compared to the loud and busy city of Hardwar.

The Mahatma showed me lots of kindness. The Brahmacharis (students) were all very attentive. It was here that I first met Acharya Ramadevji, and I could tell he was a powerful and strong person. Even though we didn’t always agree, we quickly became friends.

I had long talks with Acharya Ramadevji and other teachers about why it was important to add industrial training to the Gurukul. When it was time to leave, I felt really sad to go.

I had heard many good things about the Lakshman Jhula, a hanging bridge over the Ganges river near Hrishikesh. Many friends told me I shouldn’t leave Hardwar without visiting it. I wanted to walk there and did the trip in two parts.

Many sannyasis (holy men) came to see me at Hrishikesh. One of them liked me a lot. The Phoenix group was there too, and the Swami asked me many questions because of their presence.

We talked about religion, and he saw that I cared deeply about it. I was without a shirt and hat because I had just bathed in the Ganges. He felt sad that I didn’t have a shikha (a small tuft of hair) on my head or the sacred thread around my neck. He said, “It hurts me to see you, a Hindu believer, without these two important symbols of Hinduism. Every Hindu should wear them.” There’s a story about why I stopped wearing both. When I was about ten years old, I was jealous of the Brahman boys who tied bunches of keys to their sacred threads, and I wanted to do the same.
