It’s helpful to understand people and, if we can, learn from what they do for the future. It’s hard to know exactly how someone will act in a certain situation. Also, judging someone just by what they do on the outside isn’t always right because we don’t have enough information.

Anyway, getting ready to escape made me forget about my injuries. As the Superintendent suggested, I wore an Indian constable’s uniform and put a Madrasi scarf on my head, wrapped around a plate to act like a helmet.

Two detectives came with me. One dressed up as an Indian merchant, with his face painted to look Indian. I don’t remember what the other one wore. We went to a nearby shop through a side street and sneaked past the gunny bags stacked in the warehouse. Then we got out through the shop’s gate, pushed through the crowd, and reached a carriage waiting for me at the end of the street. We drove to the same police station where Mr. Alexander had offered me a safe place, and I thanked him and the detectives.

While I was escaping, Mr. Alexander kept the crowd busy by singing a song: “Hang old Gandhi on the sour apple tree.”

When he heard I had safely arrived at the police station, he told the crowd, “Well, your victim has escaped through a nearby shop. You should go home now.” Some people were angry, some laughed, and some didn’t believe him.

“Okay,” said the Superintendent, “If you don’t believe me, you can pick one or two people to come inside the house. If they find Gandhi, I’ll give him to you. But if they don’t, you have to leave. I’m sure you don’t want to destroy Mr. Rustomji’s house or hurt Gandhi’s wife and kids.” The crowd sent their representatives to search the house.
