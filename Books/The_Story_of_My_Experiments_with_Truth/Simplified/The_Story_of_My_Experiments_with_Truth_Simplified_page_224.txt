They came back soon with bad news, and the crowd finally broke up. Most people thought the Superintendent handled the situation well, but a few were still angry and upset.

Mr. Chamberlain, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies back then, sent a message asking the Natal Government to take legal action against the people who attacked me. Mr. Escombe called me, said he was sorry about my injuries, and said, "I don’t like even the smallest harm done to you. You had the right to follow Mr. Laughton’s advice and face the worst, but if you had listened to me, this wouldn’t have happened. If you can identify those who attacked you, I will arrest and charge them. Mr. Chamberlain wants me to do this too."

I answered, "I don’t want to prosecute anyone. I might know who some of them are, but what’s the point in punishing them? I don’t blame the attackers. They thought I had lied about white people in Natal when I spoke in India. If they believed those lies, it’s no surprise they got angry. The leaders and, if I may say, you are to blame. You could have guided the people better, but you believed Reuter and thought I was exaggerating. I don’t want to punish anyone. I’m sure that once the truth is clear, they will regret what they did."

Mr. Escombe said, "Could you write this down? I need to send it to Mr. Chamberlain. Don’t rush your answer—you can talk to Mr. Laughton and your friends before deciding. I must admit, if you choose not to press charges, it will really help me calm things down and improve your reputation."

I said, "Thank you."
