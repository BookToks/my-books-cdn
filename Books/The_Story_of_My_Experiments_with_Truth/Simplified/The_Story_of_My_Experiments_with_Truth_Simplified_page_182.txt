He could have been taken to a criminal court and sent to jail if the same thing happened again. That’s why Sir William Hunter said the indenture system was almost as bad as slavery. Like a slave, the indentured worker belonged to his master.

There were only two ways to free Balasundaram: either the Protector of Indentured Labourers canceled his contract or transferred him to someone else, or his employer let him go. I went to the employer and said, “I don’t want to punish you. I think you know you beat the man badly. I will be happy if you just transfer his contract to another employer.” He agreed quickly. Then I talked to the Protector, who also agreed but said I had to find a new employer first.

So I started looking for a new employer. It had to be a European because only Europeans could hire indentured workers. I didn’t know many Europeans then, but I met one who kindly agreed to take Balasundaram. I thanked him a lot. The magistrate found Balasundaram’s old employer guilty and noted that he promised to transfer the contract.

Balasundaram’s story spread to every indentured worker, and I became known as their friend. I was very happy about this. Soon, many indentured workers started coming to my office, and I got a good chance to learn about their happiness and struggles.

News about Balasundaram’s case even reached faraway Madras. Workers from different parts of the area who went to Natal heard about it through their fellow workers.

There was nothing unusual about the case itself, but having someone in Natal to support them and fight for their rights surprised the indentured workers and gave them hope.

I said Balasundaram came into my office holding his head-gear in his hand. This showed how sad and humiliating the situation was. I have already told the story of when I was asked to take off my turban.
