To meet Gokhale, I have to skip many memories of South Africa.

At the end of the Satyagraha struggle in 1914, Gokhale told me to go home through London. So, in July, Kasturbai, Kallenbach, and I sailed for England.

During Satyagraha, I started traveling third class. So, I booked third class tickets for this trip. But third class on this boat was very different from third class on Indian coastal boats or trains. Indian third class has hardly enough seats or beds and is not very clean. On the way to London, there was plenty of space and cleanliness, and the steamship company gave us special help.

The company gave us reserved cabin space, and since we only ate fruits and nuts, the steward was told to bring us those. Usually, third class passengers don’t get much fruit or nuts. These things made our eighteen days on the boat quite comfortable.

Some things that happened on the trip are worth sharing.

Mr. Kallenbach really liked binoculars and had a few expensive pairs. We talked about one of these every day. I told him that owning them didn’t fit with the simple life we wanted. One day, while we were standing by the cabin window, we had a serious talk.

“Instead of fighting over these, why not throw them into the sea and be done with it?” I said.

“Sure, throw those awful things away,” said Mr. Kallenbach.

“I mean it,” I said.

“So do I,” he quickly answered.

And then I threw them into the sea.
