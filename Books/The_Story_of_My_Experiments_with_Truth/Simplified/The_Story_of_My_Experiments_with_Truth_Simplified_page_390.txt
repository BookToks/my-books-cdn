TO MEET GOKHALE I must skip many of the recollections of South Africa.
 
 At the conclusion of the Satyagraha struggle in 1914, I received Gokhale's instructions to return home via London. So in July Kasturbai, Kallenbach and I sailed for England.
 
 During Satyagraha I had begun travelling third class. I therefore took third class passages for this voyage. But there was a good deal of difference between third class accommodation on the boat on this route and that provided on Indian coastal boats or railway trains. There is hardly sufficient sitting, much less sleeping, accommodation in the Indian service, and little cleanliness. During the voyage to London, on the other hand, there was enough room and cleanliness and the steamship company had provided special facilities for us.
 
 The company had provided reserved closet accommodation for us, and as we were fruitarians, the steward had orders to supply us with fruits and nuts. As a rule third class passengers get little fruit or nuts. These facilities made our eighteen days on the boat quite comfortable.
 
 Some of the incidents during the voyage are well worth recording. Mr.
 
 Kallenbach was very fond of binoculars, and had one or two costly pairs. We had daily discussions over one of these. I tried to impress on him that this possession was not in keeping with the ideal of simplicity that we aspired to reach. Our discussions came to a head one day, as we were standing near the porthole of our cabin.
 
 'Rather than allow these to be a bone of contention between us, why not throw them into the sea, and be done with them?' said I.
 
 'Certainly throw the wretched things away,' said Mr. Kallenbach.
 
 'I mean it,' said I.
 
 'So do I,' quickly came the reply.
