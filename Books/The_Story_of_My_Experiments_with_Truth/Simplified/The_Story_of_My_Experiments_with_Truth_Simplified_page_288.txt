They needed to hire new officers, and these experienced men were very helpful. Some of them were really clever and created a new department. This showed how good they were at solving problems. There was already a special department for Black people. So, they thought, why not have one for Asian people too? This idea seemed fair.

When I got to the Transvaal, the new department was already set up and growing. The officers who gave out permits to refugees could give them to everyone else, but for Asians, they needed approval from the new department. If permits were given based on this department's advice, it would make the permit officers' jobs easier. That’s what they said. But really, the new department wanted work to do, and the men wanted money. If there was no work, they wouldn’t need the department, so they made work for themselves.

The Indians had to apply to this department. They had to wait many days for an answer. Since many people wanted to return to the Transvaal, a group of middlemen and officers started cheating the poor Indians out of thousands of pounds. I heard that no permit could be gotten without connections, and sometimes people had to pay up to a hundred pounds, even if they tried to use their influence.

So, it looked like I had no way to get a permit. I went to my old friend, the Police Superintendent of Durban, and asked him to introduce me to the Permit Officer and help me get a permit. I told him I had lived in the Transvaal before. He quickly put on his hat, came outside, and got me a permit. There was hardly any time left before my train was about to leave.
