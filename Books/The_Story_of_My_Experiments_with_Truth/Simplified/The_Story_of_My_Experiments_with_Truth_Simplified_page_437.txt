People followed me even to the bathing ghat, and they didn’t leave me alone when I was eating. That’s when I realized in Hardwar how much my simple work in South Africa was known all over India.

But this was not a good situation to be in. I felt stuck between two bad options. Where no one knew me, I had to deal with the hard life that millions in this country face, like traveling by train. Where people knew me, they bothered me because they wanted to see me. I often couldn’t decide which was worse. At least the people who wanted to see me made me angry or sad sometimes. Traveling was hard but also made me feel better and almost never made me mad.

Back then, I was strong and could walk a lot. Luckily, not many people knew me, so I could still go out without causing a big fuss.

While I wandered around, I noticed more careless, fake, and messy behavior from the pilgrims than real devotion. The group of holy men there seemed to only want to enjoy the good things in life.

I even saw a cow with five feet! I was amazed, but smart people quickly explained it wasn’t real. The poor fifth foot was actually cut off from a live calf and attached to the cow’s shoulder! This cruel trick was used to fool people and take their money. Every Hindu would be drawn to a five-footed cow and would give money to such a “miracle” animal.

The day of the fair finally arrived. It was a very important day for me. I didn’t go to Hardwar like a pilgrim. I never thought of visiting holy places to be more religious. But the 1.7 million people there couldn’t all be fake or just tourists. I was sure many had come to earn good karma and to improve themselves.
