"But what can we do now?" he asked. I said, "If even a few men agree to resist, and the new law is passed anyway, we should start Satyagraha right away. If I weren’t sick, I would fight alone and hope others join me. But since I’m weak now, I don’t feel able to do it."

Because of this, we decided to have a small meeting with people connected to me. I thought the Rowlatt Committee’s suggestions were unfair based on their own report, and no proud people should accept them.

The meeting finally happened at the Ashram. Only about twenty people were invited. I remember Vallabhbhai, Shrimati Sarojini Naidu, Mr. Horniman, the late Mr. Umar Sobani, Sjt. Shankarlal Banker, and Shrimati Anasuyabehn were there.

At the meeting, we wrote the Satyagraha pledge, and everyone there signed it. I wasn’t editing a newspaper then, but I sometimes shared my thoughts in the daily news. I did the same this time. Shankarlal Banker took the protest seriously, and I saw how good he was at organizing and working hard.

Since I didn’t think any existing groups would try something new like Satyagraha, I helped start a new group called the Satyagraha Sabha. Most members were from Bombay, so we made that the center. Many people signed the pledge, we sent out bulletins, and held meetings everywhere, just like in the Kheda campaign.

I became the president of the Satyagraha Sabha. But I soon saw it would be hard to agree with the educated people in the group.
