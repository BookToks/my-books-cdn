“Well, then,” he said, “keep believing what you want. One day, your Satyagraha will get you killed and drag people like me down with you.” These words reminded me of what Miss Emily Hobhouse once wrote to me about non-cooperation: “I wouldn’t be surprised if one day you have to die for the truth. May God guide you and keep you safe.”

My talk with Sorabji happened just after the new Commanding Officer was appointed. In just a few days, things between us and him got really tense. I had just recovered from a fourteen-day fast when I started doing drills again, often walking about two miles to the training spot. This gave me pleurisy, and I got very sick. Even when I was sick, I had to go camping on the weekends. While the others stayed there, I went back home. That’s when a chance for Satyagraha came up.

The Commanding Officer began acting like he was in charge of everything. He made it clear that he was the boss, both for military and non-military things, and showed his power. Sorabji came to me fast. He wasn’t going to accept this bossy behavior. He said, “All orders should come through you. We’re still in training, but weird and unfair orders are being given. There are unfair differences between us and the young people who are teaching us.

We need to talk to the Commanding Officer or we can’t keep going. The Indian students and others in our group won’t follow silly orders. We started this for self-respect, so we can’t lose it.” I went to the Commanding Officer and told him about the complaints. He asked me to write them down and told me to make sure everyone knew the right way to complain was through their section leaders, who would tell the instructors, who would tell him.

I answered back that I wasn’t in charge like a military officer and was just a regular member. But since I was the Chairman of the Volunteer Corps, I thought I could unofficially speak for them.
