I wanted to learn about the lives of farmers in Champaran and understand their problems with the indigo planters. To do this, I needed to meet thousands of the farmers. But before starting, I thought it was important to hear the planters’ side too, so I met with the Commissioner of the area and the Planters' Association.

The Secretary of the Planters' Association told me I was an outsider and had no right to get involved between the planters and their tenants. He said if I had any complaints, I should write them down. I politely told him I wasn’t an outsider and that I had every right to ask about the tenants’ problems if they wanted me to.

When I met the Commissioner, he tried to scare me and told me to leave Tirhut immediately.

I told my team about this and said that the Government might try to stop me from going further. If I was going to be arrested, it would be better if it happened in Motihari or Bettiah. So, I decided to go to those places as soon as possible.

Champaran is a district in the Tirhut division, and Motihari is its main town.

Rajkumar Shukla lived near Bettiah, and the tenants around there were the poorest in the district.

Rajkumar Shukla wanted me to meet those tenants, and I really wanted to do that too.

So, I started for Motihari with my team the same day. Babu Gorakh Prasad let us stay at his home, which was so crowded it felt like a hotel. That very day, we heard that a tenant about five miles from Motihari had been badly treated. We decided that the next morning I would go see him with Babu Dharanidhar Prasad. We traveled there on an elephant. By the way, elephants are as common in Champaran as bullock-carts are in Gujarat.
