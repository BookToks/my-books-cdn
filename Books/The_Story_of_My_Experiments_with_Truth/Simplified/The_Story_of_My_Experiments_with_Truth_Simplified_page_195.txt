Let me finish telling you about my trip. I want to introduce you to the Captain of the SS Poongola. We became friends. The Captain was a Plymouth Brother. We talked more about spiritual things than about sailing. He made a clear difference between right and wrong and faith.

To him, the Bible was very easy to understand. Its beauty was in how simple it was.

He would say that everyone—men, women, and kids—should have faith in Jesus and his sacrifice, and then their sins would be forgiven. This friend reminded me of another Plymouth Brother I knew in Pretoria. He didn’t like any religion that had strict moral rules. 

My vegetarian food started this whole talk. He asked why I shouldn’t eat meat or beef. Didn’t God make animals for people to enjoy, just like plants? These questions led us into a religious debate.

We couldn’t change each other’s minds. I believed that religion and morality were the same. The Captain strongly believed the opposite.

After twenty-four days, the nice trip ended. I enjoyed the beauty of the Hooghly River and got off the ship in Calcutta. That same day, I took a train to Bombay.
