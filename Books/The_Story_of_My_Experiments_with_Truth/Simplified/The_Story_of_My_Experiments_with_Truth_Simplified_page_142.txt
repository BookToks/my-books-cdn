The incident was a nice surprise for him, but he warned me, "I will be thankful if you get to Pretoria safely. I’m worried the guard won’t leave you alone in first class, and even if he does, the other passengers won’t."

I sat down in a first class compartment, and the train started moving. At Germiston, the guard came to check tickets. He got angry when he saw me there and told me with his finger to go to third class. I showed him my first class ticket. He said, "That doesn’t matter. Move to third class."

There was only one English passenger in the compartment. He stood up for me. "Why are you bothering this gentleman?" he asked the guard. "Can’t you see he has a first class ticket? I don’t mind him sitting with me at all." Then he said to me, "You should stay right where you are and be comfortable."

The guard mumbled, "If you want to travel with a coolie, that’s your problem," and walked away.

Around eight o’clock in the evening, the train arrived in Pretoria.
