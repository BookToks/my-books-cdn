The three communities, instead of being friends and loving each other, seemed to be fighting. The country didn’t know how to use the memorial fund.

Another skill I had that the Congress could use was drawing up plans and documents. The Congress leaders knew I was good at writing clearly and briefly because I had practiced a lot. The old Congress rules were made by Gokhale. He had created some rules to help run the Congress. I had even heard the story of how he made these rules from Gokhale himself. But now, everyone felt those rules weren’t enough for the growing work of the Congress. This question had come up every year.

At that time, the Congress had almost no system working between its meetings or to handle new problems during the year. The rules said there should be three secretaries, but only one actually worked, and he didn’t work full-time. How could one person run the Congress office, plan for the future, and handle the Congress’s past promises? That year, everyone knew this problem was very important. The Congress was too big and messy to discuss public issues well. There was no limit on how many delegates could come from each province. Everyone felt it was necessary to fix this confusing situation.

I agreed to take on the job of making a new constitution, but I had one condition. I knew two leaders, Lokamanya and Deshabandhu, were very popular with the people. I asked that they, as the people’s representatives, be part of the committee making the constitution. Since they were very busy and couldn’t work on it themselves, I suggested that two people they trusted join me on the committee. I also said the committee should only have three people. Lokamanya and Deshabandhu agreed and suggested the two people to join me.
