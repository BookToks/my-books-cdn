During this strike, I got to know Sjts. Vallabhbhai Patel and Shankarlal Banker very well. I already knew Shrimati Anasuyabai before this.

Every day, the strikers met under a tree by the Sabarmati river. Thousands of people came to these meetings. I gave speeches reminding them about their promise and the need to stay peaceful and keep their pride. Every day, they walked through the city in peaceful groups, carrying a banner that said 'Ek-Tek' (which means keep the promise).

The strike lasted for twenty-one days. While it was happening, I talked with the mill owners several times and asked them to be fair to the workers. They would say, "We have our promise too. We see the workers like our own children. Why should a third person get involved? Thereâ€™s no need for outside help to solve this."
