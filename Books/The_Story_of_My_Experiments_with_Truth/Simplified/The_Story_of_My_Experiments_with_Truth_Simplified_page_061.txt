“No help can be given to you now,” he said as he quickly went upstairs. I had planned everything carefully to meet him. I had memorized a few sentences and bowed low, saluting him with both hands. But it didn’t work at all!

I thought about my wife’s jewelry. I also thought about my older brother, who I trusted completely. He was very kind and loved me like his own son.

I came back to Rajkot from Porbandar and told everyone what had happened. I talked to Joshiji, who said I should borrow money if needed. I said we could sell my wife’s jewelry to get two or three thousand rupees. My brother promised to find the money somehow.

But my mother still didn’t want me to go. She had started asking small questions. Someone told her young men got lost in England. Someone else said they all ate meat, and another said they couldn’t live there without drinking alcohol. “What about all this?” she asked me. I said, “Will you not trust me? I won’t lie to you. I swear I won’t touch any of those things. If there was danger, would Joshiji let me go?” She said, “I can trust you, but how can I trust you so far away? I’m confused and don’t know what to do. I will ask Becharji Swami.” Becharji Swami used to be a Modh Bania but had become a Jain monk.

He was like a family advisor too, like Joshiji. He helped me and said, “I will make the boy take three promises seriously, then he can go.” He gave me the oath, and I promised not to drink alcohol, not to be with women, and not to eat meat. After that, my mother said yes.

The high school had a farewell party for me. It was rare for a young man from Rajkot to go to England. I had written a short thank-you speech.

But I could barely say the words. I remember feeling dizzy and my whole body shaking as I stood to speak.

With the blessings of my family, I left for Bombay. This was my first trip from Rajkot to Bombay. My brother came with me. But there is many a slip ‘twixt the cup and the lip. I faced some problems in Bombay.
