When I arrived in Durban in January 1897, I had three children with me, my sister's son who was ten, and my own sons who were nine and five. I wondered where I could send them to school.

I could have sent them to schools for European children, but only as a special favor. No other Indian kids were allowed there. There were schools run by Christian missions for Indian kids, but I didn’t want to send my children there because I didn’t like how they taught. They mostly taught in English or sometimes in bad Tamil or Hindi, and even that was hard to arrange. I couldn’t accept these problems. So, I tried to teach them myself, but that was not regular, and I couldn’t find a good Gujarati teacher.

I was really stuck. I put an ad looking for an English teacher who would teach the kids under my supervision. This teacher would give some regular lessons, and I would teach them the rest when I could. I hired an English governess for £7 a month.

This went on for a while, but I wasn’t happy. The boys learned some Gujarati from talking with me, since I always spoke to them in our language. I didn’t want to send them back to India because I thought young kids shouldn’t be separated from their parents. Kids learn a lot just by living in a good home, and that’s not possible in hostels. So, I kept my children with me. I did send my nephew and older son to live and study in schools in India for a few months, but I had to bring them back soon.

Later, when my eldest son was grown up, he left me and went to India to join a high school in Ahmedabad. I think my nephew was happy with what I taught him. Sadly, he died young after a short illness. The other three sons never went to public schools, but they did get some regular lessons in a small school I started for the children of Satyagraha supporters in South Africa.
