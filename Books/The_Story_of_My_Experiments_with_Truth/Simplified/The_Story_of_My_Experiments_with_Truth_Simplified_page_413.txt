But the judges kept interrupting him because they thought the mistake was just a small slip that could be fixed easily. The lawyer tried hard to argue against the decision, but the judge who was suspicious at first had now fully agreed with me.

"Imagine if Mr. Gandhi hadn’t admitted the mistake, what would you have done?" he asked.

"It was impossible for us to find a more skilled and honest expert accountant than the one we chose," I replied. "The Court has to believe you know your own case best. If you can't show anything more than a simple slip that any expert accountant might make, the Court won’t want to force the parties into new legal battles and extra costs just because of an obvious mistake. We may not order a new hearing if such an error can be easily fixed," the judge added.

So, the lawyer’s objection was rejected. The Court either confirmed the decision with the error fixed or told the arbitrator to fix it—I don’t remember which.

I was very happy. So were my client and the senior lawyer. This made me sure that it’s possible to practice law without giving up on honesty.

But the reader should remember that even being truthful in this job can’t fix the basic problem that ruins it.
