Balasundaram’s case made me learn about the indentured Indians. But what made me really study their situation was the plan to tax them heavily.

In 1894, the Natal Government wanted to make indentured Indians pay £25 tax every year. This surprised me a lot. I brought this up at the Congress, and we quickly decided to fight against it.

First, I should explain where this tax idea came from.

Around 1860, Europeans in Natal saw that sugar-cane farming was growing. They needed workers because the local Natal Zulus couldn’t do this kind of work.

So, the Natal Government asked the Indian Government for permission to bring Indian workers. These workers had to sign a contract to work in Natal for five years. After that, they could stay and own land. This was the deal to encourage the Indians to come.

But the Indians did much more than expected. They grew lots of vegetables, brought new kinds from India, and made local vegetables cheaper to grow. They also introduced mango trees.

They didn’t just farm. They started businesses, bought land, and many went from being workers to landowners. Traders from India came too, like Sheth Abubakar Amod, who built a big business.

The white traders got worried.
