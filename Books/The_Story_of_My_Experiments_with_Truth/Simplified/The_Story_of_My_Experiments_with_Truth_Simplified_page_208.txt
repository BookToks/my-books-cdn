Bhandarkar welcomed me like a caring father. It was noon when I went to see him.

He really liked that I was meeting people at that busy time. He also agreed with me about having someone not involved in politics as the president of the meeting. He said, “That’s it, that’s it.” After listening to me, he said, “Everyone knows I don’t do politics. But I can’t say no to you. Your reason is strong and you work hard, so I will help with your meeting. You did well to ask Tilak and Gokhale. Please tell them I’m happy to be the president of the meeting held by the two groups. You don’t need to ask me about the time. Any time that works for them works for me.” Then he said goodbye and wished me well.

Without any fuss, this smart and dedicated group in Poona had a meeting in a simple little place. They made me feel happy and more sure about my goal.

Next, I went to Madras. People were very excited there. The Balasundaram case made a big impact on the crowd. I gave a long speech, and everyone listened carefully. After the meeting, many people wanted the “Green Pamphlet.” I printed a second, better version with 10,000 copies. They sold out fast, but I realized I had printed too many. I was too excited and thought more people would want it. My speech was for English speakers, and in Madras, not that many people spoke English well enough to buy all 10,000.

The biggest help came from the late Sjt. G. Parameshvaran Pillay, editor of The Madras Standard. He understood the issue well and often invited me to his office to guide me. Sjt. G. Subrahmaniam of The Hindu and Dr. Subrahmaniam were also very supportive. But Sjt. G. Parameshvaran Pillay gave me full access to publish in The Madras Standard, and I used that opportunity freely.
