KUMBHA MELA

I next went to Rangoon to meet Dr. Mehta, and on my way I stopped in Calcutta.

I stayed as a guest of the late Babu Bhupendranath Basu. The Bengali hospitality was amazing. At that time, I only ate fruit, so they got all the fruits and nuts available in Calcutta for me. The women of the house stayed up all night peeling nuts. They took great care to prepare fresh fruit in the Indian way. They also made many special dishes for my friends, including my son Ramdas. Although I appreciated their kindness, I felt bad that the whole family was so busy taking care of just a few guests. But I didn’t know how to avoid this kind of attention.

On the boat to Rangoon, I traveled on the deck. While the attention at Basu’s house was too much, on the boat we got almost no attention at all, even basic care for deck passengers was missing. The bathroom was dirty, and the toilets were disgusting.

To use the toilet, you had to step through urine and waste or jump over it.

It was more than I could handle. I asked the Chief Officer for help, but nothing changed. The passengers made the place even worse by spitting where they sat and throwing food scraps, tobacco, and betel leaves everywhere. It was very noisy, and everyone tried to take up as much space as possible. Their luggage took more room than they did. We had two very hard days.

When we reached Rangoon, I wrote to the Steamship Company’s Agent to tell him everything. Thanks to my letter and Dr. Mehta’s help, the return trip was still on the deck but much less terrible.

In Rangoon, my fruit-only diet caused more trouble for my host. But since Dr. Mehta’s home felt like my own, I was able to keep the meals simple.
