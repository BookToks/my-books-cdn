As his nurse, I often got to listen to these talks.

All these things made me learn to accept all religions. But back then, Christianity was different.

I actually didn’t like it. There was a reason for that. Christian missionaries used to stand near the high school and speak badly about Hindus and their gods. I couldn’t stand listening to it. I must have heard them only once, but that was enough to stop me from going back. Around the same time, I heard about a famous Hindu who became a Christian. People said that when he was baptized, he had to eat beef and drink alcohol, change his clothes, and start wearing European-style clothes and a hat. This really upset me. I thought, how can a religion that forces you to eat beef, drink alcohol, and change your clothes be a good religion? I also heard that the new Christian was now criticizing his old religion, customs, and country. All this made me dislike Christianity.

Even though I learned to accept different religions, I didn’t really believe in God. Around this time, I found a book called Manusmriti in my father’s collection. The stories about creation and other things didn’t impress me; instead, they made me lean more toward not believing in God.

I had a cousin whose intelligence I respected a lot.

I asked him about my doubts, but he couldn’t answer them. He told me, “When you grow up, you will be able to solve these doubts yourself. These questions are too big for your age.” I was quiet but not happy. Some parts of Manusmriti about diet didn’t match what I saw people doing every day. When I asked about this, he gave me the same answer. So, I told myself that maybe with more reading and a better mind, I would understand it later.

At that time, Manusmriti didn’t teach me about non-violence. I have already shared my story about eating meat. Manusmriti seemed to support eating meat. I also thought it was okay to kill snakes, bugs, and similar creatures.
