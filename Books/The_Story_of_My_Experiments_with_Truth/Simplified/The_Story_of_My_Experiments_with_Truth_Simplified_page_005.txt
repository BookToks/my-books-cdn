He gave us a sure way to know what the right thing to do is: “Whenever you’re unsure, or when you feel too focused on yourself, try this test: Think about the poorest and weakest person you’ve seen, and ask yourself if what you want to do will help them. Then you will stop doubting and worrying only about yourself.”

Gandhiji strongly believed in democracy. He said that real democracy can only happen through non-violence and people working together naturally. “Democracy’s spirit can’t be forced from outside; it has to come from inside.” He dreamed of a ‘world group’ built on honesty and respect between countries. While he worked hard for India’s freedom and growth, he didn’t want India to be completely alone. He wanted every country to learn good things from others, but still keep their own unique identity. As he said, “I don’t want my house to be closed off or my windows blocked; I want the cultures from all over the world to flow through my house freely; but I won’t be knocked over by any of them.” So, it’s right to celebrate the 100th birthday of someone who lived every moment for the good of all people and showed us important rules for how to live.

In the unforgettable words of Pandit Nehru, “The light that has shone on this country for many years will keep shining for many more, and even a thousand years from now, that light will still be seen here and the world will notice it. It will comfort countless hearts.” “Because that light meant more than just now; it showed the eternal truth, reminding us to follow the right path and step away from mistakes.” And as Dr. Albert Einstein said with feeling, “Future generations might hardly believe that someone like this really lived on earth.” To honor Gandhi’s 100th birthday, the Navajivan Trust, which Gandhi started 50 years ago, has decided to publish The Selected Works of Mahatma Gandhi in five books, so the message of truth and kindness can reach millions in India and around the world.
