I knew it was important to learn about books too, so I started some classes with help from Mr. Kallenbach and Sjt. Pragji Desai. I also didn’t forget how important it was to keep the body strong. The kids got that from their daily work. There were no servants on the Farm, so everyone had to do all the jobs, from cooking to cleaning. There were lots of fruit trees to take care of and plenty of gardening to do.

Mr. Kallenbach liked gardening and had some experience from a government garden. Everyone, young and old, who wasn’t working in the kitchen had to spend some time gardening. The kids did most of this work, like digging holes, cutting wood, and carrying heavy things. This gave them plenty of exercise. They enjoyed the work, so they usually didn’t need extra games or sports. Of course, some kids sometimes tried to avoid work or pretend to be sick.

Sometimes I let their tricks slide, but other times I was strict. I think they didn’t like when I was strict, but they never really fought back. When I was strict, I explained to them that it wasn’t right to fool around when you had work to do. Still, they would soon stop and go play again. Even so, we got along, and the kids grew up strong and healthy. Almost no one got sick on the Farm. I think fresh air, clean water, and regular meals helped a lot.

About learning skills, I wanted every kid to learn a useful trade. Mr. Kallenbach went to a monastery and learned how to make shoes. I learned from him and taught anyone who wanted to learn. Mr. Kallenbach also knew some carpentry, and another person there did too, so we had a small class on that. Almost all the kids knew how to cook.

All of this was new to them.
