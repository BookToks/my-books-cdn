On the way to Pretoria, I met some Christian Indians living in Durban. Mr. Paul, the Court Interpreter, was a Roman Catholic. I got to know him and also met the late Mr. Subhan Godfrey, who was a teacher for the Protestant Mission and the father of James Godfrey. James visited India in 1924 as part of the South African Deputation. Around the same time, I also met the late Parsi Rustomji and the late Adamji Miyakhan. These friends hadn’t met each other before except for business, but later they became close.

While I was meeting new people, the firm got a letter from their lawyer. The letter said they needed to get ready for the case and that Abdulla Sheth should go to Pretoria himself or send someone in his place.

Abdulla Sheth gave me the letter to read and asked if I would go to Pretoria. I said, “I can only decide after I understand the case from you.” At first, I didn’t know what I was supposed to do there. So, he asked his clerks to explain the case to me.

When I started studying the case, I felt like I needed to start from the very basics. A few days earlier in Zanzibar, I had gone to the court to watch a Parsi lawyer question a witness about credit and debit entries in account books. It was all confusing to me. I had never learned bookkeeping in school or while I was in England. The case I came to South Africa for was mostly about accounts. Only someone who understood accounts could explain it.

The clerk kept talking about debits and credits, and I got more and more confused. I didn’t know what a P. Note was, and I couldn’t find it in the dictionary. I told the clerk I didn’t understand, and he explained that a P. Note meant a promissory note. I bought a book about bookkeeping and studied it. That helped me feel more confident. I started to understand the case. I saw that Abdulla Sheth, even though he didn’t know bookkeeping, had so much practical knowledge that he could quickly figure out complicated bookkeeping problems.
