"Well then, will you argue the case? I am not ready to argue it the way you want," the senior lawyer answered firmly.  

I replied politely, "If you won’t argue, then I’m ready to do it, if our client agrees. But I won’t be part of the case if the mistake isn’t admitted."  

I looked at my client. He seemed a little uncomfortable. I had been working on the case from the start. The client trusted me completely and knew me well. He said, "Okay, you will argue the case and admit the mistake. Let’s lose if that has to happen. God protect what is right."  

I was very happy. I expected nothing less from him. The senior lawyer warned me again, felt sorry for my stubbornness, but still congratulated me.  

What happened in the court will be told in the next chapter.
