This love and trust helped me a lot in my public work.

I have said before that my goal in working in South Africa was to help the community. To do this, it was very important to earn the trust of the people. The kind Indians valued professional work done for money, and when I told them to be ready to go to jail for their rights, many agreed happily. They did this not just because they thought it was the right thing, but because they trusted and cared for me.

As I write this, many happy memories come to my mind. Hundreds of clients became friends and real partners in public work, and being with them made my life better, even though it was often hard and dangerous.
