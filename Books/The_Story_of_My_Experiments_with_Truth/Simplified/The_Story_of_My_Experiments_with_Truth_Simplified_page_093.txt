Once I started, I couldn't stop. One time, they took me to Madame Blavatsky Lodge and introduced me to Madame Blavatsky and Mrs. Besant. Mrs. Besant had just joined the Theosophical Society, and I was very interested in the talks about her joining. My friends told me to join the Society too, but I politely said no, “I don’t know enough about my own religion to join another.” I remember reading Madame Blavatsky’s book called Key to Theosophy because my brothers suggested it. This book made me want to read more about Hinduism and helped me see that Hinduism wasn’t full of superstitions like the missionaries said.

Around the same time, I met a kind Christian from Manchester at a vegetarian boarding house. He talked to me about Christianity. I told him stories from my time in Rajkot. He felt sorry to hear them. He said, “I’m a vegetarian and don’t drink alcohol. Many Christians eat meat and drink, but the Bible doesn’t actually say you have to. Please read the Bible.” I agreed, and he gave me a copy. I think he used to sell Bibles. I bought one that had maps and other helpful parts. I started reading it, but I couldn’t finish the Old Testament. I read Genesis, but it was so boring it made me sleepy. Just so I could say I read it, I struggled through the rest without much interest or understanding. I especially didn’t like the book of Numbers.

But the New Testament felt different, especially the Sermon on the Mount, which really touched me. I compared it to the Gita. The verses, “But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man take away thy coat let him have thy cloke too,” made me very happy. They reminded me of Shamal Bhatt’s saying, “For a bowl of water, give a goodly meal,” and others like that. My young mind tried to bring together the lessons from the Gita, the Light of Asia, and the Sermon on the Mount.
