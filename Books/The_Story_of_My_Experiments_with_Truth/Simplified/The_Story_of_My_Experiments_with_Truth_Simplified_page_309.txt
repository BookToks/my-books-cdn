A FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION

Now, let's talk about the Asiatic Department.

Johannesburg was where the Asiatic officers were strongest. I noticed that instead of protecting Indians, Chinese, and others, these officers were actually treating them badly. Every day, I heard complaints like this: "The people who should be allowed in are not, but others without the right pay £100 to get in. If you don’t fix this, who will?" I agreed with them. If I couldn’t stop this, living in the Transvaal would be pointless.

So, I started collecting proof. Once I had enough, I went to the Police Commissioner. He seemed fair. Instead of ignoring me, he listened carefully and asked to see all my evidence. He checked the witnesses himself and was convinced, but he knew it would be hard to get a white jury in South Africa to punish white officers for crimes against colored people. "But," he said, "we have to try. We can’t just let these criminals go free because the jury might not convict them. I will make sure they get arrested. I promise I will do everything I can." I didn’t need the promise. I suspected many officers, but only had enough proof to arrest two of them.

People always knew where I was going because I visited the Police Commissioner almost every day. The two officers who were wanted had spies who watched my office and told the others what I was doing. Honestly, these officers were so bad they didn’t have many spies. Without help from the Indians and Chinese, they would never have been arrested.

One of the officers ran away. The Police Commissioner got a warrant to bring him back, and he was arrested and brought to Transvaal. They were both put on trial. Even though there was strong proof against them, and the jury knew one had run away, both were found not guilty and set free.
