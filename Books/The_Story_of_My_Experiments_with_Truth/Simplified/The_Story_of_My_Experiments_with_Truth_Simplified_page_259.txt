I read it shaking.

Gokhale agreed with it.

"Everyone agrees," everyone shouted.

"You will have five minutes to talk about it, Gandhi," said Mr. Wacha.

I didn’t like how things were done. No one had taken the time to understand the resolution. Everyone just wanted to finish quickly. Since Gokhale had seen it, no one else thought they needed to read or understand it!

The next morning, I worried about my speech. What could I say in five minutes? I had prepared, but the words wouldn’t come. I decided not to read from a paper but to speak without notes. But the confidence I had in South Africa was gone for now.

When it was my turn, Mr. Wacha called my name. I stood up, feeling dizzy. I managed to read the resolution. Someone had printed a poem praising people moving abroad and gave copies to the delegates. I read the poem and talked about the problems settlers in South Africa faced. Suddenly, Mr. Wacha rang a bell. I thought I hadn’t spoken for five minutes yet. I didn’t know the bell meant I had two minutes left. Others spoke for half an hour or more without a bell. I felt hurt and sat down when the bell rang. But I thought the poem answered Sir Pherozeshah.

There was no doubt the resolution would pass. Back then, visitors and delegates were almost the same. Everyone raised their hand, and all resolutions passed easily. My resolution did too, so it didn’t feel very important to me. But still, the fact that the Congress passed it made me very happy. Knowing the whole country’s main group agreed was enough to make anyone proud.
