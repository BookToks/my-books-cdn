I had two sons who were born in South Africa, and my time working in the hospital helped me figure out how to raise them. I was always independent, which sometimes caused problems. My wife and I wanted the best medical help when she gave birth, but what if the doctor or nurse wasn’t there when we needed them? Also, the nurse had to be Indian, and finding a trained Indian nurse in South Africa was very hard, just like it was in India. So, I learned everything needed for a safe birth. I read a book called "Advice to a Mother" by Dr. Tribhuvandas, and I took care of my kids by following the book’s advice, adding what I learned from other experiences.

We used a nurse’s help, but only for about two months each time, mostly to help my wife, not to take care of the babies. I took care of the babies myself.

When my last child was born, it was really tough. The labor started suddenly. The doctor wasn’t there right away, and it took time to get the midwife. Even if she had been there, she couldn’t have helped with the birth. I had to make sure the baby was born safely. My careful reading of Dr. Tribhuvandas’ book helped me a lot. I stayed calm and wasn’t scared.

I believe parents should know how to care for and take care of babies. I’ve seen how useful my careful studying has been. My children are healthy now because I learned and used that knowledge. Many people think babies don’t learn anything in the first five years, but that’s wrong. Babies learn more in those first five years than ever after. Learning starts even before the baby is born.

The parents’ physical and mental health when the baby is made affects the baby. During pregnancy, the baby is also affected by the mother’s feelings, moods, wants, and how she lives her life.
