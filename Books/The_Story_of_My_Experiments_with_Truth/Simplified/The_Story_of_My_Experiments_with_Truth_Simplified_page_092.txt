Near the end of my second year in England, I met two brothers who were Theosophists and not married. They talked to me about the Gita. They were reading Sir Edwin Arnold's translation called The Song Celestial and invited me to read the original with them. I felt embarrassed because I hadn’t read the divine poem in either Sanskrit or Gujarati. I told them honestly that I hadn’t read the Gita, but I was happy to read it with them. Even though my Sanskrit was weak, I hoped I could understand enough to see where the translation didn’t show the real meaning.

I started reading the Gita with them. The verses in the second chapter hit me hard: If you think too much about things you see, you start to want them; wanting turns into strong desire; desire becomes passion; passion makes you careless; then your memory fails, your good intentions disappear, and your mind and yourself fall apart.

These words stuck in my mind and I still remember them clearly. The book felt like something very precious. Over time, I grew to see it as the best book for understanding the Truth. It helped me a lot when I was feeling sad. I have read almost all the English versions, and I think Sir Edwin Arnold’s is the best. He stayed true to the original, but it doesn’t even feel like a translation. Even though I read it with my friends, I can’t say I really studied it then. It was only years later that I made it a daily reading habit.

The brothers also suggested another book by Sir Edwin Arnold called The Light of Asia. Before that, I only knew him as the author of The Song Celestial. I read The Light of Asia with even more interest than the Bhagavadgita.
