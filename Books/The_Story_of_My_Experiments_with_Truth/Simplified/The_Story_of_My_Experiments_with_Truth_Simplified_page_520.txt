**A HIMALAYAN MISCALCULATION**

Right after the Ahmedabad meeting, I went to Nadiad. It was there that I first said "Himalayan miscalculation," a phrase that later became very popular. Even at Ahmedabad, I had started to realize I might have made a mistake. But when I reached Nadiad and saw the situation for myself, and heard that many people from Kheda district had been arrested, I suddenly understood that I had made a big error by asking people in Kheda and other places to start civil disobedience too early.

I was speaking at a public meeting. When I admitted my mistake, many people made fun of me. But I never regretted telling the truth. I believe that to be fair, you have to look at your own mistakes carefully and honestly, but be more forgiving when judging others. I think this is very important for anyone who wants to be a true Satyagrahi (a person who follows nonviolent resistance).

Let’s talk about what the Himalayan miscalculation actually was. Before someone can start civil disobedience, they must first willingly and respectfully obey the laws of the state. Most of the time, people obey laws because they are afraid of getting punished, especially laws that don’t involve important moral issues.

For example, a good and honest person won’t suddenly start stealing whether there is a law against it or not. But that same person might not care about rules like having bike lights on at night. They might not even listen if someone tells them to be more careful about it. Still, they will follow such rules just to avoid getting in trouble.

But this kind of following the law isn’t the kind of willing and free obedience a Satyagrahi must have. A Satyagrahi obeys the laws thoughtfully and because they believe it is their sacred duty to do so.
