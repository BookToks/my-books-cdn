The movement to keep non-violence alive was slowly making progress. But at the same time, the government was using unfair and harsh actions, especially in Punjab. Leaders were arrested, martial law was declared, which meant there were basically no laws, and special courts were set up.

These courts were not fair. They were just tools for the ruler’s personal control. People were sentenced without real proof, and justice was ignored. In Amritsar, innocent men and women were forced to crawl on their bellies. This was so terrible that the Jallianwala Bagh massacre seemed less shocking to me, even though that event got a lot of attention from people in India and around the world.

I was asked to go to Punjab right away, no matter the risks. I wrote and sent messages to the Viceroy asking for permission, but I got no answer. If I went without permission, I wouldn’t be allowed to enter Punjab and would only be able to protest in a limited way. I had a tough choice to make. Breaking the rules to enter Punjab didn’t seem like peaceful protest because the situation there was very tense and violent. Joining civil disobedience then would have only made things worse. So, I decided not to go to Punjab, even though my friends wanted me to. It was a hard decision. Every day, I heard stories of terrible injustice from Punjab, but all I could do was feel angry and powerless.

At that time, Mr. Horniman, who made The Bombay Chronicle a strong voice, was suddenly taken away by the government. This action by the government felt very wrong to me and still makes me feel sick when I think about it.
