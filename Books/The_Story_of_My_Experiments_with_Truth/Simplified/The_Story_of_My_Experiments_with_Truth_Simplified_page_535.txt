The news about my proposal somehow reached Lala Harkishanlal. He said, "This won’t work. It will really hurt the Punjabis' feelings." I talked about it with Lokamanya, Deshabandhu, and Mr. Jinnah, but we couldn’t find a solution. Finally, I shared my worries with Malaviyaji. I told him, "I don’t see any chance of a compromise. If I want to move my resolution, we will have to call for a vote. But there’s no way to do that here."

So far, the Congress meetings took votes by a show of hands, which didn’t separate visitors from delegates. And in such a big group, we have no way to count votes properly. That means even if I want a vote, it won’t work or mean much. But Lala Harkishanlal helped out and promised to make the arrangements. He said, "We won’t allow visitors in the Congress tent on voting day. And I will make sure the votes are counted."

He also told me not to miss the Congress meeting. I gave in, wrote my resolution, and nervously got ready to present it. Pandit Malaviyaji and Mr. Jinnah agreed to support me. I could see that, even though we argued calmly and without anger, people didn’t like the disagreement. It upset them because they wanted everyone to agree.

While people were speaking, the leaders kept trying to fix the problem. They passed notes to each other to find a solution. Malaviyaji did everything he could to bring us together. Then Jeramdas gave me his amendment and kindly asked me to help avoid a vote. His amendment sounded good to me. Malaviyaji looked around, hoping for a good sign.

I told him that Jeramdas’s amendment might work for both sides. When we showed it to Lokamanya, he said, "If C.R. Das agrees, I’m okay with it." Deshabandhu finally softened and looked toward Bepin Chandra Pal for approval. Malaviyaji felt hopeful. He quickly took the paper with the amendment and before Deshabandhu could say yes, he shouted, "Brother delegates, I’m happy to tell you that we reached a compromise."
