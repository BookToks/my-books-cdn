Mr. Kallenbach said, "We always talk about how milk can be bad for us. So why don’t we just stop drinking it? It’s definitely not needed." I was happy to hear this idea and agreed right away. We promised each other to stop drinking milk right then and there. This happened at Tolstoy Farm in 1912.

But just giving up milk wasn’t enough for me. Soon after, I decided to eat only fruit, and I chose the cheapest fruit I could find. Our goal was to live like the poorest people.

The fruit diet was actually very easy. We hardly had to cook anything. We ate raw groundnuts, bananas, dates, lemons, and olive oil most of the time.

I need to warn anyone who wants to practice brahmacharya (self-control). Even though diet is connected to brahmacharya, the mind is the most important part. If your mind is not clean, fasting won’t fix it. Changing what you eat won’t help if your mind is full of bad desires. To get rid of these desires, you need deep self-examination, surrender to God, and grace.

But the mind and body are connected. A mind focused on physical desires always wants fancy and tasty food. To stop this, it helps to have rules about eating and to fast sometimes. If the mind doesn’t control the senses, it becomes a slave to them. That’s why the body needs clean, simple food and fasting now and then.

People who ignore fasting and diet rules are wrong, but so are those who depend only on them. From my experience, if your mind is trying to be self-controlled, dieting and fasting help a lot. Actually, without them, the bad desires in the mind can’t be fully removed.
