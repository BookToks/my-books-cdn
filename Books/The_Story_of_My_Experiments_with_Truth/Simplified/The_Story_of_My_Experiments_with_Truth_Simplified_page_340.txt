THE FIRST NIGHT  

It was not easy to print the first issue of Indian Opinion at Phoenix.  

If I hadn’t taken two precautions, the first issue would have been canceled or delayed. I didn’t like the idea of using a machine engine to run the press. I thought using hand power would fit better with the place where farming was also done by hand. But since hand power didn’t seem possible, we installed an oil engine.  

I told West to have a backup plan in case the engine stopped working. So, he set up a wheel that could be turned by hand. The paper was made smaller than a daily paper so that if needed, we could print copies using a foot pedal machine.  

At first, everyone had to work late nights before the day the paper came out. Both young and old helped fold the papers. We usually finished between 10 p.m. and midnight. But the first night was unforgettable. The pages were ready, but the engine wouldn’t start.  

We had called an engineer from Durban to set up the engine. He and West tried their best, but it didn’t work. Everyone was worried. West, feeling hopeless, came to me with tears and said, “The engine won’t work. I don’t think we can print the paper on time.”  

I told him, “If that’s the case, we can’t change it. No use crying. Let’s try everything else we can do. What about the hand wheel?”  

He replied, “Where will we find people to work it? We don’t have enough men. It needs groups of four people taking turns, and our men are already tired.”  

The building wasn’t finished yet, so the carpenters were still with us. They were sleeping on the press floor. I pointed to them and said, “Can’t we use these carpenters?”
