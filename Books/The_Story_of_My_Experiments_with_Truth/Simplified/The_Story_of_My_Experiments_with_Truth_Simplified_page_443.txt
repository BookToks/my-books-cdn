FOUNDING OF THE ASHRAM

My trip to the Kumbha fair was my second time visiting Hardvar.

The Satyagraha Ashram was started on May 25, 1915. Shraddhanandji wanted me to live in Hardvar. Some friends from Calcutta suggested Vaidyanathadham. Others really wanted me to choose Rajkot. But when I passed through Ahmedabad, many friends there asked me to stay and even offered to pay for the Ashram and a house for us.

I liked Ahmedabad. Since I am Gujarati, I thought I could help the country best by using the Gujarati language.

Also, Ahmedabad was an old center for handloom weaving, so it seemed like a good place to bring back the home industry of hand-spinning. Plus, since it was the capital of Gujarat, rich people there might be more willing to help with money.

We also talked about untouchability with my Ahmedabad friends. I told them I would accept an untouchable into the Ashram if he was truly deserving.

A vaishnava friend proudly said, "Where is the untouchable who meets your standards?"

In the end, I chose to start the Ashram in Ahmedabad.

For a place to stay, Jivanlal Desai, a lawyer in Ahmedabad, helped a lot. He offered his Kochrab bungalow for us to rent.

The first thing we needed was a name for the Ashram. I asked my friends. Some suggested 'Sevashram' (meaning the house of service) and 'Tapovan' (meaning the house of hard work). I liked 'Sevashram' but felt it didnâ€™t show enough about how we would serve.
