THE AMRITSAR CONGRESS

The Punjab Government couldn’t keep hundreds of Punjabis locked up under martial law. They had been put in jail with very little proof by courts that were just fake. So many people protested against this unfair treatment that the government had to let most prisoners go before the Congress meeting started. Leaders like Lala Harkishanlal were also freed while the Congress was still happening. The Ali Brothers came there straight from jail. Everyone was very happy. Pandit Motilal Nehru, who had given up his successful career to work in Punjab, was the President of the Congress. The late Swami Shraddhanandji was the Chairman of the Reception Committee.

Until then, my role in the Congress was just to speak in Hindi and talk about Indians living abroad. I didn’t expect to do more this year. But, like before, important work came to me suddenly.

The King had just announced new reforms. They weren’t perfect, and most people didn’t like them. But I thought the reforms, even if flawed, could still be accepted. I felt Lord Sinha’s influence in the King's words, which gave me hope. But experienced leaders like Lokamanya and Deshabandhu Chittaranjan Das disagreed. Pandit Malaviyaji was undecided.

Pandit Malaviyaji let me stay in his room. I had seen how simple his life was at the Hindu University’s foundation ceremony, but this time, living with him, I watched his daily routine closely. What I saw made me very happy.
