They were worth about £7, but their real value wasn’t in the price—it was because Mr. Kallenbach really loved them.

Even after getting rid of them, he never felt sorry about it.

This is just one of many things that happened between Mr. Kallenbach and me.

Every day we learned something new because we were both trying to follow the path of Truth. On the way to Truth, feelings like anger, selfishness, and hatred have to go away, or else you can’t find the Truth. A person who lets emotions control them might mean well and tell the truth, but they will never truly find the Truth. To succeed in searching for Truth means completely freeing yourself from the struggle between things like love and hate, or happiness and sadness.

Not much time had passed since I finished my fast when we started our trip. I wasn’t strong again yet. I used to walk on the deck to get some exercise, hoping it would help me feel hungry and digest my food. But even walking was too hard and made my legs hurt. When we got to London, I was actually feeling worse, not better. There, I met Dr. Jivraj Mehta. I told him about my fast and the pain I had. He said, “If you don’t rest completely for a few days, your legs might stop working.” That’s when I learned that after a long fast, you shouldn’t rush to get your strength back and you should control your appetite.

You have to be more careful and patient when breaking a fast than when fasting itself.

In Madeira, we heard that a big war could start anytime. When we entered the English Channel, we heard that the war had actually begun. Our boat was stopped for a while. It was hard to move through the submarine mines placed all over the Channel, and it took about two days to get to Southampton.

The war was declared on August 4th. We reached London on the 6th.
