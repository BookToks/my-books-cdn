"Look at Gautama’s kindness!" I said. "He didn’t just care about people, he cared about all living things. Doesn’t it make you feel warm inside to think of the little lamb happily sitting on his shoulders? I don’t see this kind of love for all creatures in Jesus’ life."  

The lady felt hurt by what I said. I understood how she felt, so I stopped and we went to the dining room. Her son, a sweet little boy around five years old, was with us. I’m happiest when I’m around children, and this boy and I had been friends for a long time. I joked about the meat on his plate and praised the apple on mine. The boy got excited and joined me in saying the fruit was better.  

But the mother was upset.  

She warned me. I stopped and changed the topic. The next week, I visited them again but felt nervous. I didn’t think I should stop visiting, and it didn’t seem right. But the lady made my choice easier.  

“Mr. Gandhi,” she said, “please don’t be angry, but my son is not doing well because of your visits. Every day he hesitates to eat meat and asks for fruit, repeating what you said. This is too much. If he stops eating meat, he will get weak or sick. How could I handle that? Please only talk about these things with us adults. It’s not good for children to hear it.”  

“Mrs. –,” I answered, “I’m sorry. I understand how you feel as a parent because I have children too. We can fix this easily. What I eat will affect the child more than what I say. So, the best way is for me to stop visiting. But that doesn’t mean we can’t still be friends.”  

She thanked me, clearly feeling relieved.
