I had been trying hydropathy, which helped a little, but it was really hard to get my strength back. Many doctors gave me advice, but I didn’t want to take any medicine. Two or three suggested I should try meat broth instead of only drinking milk, and they mentioned Ayurveda to support their ideas. One even said I should eat eggs. But I said no to all of them.

For me, choosing what to eat wasn’t about following old religious rules. It was part of my life, guided by my own principles, not by what others said. I didn’t want to live by giving up those principles. How could I break a rule for myself when I made my wife, kids, and friends stick to it?

This long illness gave me a chance to think deeply about my beliefs and test them. One night, I felt hopeless. I thought I was about to die. I sent for Anasuyabehn, and she came quickly to the Ashram. Vallabhbhai and Dr. Kanuga also came. The doctor checked my pulse and said, “Your pulse is fine. There’s no danger. This is just a nervous breakdown because you are very weak.” But I wasn’t comforted. I couldn’t sleep all night.

Morning came, and I was still alive. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was close to death. So, I spent all my awake time listening to people at the Ashram read the Gita to me. I couldn’t read myself. I didn’t want to talk much because even a little talking tired my brain. I had lost all interest in living; I never liked living just for the sake of living. It was painful to be so helpless, doing nothing, depending on friends to help me, and watching my body get weaker.

While I was waiting for death, Dr. Talvalkar came one day with a strange man from Maharashtra. He wasn’t famous, but as soon as I saw him, I realized he was unusual like me. He wanted to try his treatment on me.
