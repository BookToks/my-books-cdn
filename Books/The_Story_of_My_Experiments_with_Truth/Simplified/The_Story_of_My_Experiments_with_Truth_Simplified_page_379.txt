In the last chapter, we talked about how we set up physical training at Tolstoy Farm, and also some job skills. It wasn’t perfect, but it worked okay.

Teaching reading and writing was harder. I didn’t have the right books or tools, and I didn’t have enough time. I was very tired from working on the farm all day, and the classes were held when I really needed to rest. So, instead of being fresh, I often had a hard time staying awake. We had to do farm work and chores in the morning, so the only time for school was after lunch.

We gave up to three classes for reading and writing. We taught Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, and Urdu, using the students’ own languages. English was taught too. The Gujarati Hindu kids needed some basic Samskrit, and all the children had to learn simple history, geography, and math.

I promised to teach Tamil and Urdu. I only knew a little Tamil from trips and time in jail. I hadn’t gone past a good Tamil book by Pope. I learned the Urdu alphabet on one trip, and I only knew some familiar Persian and Arabic words from Muslim friends.

I only knew as much Samskrit as I learned in high school, and my Gujarati was just school level too.

That’s all I had to work with. My coworkers had more books and tools than me. But I loved the languages, believed I could teach, and my students didn’t know much either. Their kindness helped a lot.
