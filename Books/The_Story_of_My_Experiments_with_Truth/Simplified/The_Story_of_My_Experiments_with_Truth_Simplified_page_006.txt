As the General Editor of these Volumes, I have tried to choose important writings of the Mahatma that are valuable forever and interesting to everyone. The first two Volumes include his Autobiography, which he called The Story of My Experiments with Truth. The third Volume is about Satyagraha in South Africa. In the fourth Volume, I gathered most of Gandhi’s key works like Ethical Religion, Unto This Last, Hind Swaraj, From Yeravda Mandir, Constructive Programme, and Key to Health. The fifth Volume has many letters that are either important historically or have interesting ideas on different subjects. The sixth Volume includes all the main ideas of Mahatma Gandhi about philosophy, religion, culture, economics, politics, sociology, and education. I really hope these Selected Works will help everyone who wants to learn about Gandhi’s thoughts on many parts of life.

I want to thank the Navajivan Trust for letting me share these Volumes with many readers in India and around the world. I am also grateful to Shri H. M. Vyas, Dr. Raman Modi, and others who helped me edit this series.
