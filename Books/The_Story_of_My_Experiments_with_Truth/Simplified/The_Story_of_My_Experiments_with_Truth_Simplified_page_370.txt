The experiment stimulated the inclination for self-restraint, and I continues the abstention from the articles until long after I returned to India.
 
 Only once I happened to take both the articles whilst I was in London in 1914.
 
 But of that occasion, and as to how I resumed both, I shall speak in a later chapter.
 
 I have tried the experiment of a saltless and pulseless diet on many of my coworkers, and with good results in South Africa. Medically there may be two opinions as to the value of this diet, but morally I have no doubt that all selfdenial is good for the soul. The diet of a man of self-restraint must be different from that of a man of pleasure, just as their ways of life must be different.
 
 Aspirants after brahmacharya often defeat their own end by adopting courses suited to a life of pleasure.
