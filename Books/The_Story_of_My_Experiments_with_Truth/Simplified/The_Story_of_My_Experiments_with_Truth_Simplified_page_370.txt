The experiment made me want to control myself, and I kept avoiding those things even after I went back to India.

Only once did I take both of them when I was in London in 1914.

But I will talk about that time, and how I started using them again, in a later chapter.

I have also asked many of my coworkers to try a diet with no salt or pulses, and it worked well in South Africa. Doctors might have different opinions about this diet, but I believe that any kind of self-control is good for the soul. 

A person who controls themselves should eat differently from someone who just wants to enjoy life, just like their lifestyles should be different.

People trying to live with self-discipline often fail because they follow habits made for pleasure instead.
