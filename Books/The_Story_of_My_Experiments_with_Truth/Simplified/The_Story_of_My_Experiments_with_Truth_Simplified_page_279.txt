Just like an elephant can’t understand how an ant thinks, no matter how hard it tries, an Englishman can’t understand or make laws for an Indian.

But to get back to the story. Even though I was doing well, I was thinking of staying in Rajkot a little longer. One day, Kevalram Dave came to me and said, “Gandhi, we won’t let you waste your time here. You have to move to Bombay.” I asked, “But who will help me find work there? Can you pay for my expenses?” He said, “Yes, yes, I will. Sometimes we’ll bring you here as a big lawyer from Bombay, and we’ll send you drafting work there. It’s up to us lawyers to make or break a lawyer’s career. You’ve already shown your skills in Jamnagar and Veraval, so I’m not worried about you. You’re meant to do public work, and we won’t let you be stuck in Kathiawad. So tell me, when will you go to Bombay?” I said, “I’m waiting for money from Natal. As soon as I get it, I’ll go.”

The money arrived in about two weeks, and I went to Bombay. I rented office space at Payne, Gilbert and Sayani’s offices, and it seemed like I was ready to settle there.
