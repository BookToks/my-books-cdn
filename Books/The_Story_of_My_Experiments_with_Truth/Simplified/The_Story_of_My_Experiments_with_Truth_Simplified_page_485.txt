Champaran is a faraway place in India, and since the press was kept out, not many people from outside came to see what was happening. But the Kheda campaign was different because the news was reported in the papers every day.

The Gujaratis were very interested in the fight because it was something new for them. They were ready to give a lot of money to help. But it wasn’t easy for them to understand that Satyagraha doesn’t need money much. Even though I told them, the merchants in Bombay sent us more money than needed, so we still had some left at the end.

At the same time, the Satyagraha volunteers had to learn to live simply. I can’t say they learned it completely, but they did change their way of living a lot.

For the Patidar farmers, the fight was also new. So, we had to go from village to village to explain what Satyagraha really meant.

The main goal was to help farmers stop being afraid by showing them that officials are not their bosses but workers paid by the people’s taxes. It was hard to help them understand that they should be polite but also fearless. Once they stopped fearing the officials, it was hard to stop them from being rude back. But if they were rude, it would ruin their Satyagraha, like poison in milk. Later, I saw that they didn’t fully learn how to be polite as I hoped. I learned that being polite is the hardest part of Satyagraha. Being polite doesn’t just mean speaking nicely for the moment, but having a true kindness and wanting to help the other person. This should show in everything a Satyagrahi does.

At first, even though people were brave, the government didn’t seem ready to take strong action.
