The loan was never paid back.

But how could I let Badri, who trusted me, suffer? He only knew me. So, I covered the loss myself.

A friend who was also a client told me I was being foolish. He said, "Bhai" — which means brother, what my friends called me before I became known as Mahatma or Bapu — "this was not your job. Many people rely on you. You won’t get that money back. I know you won’t let Badri lose out because you will pay him yourself. But if you keep using your clients’ money to help your plans, those poor people will be ruined, and you’ll end up broke. You are our trustee, and if you go broke, all our work will stop." I’m glad this friend is still alive. I have never met a purer person than him, anywhere. I have even seen him say sorry to people and make things right when he wrongly suspected them.

I saw he was right. Even though I paid Badri’s loss, I couldn’t handle another one without going into debt, which I’ve never done and always hated. I realized that even if you want to help, you can’t go beyond your limits. I also understood that by lending trust-money, I broke an important rule from the Gita — that a balanced person should act without wanting rewards. This mistake became a warning for me.

Giving up something for vegetarianism wasn’t planned or expected. It just happened because it was necessary.
