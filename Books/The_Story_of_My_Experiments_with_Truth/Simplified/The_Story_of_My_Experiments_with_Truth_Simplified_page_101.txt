Our thoughts and actions were pretty similar. We were both vegetarians. We often had lunch together. At that time, I lived on 17 shillings a week and cooked for myself. Sometimes I went to his room, and sometimes he came to mine. I cooked in the English style, but he only liked Indian food. He always wanted dal. I made carrot soup and he felt sorry for my taste. One day, he found mung beans, cooked them, and brought them to me. I really enjoyed it. After that, we started regularly exchanging food. I would bring my special dishes to him, and he would bring his to me.

Cardinal Manning was very popular then. The dock workers’ strike ended early because of John Burns and Cardinal Manning. I told Narayan Hemchandra about Disraeli praising the Cardinal’s simple life. “Then I have to meet this wise man,” he said.

“He’s an important person. How will you meet him?” “I know how. I want you to write to him for me. Tell him I’m an author and want to congratulate him on his good work helping people. Also, say I’ll need you as my translator because I don’t speak English.” I wrote the letter. A few days later, the Cardinal sent a card with an appointment for us. So, we went to see him. I wore my best suit. Narayan Hemchandra wore his usual old coat and trousers. I tried to make fun of him, but he laughed and said, “You fancy people are all scared. Great people don’t care about how someone looks. They care about what’s inside.”

We entered the Cardinal’s house. After we sat down, a thin, tall, old man came in and shook our hands. Narayan Hemchandra greeted him and said, “I don’t want to take up your time.”
