Other merchants in the town talked to him, and we all stayed awake all night, determined not to move even a little bit.

Most of my co-workers were very angry, but they kept calm.

Finally, when morning came, the host gave in, paid £6, and treated us to a meal. This happened at Tongaat, but people felt the effects all the way to Stanger on the North Coast and Charlestown inland. It also made our collecting work faster.

But collecting money wasn’t the only thing to do. I had learned a long time ago to never keep more money than needed.

We held meetings once a month or even once a week if needed.

We read the notes from the last meeting, and talked about all kinds of questions. People didn’t know how to join public talks or speak clearly and briefly. Everyone was shy to speak up. I explained how meetings should be run, and they followed the rules. They saw it as a way to learn, and many who never spoke in front of others before started to get used to thinking and talking about public issues.

Since small expenses could add up in public work, I decided not to print receipt books at first. I had a machine in my office to make copies of receipts and reports. I only started printing these things when the Congress had enough money and more members and work. Saving money is very important for every group, but not everyone does it. That’s why I’m sharing these small details about how a small but growing group began.

People didn’t care about getting receipts for their payments, but we always made sure they got them. Every penny was carefully recorded, and I’m sure the money records from 1894 can still be found in the Natal Indian Congress files. Keeping good accounts is a must for any group. Without them, the group loses respect.

Without proper accounts, it’s impossible to keep truth completely clean and honest.
