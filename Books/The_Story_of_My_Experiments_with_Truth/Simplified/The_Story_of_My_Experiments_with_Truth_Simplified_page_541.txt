After a lot of hard work, we finally found some weavers who agreed to make Swadeshi yarn for us. But they only agreed if the Ashram promised to buy all the cloth they made.

By wearing cloth made from mill yarn and encouraging our friends to do the same, we became helpers for the Indian spinning mills. This brought us closer to the mills, and we learned about how they were run and their problems. We saw that the mills wanted to use more and more yarn they spun themselves. They didn’t really want to work with handloom weavers, but had to for now. We wanted to spin our own yarn as soon as possible. It was clear that if we didn’t spin our own yarn, we would always depend on the mills.

We felt we couldn’t really help the country if we just worked as agents for the Indian spinning mills.

We faced many problems again. We couldn’t find spinning wheels or anyone to teach us how to spin. We used some wheels at the Ashram for filling parts for weaving, but we didn’t know they could be used for spinning yarn. Once, Kalidas Jhaveri found a woman who said she could show us how to spin. We sent one of our most skilled Ashram members to learn from her, but even he couldn’t figure out the secret.

Time went by, and I grew more and more impatient. I asked every visitor to the Ashram who might know about hand spinning. But since spinning was mostly done by women and was almost gone, only a woman could find a spinner if she still existed somewhere.

In 1917, my Gujarati friends took me to the Broach Educational Conference, where I met an amazing lady named Gangabehn Majmundar. She was a widow, but very brave and full of ideas. She wasn’t very educated by normal standards, but her courage and common sense were better than most educated women I knew.
