We had barely gone halfway when a messenger from the Police Superintendent caught up with us and said the Superintendent sent his greetings. I understood what he meant. After leaving Dharanidhar Babu to continue to our original destination, I got into the carriage the messenger had brought. He then gave me a notice ordering me to leave Champaran and took me back to my place. When he asked me to confirm I had received the notice, I wrote that I did not plan to leave Champaran until my inquiry was finished.

After that, I got a summons to appear for trial the next day for ignoring the order to leave Champaran.

I stayed awake all night writing letters and giving instructions to Babu Brajkishore Prasad.

The news about the notice and summons spread quickly, and I heard that Motihari saw huge crowds that day. Gorakh Babu's house and the courthouse were packed with people. Luckily, I had finished all my work during the night, so I was ready to handle the crowds. My friends helped a lot by managing the crowds because they followed me everywhere.

A kind of friendship grew between the officials—the Collector, Magistrate, Police Superintendent—and me. I could have refused to accept the notices, but I didn’t. I accepted them all and treated the officials with respect. This showed them I didn’t want to upset them personally, but I was peacefully resisting their orders. This made them feel comfortable, and instead of bothering me, they happily worked with me and my team to control the crowds.

But this showed them clearly that their power was weakening. The people had lost their fear of punishment for a while and listened to the power of love that their new friend showed them.

It’s important to remember that no one knew me in Champaran. The peasants were mostly uneducated. Champaran, being far north of the Ganges and near the Himalayas close to Nepal, was cut off from the rest of India.
