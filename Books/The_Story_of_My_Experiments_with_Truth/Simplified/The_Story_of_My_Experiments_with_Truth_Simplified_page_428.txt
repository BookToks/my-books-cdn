From Rajkot, I went to Shantiniketan. The teachers and students showed me a lot of kindness. The welcome was simple, artistic, and full of love. It was here that I met Kakasaheb Kalelkar for the first time.

At first, I didnâ€™t know why Kalelkar was called 'Kakasaheb'. Later, I found out that Sjt. Keshavrao Deshpande, a close friend of mine from England, had started a school called 'Ganganath Vidyalaya' in Baroda State. He gave the teachers family nicknames to make the school feel like a family. Kalelkar was called 'Kaka', which means paternal uncle. Phadke was called 'Mama', meaning maternal uncle, and Harihar Sharma was called 'Anna', meaning brother.

Others got similar names too. Anandanand (Swami), a friend of Kaka, and Patwardhan (Appa), a friend of Mama, later joined the group. Over time, they all became my coworkers. Sjt. Deshpande was called 'Saheb'. When the school closed, the group split up, but they kept their close spiritual bonds and nicknames.

Kakasaheb went to learn from different places, and when I went to Shantiniketan, he was there. Chintaman Shastri, from the same group, was there too. Both helped teach Samskrit.

The Phoenix family had their own place at Shantiniketan. Maganlal Gandhi led them and made sure everyone followed the Phoenix Ashram rules carefully. Because of his love, knowledge, and hard work, his good influence was felt all over Shantiniketan.

Andrews and Pearson were there as well. Among the Bengali teachers we got to know well were Jagadanandbabu, Nepalbabu, Santoshbabu, Kshitimohanbabu, Nagenbabu, Sharadbabu, and Kalibabu.

As usual, I quickly made friends with the teachers and students and started talking to them about helping themselves.
