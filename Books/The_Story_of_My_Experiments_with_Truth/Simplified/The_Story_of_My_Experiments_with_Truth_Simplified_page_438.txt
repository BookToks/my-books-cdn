It's hard to say how much this kind of faith really lifts the spirit.

So, I spent the whole night thinking deeply. There were some very religious people surrounded by a lot of fake behavior. They wouldn’t feel guilty in front of their Creator. If visiting Hardvar was wrong, I had to speak out and leave Hardvar on the day of Kumbha. But if going on a pilgrimage to Hardvar and the Kumbha fair was not wrong, then I had to punish myself in some way to make up for the bad things happening there and to clean my soul. This made sense to me. My life is based on strict rules.

I thought about the trouble I caused my hosts in Calcutta and Rangoon who were so kind to me. So, I decided to limit what I ate each day and finish my last meal before sunset. I believed that if I didn’t set these rules, I would cause problems for my future hosts by making them serve me instead of me serving others. So, I promised myself that while I was in India, I would only eat five different things in 24 hours and never eat after dark. I thought carefully about any problems I might face. I even imagined being sick and counting medicine as one of the five things, but I made no exceptions for special foods. I decided there would be no exceptions at all.

I have kept these promises for thirteen years now. They have been a tough challenge, but I can say they have protected me. I believe they have added some years to my life and saved me from many illnesses.
