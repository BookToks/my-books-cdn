Around that time, Narayan Hemchandra came to England. I had heard about him as a writer. We met at Miss Manning’s house from the National Indian Association. Miss Manning knew I wasn’t very good at talking to people. When I went to her place, I usually stayed quiet and only spoke when someone talked to me. She introduced me to Narayan Hemchandra.

He didn’t know English. He wore strange clothes – loose trousers, a wrinkled and dirty brown coat like Parsis wear, no necktie or collar, and a woollen cap with a tassel. He had a long beard.

He was small and thin. His round face had scars from smallpox, and his nose was not sharp or flat. He kept touching his beard with his hand.

Because he looked so different and dressed strangely, people noticed him in fancy parties.

“I have heard a lot about you,” I said. “I have read some of your writing. I would be happy if you came to my place.” Narayan Hemchandra had a rough voice. He smiled and said, “Yes, where do you live?” “In Store Street.” “Then we are neighbors. I want to learn English. Will you teach me?” “I will be happy to teach you what I can and will try my best. If you want, I can come to your place.” “Oh no. I will come to you. I will also bring a Translation Exercise Book.” So we made a plan. Soon, we became good friends.

Narayan Hemchandra didn’t know much about grammar.
