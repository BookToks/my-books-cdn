He is pretty rich. He still writes to me. In his letters, he always talks about the same thing. He says that Christianity is the best religion in many ways, and he believes you can’t find true peace unless you accept Jesus as the only son of God and the Savior of everyone.

When I first met Mr. Baker, he asked me about my religion. I told him, "I was born Hindu, but I don’t really know much about Hinduism or other religions. Honestly, I’m confused about what I believe and want to learn more about my own religion and others too." Mr. Baker was happy to hear that. He said, "I help run the South Africa General Mission. I built a church with my own money, and I give sermons there regularly. I don’t judge people by their skin color. I have some friends who work with me, and we meet every day at one o’clock to pray for peace and wisdom. I’d be glad if you join us. I’ll introduce you to my friends, and I think you’ll like them. I’ll also give you some religious books, but the most important one is the Holy Bible, which I really recommend." I thanked him and said I would try to come to the prayers every day.

"So I’ll expect you here tomorrow at one o’clock, and we’ll go pray together," said Mr. Baker, and then we said goodbye.

I didn’t have much time to think about it yet.

I went to Mr. Johnston, paid the bill, and moved into a new place where I had lunch. The landlady was a kind woman who made a vegetarian meal for me. Soon, I felt comfortable living with her family.

Next, I went to see the friend that Dada Abdulla had told me about. From him, I learned more about the struggles Indians faced in South Africa. He insisted that I stay with him.
