When Lord Hardinge started building the Hindu University, there was a big event called a durbar. Many Rajas and Maharajas were there, and Pandit Malaviyaji specially asked me to come, so I went.

I felt upset seeing the Maharajas dressed like women – wearing silk pajamas and silk coats, pearl necklaces, bracelets, pearl and diamond decorations on their turbans, and swords with golden handles hanging from their waists.

I learned that these were not signs of their power, but signs of their slavery. I thought they chose to wear these things, but I was told they had to wear all their expensive jewelry at these events. Some of them actually didn’t like wearing the jewels and only wore them for durbars.

I’m not sure if what I heard was totally true. But whether they wear these jewels at other times or not, it’s sad that they have to go to important events wearing jewelry that usually only some women wear. It shows how much damage wealth, power, and status can cause to people.
