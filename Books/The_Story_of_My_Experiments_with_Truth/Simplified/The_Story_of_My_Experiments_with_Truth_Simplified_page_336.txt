Madanjit gave his estimate without checking it carefully and told Mr. West to expect a profit.

Now I understand that a public worker should not say things without being sure they are true. Above all, someone who values truth must be very careful.

Letting someone believe something that hasn’t been fully checked is not honest. I feel bad admitting that even though I know this, I still sometimes trust things too easily. This happens because I want to do more work than I can handle. This desire has often worried my co-workers more than it has worried me.

When I got Mr. West’s letter, I left for Natal. I trusted Mr. Polak completely. He came to say goodbye at the station and gave me a book to read on the trip, saying I would like it. The book was Ruskin’s Unto This Last.

Once I started reading, I couldn’t stop. It really caught my attention.

The trip from Johannesburg to Durban took twenty-four hours. The train got there in the evening. I couldn’t sleep that night. I decided to change my life to follow the ideas in the book.

This was the first time I read a book by Ruskin. When I was studying, I hardly read anything except textbooks, and after I started working, I didn’t have much time to read. So, I don’t have a lot of book knowledge. But I don’t think I lost much because of that. In fact, reading less helped me understand better what I did read. Of all the books I read, Unto This Last changed my life the most. Later, I translated it into Gujarati and called it Sarvodaya, which means the welfare of all.

I think I found some of my deepest beliefs in this great book by Ruskin. That’s why it touched me so much and made me change my life. A poet is someone who can bring out the good feelings inside people.

Poets don’t affect everyone the same way, because not everyone is at the same level of understanding.
