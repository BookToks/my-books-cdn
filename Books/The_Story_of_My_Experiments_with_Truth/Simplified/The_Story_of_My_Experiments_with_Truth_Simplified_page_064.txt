Then I had to get ready for the trip. I had a friend who knew a lot about this. He helped me get clothes and other things. I liked some of the clothes, but I didn’t like others at all. For example, I hated the necktie at first, even though I liked wearing it later.

I thought the short jacket was too revealing. But my dislike didn’t matter because I really wanted to go to England. I also had more than enough food for the trip. My friends saved me a bed in the same cabin as Sjt. Tryambakrai Mazmudar, the Junagadh vakil. They told him about me too. He was an older, wise man who knew a lot about the world. I was still a young kid of eighteen with no real life experience. Sjt. Mazmudar told my friends not to worry about me.

Finally, I left Bombay and sailed on September 4th.
