He said he would give them introduction letters, so Mohandas would have an easy time there. Joshiji – that’s what we called old Mavji Dave – turned to me confidently and asked, "Wouldn’t you rather go to England than study here?" I was really happy to hear that. I was struggling with my hard studies, so I quickly said the sooner I went, the better. Passing exams fast wasn’t easy. Could I go to qualify for medicine instead?

My brother stopped me and said, "Father never liked that idea. He said we Vaishnavas shouldn’t do work involving cutting dead bodies. Father wanted you to become a lawyer." Joshiji added, "I’m not against medicine like Gandhiji was. Our Shastras don’t forbid it. But a medical degree won’t make you a Diwan, and I want you to be a Diwan, or maybe something even better. That way, you can take care of your big family. Times are changing and getting harder. So it’s smarter to become a barrister." Then he turned to my mother and said, "I must go now. Please think about what I said. When I come next, I’ll expect to hear you’re preparing for England. Let me know if I can help." Joshiji left, and I started dreaming big.

My older brother was worried. How would he find money to send me? And was it right to let a young guy like me go abroad alone?

My mother was very confused. She didn’t want to let me go.

She tried to stop me by saying, "Uncle is now the oldest in the family. We should ask him first. If he agrees, then we can think about it." But my brother had a different idea. He told me, "We have some influence with the Porbandar State. Mr. Lely is the Administrator. He thinks highly of our family, and uncle is on good terms with him."
