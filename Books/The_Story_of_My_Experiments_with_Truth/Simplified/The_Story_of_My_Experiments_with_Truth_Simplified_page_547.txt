He pointed to it and said, "Look at this stuff. This is the newest kind made by our mill.

Lots of people want it. We make it from leftover materials.

Because of that, it is cheap. We send it as far north as the Himalayan valleys. We have offices all over the country, even in places where your voice or your workers can’t reach. So, you see, we don’t need more agents. Also, you should know that India doesn’t make enough cloth for everyone. The idea of Swadeshi, then, really means making more cloth here. When we can make enough and make it better, people will stop buying cloth from other countries.

My advice to you is not to keep protesting the way you are, but to focus on building new mills. What we need is not just talk to get people to want our goods, but more production."

“Then you will support me, because I’m already doing that,” I said.

“How can that be?” he asked, surprised. “Maybe you mean helping to start new mills. If so, that’s great.”

“I’m not doing exactly that,” I said. “I’m working to bring back the spinning wheel.”

“What’s that?” he asked, even more confused.

I told him all about the spinning wheel and how I searched for it. I added, “I agree with you; it’s no good for me to just be an agent for the mills. That would actually hurt the country. Our mills won’t lack customers for a long time. My job is to organize making cloth by hand and to find ways to sell the Khadi we make. So, I’m focusing on making Khadi. I believe in this kind of Swadeshi because it gives work to women who are poor and don’t have steady jobs.”
