CHANGES

Don’t think that my dancing and fun were just me wasting time. Even then, I was careful and smart. During that time, I often thought about myself and how I was spending money. I wrote down every single penny I spent, like bus rides, postage, or a few cents on newspapers. Every night before bed, I checked how much money I had left. This habit stuck with me, and because of it, even when I handled big amounts of money, I was always careful and saved more than I spent. I think every young person should try this and keep track of their money because it helps you save in the long run.

Because I watched my spending closely, I knew I needed to save more. So, I decided to cut my expenses in half. I saw I was spending a lot on transportation. Also, living with a family meant paying a weekly bill. Sometimes, I took family members out to dinner or went to parties with them. This caused more costs, especially since if the friend was a girl, it was expected that the man would pay. Eating out also cost extra because I still had to pay the weekly bill even if I didn’t eat all the meals. I felt I could save money by avoiding these things and not following unnecessary rules about how to behave.

So, I chose to rent my own rooms instead of living with a family. I also planned to move to different places based on the work I had. This way, I could learn more and save money. I picked rooms close enough to work so I could walk in half an hour and avoid spending on transportation.
