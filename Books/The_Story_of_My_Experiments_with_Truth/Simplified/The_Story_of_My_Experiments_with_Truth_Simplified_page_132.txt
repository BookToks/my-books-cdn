Whenever an Indian didn’t like being called ‘sami’ and was smart enough, he would reply like this: ‘You can call me sami, but you forget that sami means master. I am not your master!’ Some Englishmen would feel hurt by this, while others would get mad, swear at the Indian, and if they could, even hit him. To them, ‘sami’ was an insult, not a respectful word.

Because of this, I was called a ‘coolie barrister’. The merchants were called ‘coolie merchants’. The real meaning of ‘coolie’ was forgotten, and it became a common name for all Indians. Muslim merchants didn’t like this and would say, ‘I am not a coolie, I am an Arab,’ or ‘I am a merchant.’ If the Englishman was polite, he would say sorry to them.

Wearing the turban was very important in this situation. Being forced to take off the Indian turban would feel like an insult. So, I thought it was better to stop wearing the Indian turban and start wearing an English hat, which would help me avoid the insult and arguments.

But Abdulla Sheth didn’t agree. He said, ‘If you do that, it will cause problems. You will let down those who want to keep wearing Indian turbans. And the Indian turban looks good on you. If you wear an English hat, people might think you’re a waiter.’ His advice showed some good sense, patriotism, and a little bit of narrow thinking. The good sense was clear, and his patriotism made him want to keep the turban. But calling waiters a joke showed narrow thinking. Among the indentured Indians, there were three groups – Hindus, Muslims, and Christians. The Christians were children of indentured Indians who converted to Christianity. Even in 1893, many of them wore English clothes and mostly worked as waiters in hotels. Abdulla Sheth’s dislike of the English hat was about this group.
