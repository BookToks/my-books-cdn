That is our problem. She doesn’t have to wear the jewelry. She might want to keep it for us, and if we don’t want it, why shouldn’t she agree to give it up? But it was not that easy.

"You might not need it," my wife said. "Your children might not need it.

If you convince them, they will do what you say. I understand you don’t want me to wear it. But what about my daughters-in-law? They will probably want it. And who knows what will happen later? I would be the last person to give away gifts that were given with so much love." She kept arguing and even cried. But the children were firm. And I didn’t change my mind.

I quietly said, "The children aren’t married yet. We don’t want them to marry too young. When they grow up, they can look after themselves. And I’m sure our sons won’t marry girls who like jewelry. If we really need to give ornaments to the daughters-in-law, I will do it. You can ask me then." 

"Ask you? I know you well now. You took my jewelry and didn’t leave me alone about it. And now you say you will get jewelry for the daughters-in-law? You’re trying to make my boys into monks from today! No, I won’t give back the jewelry. And who gave you the right to take my necklace?" 

"But," I said, "Was the necklace given to you for your service or for mine?" 

"I agree. But your service is the same as mine. I worked hard for you day and night. Isn’t that service? You forced everyone on me, made me cry, and I worked for them!" 

Her words hurt, and some were true. But I was set on returning the jewelry. Somehow, I got her to agree. The gifts from 1896 and 1901 were all given back. A trust was made, and the jewelry was kept in a bank to be used for helping the community, following my wishes or those of the trustees.
