The campaign ended in a way no one expected. The people were very tired, and I didn’t want those who stood firm to be completely ruined. I was trying to find a good way to stop the struggle that would be okay for a Satyagrahi. Then, something helpful happened.

The Mamlatdar of Nadiad Taluka told me that if the richer Patidars paid their taxes, the poorer ones would get a break. I asked for this promise in writing, and he gave it to me. But since the Mamlatdar was only responsible for his Taluka, I asked the Collector, who was in charge of the whole district, if the promise was true for everywhere. He said that orders had already been given to grant the suspensions mentioned by the Mamlatdar. I didn’t know this before, but if it was true, the people had kept their promise. The promise was about the same thing, so we said we were happy with the orders.

Still, I wasn’t really happy about how it ended because it didn’t have the kind of respect or honor that every Satyagraha should have. The Collector acted like nothing was settled. The poor were supposed to get help, but hardly any did. The people had the right to decide who was poor, but they couldn’t use that right. I felt sad they didn’t have the power to do so. Even though we celebrated the end as a victory, I couldn’t get excited because it wasn’t a complete win.

A Satyagraha campaign only ends well if it makes the people stronger and more determined than before.

Even so, the campaign did have some important effects that we can see today and still benefit from. The Kheda Satyagraha was the start of the peasants of Gujarat waking up and beginning their real political education.
