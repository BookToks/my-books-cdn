We were now more than forty people—men, women, and children—eating our meals together in one kitchen. The idea to move was mine, but Maganlal handled the actual work.

Before we had a proper place to live, things were really hard.

The rains were coming soon, and we had to get food from the city, which was four miles away. The land we chose was empty and full of snakes, so it was risky to live there, especially with little kids. We had a rule not to kill snakes, even though we were all still scared of them.

Not killing venomous snakes was a rule we followed at Phoenix, Tolstoy Farm, and Sabarmati too. We always settled on empty land. Luckily, nobody got hurt by snakebites. I believe this was because of God’s mercy. Some might say God doesn’t care about small things or is not partial, but I can only explain what I’ve seen. Words can’t fully describe how God works.

I know God’s ways are hard to understand. But if someone tries to explain, the best way is through simple words. Even if it sounds like a superstition, I believe that being safe for twenty-five years because we didn’t kill snakes was a blessing from God, not just luck.

While the mill workers in Ahmedabad were on strike, we started building the Ashram’s weaving shed. At that time, weaving was our main work. We hadn’t started spinning yet.
