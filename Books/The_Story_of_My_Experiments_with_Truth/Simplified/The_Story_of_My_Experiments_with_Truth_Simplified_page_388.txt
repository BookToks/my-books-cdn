Feeling much better, I reached Phoenix. I looked into things more and learned some important details I needed to know.

My punishment upset everyone, but it made the situation clearer. Everyone understood how bad it was to do wrong, and the connection between me and the boys and girls became stronger and more honest.

Because of what happened, I had to fast for fourteen days not long after, and the results were even better than I expected.

I’m not saying teachers should always fast when their students mess up. But sometimes, it’s necessary.

This only works if the teacher understands things clearly and is spiritually ready. If there isn’t real love between teacher and student, if the student’s mistake doesn’t affect the teacher deeply, or if the student doesn’t respect the teacher, fasting isn’t right and might even be harmful. Still, the teacher is responsible if the student makes a mistake.

The first punishment wasn’t hard for any of us. I didn’t have to stop my usual activities. Remember, during that time I only ate fruit. The second fast was harder for me. I didn’t yet fully understand how powerful saying Ramanama was, so I couldn’t handle suffering as well.

Also, I didn’t know the right way to fast, like needing to drink lots of water even if it tasted bad. Since the first fast was easy, I was careless about the second one. During the first fast, I took Kuhne baths every day, but in the second, I stopped after a few days and drank very little water because it made me feel sick. My throat got dry and weak, and in the last days, I could only speak very quietly. Even so, I kept working by dictating when I needed to write.
