This is the first big problem for us. It hurts our pride.' 'Maybe,' said Sheth Abdulla. 'Let me tell you how the voting idea started. We didn’t know anything about it. But Mr. Escombe, one of our best lawyers, who you know, gave us the idea. Here’s what happened. He is a strong fighter, and since he didn’t get along with the Wharf Engineer, he was afraid the Engineer might take away his votes and beat him in the election. So he told us about our situation, and because of him, we all signed up to vote and voted for him. Now you can see why voting isn’t as important to us as it is to you. But we understand what you’re saying. So, what do you suggest?'

The other guests were listening carefully. One of them said, 'Should I tell you what we should do? Cancel your trip on this boat, stay here a month longer, and we will follow your plan.' Everyone agreed: 'Yes, yes. Abdulla Sheth, you have to make Gandhibhai stay.' 

The Sheth was smart. He said, 'I can’t make him stay right now. Actually, you have the same right as I do to ask him. But you’re right. Let’s all try to convince him to stay. But remember, he is a lawyer. What about his fees?'

When they mentioned money, it hurt me, so I said, 'Abdulla Sheth, money isn’t important. There are no fees for public work. If I stay, it will be as a helper. And you know, I don’t know all these people well. But if you think they will help, I’m ready to stay a month longer. There is one thing though. Even if you don’t pay me, this kind of work needs some money to get started. We might have to send telegrams, print some papers, travel around, talk to local lawyers, and since I don’t know your laws well, I might need some law books. All this costs money. And it’s clear that one person can’t do all this alone. Many people must help.'

Then many voices said together, 'Allah is great and merciful.'
