The Town Clerk thanked me for taking care of the empty house and the sick people. He honestly said that the Town Council didn’t have the resources to deal with this emergency right away, but promised they would help as much as they could. Once they realized their responsibility, the town acted quickly.

The next day, they gave me an empty warehouse to use and suggested moving the patients there. But the town didn’t promise to clean the place. The building was dirty and messy. We cleaned it ourselves, got some beds and other supplies from kind local people, and set up a temporary hospital. The town sent a nurse who brought brandy and other medical stuff.

Dr. Godfrey was still in charge.

The nurse was a kind woman and wanted to help the patients, but we rarely let her touch them because we were afraid she might catch the disease.

We were told to give the patients brandy often. The nurse even asked us to drink it for protection, as she was doing. But none of us drank it. I didn’t believe it helped the patients either. With Dr. Godfrey’s permission, I put three patients, who were ready to avoid brandy, on the earth treatment, which meant putting wet earth bandages on their heads and chests. Two of these patients survived. The other twenty died in the warehouse.

Meanwhile, the town was working on other plans. There was a special hospital for contagious diseases about seven miles from Johannesburg. The two patients who survived were moved to tents near that hospital, and plans were made to send new patients there. This meant we were free from the work.

After a few days, we heard that the kind nurse got sick and died quickly. No one knows exactly how the two patients survived or why we didn’t get sick, but this experience made me trust earth treatment more and doubt that brandy really helps as medicine.
