STEALING AND ATONEMENT

I still need to tell you about some mistakes I made during the time I was eating meat and even before that, around when I got married or just after.

A relative and I started to like smoking. We didn’t think smoking was good or like the smell of cigarettes. We just thought it would be fun to blow smoke out of our mouths. My uncle smoked, and when we saw him, we wanted to copy him. But we didn’t have any money. So we started taking leftover bits of cigarettes my uncle threw away.

But these bits were not always there, and they didn’t make much smoke. So we began stealing small coins from the servant’s pocket money to buy Indian cigarettes. But then we had to figure out where to hide them.

We couldn’t smoke in front of adults. We managed for a few weeks with the stolen money. Then we heard about some plant stalks that could be smoked like cigarettes. We found them and started smoking those.

Still, we weren’t happy with this. We felt upset because we couldn’t do anything without asking adults first. It was so frustrating that we decided to kill ourselves!

But how would we do it? Where would we get poison? We heard Dhatura seeds were poisonous. We went to the forest and found some. We thought evening was the right time. We went to Kedarji Mandir, lit a lamp with ghee, prayed, and then looked for a quiet place. But we got scared.

What if the poison didn’t kill us right away? And what good would dying do? Maybe it was better to just accept not being free. Still, we swallowed two or three seeds. We didn’t take more because we were afraid. Both of us were scared of dying, so we went to Ramji Mandir to calm down and forget about suicide.
