THAT AMAZING EVENT!

While many people were getting more and more upset about the Rowlatt Committee’s report, the Government was even more determined to follow its advice and introduced the Rowlatt Bill. I had only been to India’s legislative chamber once before, and that was during the debate on this Bill. Shastriji gave a powerful speech, warning the Government seriously. The Viceroy looked very focused, watching Shastriji closely as he spoke with strong emotion. For a moment, I thought the Viceroy might be deeply affected because the speech was so true and heartfelt.

But you can only wake someone who is really asleep; no matter what you do, you can’t change someone who’s pretending to be asleep. That’s exactly how the Government acted. They just wanted to go through the motions of following the law. They had already made up their minds. So, Shastriji’s warning didn’t affect the Government at all.

In this situation, my voice was like a cry in the wilderness. I begged the Viceroy to listen. I wrote him private and public letters, clearly telling him that if the Government kept going this way, I would have no choice but to start a peaceful protest called Satyagraha. But it didn’t work.

The Bill hadn’t become a law yet. Even though I was very weak, I decided to take a risk and travel a long way to Madras after getting an invitation. At that time, I couldn’t raise my voice much in meetings.

I still can’t stand and speak for long without shaking and feeling a strong pain.

I have always felt comfortable in the south. Because of my work in South Africa, I felt a special connection with the Tamils and Telugus, and the kind people in the south have never let me down. The invitation came signed by the late Sjt.
