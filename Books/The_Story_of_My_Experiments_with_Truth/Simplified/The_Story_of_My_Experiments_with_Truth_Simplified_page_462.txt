I want to say this not to excuse the punishment I might get, but to explain that I ignored the order given to me, not because I didn’t respect the law, but because I was following a higher law inside me—my conscience.

There was no reason to delay the hearing anymore, but since both the Magistrate and the Government lawyer were surprised, the Magistrate decided to wait before giving a decision. Meanwhile, I sent full details by wire to the Viceroy, my friends in Patna, and also to Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and others.

Before I could go to court to hear the sentence, the Magistrate sent me a written message saying the Lieutenant Governor had ordered the case against me to be dropped. The Collector also wrote to say I was free to carry out the planned inquiry and that officials would help me if I needed it. None of us expected such a quick and good result.

I visited the Collector, Mr. Heycock. He seemed like a good man who wanted to be fair. He told me I could ask to see any papers I wanted and I could come to see him anytime.

This was the country’s first clear example of Civil Disobedience. People talked about it a lot locally and in the newspapers, and my inquiry got more attention than I expected.

For my inquiry to work, the Government had to stay neutral.

But I didn’t need reporters or big articles in the press. Actually, the situation in Champaran was so sensitive that too much criticism or exaggerated reports could hurt the cause I was fighting for. So I wrote to the main newspaper editors asking them not to send reporters. I would send them whatever information they needed and keep them updated.

I knew the Government allowing me to stay upset the Champaran planters, and I also knew the officials probably didn’t like it, even though they couldn’t say anything openly.
