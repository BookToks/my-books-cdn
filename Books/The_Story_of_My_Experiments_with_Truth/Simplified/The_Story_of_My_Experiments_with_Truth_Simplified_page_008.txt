Volume I came out in 1927 and Volume II in 1929. The original book in Gujarati cost just one rupee and has been printed five times, with almost 50,000 copies sold.

The English version was only available as a special library edition, and it was too expensive for most Indian readers. People have wanted a cheaper version for a long time. Now, it is being released in one volume.

The translation was first published in parts in Young India and was checked by Gandhiji himself. It has been carefully revised again, especially the language, by a respected friend who is a well-known English expert. He asked that his name not be shared, and I agreed. I am very thankful to him.

Chapters 29 to 43 of Part V were translated by my friend Pyarelal while I was away in Bardoli during the Bardoli Inquiry in 1928-29.
