I failed my Latin exam. I felt bad but didn’t give up. I had started to like Latin, and I thought my French would get better if I tried again. I also wanted to pick a new science subject. Chemistry was my first choice, but it didn’t interest me because there were no experiments. It should have been interesting though. Chemistry was a required subject in India, so I picked it for my London exam. This time, I chose Heat and Light instead of Chemistry.

People said it was easy, and I found out they were right.

As I prepared to try again, I decided to make my life simpler. I thought my lifestyle didn’t match my family’s small income. It hurt me to think about my brother working hard to help me with money. I saw that many students who spent eight to fifteen pounds a month had scholarships. I also met poor students living more simply than me. One lived in a slum, paying two shillings a week for a room and eating cheap cocoa and bread for each meal. I didn’t want to live like him, but I thought I could have one room instead of two and cook some meals at home. That would save me four to five pounds a month. I found books about simple living and decided to stop renting a big place. I got one small room, bought a stove, and started cooking my own breakfast. It only took about twenty minutes to cook oatmeal and boil water for cocoa. I ate lunch outside and had bread and cocoa for dinner at home. This way, I lived on just a shilling and three pence a day. I studied hard during this time and passed my exam.

Don’t think that living simply made my life boring. Actually, the change made my inside feelings and outside life match better. It also fit better with my family’s money. My life felt more honest, and I was very happy inside.
