Shastri told him not to have the postponed meeting at all. The people who didn’t agree with my request understood the decision completely. It saved them from feeling uncomfortable and brought us closer as friends. When I took back my request, I truly became part of the Society.

Looking back, I realize it was better that I didn’t officially become a member, and those who opposed me were right. I also learned that we had very different opinions on important matters. But knowing our differences didn’t cause any hard feelings or distance between us. We stayed like brothers, and the Society’s home in Poona has always been a special place for me.

It’s true I never officially joined the Society, but I have always been a member in my heart. A spiritual connection is much more important than just a physical one. A physical connection without a spiritual one is like a body without a soul.
