Kitchin is someone we will learn more about later. These friends often made my wife very sad. Sadly, she went through a lot of hard times because of me.

This was the first time I had English friends living with me like family. When I stayed in English homes in England, I followed their ways, and it felt like living in a boarding house. But here, it was very different.

The English friends became part of my family. They started doing many things the Indian way. Even though the house looked Western inside, our daily life was mostly Indian.

I remember it was a bit hard to keep them as part of the family, but they had no problem feeling comfortable in my home. In Johannesburg, our friendship grew even stronger than in Durban.
