I told him to talk to his lawyer. I also said that if both sides could trust one person to decide the case, it would be over quickly. The lawyer’s fees were getting really high, almost using up all the money of the clients, who were big business people.

The case took up so much of their time that they couldn’t do any other work. Meanwhile, they started to dislike each other more and more. I began to hate the job. As lawyers, the lawyers had to argue for their own clients. I also saw for the first time that the winner never gets all the money back that they spent. The court had fixed rules about costs between the parties, but the real costs between lawyer and client were much higher. This was too much for me. I felt I should help both sides and bring them together. I worked hard to make a compromise happen. Finally, Tyeb Sheth agreed. They picked an arbitrator, the case was decided, and Dada Abdulla won.

But I wasn’t happy yet. If my client wanted to get all the money right away, Tyeb Sheth wouldn’t be able to pay it all. Among the Porbandar Meman community in South Africa, it was like an unspoken rule that bankruptcy was worse than death. Tyeb Sheth couldn’t pay the full amount of about £37,000 plus costs all at once. He wanted to pay the full amount but didn’t want to go bankrupt. There was only one solution. Dada Abdulla had to let him pay in smaller parts over time. He agreed to this, letting Tyeb Sheth pay in installments over a long period. It was harder to get this agreement than to get them to agree to arbitration. But both were happy in the end and gained respect from others. I was very happy too. I had learned the real meaning of being a lawyer. I had learned to see the good in people and understand their feelings. I realized that a lawyer’s real job was to bring people together when they were fighting. This lesson stayed with me, and for many years, I spent a lot of my time helping people settle their cases quietly.
