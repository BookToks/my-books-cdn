From the very first day I stayed with Gokhale, he made me feel right at home. He treated me like his younger brother and made sure I had everything I needed.

Luckily, I didn’t need much because I was used to taking care of myself. He really admired how I looked after myself, stayed clean, worked hard, and was always on time. He often praised me for these things.

He didn’t keep anything secret from me. He introduced me to all the important people who visited him. The one I remember most is Dr. (now Sir) P. C. Ray. He lived almost next door and came by very often.

Gokhale told me about Dr. Ray like this: “This is Prof. Ray, who earns Rs. 800 a month but only keeps Rs. 40 for himself and gives the rest to help the public. He is not married and doesn’t want to be.” I think Dr. Ray hasn’t changed much since then.

Dr. Ray’s clothes were simple, almost like they are now. Back then, he wore Indian mill-cloth, but now he wears Khadi. I loved listening to the talks between Gokhale and Dr. Ray because they were always about helping the public or teaching something useful. Sometimes their talks were tough because they criticized public leaders. This made me see that some people I thought were strong fighters were actually quite weak.

Watching Gokhale work was both fun and a great lesson. He never wasted time. All his friendships and private talks were for the good of the country. Everything he said was honest and true. He cared a lot about India’s poverty and how it was controlled by others. Many people tried to get him interested in different things, but he always told them, “You do your work. Let me do mine. What I want is freedom for my country.”
