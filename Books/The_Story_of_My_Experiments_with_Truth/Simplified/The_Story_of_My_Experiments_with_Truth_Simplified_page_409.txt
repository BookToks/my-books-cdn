Before I tell you about my life in India, I want to share some stories from my time in South Africa that I left out before.

Some lawyer friends have asked me to talk about my experiences as a lawyer. I have so many stories that if I told them all, it would fill a whole book and take me too far off topic. But I can share a few stories about how I always tried to be honest.

As far as I remember, I have already said that I never lied when I worked as a lawyer. I also did a lot of legal work for public causes without charging more than my basic expenses, and sometimes I paid even those myself. I thought I had said enough about my legal work, but my friends want me to say more. They believe that if I tell some stories about times I stayed truthful, other lawyers might learn from it.

When I was a student, I heard that being a lawyer meant you had to lie. But that didnâ€™t affect me because I never planned to get money or power by lying.

In South Africa, my honesty was tested many times. I often knew that the other side had prepared their witnesses to lie, and if I told my client or witnesses to lie too, we could win. But I always refused. I remember only one time after winning a case when I thought my client might have tricked me. Deep down, I wanted to win only when my client was truly right. When I set my fees, I never made them depend on winning or losing. Whether my client won or lost, I expected the same payment.

I told every new client from the start that I would not take a false case or help anyone lie. Because of this, I built a reputation, and no one ever brought me a false case.
