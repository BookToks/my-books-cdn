I read Max Muller's books, India – What Can It Teach Us? and the Upanishads translated by the Theosophical Society. These made me respect Hinduism more, and I started to see its beauty. But I didn’t stop liking other religions. I read Washington Irving's Life of Mahomet and His Successors and Carlyle’s praise of the Prophet. These books made me respect Muhammad more. I also read a book called The Sayings of Zarathustra.

This way, I learned more about different religions. Studying them made me think about myself and try to practice the things I liked. So, I began some Yoga exercises as best as I could from reading Hindu books. But I couldn’t go very far and decided to learn from an expert when I went back to India. That never happened.

I also studied Tolstoy’s books carefully. The Gospels in Brief, What to Do?, and others impressed me a lot. I started to understand more about the endless power of universal love.

Around the same time, I met another Christian family. They invited me to their Wesleyan church every Sunday and to dinner. But the church didn’t impress me. The sermons were boring, and the people didn’t seem very religious. They looked more like they were there for fun or out of habit. Sometimes I would even fall asleep during the service. I felt ashamed, but some neighbors did the same, so I felt a little better. I couldn’t keep going like that and soon stopped going to church.

My visits to that family ended suddenly.

Actually, I was told not to visit them anymore. Here’s what happened.

My hostess was a kind but narrow-minded woman. We often talked about religion. At that time, I was reading Arnold’s Light of Asia again.

We started to compare the lives of Jesus and Buddha.
