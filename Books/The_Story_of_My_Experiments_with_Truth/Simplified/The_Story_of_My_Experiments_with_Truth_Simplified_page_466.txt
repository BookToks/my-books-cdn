We didn’t just treat the I.D. officers badly; instead, we were polite and gave them all the information we could. This didn’t hurt us at all. In fact, having the C.I.D. officers there while statements were taken made the peasants braver. The peasants stopped being too scared of the C.I.D., but they were still careful not to exaggerate because they knew the C.I.D. was good at catching lies.

Since I didn’t want to upset the planters but wanted to win them over by being kind, I made sure to write to and meet with those planters who had serious complaints against them. I also met with the Planters’ Association, told them about the peasants’ problems, and listened to their side of the story. Some planters didn’t like me, some didn’t care, and a few were polite.
