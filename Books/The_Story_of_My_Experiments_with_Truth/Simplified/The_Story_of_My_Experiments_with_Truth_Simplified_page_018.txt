I don’t mind if every page talks only about my experiments. I believe, or at least hope, that sharing all these experiments will help the reader. People know about my political experiments, not just in India but also in some parts of the ‘civilized’ world.

For me, these experiments don’t mean much; and the title ‘Mahatma’ that came from them means even less. Sometimes, this title has hurt me a lot, and I can’t remember a single time when it made me happy.

But I really want to share my spiritual experiments, which only I know about. These gave me the strength I need for my political work. If these experiments are truly spiritual, then I shouldn’t brag about them. Instead, they should make me feel more humble.

The more I think about my past, the more I see my own limits.

What I want most—what I have been trying to reach for thirty years—is self-realization, to see God clearly, to reach Moksha (freedom from the cycle of life and death). I live my life chasing this goal. Everything I say and do, including my political work, is aimed at reaching it. I believe that if one person can do it, anyone can. So, I’ve done my experiments openly, not in secret, and I don’t think that makes them any less spiritual.

Some things only you and God can know. These can’t be shared. But the experiments I want to tell you about are not like that. They are spiritual, or better said, moral—because the heart of religion is about being good.

I will only include parts of religion that kids and adults can understand. If I tell these stories clearly and humbly, other people trying similar things might find them helpful. I’m not saying my experiments are perfect. Like a scientist who carefully tests things but never claims to know everything, I keep an open mind about what I’ve found.
