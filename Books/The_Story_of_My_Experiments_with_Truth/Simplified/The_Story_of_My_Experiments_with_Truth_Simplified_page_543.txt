FOUND AT LAST!

After wandering all over Gujarat, Gangabehn finally found the spinning wheel in Vijapur, in Baroda State. Many people there had spinning wheels at home, but they had been stored away in the attic because they thought they were useless. They told Gangabehn they would start spinning again if someone could give them a steady supply of slivers and buy the yarn they made.

Gangabehn shared this good news with me. Getting the slivers was hard. When I told Umar Sobani about it, he quickly agreed to send enough slivers from his mill. I sent these slivers to Gangabehn, and soon the yarn started coming in so fast that it was hard to keep up.

Umar Sobani was very kind, but I felt bad taking slivers from him all the time. Also, I thought it was wrong to use mill-slivers. If we could use mill-slivers, why not mill-yarn? The old ways didn’t get slivers from mills. So, I told Gangabehn to find carders who could make slivers. She took on the job confidently.

She hired a carder ready to card cotton, who asked for thirty-five rupees or more each month. I didn’t mind paying. She trained some young people to make slivers from the carded cotton. I asked for cotton in Bombay, and Yashvantprasad Desai helped right away. Gangabehn’s work did better than we thought. She even found weavers to weave the yarn from Vijapur, and soon Vijapur Khadi became well-known.

While this was happening in Vijapur, the spinning wheel also became popular at the Ashram. Maganlal Gandhi used his great mechanical skills to improve the wheel, and they started making wheels and parts at the Ashram. The first Khadi cloth made there cost 17 annas per yard. I didn’t hesitate to recommend this rough cloth to friends, who happily paid the price.
