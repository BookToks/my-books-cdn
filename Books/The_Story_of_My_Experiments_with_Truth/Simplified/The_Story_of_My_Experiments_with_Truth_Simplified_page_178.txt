It was hard to visit members outside Durban often. People were excited one moment but lost interest the next. Even members in Durban had to be reminded many times before they paid their fees.

I was the secretary, so it was my job to collect the subscriptions. At one point, I had to keep my helper busy all day collecting money. He got tired, and I realized it would be better if people paid once a year instead of every month, and paid in advance. I called a meeting to suggest this.

Everyone liked the idea of paying yearly instead of monthly, and setting the minimum fee at £3. This made collecting money much easier.

From the start, I learned not to do public work using borrowed money.

People usually kept their promises except when it came to money. They were slow to pay what they promised, and the Natal Indians were no different.

Because we only worked when we had money, the Natal Indian Congress never owed anyone.

My team was very excited to ask members for money. They enjoyed the work and learned a lot from it. Many people happily gave cash subscriptions. But it was harder to work in faraway villages.

People there didn’t understand public work well. Still, we were invited to visit far places, and important merchants welcomed us kindly.

One time, during this trip, things got tough. We expected our host to give £6, but he only offered £3. If we had accepted that, others would have given less too, and our fundraising would have failed. It was late at night, and we were all hungry. But we couldn’t eat before getting the full amount we wanted. We tried to convince him, but he wouldn’t change his mind.
