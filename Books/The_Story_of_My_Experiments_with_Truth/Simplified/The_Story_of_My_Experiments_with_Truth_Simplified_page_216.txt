There were the usual prayers and rituals, but they didn’t feel as serious as during that scary time.

The storm made me feel connected to the other passengers. I wasn’t very scared because I had been through storms like this before. I’m a good sailor and don’t get seasick. So, I moved around the passengers without fear, trying to cheer them up and giving them updates from the captain every hour.

The friendships I made during this time helped me a lot later on, as you will see.

The ship dropped anchor in Durban port on the 18th or 19th of December. The Naderi ship arrived the same day.

But the biggest challenge was still ahead.
