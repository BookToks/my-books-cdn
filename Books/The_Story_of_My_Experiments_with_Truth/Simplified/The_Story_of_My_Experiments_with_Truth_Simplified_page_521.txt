A person has to follow the laws of society very carefully before they can decide which rules are fair and which are unfair. Only after this can they have the right to disobey certain laws in the right situations. My mistake was that I asked people to start disobeying laws before they were ready for it, and this felt like a huge error to me.

When I went back to the Kheda district, I remembered the old Kheda Satyagraha struggle and wondered how I missed something so clear. I understood that before people can take part in civil disobedience, they need to fully understand what it really means. So, before starting civil disobedience on a large scale again, we needed a group of trusted, honest volunteers who knew the strict rules of Satyagraha well. They could teach others and watch carefully to keep everyone on the right path.

With these thoughts, I reached Bombay and created a group of Satyagraha volunteers through the Satyagraha Sabha. With their help, I began teaching people what Satyagraha means and why it is important. We mainly used leaflets to explain these ideas.

But while we were doing this, I saw it was hard to get people interested in the peaceful side of Satyagraha. Not many volunteers joined, and those who did often didnâ€™t get regular training. Over time, fewer new people joined instead of more.

I realized that training people for civil disobedience would take longer than I first thought.
