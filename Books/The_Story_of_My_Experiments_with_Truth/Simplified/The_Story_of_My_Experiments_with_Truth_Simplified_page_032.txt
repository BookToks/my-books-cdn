PLAYING THE HUSBAND

Around the time I got married, small booklets that cost very little were being shared. They talked about love between husband and wife, saving money, child marriages, and other topics. Whenever I found one, I read it from start to finish. I had a habit of forgetting what I didn’t like and following the advice I did like. One thing that stuck with me was the idea that a husband should always be faithful to his wife. I was naturally honest, so cheating was never an option for me. Also, I was very young, so being unfaithful wasn’t really something I thought about.

But this lesson about being faithful made me think, “If I have to be faithful, my wife should be too.” This thought made me jealous. I felt it was my right to expect her to be faithful, so I watched her closely. Even though I had no real reason to doubt her, I couldn’t stop being suspicious. She couldn’t go anywhere without asking me first. This caused a lot of fights between us. It felt like I was locking her up.

Kasturbai was not the type of girl to accept that. She made sure to go out whenever and wherever she wanted. The more I tried to control her, the more she pushed back, and I became angrier.

We ended up not talking to each other a lot. I think Kasturbai didn’t mean to be difficult. How could a simple girl accept being stopped from going to the temple or visiting friends? If I had the right to set rules for her, didn’t she also have the right to do as she pleased? I understand all this now. But back then, I felt I had to prove I was the boss.

Still, don’t think our life was always full of fights and sadness.
