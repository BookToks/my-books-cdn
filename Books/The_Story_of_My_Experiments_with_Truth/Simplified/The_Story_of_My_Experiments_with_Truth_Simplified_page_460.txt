The Congress was hardly known in that area. Even people who had heard about the Congress were afraid to join or even talk about it. Now, the Congress and its members had come to this place, but not under the Congress name, though in a much stronger way.

I talked with my team and we decided not to do anything in the name of the Congress. We wanted real work, not just a name or show. The Government and the planters saw the Congress as a big problem. To them, the Congress meant lawyers arguing, breaking laws cleverly, bombs, crime, fake talks, and lies. We wanted to prove them wrong. So, we chose not to mention the Congress or tell the peasants about it. We thought it was enough if they understood and followed what the Congress stood for, not just the name.

No one was sent there, openly or secretly, to prepare the peasants for us. Rajkumar Shukla couldn’t reach the many peasants. No political work had been done with them. The peasants didn’t know about the world outside Champaran. Still, they welcomed me like we had been friends forever. It’s not an exaggeration to say that meeting the peasants felt like meeting God, Ahimsa (non-violence), and Truth.

When I think about why I felt this way, I realize it was because I love the people. And this love comes from my strong belief in Ahimsa.

That day in Champaran was unforgettable for me and a very important day for the peasants too.

By law, I was supposed to be on trial, but really, the Government was the one being tested. The Commissioner only managed to trap the Government in the trap he had set for me.
