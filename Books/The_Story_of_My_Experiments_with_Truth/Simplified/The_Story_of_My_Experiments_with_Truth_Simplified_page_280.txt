FAITH ON ITS TRIAL  

Even though I had rented an office in the Fort and a house in Girgaum, God didn’t let me settle down. Soon after moving into the new house, my second son Manilal, who had already had smallpox a few years earlier, got very sick with typhoid, pneumonia, and was confused at night.  

The doctor came to see him. He said medicine wouldn’t help much, but eggs and chicken broth might be good for him.  

Manilal was only ten years old. I couldn’t ask him what he wanted.  

As his guardian, I had to make the decision. The doctor was a good Parsi man. I told him we were all vegetarians and I couldn’t give my son eggs or chicken broth. I asked if he could suggest something else.  

“Your son’s life is in danger,” the doctor said. “We could give him milk mixed with water, but that won’t give him enough strength. Many Hindu families accept what I prescribe. I think you should be less strict for your son’s sake.”  

“You’re right as a doctor,” I said. “But I have a big responsibility. If he were older, I would ask what he wanted and respect that. But now, I have to think for him. I believe that a person should not eat meat, eggs, or things like that, even to stay alive. Religion, as I see it, does not allow me to use meat or eggs for myself or my family, even in times like this. So I have to take the risk you mentioned. But please, I want to try some water treatments I know about instead. I don’t know how to check his pulse or lungs properly, so if you could come by sometimes to examine him and tell me how he’s doing, I would be very thankful.”
