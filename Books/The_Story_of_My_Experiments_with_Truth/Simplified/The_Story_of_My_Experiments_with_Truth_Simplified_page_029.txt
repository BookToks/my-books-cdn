Everyone tried to outdo each other by preparing more and different kinds of food. Women, whether they could sing well or not, sang loudly until they lost their voices, got sick, and annoyed their neighbors. The neighbors quietly put up with all the noise, mess, and leftover food because they knew one day they would be doing the same thing.

My older family members thought it would be better to have all the celebrations at once. It would cost less and be more impressive. They believed spending money once instead of three times was smarter. My father and uncle were old, and we were the last children they had to marry off. They probably wanted to enjoy one big, final celebration. So, they decided on having a triple wedding, and as I said before, we spent months getting ready for it.

We only found out about the event because of all the preparations. To me, it just meant new clothes, drum sounds, wedding parades, fancy dinners, and a new girl to play with. Feeling attracted to someone came later. I want to skip over the embarrassing parts, except for a few details I think are important. I will share those later, but they don’t change the main story I want to tell.

My brother and I were taken from Rajkot to Porbandar. There were some funny little things that happened before the main event, like covering ourselves with turmeric paste, but I won’t talk about those.

My father worked as a Diwan, a kind of servant, and was especially loyal to the Thakore Saheb. The Thakore wouldn’t let him leave until the last moment. When he finally did, the Thakore arranged special stage coaches to make the trip faster by two days. But things didn’t go as planned.

Porbandar is 120 miles from Rajkot, usually a five-day cart ride. My father made it in three days, but the coach overturned on the third day, and he got badly hurt. He arrived covered in bandages. His and our excitement for the wedding was partly ruined, but the ceremony still had to happen.
