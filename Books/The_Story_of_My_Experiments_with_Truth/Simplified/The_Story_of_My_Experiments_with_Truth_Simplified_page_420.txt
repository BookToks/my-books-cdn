THE FIRST EXPERIENCE

Before I got home, the group that had started from Phoenix was already there. According to our original plan, I was supposed to get there before them, but my focus on the war in England messed up our plans. When I realized I had to stay in England for a long time, I had to figure out where the Phoenix group could stay. I wanted them all to stay together in India and live like they did at Phoenix. I didn’t know any Ashram to suggest, so I told them to meet Mr. Andrews and follow his advice.

First, they stayed at the Gurukul in Kangri, where the late Swami Shraddhanandji treated them like his own children. After that, they went to the Shantiniketan Ashram, where the Poet and his people showed them the same love. The things they experienced at both places helped them and me a lot.

The Poet, Shraddhanandji, and Principal Sushil Rudra, as I told Andrews, made up this special group. When I was in South Africa, I often talked about them and my good memories from there. Mr. Andrews also talked about this great group all the time, and his stories were always some of the nicest and clearest ones. Mr. Andrews also helped the Phoenix group meet Sushil Rudra. Principal Rudra didn’t have an Ashram, but he opened his home to the Phoenix family. Within a day, his people made them feel so at home that they didn’t miss Phoenix at all.

I only found out the Phoenix group was at Shantiniketan when I landed in Bombay. So, I was eager to meet them as soon as possible after my meeting with Gokhale.

The welcome I got in Bombay gave me a chance to do a small Satyagraha.
