Working as a lawyer was not my main job. I needed to focus more on public work to make my time in Natal worth it.

Just sending the petition about the voting law wasn’t enough. We had to keep pushing to get the attention of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. So, we decided to create a permanent group for this.

I talked to Sheth Abdulla and some friends, and we all agreed to start a public organization that would last.

Picking a name for the group was really hard. We didn’t want to be linked to any political party. I knew the word "Congress" wasn’t liked by the Conservatives in England, but Congress was very important in India. I wanted people in Natal to know it too. It felt weak to be scared of using the name. So, I explained my reasons and suggested calling it the Natal Indian Congress. On May 22nd, the Natal Indian Congress was formed.

On that day, Abdulla’s big room was full of people. Everyone liked the idea of the Congress. The rules were simple, but membership fees were high. You had to pay five shillings every month to join. Rich people were asked to pay as much as they could. Abdulla Sheth promised £2 a month. Two other friends did the same. I decided to pay one pound a month, which was a lot for me, but I wanted to do my part. Luckily, I was able to manage it. Many others paid one pound a month too, and even more paid ten shillings.

We also got donations, which we were very thankful for.

Experience showed us that people didn’t pay their fees just because we asked.
