The question is tricky. People can have different opinions about it. So, I have explained my thoughts clearly to those who believe in ahimsa (non-violence) and who seriously try to live by it in every part of their lives.

A person who truly cares about the Truth should not just follow what everyone else does. They must always be ready to admit if they are wrong. And whenever they find out they made a mistake, they should honestly say so and try to make up for it.
