When I was in Johannesburg, I had up to four Indian clerks working for me. They felt more like my sons than just helpers. But even with them, I didn’t have enough help. I needed someone who could type because I was the only one who knew how. I taught two clerks to type, but their English wasn’t good enough to do the job well. I also wanted to train one as an accountant. 

I couldn’t find anyone from Natal because no one could enter the Transvaal without a special permit. I didn’t want to ask the Permit Officer for a favor just for my convenience. I was really stuck. 

Bills were piling up fast, and it felt impossible to handle both my work and public duties by myself. I was ready to hire a European clerk, but I wasn’t sure if a white man or woman would work for a colored man like me. 

Still, I decided to try. I asked a typewriter agent I knew to find me a stenographer. He found a Scottish girl named Miss Dick, who had just arrived from Scotland. She needed a job and didn’t mind working honestly wherever she could. The agent sent her to me, and I liked her right away. 

I asked, “Do you mind working for an Indian?” She said, “Not at all.” Then I asked about her salary expectations. She said, “Would £17/10s be too much?” I told her it wasn’t if she did good work and asked when she could start. She said, “Right now, if you want.” I was very happy and began dictating letters to her immediately. 

Soon, she felt more like a daughter or sister than just a stenographer. I hardly ever had to complain about her work. I trusted her with managing thousands of pounds and she took care of the account books.
