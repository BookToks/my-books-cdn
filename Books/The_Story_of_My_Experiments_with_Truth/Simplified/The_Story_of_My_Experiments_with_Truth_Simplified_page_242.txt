SIMPLE LIFE

I had started living an easy and comfortable life, but it didn’t last long.

Even though I had carefully decorated the house, it didn’t really feel like home to me. So, soon after I began this life, I started cutting down on my spending. The laundry bill was high, and the washerman wasn’t very reliable. I needed two to three dozen shirts and collars because collars had to be changed every day, and shirts at least every other day. This cost a lot, and I thought it was unnecessary. So, I bought washing supplies to do it myself. I also got a book on washing, learned how to do it, and taught my wife. It was extra work, but because it was new to me, it was fun.

I will never forget the first collar I washed myself. I used too much starch, didn’t heat the iron enough, and was too scared to press it hard because I thought I might burn it. The collar was stiff, but the extra starch kept falling off. I went to court wearing that collar, and my fellow lawyers made fun of me. But I didn’t care about their jokes.

I said, “Well, this is my first try at washing my own collars, so the starch is loose. But it doesn’t bother me, and at least I’m giving you something to laugh about.” A friend asked, “But there are laundries here, right?”

I answered, “The laundry bill is very expensive. Washing a collar costs almost as much as buying a new one. Plus, you always have to rely on the washerman. I’d much rather wash my clothes myself.” But my friends didn’t understand why I liked doing it myself. Over time, I got really good at washing my clothes, and my collars looked just as nice as the ones from the laundry. They were just as stiff and shiny.

When Gokhale came to South Africa, he had a scarf given to him by Mahadeo Govind Ranade. He took great care of it and only used it on special occasions.
