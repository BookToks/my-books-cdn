When they first allowed Indian workers to come, they didn’t expect them to be so good at business. They could be accepted as farmers, but their success in trade was not wanted.

This caused people to start disliking Indians. Many other reasons made this feeling stronger. Our different ways of living, our simple lifestyle, being happy with small earnings, not caring much about hygiene and cleanliness, being slow to keep our places tidy, and being careful with money when fixing our homes – all these, plus our different religions, made the dislike worse. This feeling showed up in laws that took away voting rights and put a tax on Indian workers. Even before these laws, there were already small problems started against us.

The first idea was to send Indian workers back to India so their work contracts would end there. But the Indian Government didn’t agree to this. So another plan was made: 1. Workers should go back to India when their contract ended; or 2. They should sign a new contract every two years with a raise each time; and 3. If they didn’t want to go back or renew the contract, they had to pay a yearly tax of £25.

Sir Henry Binns and Mr. Mason went to India to get the Indian Government’s approval. The Viceroy then was Lord Elgin. He didn’t like the £25 tax but agreed to a smaller tax of £3. I thought then, and still think, this was a big mistake by the Viceroy. He didn’t think about India’s interests. It wasn’t his job to help the Europeans in Natal this way. After a few years, an Indian worker with his wife and each son over 16 and daughter over 13 had to pay this tax.
