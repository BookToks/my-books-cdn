AT NAGPUR

The decisions made at the special Congress meeting in Calcutta were to be confirmed at the annual session in Nagpur. Just like in Calcutta, many visitors and delegates came to Nagpur. The number of delegates was not limited yet. As far as I remember, about fourteen thousand people attended this time. Lalaji suggested a small change to the rule about boycotting schools, and I agreed to it.

Some changes were also made because of Deshabandhu, and after that, the non-cooperation resolution was accepted by everyone.

The session also discussed changing the Congress constitution. A draft was shared at the Calcutta meeting and talked about a lot. At the Nagpur session, where the final decision was made, Sjt. C. Vijayaraghavacharia was the President. The Subjects Committee approved the draft but made one important change. In my draft, the number of delegates was set at about 1,500; the Subjects Committee changed it to 6,000. I think this increase was a mistake, and years of experience have proved me right. I believe having many delegates does not help run things better or protect democracy. Fifteen hundred delegates who care about the people, are open-minded and honest, are much better for democracy than six thousand careless people picked randomly. To protect democracy, people need to feel independent, proud, and united, and they should only choose good and honest representatives. But the Subjects Committee was focused on numbers and wanted even more than six thousand. So six thousand was just a compromise.

The question about what the Congressâ€™s goal should be was also discussed intensely.
