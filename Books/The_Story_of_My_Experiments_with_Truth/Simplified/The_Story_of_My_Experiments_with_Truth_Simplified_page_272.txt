I was traveling from Calcutta to Rajkot and planned to stop at Benares, Agra, Jaipur, and Palanpur along the way. I didn’t have time to visit more places than these. In each city, I stayed for one day and lived in dharmashalas or with pandas like regular pilgrims, except at Palanpur. I think I didn’t spend more than Rs. 31 on the whole trip, including train tickets.  

When traveling third class, I usually chose ordinary trains instead of mail trains because mail trains were more crowded and cost more.  

The third class train compartments were almost as dirty and had just as bad toilet facilities as before. Maybe things have gotten a little better now, but the difference between first and third class is way bigger than the difference in price. Third class passengers are treated like sheep, and their comfort is like that of sheep.  

In Europe, I traveled third class most of the time — and only once first class to see what it was like — but there I didn’t see such a big difference between first and third class. In South Africa, many third class passengers are Black people, yet third class there is better than here. Sometimes, third class compartments even have beds and cushioned seats. Also, they make sure the compartments aren’t too crowded, but here they often are.  

The railway officials don’t care much about the comfort of third class passengers. Combined with the dirty and rude habits of some passengers, traveling third class can be very hard for someone who likes to stay clean.  

These bad habits usually include throwing trash on the floor, smoking anytime and anywhere, chewing betel and tobacco, turning the whole carriage into a spittoon, shouting and yelling, and using bad language without caring if it bothers other passengers.
