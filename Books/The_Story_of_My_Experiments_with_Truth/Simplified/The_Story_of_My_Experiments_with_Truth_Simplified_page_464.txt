METHODS OF WORK

To fully explain the Champaran inquiry, I would have to tell the whole history of the Champaran farmers, which is too much for these chapters. The inquiry was a brave test of Truth and non-violence, and I am sharing only what I think is important from that view each week. For more details, readers can look at Rajendra Prasad’s history of the Champaran Satyagraha in Hindi. I hear an English version is coming out soon.

Now, back to the topic. We couldn’t do the inquiry in Gorakh Babu’s house because that would have meant asking poor Gorakh Babu to leave. Also, the people of Motihari were still too scared to rent a house to us. But Brajkishore Babu cleverly found a place with some open space, and we moved there.

We needed money to do the work, but until then, no one had asked the public for money for this kind of work. Brajkishore Babu and his friends were mostly lawyers who gave money themselves or got it from their friends when needed.

They thought, why ask the poor people to pay when they and their group could afford it? I decided not to take anything from the Champaran farmers because it might be misunderstood. I also chose not to ask the whole country for money because that could make the inquiry seem political and all-India.

Some friends from Bombay offered Rs. 15,000, but I politely refused. Instead, I planned to get money from rich Biharis living outside Champaran with Brajkishore Babu’s help. If we needed more, I would ask my friend Dr. P.J. Mehta in Rangoon. Dr. Mehta happily agreed to help.

So, we didn’t worry about money. We didn’t need much because we wanted to spend very carefully, knowing how poor Champaran was. In the end, we found we didn’t need a large amount at all.
