I noticed problems in Hinduism that bothered me a lot. If untouchability was part of Hinduism, then it had to be a bad and ugly part. I didn’t understand why there were so many different groups and castes. What did it really mean to say the Vedas were the inspired Word of God? If that was true, then why couldn’t the Bible and the Koran be inspired too?

My Christian friends were trying to convert me, and so were my Muslim friends. Abdulla Sheth kept encouraging me to learn about Islam, and he often talked about how beautiful it was.

I wrote a letter to Raychandbhai to share my doubts. I also wrote to other religious leaders in India and got replies from them.

Raychandbhai’s letter helped calm me down a bit. He told me to be patient and to study Hinduism more carefully. He said something like, “If you look at it without bias, no other religion has the deep and thoughtful ideas of Hinduism, its understanding of the soul, or its kindness.” I bought Sale’s translation of the Koran and started reading it. I also got other books about Islam. I talked with Christian friends in England, and one of them introduced me to Edward Maitland, who I started writing letters to.

He sent me a book called The Perfect Way, which he wrote with Anna Kingsford. The book rejected the usual Christian beliefs. He also sent me another book called The New Interpretation of the Bible. I liked both books because they seemed to support Hinduism. Tolstoy’s The Kingdom of God Is Within You really amazed me. It made a strong impact on me. Compared to this book, the ones Mr. Coates gave me seemed less important.

My reading and thinking took me in a direction nobody expected from my Christian friends.

I kept writing to Edward Maitland for quite a while, and I also kept writing to Raychandbhai until he passed away. I read some of the books Raychandbhai sent me.

These included Panchikaran, Maniratnamala, Mumukshu Prakaran of Yogavasistha, Haribhadra Suri’s Shaddarshana Samuchchaya, and others.
