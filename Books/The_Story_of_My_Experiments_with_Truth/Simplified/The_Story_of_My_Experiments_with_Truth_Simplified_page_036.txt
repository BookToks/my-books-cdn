At first, I thought gymnastics had nothing to do with education. Now I understand that physical training is just as important as mental training.

I should say that I wasn’t hurt by skipping exercise. That’s because I liked reading about the benefits of long walks outside, so I made a habit of walking, which I still do. These walks helped me stay healthy.

The reason I didn’t like gymnastics was because I really wanted to take care of my father. As soon as school finished, I would rush home to help him. Gymnastics was required, and it got in the way of this. I asked Mr. Gimi to let me skip gymnastics so I could care for my dad, but he said no. 

One Saturday, we had school in the morning and gymnastics at 4 pm. I didn’t have a watch, and the clouds tricked me. By the time I got to school, all the boys had left. The next day, Mr. Gimi saw I was marked absent. When I explained, he didn’t believe me and made me pay a fine, though I don’t remember how much.

Being called a liar hurt me a lot. I didn’t know how to prove I was telling the truth. I cried because I felt so sad. That made me realize that being honest means also being careful. This was the only time I was careless at school. I think I finally got the fine taken away. My dad wrote to the headmaster to let me skip exercise so I could stay home after school.

Even though skipping exercise didn’t hurt me, I still regret another mistake. I didn’t think good handwriting was important until I went to England. Later, especially in South Africa, I saw how neat and beautiful the handwriting of lawyers and young men was. I felt ashamed and sorry for not paying attention to my handwriting.
