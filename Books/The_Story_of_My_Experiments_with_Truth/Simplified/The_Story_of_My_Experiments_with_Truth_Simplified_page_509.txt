Kasturi Ranga Iyengar invited me, but the person who really invited me, as I later found out on my way to Madras, was Rajagopalachari.

This was probably the first time I met him; at least it was the first time we got to know each other personally.

Rajagopalachari had just recently moved from Salem to Madras to start working as a lawyer because his friends, like the late Sjt. Kasturi Ranga Iyengar, asked him to. He wanted to be more involved in public life.

We stayed with him in Madras. I only realized this after staying for a couple of days because the house belonged to Sjt. Kasturi Ranga Iyengar, so I thought we were his guests. But Mahadev Desai corrected me. He quickly became good friends with Rajagopalachari, who was naturally shy and stayed in the background. Mahadev warned me, “You should get close to this man,” and so I did.

Every day, we talked about plans for the fight, but besides holding public meetings, I didn’t know what else to do. I was confused about how to use civil disobedience against the Rowlatt Bill if it became law. You could only disobey it if the Government gave you a chance. If not, could we disobey other laws? And if yes, where should we stop? These questions were the main topic of our talks.

Sjt. Kasturi Ranga Iyengar gathered a small group of leaders to discuss the issue. One important person there was Sjt. Vijayaraghavachari. He suggested I should write a detailed guide about Satyagraha, including even small details. I felt the job was too big for me and told him so.

While we were still thinking about this, we heard that the Rowlatt Bill had become a law. That night, I fell asleep thinking about it. Early in the morning, I woke up a bit earlier than usual. I was still half asleep when suddenly an idea came to me — it felt like a dream.
