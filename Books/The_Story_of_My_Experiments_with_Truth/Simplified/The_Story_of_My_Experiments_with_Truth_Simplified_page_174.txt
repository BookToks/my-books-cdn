He talked to me openly and asked about my background, which I told him. Then he said, "I have nothing against you. I was just worried you might be some adventurer born in the colonies. Also, you didn’t send the original certificate with your application, which made me suspicious. Some people have used fake diplomas. The character certificates from European traders you gave me don’t mean much. What do they really know about you? How well do they know you?"

I said, "Everyone here is new to me. Even Sheth Abdulla only met me here." He replied, "But you say he’s from the same place as you? If your father was Prime Minister there, Sheth Abdulla must know your family. If you bring his affidavit, I won’t object at all. I would then tell the Law Society I can’t oppose your application."

This made me angry, but I stayed calm. I thought, "If I had sent Abdulla’s certificate, they would have rejected it and asked for European ones. What does my birth or background have to do with being admitted as an advocate? How can my birth, whether low or bad, be used against me?" I answered quietly, "I don’t agree that the Law Society has the right to ask for all this, but I’m ready to give the affidavit you want."

We prepared Sheth Abdulla’s affidavit and gave it to the Law Society’s lawyer. He said he was satisfied. But the Law Society still opposed my application in the Supreme Court. The court rejected their opposition without even asking Mr. Escombe to reply. The Chief Justice basically said, "Not sending the original certificate is not a real problem. If he lied in the affidavit, he can be punished, and his name can be removed from the list if proven guilty."
