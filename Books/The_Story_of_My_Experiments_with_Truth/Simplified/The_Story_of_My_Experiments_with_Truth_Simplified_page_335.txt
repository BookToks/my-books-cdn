THE MAGIC SPELL OF A BOOK

The black plague made me more important to the poor Indians and increased my work and responsibilities. Some of my new friends among the Europeans became so close that I felt more responsible for them too.

I met Mr. Polak at a vegetarian restaurant, just like I met Mr. West. One evening, a young man eating nearby sent me his card, asking to meet me. I invited him to join my table, and he did.

"I am the sub-editor of The Critic," he said. "When I read your letter about the plague, I really wanted to meet you. I’m happy we can talk now." Mr. Polak was honest, and I liked him right away. That evening, we got to know each other and found we thought alike about important things in life.

He liked living simply. He was great at turning ideas into action quickly and completely. Some changes he made in his life were fast and big.

Indian Opinion was costing more money every day. The first report from Mr. West was worrying. He wrote: "I don’t think the business will make as much money as you hoped. It might even lose money. The books are a mess. There is a lot of money owed, but no clear way to fix it. We will have to work hard to sort it out. But don’t worry. I will do my best to fix things. I’ll stay, whether we make money or not." Mr. West could have left when he found out there was no profit, and I wouldn’t have blamed him. Actually, he had the right to be upset with me for saying the business was profitable without proof. But he never complained. Still, I think he started to see me as a bit too trusting because I had just believed what I was told.
