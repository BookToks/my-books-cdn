But I didnâ€™t feel like talking.

I started thinking about what I had to do. Should I fight for my rights, go back to India, or keep going to Pretoria without caring about the insults and then return to India after the case was over? Running back to India without finishing what I started would be like being a coward. The problems I was facing were just a small part of a bigger problem called color prejudice. I wanted to try to stop this problem, even if it meant going through hard times. I would only ask for help to fix the color prejudice.

So, I decided to take the next train to Pretoria.

The next morning, I sent a long message to the General Manager of the Railway and also told Abdulla Sheth. Abdulla met the General Manager right away. The Manager said the railway people were right but told him he had told the Station Master to make sure I got to my destination safely. Abdulla sent messages to Indian business people in Maritzburg and friends in other places to meet me and help me. The merchants came to the station and tried to make me feel better by telling me their own hard experiences. They said what happened to me was normal. They also said that Indians traveling in first or second class always had to expect problems with railway staff and white passengers. I spent the day listening to their sad stories. In the evening, the train came. A seat was reserved for me. At Maritzburg, I bought the bedding ticket I had refused to buy in Durban.

The train took me to Charlestown.
