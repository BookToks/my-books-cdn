When none of my usual treatments worked, I begged her to stop eating salt and pulses. But she refused, no matter how much I asked, even when I gave reasons from experts. Finally, she challenged me, saying that even I couldn’t give up these foods if someone told me to. I felt both hurt and happy—happy because I could show her how much I cared. I told her, "You’re wrong. If I were sick and the doctor told me to stop eating these or any other foods, I would do it without hesitation. In fact, without any doctor’s advice, I will give up salt and pulses for one whole year, whether you do or not."

She was shocked and said sadly, "Please forgive me. I shouldn’t have challenged you. I promise to stop eating these things, but please take back your promise. It’s too hard for me." I told her, "It’s good for you to give up these foods. I’m sure you will feel better without them. But I can’t take back my promise. It will help me, because any kind of self-control is good for people. So please leave me alone. This will be a test for me and will help you stick to your decision." She gave up trying to change me and said through tears, "You’re too stubborn. You won’t listen to anyone."

I like to think of this moment as an example of Satyagraha (nonviolent resistance), and it’s one of my happiest memories.

After this, Kasturbai got better quickly—whether it was because of the saltless and pulseless diet, the other changes in her food, my careful watch over her habits, or the positive feeling from this event, I don’t know. But she recovered fast, the bleeding stopped, and I got a bit of a reputation as a doctor.

As for me, I felt better from giving up these things. I didn’t miss them at all, the year went by quickly, and I found my desires were calmer than ever before.
