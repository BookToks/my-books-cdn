So the lancers rushed through the crowd without really knowing where they were going. I don’t think they could see what they were doing at all. It was a really scary and messy scene. The horsemen and the people were all mixed up in a crazy way.

Because of this, the crowd broke apart and stopped moving forward. Our car was then allowed to go ahead. I made it stop in front of the Commissioner’s office, and I got out to complain to him about how the police were acting.
