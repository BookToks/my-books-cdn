RUMBLINGS OF THE STORM This was my first trip with my wife and kids. I have often noticed that in middle-class Hindu families, husbands are usually educated but wives are not. Because of this, there is a big gap between them, and the husband has to teach his wife. So, I had to decide what my wife and kids should wear, what food they should eat, and how they should behave in their new environment. Some memories from those days are funny to think about now.

A Hindu wife believes she must always obey her husband completely.

A Hindu husband thinks he is the boss and his wife should always serve him.

Back then, I thought that to seem civilized, our clothes and manners should be as close to European styles as possible. I believed that only this way could we have some influence, and without influence, we couldn’t help our community.

So, I picked the clothes for my wife and kids. I didn’t want people to call them Kathiawad Banias. The Parsis were seen as the most civilized Indians at the time, so when full European style didn’t seem right, we chose the Parsi style.

My wife wore a Parsi sari, and the boys wore Parsi coats and trousers. Of course, everyone had to wear shoes and socks. It took a long time for my wife and kids to get used to them. The shoes hurt their feet, and the socks smelled bad from sweat. Their toes often got sore. I always had answers for their complaints, but I think it was more my authority that made them agree.

They accepted the new clothes because they had no choice. They also reluctantly started using knives and forks.

When my excitement about these signs of being civilized faded, they stopped using the knives and forks.
