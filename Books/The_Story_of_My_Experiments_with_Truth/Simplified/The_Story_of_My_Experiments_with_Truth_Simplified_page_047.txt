At that time, I understood how important Brahmacharya is. I realized that a wife is not a slave to her husband, but his partner and helper. She shares both his happiness and sadness and has the same freedom as him to make her own choices.

When I remember those dark times filled with doubt and suspicion, I feel ashamed of how foolish and cruel I was because of my selfish desires. I also regret how blindly I trusted my friend.
