“How will the confession you made to me help you?” I asked gently.

“Of course, I’ll do whatever you advise, but won’t you also talk to my old lawyer, Mr. _____? He’s a friend too,” said Parsi Rustomji.

We found out that the smuggling had been happening for a long time, but the actual crime involved only a small amount of money. We went to his lawyer. He looked over the papers and said, “The case will be decided by a jury, and a Natal jury is very unlikely to let an Indian go free. But I won’t lose hope.” I didn’t know this lawyer well. Parsi Rustomji interrupted, “Thank you, but I want to follow Mr. Gandhi’s advice on this. He knows me well. Of course, you can help him when needed.” After deciding not to rely on the lawyer, we went to Parsi Rustomji’s shop.

I explained my opinion to him: “I don’t think this case should even go to court. It’s up to the Customs Officer to decide if he wants to press charges or let you go, and he will listen to the Attorney General. I’m ready to talk to both of them. I suggest you offer to pay whatever fine they decide, and chances are they will agree. But if they don’t, you have to be ready to go to jail. I believe the real shame isn’t going to jail, but committing the crime in the first place. The wrong has already been done. Going to jail should be seen as a punishment. The real punishment is deciding never to smuggle again.” Parsi Rustomji didn’t take this very well at first. He was brave, but he was scared for a moment. His name and reputation were on the line, and he worried about what would happen if everything he had worked hard for fell apart.

“Well, I’ve told you,” he said, “I’m completely in your hands. Do whatever you think is best.” I used all my powers of persuasion on this case. I met the Customs Officer and honestly told him everything. I also promised to give him all the books and told him how sorry Parsi Rustomji felt.
