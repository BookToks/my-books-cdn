My idea is to have women spin yarn and make clothes for the people of India using Khadi fabric made from it. I don’t know how successful this movement will be yet because it’s just getting started. But I believe in it completely.

At least, it can’t do any harm. If it helps make even a small amount more cloth for the country, that will be a real benefit. So, you can see that my movement doesn’t have the problems you mentioned.

He replied, “If your movement aims to increase cloth production, I don’t have any objections. Whether spinning wheels can compete with modern machines is another question. But I wish you all the best.”
