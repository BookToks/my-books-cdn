I learned a lot from my own life and mistakes. I wanted to find the truth by trying different things and seeing what worked best. It wasnâ€™t always easy, but I kept trying because I believed it was important.

Sometimes, I failed or made wrong choices, but those experiences helped me grow. I thought being honest with myself and others was the key to understanding what is right.

My journey was about learning to live simply and peacefully. I wanted to show that even small changes in how we act can make a big difference in the world.
