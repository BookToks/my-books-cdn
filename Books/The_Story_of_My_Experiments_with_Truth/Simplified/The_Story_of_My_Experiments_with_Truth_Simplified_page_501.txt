I felt really embarrassed to ask for help, but I had no choice. Sjt. Fulchand quickly got a commode for me. All my friends gathered around, very worried. They cared a lot, but they couldn’t take away my pain. I was stubborn and made it worse. I refused all medical help. I wouldn’t take any medicine and chose to suffer because of my mistake. So they just watched, feeling helpless. I must have had thirty or forty bathroom trips in one day. I didn’t eat anything, not even fruit juice at first. I had no appetite.

I always thought I was really strong, but my body now felt weak like clay. I had no energy left to fight. Dr. Kanuga came and begged me to take medicine. I said no. He even offered to give me an injection, but I refused that too. Back then, I didn’t understand injections at all. I thought it was some kind of serum.

Later I found out that the injection was actually made from plants, but that info came too late. The bathroom trips kept happening, and I got completely worn out. Being so tired caused a fever with confusion. My friends got more worried and called more doctors. But what could they do if I wouldn’t listen?

Sheth Ambalal and his kind wife came to Nadiad, talked with my coworkers, and carefully took me to their house in Ahmedabad. Nobody could have taken better care of me during my illness. But a low fever kept going on, slowly wearing me down every day. I felt like the sickness would last a long time and might even be deadly. Even with all the love and care at Sheth Ambalal’s house, I started feeling restless and asked him to take me back to the Ashram. He finally agreed.

While I was lying in pain at the Ashram, Sjt. Vallabhbhai brought the news that Germany had been totally defeated, and the Commissioner said no more recruiting was needed. Hearing that I didn’t have to worry about recruiting anymore was a huge relief.
