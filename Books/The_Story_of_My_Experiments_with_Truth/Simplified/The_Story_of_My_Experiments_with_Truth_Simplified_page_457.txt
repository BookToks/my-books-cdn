Taking cases like these to court doesn’t help much. When farmers are so scared and crushed, the courts don’t do anything for them.

The real help for them is to feel safe and free from fear. We can’t just sit and do nothing until we get rid of tinkathia in Bihar. I thought I could leave in two days, but now I see the work might take two years. I’m ready to spend that time if needed. I’m starting to understand the situation better, but I need your help.

I found Brajkishore Babu very calm. He said, “We’ll help as much as we can, but please tell us what kind of help you need.” So we talked until midnight.

I told them, “I won’t need your legal knowledge much. I need help with paperwork and understanding things. I might have to go to jail, and although I’d like you to share that risk, you should only do what you feel you can handle. Even just becoming clerks and stopping your regular jobs for a long time is a big deal. I don’t understand the local Hindi well, and I can’t read papers written in Kaithi or Urdu. I’ll need you to translate them. We can’t pay for this work; it has to be done out of kindness and a spirit of service.” Brajkishore Babu got this right away and then asked me and the others many questions. He wanted to know how long we’d need help, how many people would be involved, if they could take turns, and so on. Then he asked the lawyers how much they were willing to sacrifice.

In the end, they promised me this: “Some of us will do whatever you ask. Some will stay with you for as long as you need. Going to jail is new for us, but we will try to handle it.”
