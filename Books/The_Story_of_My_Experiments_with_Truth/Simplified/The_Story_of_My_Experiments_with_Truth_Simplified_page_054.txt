From when I was about six or seven until I was sixteen, I went to school and learned many things, but not about religion. I didn’t get any religious teaching from my teachers, even though they could have easily taught me. Still, I picked up some ideas about religion from what was around me. When I say "religion," I mean it in a broad way—like understanding yourself or knowing who you really are.

I was born into the Vaishnava faith, so I often had to go to the Haveli (a temple), but I never liked it. The bright decorations and fancy stuff didn’t appeal to me. I also heard some bad stories about what went on there, so I lost interest. Because of this, I didn’t learn anything from the Haveli.

What I didn’t get there, I learned from my nurse, an old servant named Rambha, who cared a lot about me. I used to be afraid of ghosts and spirits. Rambha told me to say the name of Rama (Ramanama) over and over to stop being scared. I trusted her more than the idea itself, so I started repeating Ramanama when I was very young. It didn’t work for long, but the habit stuck with me. I think because of Rambha, saying Ramanama is now a sure way to help me.

Around that time, my cousin, who loved the Ramayana, helped my brother and me learn the Ram Raksha prayer by heart. We promised to say it every morning after our bath. We kept this up while we lived in Porbandar, but stopped when we moved to Rajkot because I didn’t really believe in it. I mostly said it to show off that I could pronounce it right.

What really stayed with me was listening to the Ramayana being read aloud to my father. When he was sick and staying in Porbandar, every evening he would listen to the Ramayana being read by Ladha Maharaj, a big Rama devotee.
