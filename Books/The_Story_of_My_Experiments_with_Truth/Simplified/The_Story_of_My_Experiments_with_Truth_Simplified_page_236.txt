Was I really faithful if I used my wife just to satisfy my desires? As long as I was controlled by lust, my faithfulness meant nothing. To be fair, my wife never tempted me. So, it should have been easy for me to promise to control myself if I really wanted to. But my weak will and strong desires were the problem.

Even after I realized this, I failed two times. I failed because my reason for trying wasn’t the best. I mainly wanted to avoid having more kids. When I was in England, I read about birth control. I already talked about Dr. Allinson’s ideas in the chapter on Vegetarianism. Those ideas helped me a little, but Mr. Hill’s advice against birth control and for self-control helped me more, and eventually it stuck. Since I didn’t want more children, I started trying to control myself. It was very hard. We even started sleeping in separate beds. I decided to go to bed only when I was really tired. These efforts didn’t seem to work at first, but looking back, I think they helped me finally make a strong decision.

I could only make that final decision in 1906. I hadn’t started Satyagraha yet and didn’t know it was coming. I was working in Johannesburg during the Zulu Rebellion in Natal, which happened after the Boer War. I felt I should help the Natal Government then. They accepted my offer, which I’ll explain in another chapter. This work made me think deeply about self-control, and I talked about it with my coworkers.

I became sure that having children and taking care of them didn’t go well with public service. I had to leave my home in Johannesburg to help during the Rebellion. Within a month of offering to help, I gave up the house I had worked hard to set up. I took my wife and kids to Phoenix and led the Indian ambulance corps with the Natal forces.
