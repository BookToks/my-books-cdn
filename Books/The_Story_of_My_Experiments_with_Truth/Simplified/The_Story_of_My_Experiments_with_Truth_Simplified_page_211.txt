Everyone there knew him. His paper had plenty to talk about, and back then, not many people knew much about South Africa.

No matter how serious someone's problem seemed to them, the editor’s office was always full of people with their own complaints. How could the editor deal with all of them? Also, people thought the editor had a lot of power, but only he knew his power hardly went beyond his office. Still, I didn’t give up. I kept meeting editors from other papers. I also met the Anglo-Indian editors. The Statesman and The Englishman understood how important the issue was. I gave them long interviews, and they printed everything I said.

Mr. Saunders, the editor of The Englishman, treated me like a friend. He let me use his office and paper, and even let me change the main article he had written about the situation. He sent me the proof before it was published. We really became friends. He promised to help me as much as he could, kept that promise, and stayed in touch until he got seriously sick.

In my life, I’ve been lucky to make many such friendships, often when I least expected them. What Mr. Saunders liked about me was that I didn’t exaggerate and always stuck to the truth. He asked me many tough questions before he started to support my cause, and he saw that I worked hard to be fair, even to the white people in South Africa.

I’ve learned that the fastest way to get justice is to give justice to the other side.

Mr. Saunders’s unexpected help made me hopeful that I could hold a public meeting in Calcutta. Then I got a cable from Durban saying: 'Parliament opens January.'
