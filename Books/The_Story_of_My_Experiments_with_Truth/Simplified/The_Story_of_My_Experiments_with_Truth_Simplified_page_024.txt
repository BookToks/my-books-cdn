But when the Agent saw that Kaba Gandhi was very determined, he told them to let him go.

My father never wanted to get rich and left us very little property.

He didn’t have much schooling, only about up to the fifth grade in Gujarati. He didn’t know much about history or geography. But his lots of real-life experience helped him solve difficult problems and manage many people.

He didn’t have much religious training, but he had the kind of religious feeling that comes from visiting temples often and listening to religious talks, like many Hindus do. In his last days, a smart Brahman friend of the family told him to read the Gita, and he would say some verses out loud every day during worship.

The strongest memory I have of my mother is that she seemed very holy. She was very religious. She never ate a meal without saying her daily prayers. Going to the Vaishnava temple, called Haveli, was something she did every day. As far back as I can remember, she never missed the Chaturmas period. She would take very hard vows and keep them no matter what. Being sick was never a reason to stop. I remember once she was sick while doing the Chandrayana vow, but she didn’t stop. She could fast for two or three days in a row without trouble. During Chaturmas, she would eat only one meal a day. One time, she even fasted every other day during Chaturmas. Another time, she promised not to eat until she saw the sun. We kids would watch the sky and try to spot the sun first to tell her. Everyone knows that in the middle of the rainy season, the sun often doesn’t come out. I remember days when the sun suddenly appeared, and we would hurry to tell her. She would run outside to see it, but by then the sun was gone, and she missed her meal.

“That doesn’t matter,” she would say happily. “God didn’t want me to eat today.”
