I believe that the more helpless a living being is, the more we should protect it from the cruelty of people.

But if someone isn’t ready or able to help, they can’t protect others. I need to work on myself more and make sacrifices before I can save these innocent beings from being hurt. Right now, I feel like I might never reach that level.

I always hope that one day, a great person—man or woman—full of kindness and care will come and stop this terrible cruelty, save the innocent lives, and make things right. How can Bengal, with all its knowledge and feelings, allow this killing to happen?
