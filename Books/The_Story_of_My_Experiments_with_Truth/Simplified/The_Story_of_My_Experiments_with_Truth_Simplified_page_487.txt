Pandya and his friends were found guilty and given a short time in jail. I thought the punishment was wrong because taking the onion crop wasn’t really ‘theft’ according to the law. But no one appealed because the plan was to stay away from the courts.

A group of people walked with the ‘convicts’ to jail. That day, Sjt. Mohanlal Pandya got the funny nickname ‘dungli chor’ (onion thief) from the people, and he still keeps that name.

I will talk about how the Kheda Satyagraha ended in the next chapter.
