I won’t spend more time here talking about how Khadi kept growing. That would be too much for these chapters. I’m not trying to tell the full story of everything I did after people started noticing me, because that would need a whole book. My goal is just to share how certain things naturally came to me while I was trying to live honestly.

Now, back to the non-cooperation movement. While the big Khilafat protest led by the Ali Brothers was happening, I had long talks with the late Maulana Abdul Bari and other religious leaders. We talked about how much a Muslim could follow non-violence. In the end, they all agreed that Islam didn’t stop Muslims from choosing non-violence and that if they decided to do it, they must do it fully. Finally, the non-cooperation idea was approved at the Khilafat meeting after a lot of discussion. I remember once in Allahabad, a group stayed up all night talking about it. At first, the late Hakim Saheb didn’t believe non-violent non-cooperation would work. But once he believed in it, he gave his full support, which really helped the movement.

After that, I introduced the non-cooperation idea at a political meeting in Gujarat. Some people said a local meeting couldn’t decide on this before the main Congress did. I argued that this rule might be true if the movement was weak, but if you want to move forward, smaller groups are not only allowed but should do it if they have the courage and confidence. I said no one needed permission to try to make the main group stronger, as long as they did it carefully and took responsibility themselves.
