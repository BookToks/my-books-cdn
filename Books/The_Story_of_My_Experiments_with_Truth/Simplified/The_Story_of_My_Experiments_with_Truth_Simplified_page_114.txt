I never saw him lose his calm. There was no business or selfish reason for him to be close to me, but we were still good friends. Back then, I was a young lawyer without many clients, but whenever I met him, he would talk to me about serious religious things. Even though I didn’t really understand or care much about religion at the time, I found his talks very interesting.

Since then, I have met many religious leaders and tried to learn from different faiths. But no one has impressed me as much as Raychandbhai did. What he said really touched me. I respected his intelligence and honesty, and deep inside, I believed he would never mislead me and would always share his true thoughts. When I faced spiritual problems, he was the person I turned to.

Still, even though I respected him a lot, I couldn’t make him my official Guru, or spiritual teacher. That special place in my heart is still empty, and I’m still looking for the right one.

I believe in the Hindu idea that a Guru is very important for spiritual growth.

I think it’s true that you can’t gain real knowledge without a Guru. A not-so-great teacher might be okay for regular things, but not for spiritual matters. Only a truly wise and perfect person deserves to be a Guru. So, we must always try to become better and better. You get the Guru you deserve. Trying your best is your right and also its own reward. After that, everything else depends on God.

So, even though I didn’t make Raychandbhai my Guru, he still helped and guided me many times. Three people have deeply influenced my life: Raychandbhai because I knew him personally; Tolstoy through his book, The Kingdom of God Is Within You; and Ruskin through his book, Unto This Last. I will talk more about them later.
