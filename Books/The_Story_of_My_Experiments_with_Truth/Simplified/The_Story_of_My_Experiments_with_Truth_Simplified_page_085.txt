I believed that anyone who was a vegetarian could join the Society, no matter what they thought about other moral issues.

Some people on the Committee agreed with me, but I felt I had to share my own opinion. I didn’t have the courage to speak up, so I decided to write down my thoughts instead. I took the paper with me to the meeting. I think I couldn’t even read it myself, so the President asked someone else to read it aloud. Dr. Allinson’s side lost the argument that day. So, in the first big disagreement like this, I was on the losing side. But I felt good because I believed we were right. I vaguely remember that after this, I quit the Committee.

I stayed shy during all my time in England. Even when I visited people, if there were more than five or six people there, I couldn’t say much.

Once, I went to Ventnor with Sjt. Mazmudar. We stayed with a vegetarian family. Mr. Howard, who wrote The Ethics of Diet, was also there. We met him, and he asked us to speak at a meeting to promote vegetarianism. I checked, and it was okay to read a speech. Many people did this to speak clearly and quickly. I couldn’t speak without preparation, so I wrote my speech down. But when I stood up to read it, I couldn’t. My vision got blurry and I started shaking, even though the speech was short. Sjt. Mazmudar had to read it for me. His speech was great and people clapped. I felt ashamed and sad because I couldn’t do it.

My last try to speak in public in England was just before I left to go home. But I only made a fool of myself again. I invited my vegetarian friends to dinner at the Holborn Restaurant mentioned earlier. I told myself, “You can always get a vegetarian meal in vegetarian restaurants.”
