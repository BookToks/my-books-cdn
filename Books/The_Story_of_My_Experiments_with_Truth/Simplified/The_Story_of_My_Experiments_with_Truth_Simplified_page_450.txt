Luckily, I hadn’t been called a Mahatma yet, even though people often shouted that name when they saw me.

One time, the detectives stopped me at several train stations, asked for my ticket, and wrote down the number. I answered all their questions easily. Other passengers thought I was a holy man or a beggar. When they saw the detectives bothering me at every stop, they got angry and shouted at the detectives. “Why are you troubling this poor holy man for no reason?” they said. They told me, “Don’t show these bad men your ticket.”

I calmly told them, “It’s no problem to show my ticket. They are just doing their job.” But the passengers didn’t like it. They felt more sorry for me and kept saying it was wrong to treat innocent people like this.

The detectives were not the worst part. The hardest thing was traveling in the third-class train. My worst experience was from Lahore to Delhi. I was going to Calcutta from Karachi and had to change trains at Lahore. The train was so full it was impossible to find a seat. People got in by pushing or sneaking through windows when doors were locked. I had to get to Calcutta on time for a meeting, so I couldn’t miss the train. I almost gave up trying to get on. No one wanted to let me in until a porter saw me and said, “Give me twelve annas and I’ll find you a seat.” I said, “Okay, you’ll get twelve annas if you find me a seat.” The porter asked many passengers, but no one helped.

As the train was about to leave, some passengers said, “There’s no room, but you can push him in if you want. He’ll have to stand.” The porter asked me, and I agreed. He pushed me in through the window.

That’s how I got on the train, and the porter earned his twelve annas.

The night was tough. Other passengers were all sitting somehow, but I stood for two hours, holding onto the chain of the top bunk. Some passengers kept bothering me, asking, “Why won’t you sit down?” I told them there was no room, but they didn’t like me standing, even though they were lying down on the upper bunks.
