On one side, there were a few poor Indians and some of their English friends. On the other side were the white men, who were strong because they had weapons, more people, better education, and more money. They were also supported by the government. The Natal Government openly helped them. Mr. Harry Escombe, who was very important in the government, even joined their meetings.

The real reason for the quarantine was to scare the passengers into going back to India. They wanted to pressure us or the Agent Company. They started threatening us too: "If you don’t go back, we will push you into the sea. But if you agree to return, you might even get your money back." I moved among my fellow passengers to cheer them up. I also sent messages to the passengers on the SS Naderi to keep them calm and brave.

We planned all kinds of games on the ship to keep everyone entertained. On Christmas Day, the captain invited the saloon passengers to dinner. My family and I were some of the main guests. After dinner, I gave a speech about Western civilization. I knew it wasn’t the right time for a serious speech, but mine had to be serious. I joined in the fun, but my mind was on the fight happening in Durban. I was the real target of the attack. Two accusations were made against me: (1) That I had unfairly criticized the Natal whites while in India; (2) That I had brought two shiploads of passengers to settle in Natal to flood the area with Indians.

I felt the weight of my responsibility. I knew that Dada Abdulla and others had taken big risks for me, the passengers’ lives were in danger, and by bringing my family, I had put them in danger too.

But I was completely innocent. I had not forced anyone to come to Natal. I didn’t even know the passengers when they left India. Except for a couple of relatives, I didn’t know the names or addresses of the hundreds of passengers on board.
