The Ashram had only been open for a few months when we faced a test I hadn’t expected. I got a letter from Amritlal Thakkar that said, “A humble and honest untouchable family wants to join your Ashram. Will you accept them?” I was worried. I never thought an untouchable family, introduced by someone as important as Thakkar Bapa, would want to join so soon. I showed the letter to my friends. They were happy about it.

I wrote back to Amritlal Thakkar saying we would accept the family if they agreed to follow the Ashram’s rules.

The family had Dudabhai, his wife Danibehn, and their little daughter Lakshmi, who was just a baby. Dudabhai used to be a teacher in Bombay.

They agreed to follow the rules and were allowed to join.

But their joining caused some trouble among the friends helping the Ashram. The first problem was with using the well, which the bungalow owner partly controlled. The man who ran the water lift said our bucket water would pollute him. He started swearing at us and bothering Dudabhai. I told everyone to ignore the insults and keep getting water no matter what.

When the man saw we didn’t fight back, he felt ashamed and stopped bothering us.

But all money support stopped. The friend who asked if an untouchable could follow the Ashram’s rules didn’t expect any to come.

After the money stopped, rumors started about a social boycott.

We were ready for this. I told my friends that if people boycotted us and stopped giving us what we needed, we wouldn’t leave Ahmedabad. We would live in the untouchables’ area and survive by doing hard work ourselves.
