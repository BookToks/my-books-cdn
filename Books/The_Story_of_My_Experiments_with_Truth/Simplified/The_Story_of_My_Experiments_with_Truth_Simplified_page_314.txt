As my physical desires slowly went away, my home life became more peaceful, sweet, and happy.

But don’t think from this story that we are a perfect couple or that we always share the same ideas. Kasturba might not even know if she has her own ideas separate from mine. Even now, she probably doesn’t agree with everything I do. We never talk about these things because I don’t think it helps.

She wasn’t taught well by her parents or me when she should have been. But she has one great quality that many Hindu wives have. Whether she knows it or not, she feels lucky to follow my example and has never stopped me from living a life of self-control.

So even though we are very different in how we think, I have always felt that our life is full of happiness, peace, and growth.
