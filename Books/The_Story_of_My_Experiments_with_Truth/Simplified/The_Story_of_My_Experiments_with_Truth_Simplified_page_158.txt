Getting the case ready was what I cared about most.

Reading the law and checking law cases whenever needed always took up most of my time. Because of this, I understood the facts of the case better than even the people involved, since I had all their papers with me.

I remembered the advice from the late Mr. Pincutt – facts are three-fourths of the law. Later, a famous South African lawyer, the late Mr. Leonard, proved this true. In one case I was handling, I saw that even though my client was right, the law seemed against him. Feeling stuck, I asked Mr. Leonard for help. He also thought the facts were strong. He said, “Gandhi, I’ve learned one thing: if we focus on the facts, the law will take care of itself. Let’s look deeper into the facts.” After studying again, I saw the facts differently and found an old South African case that helped. I was happy and told Mr. Leonard. He said, “Good, we will win. But remember, it depends on which judge hears the case.” While working on Dada Abdulla’s case, I didn’t fully understand how important facts were. Facts mean the truth, and when we stick to the truth, the law helps us naturally. I saw that Dada Abdulla’s facts were very strong, so the law would be on his side.

But I also saw that if the case kept going, it would ruin both the plaintiff and defendant. They were family and from the same city. No one knew how long the case would last. If it kept going in court, it might never end and wouldn’t help either side. So, both wanted to end the case quickly, if possible.

I talked to Tyeb Sheth and asked him to agree to settle the case through arbitration.
