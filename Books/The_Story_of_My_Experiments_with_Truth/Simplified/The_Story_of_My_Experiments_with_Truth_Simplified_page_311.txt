Ahimsa, which means not hurting others, is the main part of looking for the truth. I’m learning every day that trying to find the truth doesn’t work unless you base it on ahimsa.

It’s okay to fight against a bad system, but fighting against the person who made it is like fighting yourself. We’re all connected and come from the same Creator. Because of this, the special power inside each of us is endless.

When you treat one person badly, you’re actually hurting that special power and not just that person. This means you’re also hurting the whole world.
