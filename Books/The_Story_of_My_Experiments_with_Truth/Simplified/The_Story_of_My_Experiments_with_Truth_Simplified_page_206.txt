Pestonji Padshah didn’t just say no to helping me; he also told me not to go back to South Africa.

He said, "I can’t help you. But I don’t even like the idea of you going there. Isn’t there enough work in our own country? Right now, there’s a lot to do for our language. I have to find scientific words, but that’s just one part of the work. Think about how poor our country is. Sure, our people in South Africa have problems, but I don’t want someone like you to get hurt working there. Let’s focus on winning self-government here first, and then we can help our people there. I know I can’t change your mind, but I won’t support anyone like you who wants to go there."

I didn’t agree with his advice, but it made me respect Mr. Pestonji Padshah even more. I was impressed by how much he loved our country and language. This moment made us understand each other better. I saw his point of view.

But instead of giving up my work in South Africa, I became more determined. A true patriot can’t ignore any way to serve their country. To me, the message of the Gita was clear: It’s better to do your own duty, even if you fail, than to do someone else’s duty, even if it seems easier.

To die doing your duty is not bad;  
But those who try other paths will get lost.
