A MONTH WITH GOKHALE - III

The awful sacrifice made to Kali in the name of religion made me want to learn more about Bengali life. I had read and heard a lot about the Brahmo Samaj. I knew a bit about Pratap Chandra Mazumdar’s life. I had attended some of his meetings. I got a book about Keshav Chandra Sen’s life written by him, read it carefully, and understood the difference between Sadharan Brahmo Samaj and Adi Brahmo Samaj. I met Pandit Shivanath Shastri and went with Prof. Kathavate to see Maharshi Devendranath Tagore, but we couldn’t meet him because no visitors were allowed then. However, we were invited to a Brahmo Samaj celebration at his home, where we enjoyed beautiful Bengali music. Since then, I have loved Bengali music.

After learning enough about the Brahmo Samaj, I wanted to see Swami Vivekanand badly. So I went to Belur Math, mostly walking all the way. I liked the quiet, peaceful place. But I was sad to hear that Swami was sick and staying at his house in Calcutta, so I couldn’t meet him.

Next, I found out where Sister Nivedita lived and met her in a big house in Chowringhee. I was surprised by the luxury around her, and we didn’t really connect much during our talk. I told Gokhale about this, and he said he wasn’t surprised because she was a very emotional and strong person.

I met her again at Mr. Pestonji Padshah’s house. I came in while she was talking to his old mother, so I helped them understand each other. Even though I didn’t agree with her, I couldn’t help but respect her deep love for Hinduism. Later, I learned about her books.

I spent my days meeting important people in Calcutta about work in South Africa and visiting religious and public places in the city.
