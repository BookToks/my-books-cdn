I must have been about seven when my dad left Porbandar for Rajkot to join the Rajasthanik Court. I started primary school there, and I still remember those days clearly, even the names of my teachers. Just like in Porbandar, there wasn’t much to say about my studies. I was probably just an average student. After that school, I went to a suburban school and then to high school when I was about twelve. I don’t remember ever lying to my teachers or classmates during that time. I was very shy and didn’t like being around people. My books and lessons were my only friends. Every day, I would be at school right on time and run straight home as soon as school ended. I literally ran because I didn’t want to talk to anyone. I was even scared someone might make fun of me.

There is one story from my first year at high school that I think is important. Mr. Giles, the Education Inspector, came to check on us. He gave us five words to spell. One word was "kettle." I spelled it wrong. My teacher tried to help me by nudging me with his boot, but I didn’t understand he wanted me to copy from my neighbor’s slate. I thought the teacher was there to stop us from copying. So, everyone else spelled all the words right except me. The teacher later tried to make me feel bad for being “stupid,” but it didn’t work. I never learned how to copy.

Even after this, I still respected my teacher a lot. I was naturally blind to the mistakes of adults. Later, I found out my teacher had many faults, but I still respected him. I learned that I should follow the orders of elders, not question what they do.

Two other events from that time have stayed with me forever.
