The meeting in Pachaiappa Hall, as far as I remember, was led by Dr. Subrahmaniam.

Most of the friends I met showed me a lot of kindness and were really excited about our cause. Even though I had to talk to them in English, I felt completely comfortable.

What kind of barrier can love not overcome?
