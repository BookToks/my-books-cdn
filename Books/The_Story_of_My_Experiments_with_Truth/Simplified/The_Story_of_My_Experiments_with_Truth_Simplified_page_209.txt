The meeting in Pachaiappa Hall, so far as I can recollect, was with Dr.
 
 Subrahmaniam in the chair.
 
 The affection showered on me by most of the friends I met and their enthusiasm for the cause were so great that, in spite of my having to communicate with them in English, I felt myself entirely at home. What barrier is there that love cannot break?
