But it might be said that God has never let any of my own plans work out.

He has handled things His own way.

Just when I thought I was settling down like I planned, I got a surprise message from South Africa: "Chamberlain expected here. Please come back right away." I remembered my promise and replied that I would be ready to leave as soon as I got the money. They quickly sent the money, so I gave up my chambers and left for South Africa.

I thought the work there would keep me busy for at least a year, so I kept my bungalow and left my wife and kids there.

I believed that young people who couldn’t find jobs here should move to other countries. So, I took four or five such young men with me, including Maganlal Gandhi.

The Gandhi family was big and still is. I wanted to find all those who wanted to leave the usual path and try living abroad. My father used to help some of them get government jobs, but I wanted them to be free from that. I didn’t want to get them jobs; I wanted them to learn to take care of themselves.

As my ideas grew, I tried to get these young men to share my beliefs, and I had the most success with Maganlal Gandhi.

But I’ll talk about that later.

Being away from my wife and kids, leaving a settled life, and moving from something sure to something unknown was hard for a moment, but I was used to living an uncertain life. I think it’s wrong to expect things to always be certain in this world, where everything except God, who is Truth, is uncertain. Everything we see and experience changes and doesn’t last. But there is a Supreme Being inside all of this who is certain, and it’s a blessing if someone can see that and hold on to it.
