A MONTH WITH GOKHALE - II

While I was staying with Gokhale, I was not just sitting at home doing nothing.

I had told my Christian friends in South Africa that I would meet Christian Indians in India and learn about their lives. I had heard about Babu Kalicharan Banerji and respected him a lot. He was active in the Congress, and I didn’t have the same doubts about him as I did about most Christian Indians, who kept away from the Congress and stayed separate from Hindus and Muslims. I told Gokhale that I wanted to meet him. Gokhale said, "What’s the point? He’s a good man, but I don’t think he will satisfy you. I know him well. But if you want, you can meet him."

I asked for a meeting, and he agreed. When I went, I found his wife was very sick. His house was simple. At the Congress, I had seen him wearing a coat and trousers, but I was happy to see him now in a Bengal dhoti and shirt. I liked his simple clothes, even though I was still wearing a Parsi coat and trousers myself. I explained my problems to him. He asked, "Do you believe in original sin?" I said, "Yes."

He said, "Well, Hinduism doesn’t offer a way to get rid of sin, but Christianity does." He added, "The punishment for sin is death, and the Bible says the only way to be saved is to surrender to Jesus." I talked about Bhakti-marga, the path of devotion from the Bhagavadgita, but it didn’t convince him. I thanked him for his kindness. He didn’t satisfy me, but I still learned from our talk.

During these days, I walked all over the streets of Calcutta. I went to most places on foot. I met Justice Mitter and Sir Gurdas Banerji, hoping to get their help for my work in South Africa. Around this time, I also met Raja Sir Pyarimohan Mukarji.

Kalicharan Banerji had told me about the Kali temple, which I really wanted to see, especially since I had read about it in books.
