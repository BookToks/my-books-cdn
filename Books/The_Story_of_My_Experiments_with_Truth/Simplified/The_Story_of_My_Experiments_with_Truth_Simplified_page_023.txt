BIRTH AND FAMILY

The Gandhis come from the Bania caste and were originally grocers. But for three generations, starting with my grandfather, they were Prime Ministers in different Kathiawad States. My grandfather, Uttamchand Gandhi, also called Ota Gandhi, was a man of strong principles. Because of political problems, he had to leave Porbandar, where he was Diwan, and go to Junagadh for safety.

There, he greeted the Nawab with his left hand. Someone noticed this and thought it was rude, so they asked why. He explained, “My right hand is already promised to Porbandar.” Ota Gandhi married a second time after his first wife died. He had four sons with his first wife and two with his second. When I was a child, I never really thought about the fact that these six brothers had different mothers. The fifth brother was Karamchand Gandhi, also known as Kaba Gandhi, and the sixth was Tulsidas Gandhi. Both of them were Prime Ministers in Porbandar, one after the other. Kaba Gandhi was my father. He was part of the Rajasthanik Court, which no longer exists but used to help settle problems between chiefs and their clans. He was also Prime Minister in Rajkot and later in Vankaner. When he died, he was receiving a pension from the Rajkot State.

Kaba Gandhi married four times because each of his wives died. He had two daughters from his first two marriages. His last wife, Putlibai, had a daughter and three sons with him, and I was the youngest.

My father loved his family, was honest, brave, and generous, but he could get angry quickly. He might have enjoyed some pleasures since he married for the fourth time when he was over forty. Still, he was honest and fair, and people respected him for that. He was very loyal to the State. Once, an Assistant Political Agent insulted the Rajkot Thakore Saheb, who was my father’s chief, and my father stood up against the insult. The Agent got angry and told my father to say sorry, but he refused. Because of this, he was kept in detention for a few hours.
