Before I talked more about Christian contacts, I want to share other experiences from the same time.

Sheth Tyeb Haji Khan Muhammad was very important in Pretoria, just like Dada Abdulla was in Natal. No public event could happen without him. I met him during my first week there and told him I wanted to connect with every Indian in Pretoria. I wanted to learn about their situation and asked for his help, which he happily agreed to.

The first thing I did was call a meeting of all the Indians in Pretoria. I wanted to show them what their life was like in the Transvaal. The meeting was at Sheth Haji Muhammad Haji Joosab’s house, who I knew from a letter of introduction. Mostly Meman merchants came, with a few Hindus too. Actually, there were very few Hindus living in Pretoria.

That meeting was probably the first time I gave a public speech. I had prepared well and talked about being honest in business. I had often heard merchants say that truth was impossible in business. But I didn’t agree then, and I still don’t now. Even today, some merchant friends say that truth doesn’t fit with business.

They say business is practical, and truth is about religion. They think practical things and religion are completely different.

They believe being 100% truthful in business is impossible and you can only be honest up to a certain point. I strongly disagreed and made the merchants realize their duty. Their responsibility to be truthful was even bigger because they lived in a foreign country. The way a few Indians behaved would reflect on millions of Indians back home.

I also noticed that their habits were not very clean compared to the English people around them, and I told them to pay attention to this.
