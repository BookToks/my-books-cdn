People were clearly told that they could be arrested and put in jail for buying the banned books. But at that moment, they weren’t afraid of going to jail.

Later, it was found out that the Government decided the banned books had not really been sold. They said what we sold was not really banned literature. The Government said the new versions we sold were just new editions of the banned books, so selling them was not against the law. This made many people feel disappointed.

The next morning, another meeting was held to take promises about supporting Swadeshi and Hindu-Muslim unity. Vithaldas Jerajani realized for the first time that not everything that looks good really is. Only a few people came. I clearly remember some sisters who were there. Very few men came too. I had already written the pledge and brought it with me. I explained its meaning carefully before asking people to say it. I wasn’t hurt or surprised by the small number because I had seen before that people like exciting work but don’t like quiet, steady effort. This difference still continues today.

But I will talk about this more in a separate chapter. To continue the story: On the night of the 7th, I started my trip to Delhi and Amritsar. When I reached Mathura on the 8th, I first heard rumors that I might be arrested. At the next stop after Mathura, Acharya Gidvani met me and told me for sure that I was going to be arrested. He also said he would help me if I needed it. I thanked him and told him I would ask for his help if I needed it.

Before the train reached Palwal station, I was given a written order saying I was not allowed to enter Punjab because my presence there might cause trouble. The police asked me to get off the train. I refused, saying, “I am going to Punjab because I was invited and to calm things down, not to cause trouble.”
