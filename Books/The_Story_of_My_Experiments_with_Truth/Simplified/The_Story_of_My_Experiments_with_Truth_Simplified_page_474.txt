While I was finishing my work on the Committee, I got a letter from Mohanlal Pandya and Shankarlal Parikh. They told me that the crops failed in the Kheda district and asked me to help the farmers who couldn’t pay their taxes. But I didn’t feel ready or brave enough to give advice without seeing the situation myself.

At the same time, I got a letter from Shrimati Anasuyabai about the workers in Ahmedabad. Their wages were low, and they had been asking for more money for a long time. I wanted to help them if I could.

But I didn’t feel confident to handle even this small problem from far away. So I took the first chance to go to Ahmedabad. I hoped I could solve both problems quickly and then go back to Champaran to check on the work we started there.

But things didn’t go as fast as I wanted, and I couldn’t return to Champaran. Because of this, the schools started closing one by one. My team and I had made many plans, but they all had to be put on hold for now.

One of these plans was to protect cows in Champaran, along with improving cleanliness and education in villages. During my travels, I noticed that cow protection and promoting Hindi were mostly handled by the Marwadis. A Marwadi friend had given me a place to stay in Bettiah. Other Marwadis there showed me their goshala (cow shelter). That’s when I formed my ideas about protecting cows, which are the same now. To me, cow protection means breeding better cattle, taking care of them kindly, running model dairies, and more. The Marwadi friends promised to help fully, but since I couldn’t settle in Champaran, the plan didn’t happen.

The goshala in Bettiah still exists, but it’s not a model dairy. The Champaran bullocks still work too hard, and many so-called Hindus still treat the poor animals badly, hurting their religion by doing so.
