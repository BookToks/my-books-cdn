I already talked about the time I got pleurisy in England. Gokhale came back to London soon after. Kallenbach and I would visit him often.

We mostly talked about the war. Kallenbach knew a lot about Germany’s geography and had traveled a lot in Europe, so he showed Gokhale different places on the map related to the war.

When I got pleurisy, that became a daily topic too. I was still trying out different foods to help myself get better. I ate things like groundnuts, ripe and unripe bananas, lemon, olive oil, tomatoes, and grapes.

I completely stopped drinking milk and eating cereals, pulses, and other foods.

Dr. Jivraj Mehta was treating me. He strongly urged me to start drinking milk and eating cereals again, but I refused. Gokhale heard about this. He didn’t really agree with my reasons for eating only fruit, and he wanted me to follow the doctor’s advice to get better.

It wasn’t easy for me to say no to Gokhale. When he wouldn’t accept my refusal, I asked him to give me 24 hours to think about it. That evening, Kallenbach and I talked about what I should do. He had been with me during my experiment and liked it, but he was okay if I stopped for my health. So I had to decide for myself by listening to my inner feelings.

I spent the whole night thinking about it. Giving up the experiment would mean giving up all my ideas, but I still believed in them. The question was how much I should listen to Gokhale’s kind pressure and how much I should change my experiment for my health. I finally decided to keep my experiment if the reason was mostly religious, but to follow the doctor’s advice if the reason was mixed. I had stopped milk mostly for religious reasons.

I remembered how cruel the milk sellers in Calcutta were when they got milk from cows and buffaloes. I also felt that just like meat isn’t meant for humans, animal milk isn’t meant for humans either.
