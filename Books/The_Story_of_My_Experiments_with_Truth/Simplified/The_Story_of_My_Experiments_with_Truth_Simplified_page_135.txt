I told him I was ready to go to Pretoria.  

"Where will you stay?" the Sheth asked.  

"Anywhere you want me to," I replied.  

"Then I’ll write to our lawyer. He will find a place for you to stay. I’ll also write to my Meman friends there, but I don’t think you should stay with them.  

The other side has a lot of power in Pretoria. If any of them get hold of our private letters, it could cause us big problems. So the less you hang out with them, the better for us."  

"I’ll stay where your lawyer arranges or find my own place. Don’t worry. No one will know anything private between us. But I do want to get to know the other side. I want to be friends with them. I’ll try to settle the case without going to court. After all, Tyeb Sheth is your relative."  

Sheth Tyeb Haji Khan Muhammad was closely related to Abdulla Sheth.  

When I mentioned settling the case, the Sheth looked surprised. But I had been in Durban for six or seven days, and we understood each other better. I was no longer a ‘white elephant.’ So he said, "Y…es, I see. It would be great to settle without going to court.  

But we are all family and know each other well. Tyeb Sheth won’t agree to settle easily. If we’re careless, he could trick us and take advantage in the end. So please think carefully before you do anything."  

"Don’t worry," I said. "I don’t need to talk to Tyeb Sheth or anyone else about the case. I’ll just suggest he try to work things out and avoid a long legal fight."  

On the seventh or eighth day after I arrived, I left Durban. I had a first-class ticket. There, it was normal to pay five shillings extra for bedding on the train. Abdulla Sheth wanted me to pay for it, but because I was stubborn and proud and wanted to save five shillings, I said no.
