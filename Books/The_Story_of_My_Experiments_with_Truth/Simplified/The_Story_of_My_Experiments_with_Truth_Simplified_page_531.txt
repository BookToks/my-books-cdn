Back then, I already knew that if we only relied on the mills to boycott foreign cloth, we would be let down. I was stuck in this problem when the Maulana finished his speech.

I didn’t have the right Hindi or Urdu words to say what I wanted. It was my first time giving a serious speech to an audience mostly made up of North Indian Muslims. I had spoken a little Urdu before at the Muslim League in Calcutta, but that was just to share feelings. This time, the crowd was more critical, maybe even against me, and I had to explain my ideas clearly. I wasn’t worried about speaking perfect Urdu like the Delhi Muslims. I just wanted to share my thoughts in the broken Hindi I knew.

And I did well. This meeting showed me that Hindi-Urdu could be the common language for all of India. If I had spoken English, I wouldn’t have made the same impact, and the Maulana might not have responded the way he did. Even if he had, I wouldn’t have been able to reply well.

I couldn’t find a good Hindi or Urdu word for the new idea I had, which made me a bit confused. In the end, I called it “non-co-operation,” which I used for the first time at this meeting. When the Maulana was speaking, I felt it was pointless for him to talk about fighting the government if he was already working with them in some ways. Since using weapons was not an option, the only real way to resist was to stop cooperating with the government. That’s how I came up with “non-co-operation.” I didn’t fully understand what it meant yet, so I didn’t go into details.

I just said: “The Muslims have made an important decision. If the peace terms are bad for them—which I hope won’t happen—they will stop all cooperation with the government.”
