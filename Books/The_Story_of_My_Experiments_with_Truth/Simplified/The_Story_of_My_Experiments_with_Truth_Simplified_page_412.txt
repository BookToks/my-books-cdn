I was sure my advice was good, but I wasn’t sure if I was the right person to fully handle the case. It felt really risky to argue such a hard case in the Supreme Court, and I was very nervous when I stood before the judges.

Right after I mentioned the mistake in the accounts, one of the judges asked, “Isn’t this sharp practice, Mr. Gandhi?” I got really upset inside because it was unfair to be called dishonest when I wasn’t.

I thought, “If a judge is already biased like this, it’ll be hard to win.” But I stayed calm and said, “I’m surprised your Lordship thinks I’m being dishonest without hearing me out.” The judge replied, “It’s not a charge, just a suggestion.” I said, “That suggestion feels like a charge. Please listen to me first, and then you can decide.” The judge said sorry for interrupting and told me to continue explaining the mistake.

Because the judge brought this up, I got the chance to grab the Court’s attention right away. I felt encouraged and explained everything in detail. The Court listened carefully and I convinced them the mistake happened by accident. So, they didn’t want to cancel the whole award, which took a lot of effort.

The other lawyer thought the case was easy to win once the error was admitted, but it wasn’t that simple.
