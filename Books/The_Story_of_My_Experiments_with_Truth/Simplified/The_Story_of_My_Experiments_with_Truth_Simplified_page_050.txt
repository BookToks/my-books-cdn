He was sick with a fistula and had to stay in bed. His bed was just a simple wooden board. I gave him the note and sat across from him.

He read the note, and tears fell from his eyes, soaking the paper. He closed his eyes for a moment, thinking, then tore up the note.

He had sat up to read it but then lay back down. I cried too. I could see how much pain my father was in. If I could paint, I would draw this whole scene because it’s still clear in my mind.

His tears of love cleaned my heart and washed away my guilt. Only someone who has felt this kind of love can understand it. Like the song says: Only someone hit by the arrows of love knows how strong it is.

For me, this was a lesson in Ahimsa, or non-violence. Back then, I just saw it as a father’s love, but now I know it was true Ahimsa. When Ahimsa is real and all around, it changes everything it touches. Its power is endless.

This amazing forgiveness wasn’t normal for my father. I thought he would be angry, say harsh things, or hit his forehead. But he was so calm, and I think it was because I told the truth honestly. A true confession, along with a promise to never repeat the mistake, given to someone who has the right to hear it, is the purest kind of saying sorry. I know my confession made my father feel safe about me and made him love me even more.
