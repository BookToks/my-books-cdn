About three hundred were free Indians, and the rest were indentured workers. Dr. Booth was also with us. Our group did a good job. Even though we were supposed to work away from the fighting and had the Red Cross for protection, we were asked at a tough time to help right where the fighting was happening. We didn’t choose to be in danger. The leaders didn’t want us near the shooting. But after the defeat at Spion Kop, General Buller sent a message saying that, while we didn’t have to take the risk, the government would be grateful if we did and helped bring the wounded from the battlefield. We didn’t hesitate, so during the battle at Spion Kop, we worked right in the firing line. Those days, we had to walk 20 to 25 miles a day, carrying wounded soldiers on stretchers. Among the injured, we had the honor of carrying important soldiers like General Woodgate.

The group was broken up after six weeks. After losing at Spion Kop and Vaalkranz, the British Commander-in-Chief gave up the quick plan to save Ladysmith and other places. Instead, he decided to wait for more soldiers from England and India and move slowly.

Our simple work was praised a lot, and the Indians got more respect. Newspapers wrote poems saying, “We are sons of Empire after all.” General Buller mentioned the group’s work in his report, and the leaders got the War Medal.

The Indian community became more organized. I got closer to the indentured Indians. They started to feel more united, realizing that Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Tamilians, Gujaratis, and Sindhis were all Indians and part of the same country. Everyone believed their problems would soon be fixed. At that time, the white people’s attitude seemed to change for the better. The friendships made with the white soldiers during the war were very kind. We met thousands of Tommies. They were friendly and thankful that we were there to help them.

I can’t help but share a sweet memory of how people show their best side during hard times.
