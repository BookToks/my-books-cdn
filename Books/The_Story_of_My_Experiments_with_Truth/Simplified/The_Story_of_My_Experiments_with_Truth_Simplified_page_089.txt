She was running like a bird while I was wondering when I should go back home. We finally reached the top of a hill. The question was how to get down again. Even though she wore high-heeled boots, this lively young woman of twenty-five ran down the hill like an arrow. I was embarrassed and struggling to get down. She stood at the bottom, smiling, cheering me on, and offering to come and help me. How could I be so scared? With a lot of effort, and sometimes crawling, I somehow managed to get to the bottom. She laughed loudly and said "bravo," making me feel even more embarrassed, which was fair.

But I couldn’t get away without some trouble everywhere. God wanted to get rid of my habit of not telling the truth. Once, I went to Brighton, another seaside town like Ventnor. This was before I went to Ventnor. I met an old widow with not much money at a hotel. It was my first year in England. The menu was all in French, which I didn’t understand. I sat at the same table as the old lady. She saw I was new and confused, and quickly came to help me. “You look like a stranger,” she said, “and you seem confused. Why haven’t you ordered anything?” I was trying to read the menu and was about to ask the waiter about the dishes when she spoke.

I thanked her and explained that I didn’t know which dishes were vegetarian because I didn’t understand French. “Let me help you,” she said. “I will explain the menu to you and show you what you can eat.” I was thankful for her help. This was the start of a friendship that lasted through my time in England and even after. She gave me her London address and invited me to eat at her house every Sunday. Sometimes, she would invite me to special events, help me get over my shyness, introduce me to young ladies, and get me talking with them. One young lady who stayed with her was especially meant for these talks, and often we would be left alone together.

At first, I found all this very hard.
