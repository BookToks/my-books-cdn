I learned a lot from my life and made many experiments to understand the truth. Sometimes, I made mistakes, but I kept trying to do what was right.

I believe that everyone should be honest and kind. Even when things are hard, we should not give up on being good people.

By sharing my story, I hope others can learn and be inspired to find their own truth too. Life is a journey, and we all have to keep learning along the way.
