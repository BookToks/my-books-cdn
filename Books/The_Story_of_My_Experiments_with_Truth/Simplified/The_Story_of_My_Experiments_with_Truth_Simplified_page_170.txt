Getting this many signatures from all over the province was really hard, especially since the men didn’t know anything about this kind of work.

We had to pick special volunteers who were good at this because we decided not to take any signature unless the person fully understood the petition. The villages were far apart. The work could only be done fast if many workers worked with all their heart. And that’s exactly what they did. Everyone did their part with excitement. But as I write this, I clearly remember Sheth Dawud Muhammad, Rustomji, Adamji Miyakhan, and Amod Jiva. They got the most signatures. Dawud Sheth traveled around all day in his carriage. They did all this because they cared, not to get paid. Dada Abdulla’s house became like a busy hotel and an office. Many educated friends who helped me and others ate there. So every helper spent a good amount of money.

Finally, the petition was sent in. A thousand copies were printed to share and spread around. It was the first time Indian people learned about what was happening in Natal. I sent copies to all the newspapers and writers I knew.

The Times of India wrote a strong article supporting the Indian demands. Copies were also sent to newspapers and writers in England from different groups. The London Times supported our claims, and we started hoping the Bill would be stopped.

By now, I couldn’t leave Natal. Indian friends surrounded me and begged me to stay there forever. I told them I had problems. I decided not to live on public money. I felt I needed to have my own home. I wanted the house to be nice and in a good area. I also thought I couldn’t bring respect to the community unless I lived like a regular lawyer. And I believed it was impossible to keep such a home with less than £300 a year. So, I decided I could only stay if the community promised to give me enough legal work to earn that much, and I told them my decision.
