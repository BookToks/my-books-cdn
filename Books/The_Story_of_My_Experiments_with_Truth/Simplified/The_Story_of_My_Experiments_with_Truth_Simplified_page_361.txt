I wanted to practice brahmacharya in my thoughts, words, and actions. At the same time, I wanted to spend as much time as possible on the Satyagraha struggle and prepare myself by staying pure. So, I made more changes and set stricter rules for myself about food. Before, my changes were mostly about health, but now I did it for religious reasons.

Fasting and eating less became a bigger part of my life.

Usually, people’s strong feelings come with a desire for tasty food. It was the same for me. I had many problems trying to control both my feelings and my taste for food. Even now, I can’t say I have full control. I thought I ate a lot. What my friends thought was self-control didn’t feel like that to me. If I hadn’t learned some control, I would have behaved worse than animals and probably failed a long time ago.

But since I knew my weaknesses, I worked hard to overcome them. Because of this, I have managed to keep my body going and do my part of the work all these years.

Knowing my weaknesses and meeting people who shared my ideas, I started eating only fruit or fasting on Ekadashi days. I also observed holidays like Janamashtami.

I began by eating fruit only, but in terms of self-control, I didn’t see much difference between fruit and grain diets. I noticed you could enjoy tasty food just as much with fruit, sometimes even more when you got used to it. So, I began to focus more on fasting or eating just one meal a day on holidays. And if there was a chance to do penance or something similar, I happily used it to fast.

But I also saw that when my body was more empty, food tasted better and my hunger felt stronger.
