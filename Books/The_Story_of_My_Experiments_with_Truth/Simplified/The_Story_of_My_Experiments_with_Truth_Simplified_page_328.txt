Madanjit bravely broke open the lock of an empty house and put all the sick people there. I rode my bike to the place and wrote to the Town Clerk to explain why we had taken over the house.

Dr. William Godfrey, who worked in Johannesburg, came quickly when he heard the news. He became both nurse and doctor for the patients.

But twenty-three patients were too many for just the three of us to handle.

I believe that if your heart is pure, trouble will bring help and solutions. At that time, I had four Indians working in my office – Sjts. Kalyandas, Maneklal, Gunvantrai Desai, and another whose name I can’t remember. Kalyandas was given to me by his father. In South Africa, I rarely met anyone as helpful and obedient as Kalyandas. Luckily, he was unmarried then, so I didn’t hesitate to give him risky tasks.

I found Maneklal in Johannesburg. As far as I remember, he was unmarried too. So I decided to ask all four to help – whether you call them clerks, co-workers, or sons. I didn’t even need to ask Kalyandas. The others said yes as soon as I asked. Their answer was simple: “Where you go, we will go.”

Mr. Ritch had a big family. He was ready to help, but I stopped him because I didn’t want to put him in danger. So he worked outside the risky area.

That night was awful – staying up and taking care of the sick. I had looked after patients before, but never anyone with the black plague. Dr. Godfrey’s courage spread to us. We didn’t have to do much nursing. We just gave medicine, helped with their needs, kept their beds clean, and tried to cheer them up.

The energy and fearlessness of the young men made me very happy. You could expect bravery from Dr. Godfrey and the experienced Madanjit, but these young guys were amazing!

As far as I remember, we helped all the patients get through that night.

This whole event, besides being sad, is very interesting and important to me, so I want to write two more chapters about it.
