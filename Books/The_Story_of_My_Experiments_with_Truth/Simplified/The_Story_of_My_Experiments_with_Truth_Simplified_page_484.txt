Sjt. Vallabhbhai joined the struggle even though he had to stop his successful law practice, which he never really got back.

We made our main office at the Nadiad Anathashram because there was no other place big enough for all of us.

The Satyagrahis signed a promise: “We know the crops in our villages didn’t do well, so we asked the Government to stop collecting taxes until next year. But the Government said no. So, we promise not to pay the full or any remaining taxes this year.

We will let the Government take any legal action they want and accept the consequences of not paying. We would rather lose our land than pay and lose our self-respect. However, if the Government agrees to stop collecting the second part of the tax for the whole district, those of us who can pay will pay whatever is owed. 

The reason why even people who can pay are holding back is that if they pay, poorer farmers might panic, sell their things, or borrow money to pay their taxes, which would hurt them. So, to protect the poor, even those who can pay feel they must not pay now.”

I can’t write many chapters about this struggle, so some nice memories won’t be included. Anyone who wants to learn more should read the full history of the Kheda Satyagraha by Sjt. Shankarlal Parikh from Kathlal, Kheda.
