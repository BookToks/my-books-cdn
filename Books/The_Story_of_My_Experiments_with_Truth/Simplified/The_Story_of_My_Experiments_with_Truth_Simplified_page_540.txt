THE BIRTH OF KHADI

I don’t remember seeing a handloom or spinning wheel when I wrote about it in 1908 in Hind Swaraj. I said it was the best solution for the increasing poverty in India.

In that book, I believed that anything helping India’s poor people would also help India become free. Even in 1915, when I came back to India from South Africa, I hadn’t actually seen a spinning wheel.

When we started the Satyagraha Ashram at Sabarmati, we brought in some handlooms. But we ran into a problem. We were all professionals or business people, and none of us knew how to weave. We needed an expert to teach us.

Finally, we found a weaver from Palanpur, but he didn’t teach us everything. Still, Maganlal Gandhi, who was good with machines, learned fully soon. Then, we trained more weavers at the Ashram.

Our goal was to wear only clothes made by our own hands. So, we stopped using mill-made cloth and decided everyone in the Ashram would wear handwoven cloth made from Indian yarn.

This gave us a lot of experience. We learned about the life of weavers, how much they made, the problems they faced getting yarn, how they were tricked, and how they kept falling into debt.

We couldn’t make all the cloth we needed right away. So, we had to buy it from handloom weavers. But getting ready-made cloth from Indian mill-yarn was hard, whether from dealers or weavers.

Most fine cloth made by weavers used foreign yarn because Indian mills didn’t spin fine yarn well. Even today, Indian mills produce very little of the finer yarns, and they can’t make the highest quality at all.
