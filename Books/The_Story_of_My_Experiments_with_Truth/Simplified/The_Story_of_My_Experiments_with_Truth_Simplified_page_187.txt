COMPARATIVE STUDY OF RELIGIONS

If I spent all my time helping others, it was because I wanted to understand myself better. I made helping others my own kind of religion because I believed that God could only be found through service. For me, serving meant helping India because that feeling came naturally to me. I had gone to South Africa to travel, to get away from problems back home in Kathiawad, and to make a living.

But like I said, I was really looking for God and trying to understand myself.

My Christian friends made me want to learn more, and I couldn’t stop even if I wanted to. In Durban, Mr. Spencer Walton, who led the South African General Mission, noticed me. I became almost like part of his family. This happened because I had already met some Christians in Pretoria.

Mr. Walton had a special way of being. I don’t remember him ever asking me to become a Christian. Instead, he showed me his life openly, and I got to see everything he did. Mrs. Walton was very kind and talented. I liked how this couple acted. We knew we were different in many ways. No amount of talking could change that. But differences can be good if there is tolerance, kindness, and honesty. I liked that Mr. and Mrs. Walton were humble, hardworking, and devoted to their work, and we met often.

This friendship kept my interest in religion alive. I didn’t have as much free time in Durban as I did in Pretoria to study religion. But I used whatever little time I had well. I kept writing letters about religion. Raychandbhai was helping me. A friend sent me a book called Dharma Vichar by Narmadashanker. The introduction was very useful. I had heard that the poet had lived a wild life, and the introduction described how his religious studies changed his life. That really interested me. I liked the book and read it carefully from start to finish.
