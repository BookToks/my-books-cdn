Some of my clients would only bring me the easy cases and take the tricky ones to other lawyers.

One case was really hard. It was from one of my best clients. The case involved very complicated money records and took a long time. It had been looked at by different courts before. Finally, some expert accountants were asked to check the bookkeeping part. They decided everything in favor of my client, but they made a small mistake in their calculations. They put something on the wrong side of the accounts, which was a serious problem. The other side was also fighting the decision for other reasons. I was the assistant lawyer for my client. When the main lawyer found out about the mistake, he said we didn’t have to admit it. He believed that no lawyer should admit anything that hurts their client. I thought we should admit the mistake.

But the main lawyer said, “If we admit it, the court might cancel the whole decision. No smart lawyer would risk losing the whole case for that. If the case has to be heard again, we don’t know how much money it will cost our client or what will happen!” The client was there when we talked about this.

I said, “I think both the client and we should take the risk. How can we be sure the court will keep a wrong decision just because we don’t admit the mistake? And if admitting it causes problems, what’s the harm?” The main lawyer asked, “But why should we admit it at all?”

I answered, “How can we be sure the court won’t find the mistake or that the other side won’t find it first?”
