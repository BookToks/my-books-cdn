Only my friends know how reading the Gita affected them, but for me, the Gita became a sure guide for how to live. It was like a dictionary I used every day. Just like I looked up English words I didn’t know in a dictionary, I turned to the Gita to find answers to my problems.

Words like aparigraha (not owning things) and samabhava (being calm and fair) really caught my attention. I wondered how to stay calm and treat everyone the same. How could I treat rude officials, coworkers who opposed me, and kind people all equally? How could I stop being attached to things? Wasn’t my body a possession? What about my wife and children? Should I get rid of all my books? Should I give up everything I had and follow Him?

The answer came clearly: I couldn’t follow Him unless I gave up everything. My study of English law helped me understand. I remembered Snell’s talk about fairness and understood the idea of a ‘trustee’ better. I saw law as a kind of religion. The Gita’s teaching about not owning things meant that people seeking salvation should act like trustees—people who manage things but don’t think of them as their own.

It became clear to me that not owning things and being calm meant changing how I felt inside and how I thought. I wrote to Revashankarbhai to let my insurance policy end and to take back whatever money was possible, or just lose what was paid so far, because I believed God, who made my wife and children and me, would take care of them.

I also wrote to my brother, who had been like a father to me, and told him I had given him all my savings so far, but from now on he should not expect anything more. Any money I saved in the future would be used to help the community.

My brother didn’t find it easy to understand this.
