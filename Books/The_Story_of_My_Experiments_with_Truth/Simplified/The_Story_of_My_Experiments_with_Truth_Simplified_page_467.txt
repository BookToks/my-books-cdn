Brajkishorebabu and Rajendrababu were an unbeatable team. They were so devoted that I couldn’t do anything without their help. Their friends, like Shambhubabu, Anugrahababu, Dharanibabu, Ramnavmibabu, and other vakils, were always with us. Vindhyababu and Janakdharibabu also came to help sometimes. All of them were from Bihar.

Their main job was to write down what the ryots (farmers) said.

Professor Kripalani joined us without hesitation. Although he was Sindhi, he acted more like a true Bihari. I have seen only a few people who can blend so well into a new place. Kripalani was one of them. He made sure no one noticed he was from somewhere else. He was like my main guard. For a while, he made it his life’s goal to protect me from visitors who just wanted to see me. He kept people away using his great humor and peaceful warnings. At night, he became a teacher and shared interesting history stories, encouraging shy visitors to be brave.

Maulana Mazharul Haq had promised to help whenever I needed him and made sure to visit once or twice a month. Back then, he lived in great luxury, which was very different from his simple life now. Even though he dressed fancy, he acted like he was one of us.

As I learned more about Bihar, I realized that lasting change was impossible without proper education in villages. The farmers’ lack of knowledge was really sad. They either let their children wander around or made them work all day on indigo farms for just a few cents. At that time, a man’s daily wage was no more than ten pice, a woman’s was six, and a child’s was three.
