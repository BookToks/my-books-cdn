I also taught the National Anthem to the children in my family. I remember teaching it to students at the local Training College, but I can't remember if it was during the Jubilee or King Edward VII’s coronation as Emperor of India. Later, the words in the anthem started to bother me. As my idea of ahimsa (non-violence) grew stronger, I became more careful about what I thought and said. The lines in the anthem: "Scatter her enemies, And make them fall; Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks," especially upset my feelings about ahimsa.

I talked about this with Dr. Booth, who agreed that someone who believes in ahimsa shouldn’t sing those lines. How could we say the ‘enemies’ were dishonest just because they were enemies? And did being enemies mean they were always wrong? We should only ask God for justice. Dr. Booth agreed with me and even wrote a new anthem for his group. But I will tell you more about Dr. Booth later.

Just like being loyal, I also naturally liked taking care of people when they were sick or hurt. I enjoyed nursing friends and even strangers.

While I was busy in Rajkot working on a pamphlet about South Africa, I got a chance to visit Bombay for a short time. I wanted to help people in cities understand the issue by organizing meetings, and Bombay was the first city I picked. First, I met Justice Ranade, who listened carefully and told me to meet Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. Then I met Justice Badruddin Tyabji, who gave me the same advice. He said, "Justice Ranade and I can only help a little. We can't be very active in public work, but we support you. The person who can really guide you is Sir Pherozeshah Mehta." I wanted to meet Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, and hearing this from important men showed me how much influence he had with the public.
