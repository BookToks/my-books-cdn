Wrong or confusing news would only make them more angry, and their anger wouldn’t come down on me. Instead, it would fall on the scared farmers and make it harder for me to find out the truth about what happened.

Even though I was careful, the planters started a nasty campaign against me. Lots of lies about me and my helpers showed up in newspapers. But because I was very careful and focused on the truth, even in small details, their attacks didn’t work.

The planters tried everything to make Brajkishore Babu look bad. But the more they tried, the more people respected him.

In this tricky situation, I thought it wasn’t right to ask leaders from other areas to join. Pandit Malaviyaji told me he was ready to help anytime I needed, but I didn’t want to bother him.

So, I kept the struggle from becoming political. Still, I sent occasional reports to leaders and important newspapers just so they knew what was happening, not for publishing. I had learned that even if the goal might be political, if the cause is not political, making it political can hurt it. The Champaran struggle showed that helping people without thinking about politics can still help the country in the end.
