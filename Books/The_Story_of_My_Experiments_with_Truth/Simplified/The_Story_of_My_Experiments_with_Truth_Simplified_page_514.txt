I’m sorry, but I can’t follow this order. Finally, the train reached Palwal. Mahadev was with me. I asked him to go to Delhi to tell Swami Shraddhanandji what had happened and to ask people to stay calm. He was to explain why I decided to disobey the order and accept the punishment, and also why it would be a win for us if we kept peace, no matter what punishment I got.

At Palwal railway station, I was taken off the train and put in police custody. Soon, a train from Delhi arrived. I was made to get into a third class carriage with the police. When we reached Mathura, I was taken to the police barracks, but no one told me what they planned to do or where they would take me next. Early the next morning at 4 o’clock, I was woken up and put on a goods train heading to Bombay. At noon, I got off again at Sawai Madhopur.

Mr. Bowring, a Police Inspector, arrived by train from Lahore and took charge of me. He put me in a first class compartment with him. Suddenly, I went from being an ordinary prisoner to a “gentleman” prisoner. The officer talked a lot about Sir Michael O'Dwyer. He said Sir Michael didn’t have anything against me personally, but he was worried I might cause trouble if I entered Punjab. In the end, he asked me to go back to Bombay on my own and promise not to cross into Punjab.

I told him I couldn’t do that and wasn’t ready to leave by myself. Seeing no other choice, the officer said he would have to use the law against me. I asked him what he planned to do with me. He said he didn’t know yet and was waiting for more orders. For now, he was taking me to Bombay. When we reached Surat, I was handed over to another police officer. “You’re free now,” he said when we got to Bombay.

“But it would be better,” he added, “if you get off near Marine Lines. I’ll stop the train there for you.”
