When I was in India, I never said anything about the white people in Natal that I hadn’t already said when I was in Natal. And I had plenty of proof to back up what I said.

I was unhappy with the kind of civilization the white people in Natal represented and supported. I had been thinking about this civilization for a long time, so I shared my thoughts in a speech at a small meeting. The captain and some friends listened carefully and understood what I meant. I don’t know if my speech changed their lives, but later I had long talks with the captain and other officers about Western civilization. In my speech, I said Western civilization is mostly built on force, unlike Eastern civilization. One of the officers, the captain, asked me: “If the white people act violently, how will you stick to your belief in non-violence?” I answered, “I hope God will help me forgive them and not take them to court. I’m not angry with them. I just feel sorry because they don’t understand and have narrow minds. I believe they truly think what they are doing is right. So, I have no reason to be angry.” The captain smiled, maybe not fully trusting me.

The days went by slowly and we didn’t know when the quarantine would end. The Quarantine Officer said it was out of his control and he would let us land once he got orders from the Government.

Finally, we were given ultimatums. They told us to obey if we wanted to stay alive. But the passengers and I answered that we had the right to land at Port Natal and we were ready to enter Natal no matter the risks.

After twenty-three days, the ships were finally allowed to enter the harbor, and the passengers were given permission to land.
