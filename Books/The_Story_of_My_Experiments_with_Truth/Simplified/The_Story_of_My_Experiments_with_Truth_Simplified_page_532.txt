People have the basic right to refuse to help the government. We donâ€™t have to keep government jobs or accept government titles. If the government betrays us in something important like the Khilafat issue, we have no choice but to stop cooperating.

So, we have the right to not cooperate with the government if they betray us. But it took many months before the idea of non-cooperation became popular.

At first, this idea was lost during the conference discussions. In fact, when I supported cooperation at the Congress meeting in Amritsar a month later, I hoped that the government would not betray us.
