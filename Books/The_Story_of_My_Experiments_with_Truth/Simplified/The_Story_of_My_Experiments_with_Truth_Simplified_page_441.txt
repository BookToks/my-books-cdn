My mind doesn’t want to wear the sacred thread. But I think your idea about the shikha is worth trying. I used to have one, but I stopped because I felt ashamed for no good reason. Now I think I should start growing it again. I will talk about this with my friends. The Swami didn’t agree with me about the sacred thread.

The reasons I had for not wearing it seemed good to me, but to him, those same reasons meant I should wear it. Even now, I feel the same as I did in Hrishikesh. Since there are many religions, each might need a symbol to show who they are. But when people treat the symbol like a tool to prove their religion is better than others, it should be thrown away. To me, the sacred thread doesn’t help Hinduism grow. So, I don’t care much about it.

About the shikha, I stopped wearing it because I was scared, but after talking with friends, I decided to grow it again.

Now about Lakshman Jhula. I loved the natural beauty around Hrishikesh and the Lakshman Jhula bridge. I felt respect for our ancestors for seeing how beautiful nature is and for making nature important in religion.

But how people treated these beautiful places didn’t make me happy. Like in Hardwar, at Hrishikesh, people made the roads and the river banks dirty. They didn’t even care about polluting the holy Ganges river. It hurt me to see people doing dirty things right where everyone could see, when they could easily go somewhere else.

Lakshman Jhula is just an iron suspension bridge over the Ganges. I heard there used to be a nice rope bridge. A kind man from Marwadi wanted to take down the rope bridge and build an iron one that cost a lot, then gave the keys to the government! I can’t say much about the rope bridge because I never saw it, but the iron bridge doesn’t fit in here and spoils the beauty.
