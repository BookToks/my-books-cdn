A practice had been forced upon every indentured labourer and every Indian stranger to take off his head-gear, when visiting a European, whether the headgear were a cap, turban or a scarf wrapped round the head. A salute even with both hands was not sufficient. Balasundaram thought that he should follow the practice even with me. This was the first case in my experience. I felt humiliated and asked him to tie up his scarf. He did so, not without a certain hesitation, but I could perceive the pleasure on his face.
 
 It has always been a mystery to me how men can feel themselves honoured by the humiliation of their fellow beings.
