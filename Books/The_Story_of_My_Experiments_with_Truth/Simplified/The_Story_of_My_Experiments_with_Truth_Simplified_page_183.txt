Every indentured worker and every Indian visitor had to take off their head covering when they met a European. It didn’t matter if it was a cap, turban, or scarf wrapped around the head. Even saluting with both hands wasn’t enough.

Balasundaram thought he should do this with me too. This was the first time I saw this happen. I felt embarrassed and told him to put his scarf back on. He did it, though he looked a little unsure, but I could see he was also a bit happy.

I have never understood how people can feel proud by making others feel ashamed.
