We had to start all over again.

Some people mocked me, saying, "Because of you, the community helped in the war, and look at what happened now." But their words didn’t bother me. I said, "I don’t regret giving that advice. I still believe we did the right thing by joining the war. We were just doing our duty. We might not get any rewards now, but I truly believe good actions will pay off in the end. Let’s forget the past and focus on what we need to do now." Everyone agreed with me.

I added, "To be honest, the work you asked me to do is almost done. But I don’t think I should leave the Transvaal, even if you let me go back home. Instead of working from Natal like before, I need to work from here now. I can’t think about going back to India anytime soon. I have to get registered with the Transvaal Supreme Court. I’m confident I can handle this new role. If we don’t do this, our community will be pushed out of the country and robbed. Every day, we’ll face more insults.

It doesn’t matter that Mr. Chamberlain refused to see me or that an official insulted me. What matters more is the humiliation of the whole community. We won’t be able to live the hard life we’re expected to endure." So, I started making plans, talked with Indians in Pretoria and Johannesburg, and finally decided to open an office in Johannesburg.

It wasn’t certain that I would be accepted into the Transvaal Supreme Court. But the Law Society didn’t stop my application, and the Court accepted it. It was hard for an Indian to find a good office space in the right area. But I knew Mr. Ritch, a merchant there. With his help and a house agent he knew, I got a good office in the legal part of the city and began my work.
