Some people wrongly think that Gandhiji didn’t like modern science and technology and preferred old-fashioned methods for spiritual or emotional reasons. But Gandhiji said, “I value every invention that helps everyone.” He believed machines are good when there aren’t enough people to do the work. But machines are bad when there are more workers than jobs, like in India.

So, Gandhiji wasn’t against machines themselves. He didn’t like the obsession with machines and making too many of them. Instead of making things in huge factories, he wanted lots of people to make things together. He imagined that in a country like India, with little money but many workers, the energy of the people could be used to build the nation in a fair way. A professor called this idea a “megamachine” but in a different way.

We have to understand clearly that focusing only on money and material success will lead us nowhere. Big industries have created giant companies that can control the government and make it serve only their needs. An American economist warns that to avoid the problems of this system, we need to focus on other important goals. These goals should be about people and their spirit, just like Gandhiji wanted.

Mahatma Gandhi cared deeply about the poor and less fortunate in India and other countries. While working for the good of everyone, he first paid attention to the poorest and weakest people. He was inspired by Ruskin’s idea from Unto This Last, which shaped his life and work. This caring attitude made Gandhiji fight strongly against racism and colonial rule.
