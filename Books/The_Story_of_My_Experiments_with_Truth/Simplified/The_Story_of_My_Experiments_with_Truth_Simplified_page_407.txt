Mr. Kallenbach came with me to England because we planned to go to India together.

We stayed in the same place and wanted to travel on the same ship.

But since Germans were watched very closely, we weren’t sure if Mr. Kallenbach could get a passport. I tried my best to help, and Mr. Roberts, who supported him, sent a message to the Viceroy asking for permission. But Lord Hardinge replied quickly: "Sorry, the Government of India can’t take this risk." We all understood what that meant.

It was very hard for me to say goodbye to Mr. Kallenbach, but I think it was even harder for him. If he had come to India, he would have lived a simple, happy life as a farmer and weaver. Now, he is in South Africa, doing well as an architect.

We wanted to buy third-class tickets, but there were none available on P. & O. ships, so we had to travel second class.

We brought dried fruit from South Africa because fresh fruit was easy to get on the ship, but dried fruit was not.

Dr. Jivraj Mehta had wrapped my ribs with "Mede’s Plaster" and told me not to take it off until we reached the Red Sea. I tried to keep it on for two days, but it became too uncomfortable. I finally managed to remove the plaster and was able to wash properly.

I mostly ate nuts and fruits. I felt better every day and was much stronger by the time we reached the Suez Canal. I was still weak but no longer in danger, and I slowly started doing more exercise. I think the fresh air in the cooler parts of the world helped me heal.

I’m not sure if it was because of my past trips or for some other reason, but I noticed that the English and Indian passengers on the ship kept a bigger distance from each other than I had ever seen before, even on my trip from South Africa.
