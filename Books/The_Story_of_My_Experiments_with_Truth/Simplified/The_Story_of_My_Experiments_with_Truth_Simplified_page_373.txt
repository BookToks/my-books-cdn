FASTING

Around the time I stopped drinking milk and eating cereals and started trying a fruit-only diet, I began fasting to practice self-control. Mr. Kallenbach joined me in this. I had fasted sometimes before, but only for health reasons. I learned from a friend that fasting could help with self-control.

I was born into a Vaishnava family, and my mother often kept strict vows. While in India, I had fasted on days like Ekadashi, but I did it just to copy my mother and make my parents happy.

Back then, I didnâ€™t really understand or believe that fasting had any real power.

But when I saw my friend benefiting from fasting and trying to support his vow of brahmacharya (self-discipline), I decided to follow him and started fasting on Ekadashi days. Usually, Hindus eat milk and fruit on fasting days, but I began complete fasting, only drinking water.

When I started this, the Hindu month of Shravan and the Islamic month of Ramzan happened at the same time. The Gandhi family followed both Vaishnava and Shaivite vows and visited temples of both kinds.

Some family members fasted on pradosha days throughout the month of Shravan. I chose to do the same.

These important experiments happened while we lived at Tolstoy Farm, where Mr. Kallenbach and I stayed with some Satyagrahi families, including young people and children. We had a school for the kids. Among them were four or five Muslims. I always helped and encouraged them to follow their religious practices. I made sure they offered their daily namaz (prayers). There were also Christian and Parsi young people, and I thought it was my duty to support them in following their religious customs.
