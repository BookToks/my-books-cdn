He had many good qualities, but one problem – he was naturally suspicious.

He was proud of Islam and liked to talk about Islamic ideas. Even though he didn’t know Arabic, he knew the Holy Koran and other Islamic books quite well. He always had lots of examples ready to explain things. Spending time with him helped me learn a lot about Islam. When we got closer, we often had long talks about religion.

On my second or third day there, he took me to see the Durban court.

He introduced me to some people and sat me next to his lawyer.

The judge kept looking at me and finally asked me to take off my turban.

I refused and left the court.

So, I was going to face some trouble here too.

Abdulla Sheth told me why some Indians had to take off their turbans. He said that those wearing Muslim clothes could keep their turbans on, but other Indians had to take theirs off in court.

I need to explain this to make the difference clear. In those few days, I noticed that Indians were split into groups. One group was Muslim merchants who called themselves ‘Arabs.’ Another group was Hindu, and another was Parsi clerks.

The Hindu clerks didn’t belong to any group unless they joined the ‘Arabs.’ The Parsi clerks called themselves Persians. These three groups had some social connections. But the biggest group was made up of Tamil, Telugu, and North Indian workers who were either indentured or freed laborers. Indentured workers were those who went to Natal with an agreement to work for five years. They were called ‘girmitiyas’ from ‘girmit,’ a changed form of the English word ‘agreement.’ The other three groups only had business connections with these workers. English people called these workers ‘coolies’ because most Indians were workers. So, all Indians were called ‘coolies’ or ‘samis.’ ‘Sami’ is a Tamil ending after many Tamil names, and it actually means ‘master’ in Sanskrit.
