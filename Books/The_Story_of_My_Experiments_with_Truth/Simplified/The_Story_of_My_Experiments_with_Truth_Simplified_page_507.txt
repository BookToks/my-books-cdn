I insisted on using Gujarati in the Sabha, and some of my other ways of working seemed strange to others. This made them worried and uncomfortable. But I have to say, most of them were kind enough to accept my weird habits.

Right from the start, I felt the Sabha wouldn’t last very long. I noticed that some members didn’t like how much I focused on truth and Ahimsa (non-violence). Still, in the beginning, our new work was very active, and the movement grew quickly.
