After this, we exchanged a lot of letters, but I don’t want to make the sad story longer. Just know that what happened to me was similar to what happens every day in India. The Commanding Officer used threats and clever tricks to split our group. Some people who had agreed to the plan changed their minds because of the Commander’s pressure.

Around this time, many wounded soldiers came to Netley Hospital, and our group was asked to help. Those who the Commanding Officer convinced went to Netley. The others said no. I was lying down sick, but I kept in touch with the group. Mr. Roberts, the Under-Secretary of State, visited me many times then. He kept telling me to convince the others to help.

He said they could make a new group that only listened to the Commanding Officer at Netley Hospital. This way, no one would feel disrespected, the government would be happy, and the wounded soldiers would get help. This idea sounded good to me and my friends, so those who had refused before also went to Netley.

Only I stayed behind, lying down and trying to deal with my situation as best I could.
