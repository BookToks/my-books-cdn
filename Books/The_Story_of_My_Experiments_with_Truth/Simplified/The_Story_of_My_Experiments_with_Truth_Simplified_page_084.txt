I was chosen to be part of the Executive Committee of the Vegetarian Society, and I made sure to go to every meeting. But I always felt too shy to speak up.

Dr. Oldfield once said to me, "You talk to me fine, but why don’t you say anything at committee meetings? You’re like a drone." I understood his joke. Bees work hard, but drones just hang around. It was strange that while others shared their opinions, I stayed quiet. It wasn’t because I didn’t want to talk—I just didn’t know how to say what I felt. Everyone else seemed to know more than me. And just when I finally got ready to speak, they would start talking about something new. This kept happening for a long time.

Then a serious topic came up. I didn’t want to skip the meeting or just stay silent and vote without saying anything. The President of the Society was Mr. Hills, who owned the Thames Iron Works. He was very strict and moral. The Society mostly depended on his money, and many committee members were supported by him. Dr. Allinson, a well-known vegetarian doctor, was also on the committee. He supported birth control, which was a new idea then, and he taught working-class people about it.

Mr. Hills thought birth control was against good morals. He believed the Vegetarian Society should not only focus on diet but also promote moral behavior. He didn’t want Dr. Allinson in the group because of his views. So, they suggested kicking Dr. Allinson out.

This topic interested me a lot. I thought Dr. Allinson’s ideas about birth control were risky, and I understood why Mr. Hills, as a strict moral person, opposed him. I also respected Mr. Hills for his kindness and support. But I didn’t think it was right to remove someone from the Vegetarian Society just because they didn’t agree with Mr. Hills’ strict morals. Mr. Hills’ opinion about excluding people who didn’t share his morals was his own personal view. The Society’s main goal was to promote vegetarianism, not to force any moral rules.
