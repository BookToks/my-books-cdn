HOW A CLIENT WAS SAVED

By now, you probably know the name Parsi Rustomji well. He became both my client and my co-worker. Actually, he was my co-worker first and then my client. I earned his trust so much that he asked for my advice even on personal family matters. When he was sick, he came to me for help. Even though we lived very different lives, he didn’t mind accepting my homemade treatments.

One time, this friend got into big trouble. He usually told me about most things, but he kept one secret. He was a big importer of goods from Bombay and Calcutta and sometimes smuggled items. Since he was good friends with the customs officials, no one thought he was doing anything wrong. The officials trusted his invoices and sometimes looked the other way.

But, like the Gujarati poet Akho said, stealing like quicksilver can’t be hidden forever, and Rustomji’s secret was found out. He came to me quickly, tears falling, and said, “Brother, I have lied to you. Today my guilt was discovered. I smuggled goods and now I’m doomed. I might go to jail and lose everything. Only you might be able to save me. I never told you about this smuggling because I didn’t want to bother you with such things, but now I’m very sorry!” I told him to stay calm and said, “Whether you are saved or not is up to God. You know how I work; I can only try to help you if you tell the truth.” Rustomji felt very ashamed.

“But isn’t my confession to you enough?” he asked.

I said, “You haven’t wronged me, but the Government.”
