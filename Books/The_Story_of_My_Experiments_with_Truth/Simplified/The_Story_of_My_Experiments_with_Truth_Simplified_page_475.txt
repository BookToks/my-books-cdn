I have always felt sad that this work was never finished. Whenever I visit Champaran and hear kind reminders from my Marwadi and Bihari friends, I think about all the plans I had to stop suddenly, and it makes me sigh.

Education is still happening in many places in some way. But the work to protect cows didn’t really take hold and didn’t move forward as planned.

While people were still talking about the problems of the Kheda farmers, I had already started working on the issues of the mill workers in Ahmedabad.

I was in a tricky situation. The mill workers’ case was strong. Shrimati Anasuyabai had to fight against her own brother, Sjt. Ambalal Sarabhai, who was leading the mill owners. I was friends with them, which made it harder to argue with them. I talked with them and asked them to settle the problem through arbitration, but they refused.

So, I had to tell the workers to go on strike. Before that, I got very close to the workers and their leaders and explained the rules for a good strike: 1. never use violence, 2. never bother people who kept working, 3. never ask for charity, and 4. stay strong, no matter how long the strike lasts, and earn money in honest ways while striking.

The strike leaders understood and agreed to these rules. At a big meeting, the workers promised not to go back to work until their demands were met or the mill owners agreed to arbitration.
