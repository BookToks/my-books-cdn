Dinabandhu Andrews asked me if it was right for me to take part in the war conference. He told me about some secret deals between England and Italy that were causing a lot of talk in the British newspapers. He asked, "How can you join the conference if England has made secret promises to another European country?" But I didn’t know anything about these secret deals.

I trusted what Dinabandhu Andrews said. So, I wrote a letter to Lord Chelmsford to explain why I wasn’t sure about going to the conference. He invited me to talk about it with him. I had a long talk with him and his assistant, Mr. Maffey. After that, I agreed to go to the conference.

The Viceroy’s main point was this: “You don’t think I know everything the British government does. No one thinks the British government is perfect. But if you believe the British Empire has mostly done good things, and if you think India has mostly benefited from being connected to Britain, then don’t you think every Indian should help the Empire when it really needs it? I’ve also seen what the newspapers say about secret treaties. I don’t know anything more than what you read, and you know how newspapers often make up stories. Can you really refuse to help the Empire just because of a newspaper report at such an important time? 

You can question us about these moral issues after the war, but not now.” I had heard this kind of argument before, but it felt different because of who said it and when. So, I decided to go to the conference. About the Muslim demands, I was going to write a letter to the Viceroy.
