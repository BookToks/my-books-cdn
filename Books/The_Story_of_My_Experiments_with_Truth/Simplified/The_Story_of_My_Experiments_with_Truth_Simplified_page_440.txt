Back then, wearing the sacred thread was not common among the vaishya families in Kathiawad.

But a new movement had started to make it necessary for the first three varnas to wear it. Because of this, several members of the Gandhi family began wearing the sacred thread. The Brahman who taught a few of us boys, Ram Raksha, gave us the thread. Even though I didn’t need a bunch of keys, I got one and started wearing it. Later, when the thread broke, I don’t remember if I really missed it. But I know I didn’t get a new one.

As I got older, many people tried to get me to wear the sacred thread again, both in India and South Africa, but I didn’t want to. I thought, if Shudras can’t wear it, why should the other varnas? I didn’t see a good reason to follow what seemed like an unnecessary custom. I didn’t mind the thread itself, but I didn’t believe in the reasons for wearing it.

As a vaishnava, I always wore the kanthi necklace, and the shikha (a tuft of hair) was expected by the elders. But the night before I went to England, I got rid of the shikha. I was afraid that if I was bareheaded, English people might laugh at me and think I was uncivilized. This fear was so strong that in South Africa, I even convinced my cousin Chhaganlal Gandhi, who always wore the shikha for religious reasons, to cut it off. I worried it might hurt his public work, so even though I knew it might upset him, I made him do it.

I told the Swami honestly, "I won’t wear the sacred thread because I don’t think it’s necessary. Many Hindus don’t wear it and still stay Hindus. The sacred thread should mean spiritual rebirth, showing that the person wearing it is trying to live a better, purer life. But right now, Hinduism and India aren’t ready to prove that. This right to wear the thread can only come after Hinduism gets rid of untouchability, stops treating people as better or worse, and fixes many other problems and fake behaviors that have become common."
