During the hard walks I had to do, I suddenly thought that if I wanted to serve my community like this, I would have to give up wanting children and money. I would need to live like a vanaprastha – someone who steps away from family life.

The 'Rebellion' didn’t take up more than six weeks of my time, but those weeks were very important for me. I started to understand how important promises, or vows, really are. I saw that a vow doesn’t take away your freedom; instead, it actually gives you more freedom.

Before this, I hadn’t succeeded because I didn’t have strong willpower or faith in myself or in God’s help. My mind was full of doubts. I realized that if you don’t make a vow, you get tempted easily. But when you make a vow, it’s like moving from being uncontrolled to being truly committed, like in a real marriage.

People who say, “I believe in trying, but I don’t want to make promises,” are actually weak and secretly want the thing they should avoid. Why is it so hard to make a clear decision? I promise to run away from a snake I know will bite me, not just try to run. Just trying might not be enough to save me.

If I’m okay with just trying, it means I don’t fully understand how important it is to take strong action. Sometimes we worry about changing our minds later and think, “How can I promise something forever?” But that doubt shows we don’t clearly see that we need to give up something for good.

That’s why Nishkulanand said, “Giving up without really hating it won’t last.” So when you stop wanting something, making a promise to give it up is natural and will happen for sure.
