We were walking toward Chievely Camp, where Lieutenant Roberts, the son of Lord Roberts, had been seriously hurt. Our group had the honor of carrying his body from the battlefield. It was a hot and sticky day during our march. Everyone was really thirsty.

On the way, there was a small stream where we could drink water. But who should drink first? We wanted to wait until the Tommies finished.

However, they didnâ€™t want to start first and encouraged us to go ahead. For a while, we had a friendly competition, each trying to let the other drink first.
