Things got so bad that one day Maganlal Gandhi told me, "We have no money left and nothing for next month." I quietly said, "Then we will go to the untouchables' area." This wasn’t the first time I faced a problem like this. Every time, God helped me at the last moment. One morning, soon after Maganlal warned me about our money problem, a child came to say that a man named Sheth was waiting in a car outside and wanted to see me.

I went out to him. He said, "I want to help the Ashram. Will you accept it?"

I said, "Of course. Honestly, I don’t have any money right now." He said, "I will come back tomorrow at this time. Will you be here?" I said, "Yes," and he left.

The next day, right on time, the car came near our place, and the horn honked. The children told me the Sheth was outside but didn’t come in. I went out to meet him. He gave me 13,000 rupees in cash and then drove away.

I never expected help like this, and it was such a strange way to give it! The man had never been to the Ashram before. As far as I remember, I had only met him once. No visit, no questions—just giving money and leaving! This was a new experience for me. This money stopped us from moving to the untouchables' area. We felt safe for a whole year.

Just like there was a storm outside, there was also a storm inside the Ashram.

Even though untouchable friends used to come to my place in South Africa and live and eat with me, my wife and other women didn’t really like having untouchable friends in the Ashram. I could easily see they didn’t care for Danibehn and maybe even didn’t like her. The money problem didn’t worry me, but this problem inside the Ashram was harder for me to handle.
