Escombe was a friend of Dada Abdulla's. The Speaker quickly said that the discussion about the Bill would be delayed for two days. This made us very happy.

The petition to be given to the Legislative Assembly was written. Three copies had to be made, plus one extra for the newspapers. We also wanted to get as many signatures as possible, and all this had to be done in one night. Volunteers who knew English and others stayed up all night. Mr. Arthur, an old man famous for his beautiful handwriting, wrote the main copy. The other copies were written by others while listening to someone reading. Five copies were finished at the same time.

Merchant volunteers went out in their own carriages, or carriages they paid for, to collect signatures. This happened quickly, and the petition was sent out. Newspapers printed it with good comments. It also made an impression on the Assembly. The Bill was talked about in the House. Supporters of the Bill gave a weak defense against the points made in the petition. Still, the Bill was passed.

We all knew this would happen, but the protest gave new energy to the community. It made everyone realize that the community was united and that it was just as important to fight for political rights as for business rights.

At that time, Lord Ripon was the Secretary of State for the Colonies. We decided to send him a huge petition. This was a big job and couldnâ€™t be done in one day. Volunteers helped, and everyone did their share.

I worked hard on writing this petition. I read everything I could about the topic. My main argument was based on a principle and what made sense. I said we had a right to vote in Natal because we had a kind of voting right in India. I also said it was smart to keep this right because only a small part of the Indian population could actually use it.

In two weeks, we got ten thousand signatures.
