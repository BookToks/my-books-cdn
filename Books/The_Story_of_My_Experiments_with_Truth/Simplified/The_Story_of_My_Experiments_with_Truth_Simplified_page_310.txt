I was really disappointed. The Police Commissioner was also very sorry. I felt disgusted with the legal system. I started to hate how smart people could use their brains to hide crime.

But the guilt of these two officers was clear. Even though they were found not guilty, the government couldn’t keep them. Both were fired, the Asiatic department became cleaner, and the Indian community felt a bit safer.

This event made me more respected and brought me more work. Most of the money the community was losing to corruption was saved. Not all of it, because some dishonest people still kept cheating. But honest people could now stay honest.

Even though these officers were bad, I didn’t hate them personally. They knew this, and when they were in trouble, they came to me for help. I helped them. They had a chance to get jobs with the Johannesburg Municipality, and I didn’t stop them. A friend of theirs talked to me about it, I agreed, and they got the jobs.

Because of this, the officials I dealt with were comfortable around me. Even though I often had to argue with their department and use strong words, they stayed friendly. I didn’t realize then that this was part of my nature. Later, I learned it was an important part of Satyagraha and ahimsa.

A person and what they do are two different things. A good action deserves praise, and a bad one deserves criticism. But the person who does the action always deserves respect or pity, depending on the situation.

The idea of “hate the sin, not the sinner” is easy to understand but hard to practice. That’s why hate spreads in the world.
