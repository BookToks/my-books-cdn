All this happened because of eating meat.

There was a funny poem by the Gujarati poet Narmada that we schoolboys liked. It went like this: Look at the mighty Englishman. He rules over small Indians because he eats meat and is five cubits tall.

This poem made a big impression on me. I was beaten, and slowly I started to believe that eating meat was good. I thought it would make me strong and brave. I also believed that if everyone in the country ate meat, we could beat the English.

So, we picked a day to try eating meat. We had to keep it a secret. The Gandhis were Vaishnavas, and my parents were very strict Vaishnavas too. They often went to the Haveli, and our family even had their own temples. Jainism was strong in Gujarat, and its influence was everywhere. People in Gujarat, especially Jains and Vaishnavas, were very against eating meat, more than anywhere else in India or outside.

These were the traditions I grew up with. I loved my parents a lot. I knew if they found out I ate meat, they would be shocked. Also, because I loved telling the truth, I was careful. I knew I would have to lie to my parents if I started eating meat. But I was determined to make this change. It wasn’t about liking the taste—I didn’t even know if it tasted good. I wanted to be strong and brave and wanted my people to be strong too, so we could defeat the English and make India free. I hadn’t heard the word ‘Swaraj’ yet, but I knew what freedom meant. I was so focused on this change that I convinced myself hiding it from my parents wasn’t really lying.
