I liked some parts of the books, but didn’t like others. Many of the Infallible Proofs were meant to support the religion of the Bible, as the author saw it. The book didn’t change my mind.

Parker’s Commentary was good for improving morals, but it wasn’t helpful for someone like me who didn’t believe in the usual Christian ideas. Butler’s Analogy seemed very deep and hard to understand, and I thought it needed to be read several times to get it. It looked like it was written to convince atheists to believe in God. The parts about God’s existence didn’t matter to me because I already believed, but the parts saying Jesus was the only true son of God didn’t affect me.

Mr. Coates wasn’t someone who gave up easily. He cared about me a lot. He saw the Vaishnava necklace of Tulsi-beads around my neck and thought it was just a silly superstition. He was upset by it. “This superstition doesn’t suit you. Let me break the necklace,” he said. “No, you can’t. It’s a special gift from my mother,” I answered. “But do you believe in it?” he asked. “I don’t fully understand its meaning. I don’t think I’ll be harmed if I don’t wear it. But I can’t just give up this necklace my mother gave me out of love and hope for my good. When it wears out and breaks by itself, I won’t want a new one. But this necklace can’t be broken.” Mr. Coates didn’t accept my reasons because he didn’t respect my religion. He wanted to save me from what he saw as ignorance.

He tried to make me believe that, even if other religions had some truth, I couldn’t be saved unless I accepted Christianity as the real truth. He said my sins wouldn’t be forgiven except through Jesus, and that doing good things wouldn’t help me.

Just like he gave me books, he introduced me to friends who were strong Christians.
