There was water everywhere. There were only a few toilets, and I still remember how bad they smelled. I told the volunteers about it. They said straight away, "That’s not our job, it’s the scavengers’ job." I asked for a broom. The man looked at me like I was weird.

I got a broom and cleaned the toilet myself. But that was just for me. There were so few toilets and so many people that they needed to be cleaned often, but I couldn’t do it all. So I just took care of my own needs. The others didn’t seem to care about the bad smell and dirt.

But that wasn’t the worst part. Some delegates even used the porches outside their rooms as bathrooms at night. In the morning, I showed the spots to the volunteers. No one wanted to clean them, and I couldn’t find anyone to help me.

Things have gotten better since then, but even now, some careless delegates still make a mess wherever they want. And not all volunteers are ready to clean up after them.

I saw that if the Congress meeting went on for a long time, these conditions could cause a disease outbreak.
