THE CANKER OF UNTRUTH

About forty years ago, there were not many Indian students in England. They usually pretended to be single even if they were married. In England, students were all single because people thought studying and being married didn’t go well together. Back home, students were called brahmacharis, which meant they stayed single while studying. But in India, kids sometimes got married very young, which was almost never seen in England. So, Indian students in England felt embarrassed to say they were married.

Another reason they lied was because if people knew they were married, they couldn’t spend time or flirt with the girls in the family where they lived. The flirting was mostly innocent, and parents even liked it. This was important because every young man had to find a wife. But when Indian boys in England acted like English boys and started these friendships, it often caused trouble. I saw that many of our young men gave in to this and started lying just to keep these friendships, even though these friendships were not good for them. I did the same. I said I was single even though I was married and had a son. But lying didn’t make me happy. I was quiet and kept to myself, which stopped things from getting worse. If I didn’t talk much, no girl would want to talk to me or go out with me.

I was both shy and quiet. In the family where I stayed in Ventnor, it was usual for the landlady’s daughter to take guests for walks. One day, she took me to the beautiful hills near Ventnor. I walked fast, but she walked even faster, pulling me along and talking a lot. I could only answer with a quiet “yes” or “no,” or sometimes, “yes, how beautiful!”
