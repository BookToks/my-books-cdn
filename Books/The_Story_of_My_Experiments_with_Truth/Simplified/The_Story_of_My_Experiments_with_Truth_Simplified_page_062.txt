With my mother’s permission and blessings, I happily left for Bombay, leaving my wife and our baby behind. But when I got there, friends told my brother that the Indian Ocean was very rough in June and July. Since it was my first trip, they said I shouldn’t sail until November. Someone even said a ship had just sunk in a storm. This made my brother worried, and he didn’t want me to take the risk of sailing right away.

He left me with a friend in Bombay and went back to Rajkot to do his work. He gave the money for my travel to his brother-in-law and told some friends to help me if I needed anything.

Time passed slowly in Bombay. I kept dreaming about going to England.

At the same time, my caste people were upset about me wanting to go abroad. No Modh Bania had ever gone to England before, and they thought I shouldn’t do it. They called a big meeting and asked me to come. I went. Somehow, I found the courage to face them without fear.

The Sheth, the leader of our community and someone related to me who was close to my father, spoke to me. He said, “Our caste thinks it’s wrong for you to go to England. Our religion forbids traveling abroad. We also heard it’s hard to keep our religion there because you have to eat and drink with Europeans.” I answered, “I don’t think going to England breaks our religion. I want to go to study more. I promised my mother I will avoid the three things you worry about most. I believe my promise will keep me safe.”

But the Sheth replied, “We tell you, it’s not possible to keep our religion there.”
