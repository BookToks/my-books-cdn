This made me feel a little better. I didn’t plan to take any action against the man who attacked me, so that part of the story ended there.

The next morning, Isa Sheth’s helper took me to the coach. I got a good seat and arrived safely in Johannesburg that night.

Standerton is a small village, and Johannesburg is a big city. Abdulla Sheth had also sent a message to Johannesburg with the name and address of Muhammad Kasam Kamruddin’s company there. Someone from the company was supposed to meet me at the stage, but I didn’t see him, and he didn’t recognize me. So, I decided to go to a hotel.

I knew the names of some hotels. I took a taxi and asked to go to the Grand National Hotel. I spoke to the manager and asked for a room. He looked at me for a moment and politely said, “I’m sorry, we are full,” and then said goodbye. So I told the driver to take me to Muhammad Kasam Kamruddin’s shop.

There, I met Abdul Gani Sheth waiting for me. He greeted me warmly and laughed a lot when I told him about my experience at the hotel.

“How did you expect to get a room at a hotel?” he asked.

“Why not?” I said.

“You’ll understand after you’ve stayed here a few days,” he replied.

“Only people like us live in a place like this because we want to make money so badly that we accept insults. That’s why we’re here.” Then he told me about the tough life Indians face in South Africa.

We will learn more about Abdul Gani Sheth as we go on.

He said, “This country isn’t made for people like you. Tomorrow you have to go to Pretoria, but you’ll have to travel third class. Things are worse in Transvaal than in Natal. Indians are never allowed to buy first or second class tickets.” 

“You probably haven’t tried hard enough,” I said.

“We have asked for changes, but honestly, most of our people don’t want to travel first or second class anyway.” 

I asked for the railway rules and read them.
