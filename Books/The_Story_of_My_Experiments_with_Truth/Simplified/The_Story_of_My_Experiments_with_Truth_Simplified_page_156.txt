I shall gladly be your witness in court if you proceed against the man. I am very sorry you have been so rudely assaulted.' 'You need not be sorry', I said. 'What does the poor man know? All coloured people are the same to him. He no doubt treats Negroes just as he has treated me. I have made it a rule not go to court in respect of any personal grievance.
 
 So I do not intend to proceed against him.' 'That is just like you,' said Mr. Coates, but do think it over again. We must teach such men a lesson.' He then spoke to the policeman and reprimanded him. I could not follow their talk, as it was in Dutch, the policeman being a Boer. But he apologized to me, for which there was no need. I had already forgiven him.
 
 But I never again went through this street. There would be other men coming in this man's place and, ignorant of the incident, they would behave likewise.
 
 Why should I unnecessarily court another kick? I therefore selected a different walk.
 
 The incident deepened my feeling for the Indian settlers. I discussed with them the advisability of making a test case, if it were found necessary to do so, after having seen the British Agent in the matter of these regulations.
 
 I thus made an intimate study of the hard condition of the Indian settlers, not only by reading and hearing about it, but by personal experience. I saw that South Africa was no country for a self-respecting Indian, and my mind became more and more occupied with the question as to how this state of thing might be improved.
 
 But my principal duty for the moment was to attend to the case of Dada Abdulla.
