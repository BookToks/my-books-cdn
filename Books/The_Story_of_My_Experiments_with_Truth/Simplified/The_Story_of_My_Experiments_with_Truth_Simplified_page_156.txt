I would be happy to be your witness in court if you decide to take action against the man. I’m really sorry you were treated so badly. 

You don’t have to be sorry, I said. What does the poor man know? To him, all colored people are the same. He probably treats all Black people the way he treated me. I have a rule not to go to court over personal problems.

So, I don’t plan to take any action against him. 

“That’s just like you,” said Mr. Coates, “but please think about it again. We need to teach men like that a lesson.” He then talked to the policeman and scolded him. I couldn’t understand their conversation because it was in Dutch, since the policeman was a Boer. But the policeman apologized to me, even though I had already forgiven him.

After that, I never walked down that street again. Other men would come and, not knowing what happened, might act the same way.

Why should I risk getting hurt again? So, I chose a different route.

This event made me feel more connected to the Indian settlers. I talked with them about possibly making a test case if it was needed, after checking with the British Agent about the rules.

I learned a lot about the tough life of the Indian settlers, not just by reading or hearing about it, but by living through it myself. I saw that South Africa was not a good place for any Indian who wanted to keep their dignity. I kept thinking about how things could be better.

But right now, my main job was to help with the case of Dada Abdulla.
