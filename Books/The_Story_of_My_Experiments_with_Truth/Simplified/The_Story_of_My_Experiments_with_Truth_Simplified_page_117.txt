Starting to work in Rajkot would have meant being laughed at for sure. I hardly knew as much as a qualified lawyer, but I expected to be paid ten times more than him! No client would be crazy enough to hire me. Even if someone did, should I add arrogance and cheating to my ignorance and make my debt bigger?

My friends told me to go to Bombay for a while to get experience at the High Court, learn Indian law, and try to get some cases. I listened to them and went.

In Bombay, I started living with a cook who was as bad at cooking as I was. He was a Brahmin. I didn’t treat him like a servant but as part of the family.

He would pour water on himself but never actually wash. His clothes were dirty, including his sacred thread, and he didn’t know the scriptures. But how could I find a better cook?

“Well, Ravishankar,” (that was his name), I asked him, “you might not know cooking, but you must know your daily prayers, right?” He said, “Prayers? For me, the plough is my prayer and the spade my ritual. That’s the kind of Brahmin I am. I have to live by your kindness. Otherwise, I’d be a farmer.” So I had to teach Ravishankar. I had plenty of time, so I started doing half the cooking myself and tried new vegetarian recipes. I bought a stove, and together with Ravishankar, we ran the kitchen. I didn’t mind eating together, and soon Ravishankar didn’t either. We got along well. The only problem was that Ravishankar promised to stay dirty and keep the food unclean!

But I couldn’t stay in Bombay for more than four or five months because I didn’t make enough money to cover my growing expenses.

This is how I started my life. I found being a lawyer to be a bad job – lots of show but little real knowledge. I felt a heavy weight of responsibility.
