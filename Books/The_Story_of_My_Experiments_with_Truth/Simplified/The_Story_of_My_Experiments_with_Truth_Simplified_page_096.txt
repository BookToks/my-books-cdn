Although I had learned a little about Hinduism and other religions, I should have known that this wouldn't be enough to help me through tough times. People don’t really understand what keeps them going during hard times. If someone doesn’t believe in God, they might think it’s just luck. If they do believe, they’ll say God saved them. They might think their religious study or spiritual practice helped them, but when they’re actually being saved, they don’t really know what did. Anyone who’s been proud of their spiritual strength has probably seen it broken down during tough times. Just knowing about religion isn’t very useful when you’re really struggling.

I first realized how useless just knowing about religion was when I was in England. I don’t really know how I was saved before because I was very young then. But now I was twenty and had some experience as a husband and father.

In the last year I was in England, in 1890, there was a Vegetarian Conference in Portsmouth. An Indian friend and I were invited to go. Portsmouth is a busy sea-port with a big navy base. Many houses there had women who weren’t exactly prostitutes but didn’t have very strict morals either. We stayed in one of those houses without knowing it. The people who invited us didn’t know either. It’s hard for travelers to know which places are good or bad in a town like Portsmouth.

After the Conference, we came back in the evening. After dinner, we played a game of bridge, and our landlady joined us, which is normal in England, even in good families. Everyone makes harmless jokes while playing, but my friend and our hostess started making dirty ones.
