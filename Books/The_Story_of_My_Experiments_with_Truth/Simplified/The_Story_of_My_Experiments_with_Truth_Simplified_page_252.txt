Often, when I needed money for public projects and thought I had to use the trust fund, I found ways to get the money without touching the trust. The fund is still there and is used only when really needed, and it has grown over time.

I have never regretted this decision, and as time passed, my wife also understood why it was smart. It has helped us avoid many temptations.

I truly believe that someone working for the public should never accept expensive gifts.
