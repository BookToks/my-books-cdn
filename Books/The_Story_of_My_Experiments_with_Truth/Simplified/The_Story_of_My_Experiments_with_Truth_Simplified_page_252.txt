Often, when I was in need of funds for public purposes, and felt that I must draw upon the trust, I have been able to raise the requisite amount, leaving the trust money intact. The fund is still there, being operated upon in times of need, and it has regularly accumulated.
 
 I have never since regretted the step, and as the years have gone by, my wife has also seen its wisdom. It has saved us from many temptations.
 
 I am definitely of opinion that a public worker should accept no costly gifts.
