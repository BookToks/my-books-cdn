Another important part of the Congress was the involvement of educated Indians who were born in the colonies.

The Colonial-born Indian Educational Association was started with the help of the Congress. Most members were these educated young people. They had to pay a small fee to join. The Association helped them share their problems and ideas, think more deeply, connect with Indian businesspeople, and find ways to help the community. It was like a club where members met regularly to talk or read papers on different topics. They also started a small library for members to use.

The third important part of the Congress was spreading information. This meant telling people in South Africa, England, and India about the real situation of Indians living in Natal. To do this, I wrote two pamphlets.

The first pamphlet was called An Appeal to Every Briton in South Africa. It showed the facts and evidence about how Indians were treated in Natal.

The second pamphlet was called the Indian Franchise â€“ An Appeal. It gave a short history of how Indians got the right to vote in Natal, with important facts and numbers. I worked hard to prepare these pamphlets, and the effort paid off. They were shared widely.

Because of all this work, Indians made many friends in South Africa and gained strong support from all groups in India. It also gave South African Indians a clear plan for what to do next.
