I think my real start in Congress politics was when I took part in the Congress meetings at Amritsar. Before that, going to Congress meetings was just something I did every year to show I was loyal. I never thought I had a special job to do, and I didn’t want one either.

At Amritsar, I realized there were a few things I was good at and could help the Congress with. I noticed that important leaders like Lokamanya, Deshabandhu, and Pandit Motilalji liked the work I did for the Punjab inquiry. They invited me to their small meetings where they planned important decisions. Only people they trusted and needed were invited, but sometimes others sneaked in too.

For the next year, two things caught my interest because I thought I could do well with them. One was about remembering the Jalianwala Bagh Massacre. The Congress had passed a resolution about it, and they needed to raise about five lakh rupees. I was made one of the trustees. Pandit Malaviyaji was famous for being really good at raising money for public causes, and I knew I was not too bad at it either. I found out I was good at this while I was in South Africa. I wasn’t as great as Malaviyaji at getting big donations from kings and princes, but for the Jalianwala Bagh memorial, we didn’t plan to ask them. So, most of the work to collect money was up to me. The kind people of Bombay gave generously, and now the memorial fund has a good amount saved in the bank. But the big question now is what kind of memorial to build on the land where Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs all gave their lives together.
