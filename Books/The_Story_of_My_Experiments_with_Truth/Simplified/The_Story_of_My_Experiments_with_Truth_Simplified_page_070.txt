And I’m telling you, being stubborn like this won’t get you anywhere here.

You admit you’ve eaten and enjoyed meat. You ate it when it wasn’t really needed, but won’t eat it when it really is. What a shame! But I was determined.

Every day my friend argued with me, but I always said no. The more he argued, the stronger I said no. Every day I prayed for God to protect me, and I felt He did. I didn’t really understand God then. It was just faith—faith that started because of the kind nurse Rambha.

One day, my friend started reading Bentham’s Theory of Utility to me. I was confused. The words were too hard to understand. He explained it, but I said, “Sorry, this is too complicated for me. I know eating meat is necessary, but I can’t break my promise. I can’t argue about it. Please think of me as stubborn or silly. I know you care about me and want the best. But I’m stuck. A promise is a promise.” My friend was surprised. He closed the book and said, “Okay, I won’t argue anymore.” I was happy. He never talked about it again. But he still worried about me. He smoked and drank but never asked me to. He even told me to stay away from both. His only worry was that I might get too weak without meat and not feel comfortable living in England.

That’s how I learned for a month. My friend’s house was in Richmond, and I couldn’t go to London more than once or twice a week. So, Dr. Mehta and Sjt. Dalpatram Shukla decided I should live with a family. Sjt. Shukla found a house with an Anglo-Indian family in West Kensington and sent me there. The landlady was a widow. I told her about my promise. She said she would take good care of me, so I moved in. But I was almost starving there too. I had sent for sweets and other foods from home, but nothing had arrived yet.
