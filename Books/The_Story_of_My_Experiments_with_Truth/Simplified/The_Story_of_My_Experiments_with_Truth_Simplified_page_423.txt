They were afraid to take any risks because they didn’t want to lose their good opinion of you. But whether you officially join or not, I’m going to consider you a member anyway. I told Gokhale what I planned. I wanted to have an Ashram where I could live with my Phoenix family, even if I wasn’t officially a member. I hoped to find a place in Gujarat because I’m Gujarati, and I thought I could best help the country by helping Gujarat first. Gokhale liked the idea. He said, “You should definitely do this. No matter what happens with the other members, you can count on me to pay for the Ashram. I’ll treat it like it’s mine.” This made me really happy. It was such a relief not to worry about money or doing everything alone. I knew I could count on him whenever I needed help. It took a big weight off my mind.

So, the late Dr. Dev was called and told to open an account for me in the Society’s records. He was also told to give me whatever I needed for the Ashram and for public expenses.

I got ready to go to Shantiniketan. The night before I left, Gokhale planned a small party with some close friends. He made sure to get my favorite snacks—fruits and nuts. The party was just a few steps from his room, but he was so weak he could hardly walk. Still, he really wanted to come because he cared about me. He came, but then fainted and had to be carried away. This wasn’t the first time he fainted. When he came to, he told us to keep the party going.

The party was really just a casual chat outside the Society’s guest house, with friends talking and enjoying groundnuts, dates, and fresh seasonal fruits.

But that fainting episode was not going to be just a one-time thing in my life.
