I still feel it was a big mistake not to ask them, and I kindly suggest that this mistake could maybe be fixed if these leaders were invited to help the Government by sharing their advice at the Provincial Conferences, which I hear will happen soon.

I believe no Government can ignore these leaders because they speak for many people, even if their ideas are very different. At the same time, I’m happy to say that all parties were allowed to share their opinions freely at the Conference Committees.

As for me, I chose not to share my views at the Committee or the Conference. I thought I could help best by supporting the resolutions that were presented, and I did this without any doubt. I hope to turn these words into action as soon as the Government agrees to my offer, which I am sending in a separate letter.

I understand that in this difficult time, we must give full and honest support to the Empire, which we want to join soon as equals like the other Dominions overseas. But the truth is, our support is because we believe our goal will be reached faster this way.

Because doing our duty gives us rights, people expect that the upcoming changes will include the main ideas from the Congress-League plan. I’m sure this hope is why many members of the Conference are willing to fully cooperate with the Government.

If I could, I would ask my countrymen to take back all the Congress resolutions and not even talk about "Home Rule" or "Responsible Government" while the War is still going on.
