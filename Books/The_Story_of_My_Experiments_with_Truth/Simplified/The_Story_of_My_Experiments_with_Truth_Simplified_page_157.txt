Spending a year in Pretoria was very important for me. It gave me chances to learn about public work and helped me understand how good I was at it. During this time, my religious feelings became very strong, and I also learned a lot about how the law works. I picked up the things a junior lawyer learns from a senior one, and I started to believe I could be a good lawyer after all. I also discovered the secret to being successful as a lawyer.

Dada Abdulla’s case was a big one. The lawsuit was for £40,000. It came from business deals and had lots of tricky details about money. Part of the claim was about promissory notes, and part was about forcing someone to deliver those notes. The defense said the notes were taken by fraud and were not valid. There were many facts and legal points to figure out in this complicated case.

Both sides hired the best lawyers. This gave me a great chance to watch how they worked. I was given the job of getting the plaintiff’s case ready for the lawyer and sorting out the facts to support it. It was a lesson to see what the lawyer accepted or rejected from my work, and to watch how the main lawyer used the notes made by the attorney. I realized this kind of case preparation would test how well I understood things and how good I was at organizing evidence.

I was very interested in the case. I really threw myself into it. I read all the papers about the deals. My client was very smart and trusted me completely, which made my work easier. I also studied bookkeeping to understand the money matters better. My translation skills got better because I had to translate letters, mostly written in Gujarati.

Even though, as I said before, I cared about religion and public work and spent some time on them, they were not my main focus then.
