The Tamil boys were all born in South Africa, so they didn’t know much Tamil and couldn’t read or write it at all. I had to teach them the Tamil letters and the basics of grammar. That was pretty easy. My students knew they could talk better Tamil than me, and when Tamilians who didn’t speak English came to visit, the boys helped translate for me. I got along well with them because I never tried to hide what I didn’t know. I always showed them who I really was. Even though I didn’t know much Tamil, they still liked and respected me. It was easier to teach the Musalman boys Urdu because they already knew the letters. I just had to make them interested in reading and help them write better.

Most of these kids hadn’t gone to school or learned much. But while teaching them, I found I didn’t have to teach much except to stop them from being lazy and to watch over their studies. I was happy with this, so I could teach boys of different ages and subjects all in the same classroom.

People talk a lot about textbooks, but I never really needed many. I don’t even remember using the books we had much. I didn’t think it was necessary to give the boys lots of books. I always believed the best textbook is the teacher. I hardly remember what my teachers taught me from books, but I do remember the things they taught me without books.

Kids learn more and easier by listening than by reading. I don’t remember reading any book completely with my boys. But I told them in my own words everything I learned from the books I read. I think they still remember some of it. It was hard for them to remember what they read, but they could easily repeat what I told them. Reading was hard for them, but listening to me was fun—when I made the lessons interesting and didn’t bore them.
