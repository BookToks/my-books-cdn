Sheth Haji Muhammad Haji Dada was seen as the top leader of the Indian community in Natal in 1893. Sheth Abdulla Haji Adam was the richest among them, but he and others always let Sheth Haji Muhammad take the lead in public matters. So, a meeting was held at Abdulla Sheth’s house with Sheth Haji Muhammad in charge, and they decided to fight against the Franchise Bill.

Volunteers were signed up. Most of the volunteers were Natal-born Indians, mostly Christian young people. Mr. Paul, the Durban Court Interpreter, and Mr. Subhan Godfrey, a mission school headmaster, helped bring many Christian youths to the meeting. All of them joined as volunteers.

Many local business people also joined, including Sheths Dawud Muhammad, Muhammad Kasam Kamruddin, Adamji Miyakhan, A. Kolandavellu Pillai, C. Lachhiram, Rangasami Padiachi, and Amod Jiva. Parsi Rustomji was there too. Some clerks like Manekji, Joshi, and Narsinhram, who worked for big firms, also joined. They were happy to be part of this public work because it was a new experience for them. Because of the serious problem facing their community, all differences like rich or poor, boss or worker, religion, and language were forgotten. Everyone saw themselves as children and helpers of their homeland.

The Bill had already passed or was about to pass its second reading. People said that since Indians had not fought against the harsh Bill before, it showed they were not fit to vote.

I explained the situation to the meeting. The first thing we did was send a telegram to the Speaker of the Assembly asking him to delay the Bill’s discussion. We also sent similar telegrams to the Premier, Sir John Robinson, and another important person.
