At Jehangir Petit's house, I didn’t dare to speak in Gujarati. In that fancy place full of amazing things, I, who had lived my whole life among poor workers, felt like a total country bumpkin. Wearing my Kathiawadi cloak, turban, and dhoti, I looked a bit more polished than I do now, but the luxury of Mr. Petit's mansion made me feel totally out of place. Still, I did okay because Sir Pherozeshah was there to support me.

Then there was the Gujarati event. The Gujaratis wouldn’t let me leave without a welcome party, which was arranged by the late Uttamlal Trivedi. I had checked the program beforehand. Mr. Jinnah, who was Gujarati, was there too. I can’t remember if he was the president or the main speaker. He gave a short, nice speech in English. I think most other speeches were also in English. When it was my turn, I thanked everyone in Gujarati. I said I liked Gujarati and Hindustani better and gently complained about using English at a Gujarati event.

I was a little nervous doing this because I worried people might think it was rude for someone like me, who was new and had been away for a long time, to challenge the usual way of doing things. But no one seemed upset that I spoke in Gujarati. In fact, I was happy that everyone accepted my choice.

This meeting made me feel brave enough to believe I could share my new ideas with my fellow countrymen.

After a short time in Bombay, filled with these first experiences, I went to Poona because Gokhale had called me there.
