After thinking deeply and talking it over, I made a promise in 1906. I hadn’t told my wife about it before, but I asked her when I decided to take the vow. She didn’t mind. Still, it was really hard for me to make up my mind; I didn’t feel strong enough. How could I control my desires? Giving up a physical relationship with my wife felt very strange back then. But I started with faith in God’s power to help me.

Looking back on the twenty years since I made the vow, I feel happy and amazed. I had been trying to control myself since 1901, but the freedom and happiness I felt after taking the vow in 1906 was something new. Before that, temptation could take over me anytime. Now, the vow acted like a strong shield against temptation. Every day, I saw more clearly how powerful brahmacharya was.

I made the vow when I was in Phoenix. After finishing my ambulance work, I went there and then had to go back to Johannesburg. About a month after I returned, the idea of Satyagraha started. It was like the brahmacharya vow was getting me ready for it without me even knowing. Satyagraha wasn’t a plan I made ahead of time; it just happened naturally.

Looking back, I see that everything I did before led me to that point. I had cut down on my big household expenses in Johannesburg and gone to Phoenix to take the brahmacharya vow.

I didn’t learn that perfect brahmacharya means realizing Brahman from reading holy books. That understanding came slowly from my own experience. I only read the scriptures about it later in life.

Every day of keeping the vow brought me closer to knowing that brahmacharya protects the body, mind, and soul.

For me, brahmacharya was no longer a hard punishment; it became a comfort and a joy. Each day showed me something new and beautiful about it.

But don’t think it was always easy for me, even if it brought more and more happiness.
