The audience became completely quiet and listened to the whole speech. They clapped and shouted "shame" at the right moments. This made me very happy.

Sir Pherozeshah liked the speech too. I felt really great.

The meeting helped me get the support of Sjt. Deshpande and a Parsi friend whose name I won’t say because he is an important government official now. Both said they would go with me to South Africa. Mr. C. M.

Cursetji, who was a Small Causes Court Judge back then, convinced the Parsi friend to change his mind because he had planned to get married. He had to choose between marriage and going to South Africa, and he chose marriage. But Parsi Rustomji made up for this by supporting the cause, and many Parsi women are now making up for the lady who didn’t come by working hard for khadi (homespun cloth). So, I have forgiven that couple. Sjt. Deshpande didn’t have marriage plans, but he couldn’t come either. Now he is making up for breaking his promise. On my way back to South Africa, I met one of the Tyabjis in Zanzibar. He also promised to help but never came. Mr. Abbas Tyabji is now making up for not coming. So, none of my three tries to get barristers to go to South Africa worked.

I also remember Mr. Pestonji Padshah. I had been friends with him since I stayed in England. I first met him in a vegetarian restaurant in London. I knew about his brother, Mr. Barjorji Padshah, who was called a 'crank' (someone a bit strange). I never met him, but friends said he was weird. Because he felt sorry for horses, he wouldn’t ride trams, and he didn’t take degrees even though he had a great memory. He was independent and a vegetarian, even though he was Parsi. Pestonji didn’t have all these quirks, but he was famous in London for being very smart. The thing we had in common was vegetarianism, not his big knowledge, which I couldn’t match.

I met him again in Bombay. He was Prothonotary (a court officer) in the High Court. When I met him, he was working on a Higher Gujarati Dictionary.

There was no friend I hadn’t asked for help with my South African work.
