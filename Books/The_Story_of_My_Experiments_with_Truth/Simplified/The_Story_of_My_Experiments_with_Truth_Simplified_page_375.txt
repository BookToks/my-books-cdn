For me, I believe fasting helped me a lot both physically and morally. But I know it doesn’t mean fasting will have the same effect on everyone.

Fasting can help control strong desires only if you do it to practice self-control. Some of my friends actually felt more desire and hunger after fasting. This means fasting is useless unless you really want to control yourself. There is a famous verse from the Bhagavadgita that relates to this: When someone fasts, their senses stop focusing on outside things, but the desire stays. But when they reach a higher understanding, even the desire goes away.

So, fasting and similar practices are ways to reach self-control, but they are not everything. If you only fast physically and don’t control your mind, it will just lead to being fake and cause problems.
