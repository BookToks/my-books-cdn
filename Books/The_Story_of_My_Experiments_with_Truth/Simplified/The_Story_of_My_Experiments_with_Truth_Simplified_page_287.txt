‘LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST’?

Mr. Chamberlain came to South Africa to get a gift of 35 million pounds and to win the support of Englishmen and Boers. So, he ignored the Indian group that wanted to talk to him.

He said, "You know the Imperial Government can't control self-governing Colonies very much. Your problems seem real. I will try to help, but you must do your best to keep the Europeans happy if you want to live among them." 

This answer made the Indian group feel cold and disappointed. I was also upset. It made us realize we had to start our work all over again. I explained this to my friends.

Actually, Mr. Chamberlain’s answer wasn’t wrong. It was good that he was honest. He showed us, in a gentle way, that power was what mattered most.

But we didn’t have any power. We barely had the courage or strength even to face attacks.

Mr. Chamberlain only spent a short time in the sub-continent. The distance from Shrinagar to Cape Comorin is about 1,900 miles, and from Durban to Cape Town is about 1,100 miles. He had to travel very fast.

After Natal, he quickly went to the Transvaal. I had to prepare the case for the Indians there and give it to him. But how could I get to Pretoria? Our people there couldn’t help me get the legal papers I needed to travel on time.

The war had made the Transvaal a wild, empty place. There was no food or clothes. Shops were closed or empty, waiting to open again, but that would take time. Even refugees couldn’t come back until the shops were ready with supplies. Every person from Transvaal needed a permit to move around. Europeans got permits easily, but Indians found it very hard.

During the war, many officers and soldiers came to South Africa from India and Ceylon. The British authorities were supposed to take care of those who chose to live there.
