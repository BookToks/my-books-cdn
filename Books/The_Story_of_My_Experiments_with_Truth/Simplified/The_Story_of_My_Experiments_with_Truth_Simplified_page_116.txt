If I had asked to join the caste, or tried to split it into smaller groups, or made the caste members angry, they would have fought back. Instead of avoiding trouble, I would have walked right into a big mess when I came back from England, and maybe even had to pretend things were okay when they weren’t.

My relationship with my wife still wasn’t how I wanted it. Even living in England didn’t stop me from feeling jealous. I kept worrying and doubting about small things, so none of my hopes came true. I wanted my wife to learn to read and write, and I planned to help her study, but my selfish desires got in the way, and she suffered because of it. One time, I even sent her back to her father’s house and only agreed to take her back after making her very unhappy. Later, I realized that was really foolish of me.

I wanted to change how children were taught. My brother had kids, and my own child, who I left at home when I went to England, was almost four years old now. I wanted to teach these kids exercise to make them strong, and also guide them myself.

My brother helped me with this, and I did okay. I really enjoyed being around children. Playing and joking with them became something I still love today. I’ve always thought I’d be a good teacher for kids.

We also needed to change the food we ate. Tea and coffee were already in the house. My brother had prepared some English-style things for me to feel at home, like special dishes that were usually only for special days, but now we used them all the time. My changes finished the job. I started making oatmeal porridge, and wanted cocoa to replace tea and coffee. But really, cocoa was just an extra, not a replacement. We already had boots and shoes, and I added European-style clothes to complete the change.

All this made us spend more money. New things kept being added every day. It felt like we had a big, expensive problem we couldn’t get rid of. But where was the money going to come from?
