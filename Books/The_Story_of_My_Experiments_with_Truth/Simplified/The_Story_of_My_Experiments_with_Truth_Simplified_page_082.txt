So, I did it. It was hard because I found out that even in vegetarian restaurants, many dishes had eggs in them.

This meant I had to ask a lot of questions to figure out if a dish had eggs or not, especially with puddings and cakes. Even though this made things tricky, it also made my food choices simpler. But that was annoying too because I had to stop eating some of my favorite dishes. These problems didn’t last long, though, because sticking to my promise made my food feel healthier and better in the long run.

The real challenge was still coming with another promise I made. But who would hurt someone God protects?

It’s important to understand how people interpret promises. All over the world, people argue about what promises really mean. No matter how clear a promise is, people twist it to fit what they want. This happens to everyone—rich or poor, powerful or not. Selfishness makes people blind, and they use unclear parts of promises to lie to themselves and others, even to God.

There are two good rules for understanding promises. One is to accept how the person who made the promise explains it. The other is to believe the weaker person if there are two ways to understand it. Ignoring these rules causes fights and unfairness, which come from lying. Someone who only wants the truth will follow these rules easily and won’t need help to understand the promise. For me, my mother’s way of understanding “meat” was the true one, not what I might have learned from others or from my pride.

When I was in England, I tried out my ideas about saving money and being clean. I didn’t think much about religion then. Later, in South Africa, I did serious experiments about religion, which I will tell you about later. But the idea started in England.

A new believer is usually more excited about their religion than someone born into it.
