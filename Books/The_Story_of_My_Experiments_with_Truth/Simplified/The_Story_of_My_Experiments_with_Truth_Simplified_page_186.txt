Charging a family of four—husband, wife, and two kids—a yearly tax of £12 was terrible, especially when the husband only earned about 14 shillings a month. This kind of tax was unfair and didn’t happen anywhere else in the world.

We started a strong protest against this tax. If the Natal Indian Congress had stayed quiet, the Viceroy might have even allowed a tax as high as £25. The tax was lowered from £25 to £3 mainly because of our protests. But maybe I’m wrong. It’s possible the Indian Government didn’t like the £25 tax from the start and lowered it to £3 anyway, no matter what the Congress said. Still, it was a betrayal by the Indian Government. The Viceroy, who was supposed to look after India’s people, should never have approved such a cruel tax.

The Congress didn’t feel proud just because the tax went down from £25 to £3. We were still sad that we hadn’t fully protected the indentured Indians. We were determined to get the tax completely removed, but it took twenty years to make that happen. When it finally did, it was thanks to the hard work of not just the Natal Indians but all Indians in South Africa. The broken promise to Mr. Gokhale led to the final fight, where many indentured Indians played a big part—some even died from gunfire, and over ten thousand were jailed.

But in the end, the truth won. The pain the Indians went through showed how real and strong the truth was. Still, we wouldn’t have won without strong belief, patience, and constant hard work. If the community had given up, if the Congress had stopped fighting and accepted the tax as something they couldn’t change, the hated tax would still be charged on the indentured Indians today. That would have been a shame for Indians in South Africa and all of India.
