Finally, I was in London. I didn’t feel sick on the ship at all. But as days went by, I started feeling nervous. I was shy even to talk to the steward. I wasn’t used to speaking English, and except for Sjt. Mazmudar, all the other passengers in the second saloon were English. I couldn’t talk to them because I often didn’t understand what they said. Even when I did, I couldn’t reply quickly. I had to think about every sentence before I said it.

I didn’t know how to use knives and forks and was too shy to ask which dishes didn’t have meat. So, I never ate at the table. Instead, I ate in my cabin, mostly sweets and fruits I had brought with me. Sjt. Mazmudar had no problem. He mixed with everyone and moved around on deck freely. I stayed hidden in my cabin all day and only went on deck when few people were there. Sjt. Mazmudar kept telling me to talk to the passengers and not be shy. He said lawyers should be good at talking and shared his own experiences. He told me to practice speaking English and not worry about mistakes, which are normal when learning a new language. But I couldn’t get over my shyness.

One English passenger was kind to me and started talking to me. He was older. He asked what I ate, who I was, where I was going, and why I was shy. He also told me to come eat at the table. He laughed when I said I didn’t eat meat and said in a friendly way, "It’s okay for now, but in the Bay of Biscay, you’ll have to change your mind. And England is so cold you can’t live there without eating meat." 

I said, "But I heard some people live there without eating meat."

He said, "That’s not true. As far as I know, no one lives there without eating meat. And don’t worry, I’m not asking you to drink alcohol, even though I do."
