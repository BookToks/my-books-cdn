I passed the matriculation exam in 1887. Back then, the exam was held in two places: Ahmedabad and Bombay. Most students from Kathiawad chose Ahmedabad because it was closer and cheaper. My family was poor, so I chose Ahmedabad too. This was my first trip from Rajkot to Ahmedabad, and I went alone.

My family wanted me to go to college after passing the exam. There was a college in Bhavnagar and another in Bombay. Bhavnagar was cheaper, so I decided to join Samaldas College there. But I felt lost. Everything was hard. I couldn’t understand the professors’ lectures or enjoy them. The professors were very good, but I was just not ready. After the first term, I went back home.

We had an old family friend named Mavji Dave. He was smart and knowledgeable, and he still stayed in touch with us after my father died. He visited us during my vacation. While talking to my mother and brother, he asked about my studies.

When he heard I was at Samaldas College, he said, “Times have changed. None of you will get your father’s position without a proper education. Since this boy is still studying, you should count on him to keep the family’s place. It will take him four or five years to get a B.A. degree, which might only get him a sixty-rupee job, not a top position like Diwan. If he studies law like my son, it will take even longer, and many others will want the same job. I think you should send him to England. My son Kevalram says it’s easy to become a barrister there. He can come back in three years. It won’t cost more than four or five thousand rupees. Think about the barrister who just returned from England. He lives very well and can get the Diwan’s job easily. I strongly suggest you send Mohandas to England this very year.”

Kevalram has many friends in England.
