Fasting doesn’t help people control their cravings or desires by itself. Fasting only works when the mind agrees with the hungry body, meaning the mind stops wanting the things the body is missing. Our mind is the source of all desires. So, fasting has its limits because even a person who fasts can still be controlled by their feelings.

But usually, getting rid of strong desires, especially sexual ones, is very hard without fasting. Fasting is really important for keeping brahmacharya, which means self-control.

Many people who try to practice brahmacharya fail because they want to enjoy other senses like people who don’t follow it. Their effort is like trying to feel cold in hot summer—it just doesn’t work. There should be a clear difference between the life of someone who follows brahmacharya and someone who doesn’t.

They might look similar, but the difference should be very clear. Both use their eyes, but a brahmachari uses them to see the beauty of God, while others look at silly things. Both use their ears, but the brahmachari listens to prayers, while others listen to bad or funny talk. Both might stay up late, but one prays and the other wastes time partying. Both eat, but one eats just enough to keep their body pure, while the other overeats and makes their body unhealthy.

So, they live very different lives, and as time goes on, the difference between them will only get bigger.

Brahmacharya means controlling your senses in what you think, say, and do. Every day, I understand more how important it is to control yourself like this. There is no limit to how much you can give up, just like there’s no limit to what brahmacharya can help you achieve. But reaching perfect brahmacharya needs a lot of effort.

For many people, it will only be a goal they try to reach. Someone who wants brahmacharya will always notice their own faults, look for the desires still inside their heart, and work hard to get rid of them. Until your thoughts are fully controlled by your will, you don’t have complete brahmacharya.
