This officer, even though he was Indian, was even more arrogant than the sahib. He was smart, but the ryots didn’t seem any better off because of him. I managed to get a few more powers for the Rana, but hardly any help for the Mers. It seemed like their problems weren’t even looked at properly.

So, I felt pretty disappointed with this mission. I thought my clients didn’t get the justice they deserved, but I didn’t have the power to make it happen. At best, I could have asked the Political Agent or the Governor for help, but they would have just said, "We won’t get involved." If there were clear rules for decisions like this, it might have helped, but here, the sahib’s wishes were the only law.

I was really frustrated.

Meanwhile, a Meman firm from Porbandar wrote to my brother with an offer: We have business in South Africa. Our firm is big, and we have a big case in court there, with a claim of £40,000. It’s been going on for a long time. We hired the best lawyers. If you sent your brother there, he could help us and also learn a lot. He could guide our lawyers better than we can. Plus, he would get to see a new place and meet new people.

My brother talked to me about the offer. I wasn’t sure if I just had to guide the lawyers or actually appear in court. But it sounded interesting.

My brother introduced me to the late Sheth Abdul Karim Jhaveri, a partner at Dada Abdulla & Co., the firm offering the job. "It won’t be a hard job," the Sheth told me. "We have important European friends you’ll meet. You can help us in our shop, especially with English letters. You’ll be our guest, so you won’t have to pay anything."  
“How long do you need me for?” I asked.
