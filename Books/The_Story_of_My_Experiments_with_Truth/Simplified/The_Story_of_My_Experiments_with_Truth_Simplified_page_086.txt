But why can’t you have vegetarian food in a non-vegetarian restaurant too? I made a deal with the manager of the Holborn Restaurant to serve a completely vegetarian meal. The vegetarians were really happy about this new idea.

Dinners are supposed to be fun, but in the West, they’ve turned them into a kind of art. They celebrate with music and speeches. The small dinner party I gave also had some of these things. So, there had to be speeches.

When it was my turn, I stood up to speak. I had planned a very short speech, but I couldn’t get past the first sentence. I had read about Addison, who started his first speech by saying “I conceive” three times and then stopped. Someone joked that he thought a lot but said nothing. I wanted to make a funny speech using this story, but I got stuck. My memory failed me, and trying to be funny made me look silly. So, I just said, “Thank you all for coming,” and sat down.

I only got over this shyness when I was in South Africa, but even then, I never completely lost it. I couldn’t speak without preparation. I hesitated in front of new people and tried to avoid making speeches whenever I could. Even now, I don’t think I could talk for a long time just to keep friends entertained.

I have to say, my shyness has not really been a problem. In fact, it helped me a lot. What used to annoy me—being slow to speak—is now something I like. It taught me to use words carefully. I got used to holding back my thoughts. Now, I can say that I almost never say or write anything without thinking first. I don’t remember ever regretting what I said or wrote. This has saved me from many problems and wasting time.
