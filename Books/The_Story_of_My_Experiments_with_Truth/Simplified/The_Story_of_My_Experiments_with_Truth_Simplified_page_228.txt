After managing many public institutions for a long time, I strongly believe it’s not a good idea to run them using permanent funds. Permanent funds can cause the institution to lose its sense of right and wrong. A public institution is one that is run with the approval and money of the public. If the public stops supporting it, the institution should stop existing. 

Institutions with permanent funds often ignore what the public thinks, and sometimes they do things the public doesn’t agree with. In our country, this happens a lot. Some religious trusts don’t even give reports anymore. The trustees act like they own everything and answer to no one. I believe the best way for public institutions to survive is to live day by day, like nature. If an institution can’t get public support, it shouldn’t exist. The money it gets each year shows how popular and honest it is. I think every institution should be tested this way.

But don’t get me wrong. I’m not talking about places that need permanent buildings to run. What I mean is that regular expenses should be covered by yearly donations that people give freely.

I saw these ideas work during the Satyagraha in South Africa.

That amazing six-year campaign didn’t have permanent funds, even though it needed a lot of money. I remember times when I didn’t know what would happen if no donations came in the next day. But I won’t get ahead of myself. You will see this idea clearly in the story that follows.
