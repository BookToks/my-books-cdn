I have thought deeply about myself, looked closely at my feelings and thoughts, and studied every situation carefully. But I don’t say my conclusions are perfect or final. There is one thing I do believe for sure.

To me, my ideas seem completely right and for now, I think they are final. If they weren’t, I wouldn’t act on them. At every step, I have checked whether to accept or reject them and then acted based on that.

As long as my actions make sense to both my mind and heart, I must stick to what I originally believed.

If I only had to talk about ideas, I wouldn’t write about my life. But since I want to share how I used these ideas in real life, I called the chapters The Story of My Experiments with Truth. These will include my tries with non-violence, celibacy, and other ways of living that some say are different from truth. But for me, truth is the most important idea, and it includes many other ideas.

This truth means being honest not just in words but also in thoughts. It’s not only the truth we understand now but the Absolute Truth, the Eternal Principle, which is God. There are many ways to describe God because God shows up in many forms. This amazes me and sometimes surprises me. But I worship God as Truth only.

I haven’t found God yet, but I am searching. I’m ready to give up the things I love most to find Him. Even if I have to give my life, I hope I’m ready for that. Until I reach this Absolute Truth, I must hold on to the truth as I understand it now.

This truth is like my guide and protector. The path is narrow and sharp like a razor’s edge, but for me, it has been the fastest and easiest way. Even my biggest mistakes have seemed small because I stayed on this path. The path has saved me from trouble, and I have moved forward following my own understanding.

Sometimes, I have had small glimpses of the Absolute Truth, God, and every day I feel stronger that He alone is real and everything else is not.
