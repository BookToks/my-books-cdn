Uncontrolled thoughts happen in the mind, and stopping these thoughts means controlling the mind, which is even harder than controlling the wind. But having God inside makes it possible to control the mind. Nobody should think it’s impossible just because it’s hard. It’s the biggest goal, so it makes sense that it takes the biggest effort to reach it.

When I came to India, I realized that controlling myself like this couldn’t be done by just trying hard. Before that, I mistakenly thought that eating only fruit would help me get rid of all my desires, and I believed I didn’t have to do anything else.

But I won’t get ahead of myself by talking about my struggles now. For now, I want to say that people who want to control themselves to find God shouldn’t give up, as long as they believe in God as much as they believe in their own efforts.

The senses turn away from a self-controlled person who doesn’t eat much, but the pleasure still stays for a while. That pleasure disappears only when they realize the highest truth. So, the name of God and His kindness are the last hope for anyone trying to reach freedom. I understood this only after I came back to India.
