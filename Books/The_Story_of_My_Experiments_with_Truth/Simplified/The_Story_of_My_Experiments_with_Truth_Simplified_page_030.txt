How could the wedding date be changed? But I forgot about my sadness over my dad’s injuries because I was caught up in the fun of the wedding.

I loved my parents a lot. But I also cared about the feelings and desires that come with being human. I didn’t yet understand that sometimes you have to give up happiness and fun to fully serve your parents. Still, as if to punish me for wanting pleasure, something happened that has bothered me ever since. I will tell you about it later. Nishkulanand sings: “Giving up things without giving up desires doesn’t last long, no matter how hard you try.” Whenever I hear that song, this painful memory comes back and makes me feel ashamed.

My dad acted strong even with his injuries and took part in the whole wedding. Even now, I can picture exactly where he sat during the ceremony. Back then, I never thought I would one day criticize him for marrying me off as a child. Everything seemed right and good to me on that day. I was excited to get married. I trusted everything my dad did and remember it clearly. I can still see us sitting on the wedding platform, doing the Saptapadi (seven steps), feeding each other the sweet Kansar, and starting our life together.

And oh, that first night. Two innocent kids, not knowing much, jumped into the big adventure of life. My brother’s wife had prepared me about how to act that night. I don’t know if my wife got any advice, and I never asked her. We were both too nervous and shy to really face each other. How could I even start a conversation? The advice didn’t help much. But honestly, no coaching is really needed because deep down, past life feelings take over and make all advice unnecessary. Slowly, we got to know each other and started talking openly.
