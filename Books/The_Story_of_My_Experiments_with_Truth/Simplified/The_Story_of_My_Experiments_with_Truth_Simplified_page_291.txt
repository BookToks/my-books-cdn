In South Africa, the Europeans were settlers. They had become South African citizens and controlled the government officers. But then, leaders from Asia came, and the Indians got stuck in a tough situation.

I got a good example of this control. I was called to see the head of the department, an officer from Ceylon. When I say I was 'called,' I mean no written order was sent. Indian leaders often had to visit these Asian officers. One of them was the late Sheth Tyeb Haji Khanmahomed. The chief asked him who I was and why I came. "He is our adviser," Tyeb Sheth said, "and he came because we asked him." The officer replied, "Then why are we here? Aren’t we supposed to protect you? What does Gandhi know about things here?"

Tyeb Sheth tried to explain, "You are here to help. But Gandhi is our man. He knows our language and understands us. You are just officials." The officer told Tyeb Sheth to bring me in. I went in with Tyeb Sheth and others. We were not given seats and had to stand.

The officer asked me, "Why are you here?"

I said, "I came because my people asked me to give them advice."

He said, "Don’t you know you have no right to be here? Your permit was a mistake. You are not a settled Indian. You must leave. You can’t meet Mr. Chamberlain. The Asiatic Department was made to protect Indians here. Now, you may go." Then he said goodbye and didn’t let me answer.

But he kept my friends there.
