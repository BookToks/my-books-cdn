I once spoke at a meeting led by Dr. Mullick about the work of the Indian Ambulance Corps in the Boer War. Knowing The Englishman newspaper helped me a lot that day.

Mr. Saunders was sick then, but he still helped me a lot, just like he did in 1896. Gokhale liked my speech and was happy when Dr. Ray praised it.

Living with Gokhale made my work in Calcutta much easier. It also helped me meet important Bengali families and started my close connection with Bengal.

I have many memories from that month, but I will skip most of them. I will just mention my quick visit to Burma and the foongis there. I was sad to see how lazy they were. I saw the golden pagoda but didn’t like the many little candles burning in the temple. The rats running around reminded me of a story Swami Dayanand told about Morvi. The Burmese women were lively and free, which I liked, but the men were lazy, which upset me. I also noticed that just like Bombay is not all of India, Rangoon is not all of Burma. And just like in India we’ve become middlemen for English merchants, the same thing happens in Burma with the Burmese people.

When I came back from Burma, I said goodbye to Gokhale. It was hard to leave, but my work in Bengal, especially Calcutta, was done, so I didn’t need to stay.

Before settling down, I thought about traveling around India in third class trains to understand how hard it was for those passengers. I told Gokhale about this. At first, he laughed at the idea, but when I explained why I wanted to do it, he happily agreed. I planned to go first to Benares to visit Mrs. Besant, who was sick.

I needed new stuff for my third-class trip. Gokhale gave me a metal lunchbox and had it filled with sweet balls and puris. I bought a canvas bag for twelve annas and a long wool coat.
