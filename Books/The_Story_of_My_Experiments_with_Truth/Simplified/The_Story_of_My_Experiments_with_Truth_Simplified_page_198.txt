They were dark, dirty, and full of worms. The changes we suggested were simple, like using buckets for poop instead of letting it fall on the ground. We also said urine should be collected in buckets, not soaked into the soil. We wanted to remove the walls between the outer walls and the toilets so the toilets could get more light and air, and the cleaners could do a better job. But the rich people didn’t like this idea and mostly didn’t agree to it.

The committee had to check the untouchables’ area too. Only one person was willing to come with me. The others thought it was crazy to visit that place, especially to look at their toilets. But for me, it was a nice surprise. It was my first time visiting a place like that. The men and women there were shocked to see us. I asked if we could check their toilets.

“Toilets for us!” they said, surprised. “We go outside to do our business. Toilets are for you rich people.” I asked, “Then you don’t mind if we look inside your homes?”

“You’re welcome, sir. You can see every part of our homes. They aren’t really houses, more like holes.” I went inside and was happy to see the insides were as clean as the outsides. The doorways were swept, the floors were nicely covered with cow dung, and the few pots and pans were clean and shiny. There was no risk of disease there.

In the rich people’s area, we found a toilet that I have to describe. Every room had a gutter used for both water and urine, so the whole house smelled bad. One house had a bedroom upstairs with a gutter that was used as both a pee spot and a toilet. The gutter had a pipe going down to the ground floor. The smell in this room was unbearable. I can’t imagine how the person living there could sleep in that room.

The committee also visited the Vaishnava Haveli.
