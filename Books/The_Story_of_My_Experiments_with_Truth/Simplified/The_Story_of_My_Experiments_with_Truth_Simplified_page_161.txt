RELIGIOUS FERMENT It’s time to talk again about my experiences with my Christian friends.

Mr. Baker was worried about what would happen to me in the future. He took me to the Wellington Convention. Protestant Christians hold these meetings every few years to learn more about their faith and to refresh their spirits. You could call it a religious revival. The Wellington Convention was one of these meetings. The leader was a well-known preacher named Rev. Andrew Murray. Mr. Baker hoped that being around so many excited and serious Christians would make me want to become a Christian too.

But what he really believed in was the power of prayer. He trusted prayer deeply.

He was sure that God would listen to prayers that were said with true feeling. He told me stories about people like George Muller from Bristol, who relied only on prayer for even basic needs. I listened carefully to what he said about prayer and told him that I would become a Christian if I truly felt called to do so. I wasn’t worried about saying this because I had already learned to listen to my inner feelings. I enjoyed following them. It would be hard and painful for me to go against what I felt inside.

So, we went to Wellington. Mr. Baker had a hard time traveling with me because I was a ‘coloured man.’ He faced many problems because of me. We had to stop our trip for a day since it was Sunday, and Mr. Baker and his group did not travel on Sundays. The hotel manager at the station finally agreed to let me stay after a lot of arguing, but he didn’t allow me to eat in the dining room. Mr. Baker didn’t give up easily. He defended the rights of hotel guests. But I could see how difficult it was for him. At Wellington, I stayed with Mr. Baker too. Even though he tried to hide the small troubles he faced, I could still notice them.

This Convention was a gathering of very devoted Christians.
