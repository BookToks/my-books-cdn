FIRST DAY IN PRETORIA

I thought someone from Dada Abdulla's lawyer’s office would meet me at Pretoria station. I knew no Indian would be there because I promised not to stay at an Indian’s house. But no one came to meet me. Later, I understood it was Sunday, so the lawyer couldn’t send anyone without trouble. I felt confused and didn’t know where to go. I was scared no hotel would accept me.

Pretoria station in 1893 was very different from how it looked in 1914. The lights were dim, and there were only a few travelers. I waited for the ticket collector to be free, then planned to give him my ticket and ask if he knew any small hotel or place where I could stay. If not, I would spend the night at the station. I was nervous to ask because I was afraid of being treated badly.

When the station was empty, I gave my ticket to the ticket collector and asked him. He was polite but couldn’t help much. Then an American Black man nearby joined the conversation.

“I see you’re new here and don’t have any friends,” he said. “If you come with me, I’ll take you to a small hotel. The owner is an American I know well. I think he will let you stay.” I wasn’t sure about his offer but thanked him and said yes. He took me to Johnston’s Family Hotel. He talked to Mr. Johnston, who agreed to let me stay for the night if I ate dinner in my room.

“I don’t have any color bias,” said Mr. Johnston. “But I only have European guests, and if you eat in the dining room, they might get upset and leave.” 

“Thank you,” I said, “for letting me stay even for one night.”
