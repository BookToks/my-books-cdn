What good would it do in court to offer my partial, one-sided evidence about some events in my life? If someone nosy questioned me about the parts I've already written, they might actually know more about them.

So, even though my house was full when the Boer War started, I still welcomed two Englishmen who came from Johannesburg. Both were theosophists, one of them named Mr.
