Iâ€™m going to tell you my story about how I learned to live honestly and peacefully. I tried many things in my life to find the truth and be a better person.

Sometimes, it was hard, and I made mistakes. But I kept trying because I believed it was important to be truthful and kind.

I hope my experiences can help others who want to live in a way that feels right and fair.
