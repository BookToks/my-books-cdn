The doctor was a good man and a personal friend. He and his wife had helped me a lot, but I didn’t agree with his medical rules.

"Doctor, tell me what you plan to do now. I would never let my wife have meat or beef, even if it meant she might die, unless she wanted it herself."  
"You can believe what you want. But if you keep your wife under my care, I must be able to give her whatever I think is best. If you don’t like that, I’m sorry, but you have to take her away. I can’t watch her die here."  
"Are you saying I have to take her away right now?"  
"When did I say that? I just want to be free to do my job. If you take her away, my wife and I will do everything we can for her, and you won’t have to worry. But if you don’t understand, I will have to ask you to remove her."  

I think one of my sons was with me. He agreed with me and said his mother shouldn’t be given beef tea. Then I talked to Kasturbai herself. She was very weak and couldn’t really decide, but I felt I had to ask. I told her what had been said between the doctor and me. She answered firmly, "I will not take beef tea. It’s rare to be born human, and I’d rather die in your arms than pollute my body with things like that."  

I begged her. I told her she didn’t have to listen to me. I gave examples of Hindu friends who didn’t mind taking meat or wine as medicine. But she was strong in her decision. "No," she said, "please take me away now."  

I was happy. Even though I was nervous, I decided to take her away. I told the doctor what she said. He shouted angrily, "You are so heartless! You shouldn’t have talked to her about this when she’s so weak."
