THE FIRST SHOCK

Feeling disappointed, I left Bombay and went to Rajkot, where I started my own office.

I did okay there. Writing legal papers brought me about Rs 300 every month. I didn’t get this work because of my skills, but because of influence. My brother’s partner already had many clients. All the important cases were sent to big lawyers. I only got the simpler cases for poor clients.

I have to admit, I had to break my rule about not paying commissions. In Bombay, I never gave commissions. But here, I was told the situation was different. In Bombay, commissions were paid to touts, but here they were paid to vakils (lawyers) who gave you cases. Everyone paid a part of their fees as commission. My brother explained it to me, and I couldn’t argue back. He said, “Since I’m partners with another vakil, I want to give you all the cases we can. But if you don’t pay my partner a commission, it will cause problems for me. Our fees come to the same place, so I get a share. But if my partner gives cases to others, he gets his commission too.” I believed him and thought I had no choice if I wanted to work as a barrister. That’s how I convinced myself. Still, I don’t remember ever paying commissions for any other cases.

Even though I started to make enough money to get by, I had the biggest shock of my life around this time. I had heard stories about British officers but had never met one face to face.

My brother used to be secretary and adviser to the late Ranasaheb of Porbandar before he took his position. At this time, my brother was being accused of giving bad advice while in that job.
