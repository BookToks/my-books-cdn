LOCATION IN FLAMES

Even though my co-workers and I were no longer responsible for the patients, there were still many problems caused by the black plague that needed to be handled.

I mentioned before that the Municipality ignored the location, but it was very careful about the health of its white citizens. It spent a lot of money to keep them healthy and was now spending even more to get rid of the plague. Even though the Municipality had made many mistakes and treated the Indians unfairly, I had to admit it cared a lot about the white people’s health. I helped as much as I could because of its good intentions. I think if I hadn’t helped, things would have been harder, and the Municipality might have used soldiers to force people.

But luckily, that didn’t happen. The Municipal authorities were happy with how the Indians behaved, and this made the future work easier. I used all my influence to convince the Indians to follow the Municipality’s rules. It was hard for them, but I don’t remember anyone refusing to listen to me.

The location was heavily guarded so no one could get in or out without permission. My co-workers and I had special passes to come and go. The plan was for everyone living there to move out and live in tents for three weeks on an open plain about thirteen miles from Johannesburg. After that, they would burn the location down. Moving and setting up tents with food and other supplies took time, so guards were needed during this period.

The people were very scared, but my constant presence helped calm them. Many poor people hid their small savings underground because they had no bank or safe place to keep money. This money had to be dug up.
