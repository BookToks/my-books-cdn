They were truly devoted and didn’t just worship the stone itself, but the meaning behind it. I felt that by worshipping this way, they weren’t taking away from God’s greatness, but actually making it even greater.

I need to say something about the Eiffel Tower. I’m not sure what it’s used for today. Back then, people both liked and disliked it a lot. I remember Tolstoy was the main person who didn’t like it. He said the Eiffel Tower showed how foolish people could be, not how smart. He compared tobacco to the worst drug because it made people want to do bad things that drunk people wouldn’t even try. Drinking made people crazy, but tobacco made them lose their clear thinking and dream of impossible things. Tolstoy said the Eiffel Tower was built by someone under that kind of influence.

The Eiffel Tower isn’t really art. It didn’t make the Exhibition more beautiful. People went to see it and climb it because it was new and really big. It was like a toy at the Exhibition. When we’re kids, we like toys, and the Tower showed that even grown-ups are like kids when they like shiny things. Maybe that’s what the Eiffel Tower was really for.
