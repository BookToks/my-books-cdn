Some groups in our society do very important jobs, but Hindus have unfairly treated them as "untouchables." These people are forced to live in far-off parts of a town or village called dhedvado in Gujarati, and this name has a bad reputation. A long time ago in Christian Europe, Jews were also treated as untouchables and made to live in places called "ghettoes," which was a mean name. Today, we Indians in South Africa are treated like untouchables too. We don’t know yet if the efforts of Andrews and Sastri will help us live better.

The ancient Jews believed they were God’s chosen people and looked down on others. Because of this, their descendants faced unfair punishment. Similarly, Hindus have thought of themselves as Aryas, or civilized people, and treated some of their own people as untouchables or Anaryas. Because of this attitude, Hindus in South Africa—and even Muslims and Parsis who come from the same country and share the same skin color—are also facing unfair treatment.

By now, you might understand what I mean by "locations" in this chapter. In South Africa, we are called "coolies," which is a bad word there. In India, "coolie" just means a porter or worker, but in South Africa, it is an insult like calling someone a pariah or untouchable. The places where "coolies" live are called "coolie locations." Johannesburg had one such area, and unlike other places where Indians rented homes, here Indians had 99-year leases on their plots. Many people lived very close together, but the location never got bigger even though the population grew.

The city only bothered to clean the toilets in a careless way. It didn’t provide proper bathrooms, good roads, or streetlights. It was unlikely the city would care about keeping the place clean or safe because it didn’t care about the people living there.
