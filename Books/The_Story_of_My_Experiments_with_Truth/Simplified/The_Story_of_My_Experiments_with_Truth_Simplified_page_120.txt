The ad said the job paid Rs 75. It was from a well-known high school. I applied and got called for an interview. I went there feeling happy, but when the principal saw I wasn’t a graduate, he sadly said no.

I told him, “I passed the London Matriculation with Latin as my second language.” He said, “That’s true, but we want a graduate.” There was nothing I could do. I felt really upset. My brother was worried too. We decided it was useless to stay in Bombay. I should move to Rajkot where my brother, who was a small-time lawyer, could give me work drafting papers and documents. Also, since our family was already in Rajkot, moving back would save money. I liked the idea. So, after six months in Bombay, I closed my little place there.

While in Bombay, I went to the High Court every day, but I didn’t learn much. I didn’t know enough to understand the cases. Sometimes I couldn’t follow and would fall asleep. Other people did the same, so I didn’t feel as embarrassed. After a while, I stopped feeling bad and thought maybe dozing off in the High Court was normal.

If today’s young lawyers in Bombay don’t have work like I didn’t, I’d give them some simple advice about life. Even though I lived in Girgaum, I hardly ever took a carriage or tram. I made it a rule to walk to the High Court. It took me about forty-five minutes. Of course, I always walked back home too. I got used to walking in the hot sun.

This walk saved me quite a bit of money. When many of my friends in Bombay got sick, I don’t remember ever being ill. Even after I started earning money, I kept walking to and from work. I still enjoy the benefits of that habit today.
