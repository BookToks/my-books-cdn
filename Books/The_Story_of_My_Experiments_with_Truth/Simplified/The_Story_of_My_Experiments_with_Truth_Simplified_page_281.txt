The good doctor understood my problem and agreed to my request. Even though Manilal couldn't decide, I told him what the doctor and I had talked about and asked for his opinion.

"Try your hydropathic treatment," he said. "I won’t eat eggs or chicken broth." This made me happy, but I knew that if I had given him those things, he would have eaten them.

I knew about Kuhne’s treatment and had tried it before. I also knew that fasting could help. So, I started giving Manilal hip baths like Kuhne said, only for three minutes each time, and gave him orange juice mixed with water for three days.

But his fever stayed high, going up to 104 degrees. At night, he would be confused and act strangely. I started to worry. What would people think of me? What would my older brother say? Should we call another doctor? Why not get an Ayurvedic doctor? Why were his parents making him follow their strange ideas?

These thoughts kept bothering me. Then I thought the opposite. God would be happy to see that I was treating my son the same way I would treat myself. I believed in hydropathy and didn’t trust regular medicine much.

Doctors couldn’t promise he’d get better. They could only try things. Life was in God’s hands. Why not trust Him and keep doing what I thought was right?

My mind was torn between these ideas. It was night, and I was lying next to Manilal in his bed. I decided to wrap him in a wet sheet. I got up, wet a sheet, squeezed out the water, wrapped it around him, leaving only his head out, and covered him with two blankets. I put a wet towel on his head. His whole body felt like hot iron and was very dry. He wasn’t sweating at all.

I was very tired.
