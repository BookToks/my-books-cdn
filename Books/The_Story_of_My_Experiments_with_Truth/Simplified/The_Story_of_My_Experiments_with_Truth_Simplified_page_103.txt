THE GREAT EXHIBITION

There was a big Exhibition in Paris in 1890. I had read about how much work was going into getting ready for it, and I really wanted to see Paris too. So, I decided to do both at the same time and go there then. One special thing at the Exhibition was the Eiffel Tower. It was made all of iron and was almost 1,000 feet tall. There were lots of other interesting things too, but the Tower was the main attraction because people had thought before that a building that tall couldn’t stand safely.

I heard about a vegetarian restaurant in Paris. I rented a room there and stayed for seven days. I planned everything carefully to save money, both the trip to Paris and the sightseeing. I mostly walked around using a map of Paris and a map and guide to the Exhibition. These helped me find the main streets and important places to see.

I don’t remember much about the Exhibition except that it was huge and had many different things. I do remember the Eiffel Tower because I went up it two or three times. There was a restaurant on the first platform, and just to say I had eaten lunch very high up, I spent seven shillings there.

The old churches in Paris are still clear in my mind. Their size and peaceful feeling are unforgettable. The amazing building of Notre Dame and the detailed decorations inside with beautiful sculptures can’t be forgotten. I felt that the people who spent millions on these holy churches must really have loved God.

I had read a lot about the fashion and fun side of Paris. You could see this everywhere on the streets, but the churches were very different from all that. When someone went inside a church, they would forget the noise and busy streets outside. People’s behavior would change, and they would act respectfully when they saw someone praying to the image of the Virgin Mary.

Since then, I have felt more and more that all this kneeling and praying is not just silly superstition. The people who prayed before the Virgin were not just worshipping a piece of stone.
