I want you to remember that in these chapters, I’m talking about things that weren’t really mentioned before in the story of Satyagraha in South Africa. If you keep that in mind, it will be easier to understand how these chapters connect.

As the Farm got bigger, we needed to figure out how to teach the boys and girls living there. They were from different backgrounds — Hindu, Muslim, Parsi, and Christian boys, plus some Hindu girls. We couldn’t hire special teachers for them. There weren’t many qualified Indian teachers around, and even if there were, no one wanted to travel 21 miles from Johannesburg for a small salary.

Also, we didn’t have much money to spend. I didn’t think it was necessary to bring teachers from outside the Farm. I didn’t believe in the usual way schools worked, and I wanted to try and find a better way through experience. The only thing I was sure about was that real education should come from the parents as much as possible, with little outside help. Tolstoy Farm was like a family, and I saw myself as the father who should take responsibility for teaching the young people.

I know this idea wasn’t perfect. The kids hadn’t all grown up with me, they came from different backgrounds, and they didn’t all follow the same religion.

So how could I really do my best for all of them, even if I acted like their father?

But I always thought that building good character—the culture of the heart—was the most important thing. I believed that moral training could be given to everyone, no matter their age or background. That’s why I decided to live with them all day and night as their father. I saw building character as the foundation of their education. If that foundation was strong, I was sure the kids could learn everything else on their own or with help from friends.
