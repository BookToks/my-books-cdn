SANITARY REFORM AND FAMINE RELIEF

I have never been able to accept when any part of society is left out or ignored. I don’t like to hide problems or ask for rights without fixing the community’s faults first. So, since I moved to Natal, I have been trying to clear up a complaint that was partly true. People often said that Indians were messy and didn’t keep their homes and surroundings clean.

Some important people in the community had already started cleaning their houses. But checking every house only happened when there was a risk of a plague in Durban. This was done after talking to city leaders, who wanted our help. Our help made their job easier and also made things less hard for us. When diseases break out, officials usually get impatient and take harsh actions against those they don’t like. By choosing to clean up ourselves, the community avoided this unfair treatment.

However, I had some tough experiences. I found it was harder to get people to do their part than to ask for their rights. In some places, people insulted me; in others, they just ignored me politely.

Most people didn’t want to bother keeping their areas clean. Asking them to pay for it was impossible.

These experiences taught me that without a lot of patience, it’s impossible to get people to work. The reformer wants change, but society often opposes, hates, or even fights the reformer. What the reformer loves might seem like going backwards to others.

Still, because of this effort, the Indian community slowly started to understand the need to keep their homes and neighborhoods clean.
