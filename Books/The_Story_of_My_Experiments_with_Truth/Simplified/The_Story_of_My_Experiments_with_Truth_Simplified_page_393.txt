When I got to England, I found out that Gokhale was stuck in Paris because he went there for his health. Since no one could talk between Paris and London, no one knew when he would come back. I didn’t want to go home without seeing him, but nobody could say exactly when he would arrive.

So, what was I supposed to do while waiting? What was my job with the war?

Sorabji Adajania, my friend from jail and a Satyagrahi, was studying to become a lawyer in London. He was one of the best Satyagrahis and had been sent to England to become a barrister so he could take my place when I went back to South Africa. Dr. Pranjivandas Mehta was paying for his expenses. Through Sorabji, I talked with Dr. Jivraj Mehta and others who were studying in England. Together, we called a meeting of Indians living in Great Britain and Ireland. I shared my ideas with them.

I believed that Indians living in England should help with the war. English students had joined the army, so Indians should do the same. But many people didn’t agree. They said Indians and English were very different. Indians were slaves, and English were masters. How could slaves help their masters when the masters needed them? Shouldn’t slaves use this chance to fight for freedom instead? I didn’t agree with this then. I knew Indians had a lower status, but I didn’t think we were completely slaves. I believed the problem was with some British officials, not the whole British system. I thought we could change them with kindness. If we wanted to improve our place by working with the British, it was our duty to help them when they needed us. The system had problems, but it didn’t seem as bad as it does now.

But if I had stopped trusting the system and refused to work with the British Government back then, how could my friends, who had lost faith not only in the system but also in the officials, do it?
