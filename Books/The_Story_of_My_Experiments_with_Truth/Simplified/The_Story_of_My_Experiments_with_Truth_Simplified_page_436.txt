I didn’t set any limit on how many dishes I could eat, so my taste buds and eyes didn’t stop me from ordering lots of different foods. We didn’t have regular meal times. I personally liked to eat my last meal before it got dark.

But usually, that last meal didn’t happen before eight or nine at night.

In 1915, the Kumbha fair was held at Hardvar, which only happens every 12 years. I wasn’t really excited to go to the fair, but I wanted to meet Mahatma Munshiramji, who was living in his Gurukul. Gokhale’s Society had sent many volunteers to help at the Kumbha. Pandit Hridayanath Kunzru was in charge, and the late Dr. Dev was the doctor. I was asked to send the Phoenix group to help them, and Maganlal Gandhi went ahead of me. When I came back from Rangoon, I joined the group.

The trip from Calcutta to Hardvar was very hard. Sometimes the train cars didn’t have lights. From Saharanpur, we were packed into cars meant for goods or animals. These didn’t have roofs, and with the hot sun above and the burning metal floor below, it felt like we were being roasted. Even though we were very thirsty, strict Hindus didn’t drink water if it came from Muslims. They waited until they could get water from Hindus. But these same Hindus didn’t hesitate to take wine or beef tea from doctors or water from Muslim or Christian helpers when they were sick.

When we stayed in Shantiniketan, we learned that cleaning toilets would be our special job in India. At Hardvar, the volunteers' tents were set up in a dharmashala, and Dr. Dev had dug some pits to be used as toilets.

He had to rely on paid scavengers to clean these. This was a job for the Phoenix group. We offered to cover the waste with earth and take care of its disposal, and Dr. Dev happily agreed. I was the one who made the offer, but Maganlal Gandhi was the one who actually did the work. I mostly stayed in the tent, meeting pilgrims, giving blessings, and having religious and other talks with many visitors. This left me no free time at all.
