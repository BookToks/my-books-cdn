HOW I STARTED LIFE

My older brother had big hopes for me. He really wanted me to become rich and famous. He was very kind and generous, sometimes too much. Because he was simple and honest, many friends liked him. He thought these friends would help me get important legal cases. He also expected me to have a busy law practice, so he spent a lot of money at home, hoping I would earn it back. He worked hard to make sure I had a good chance to succeed.

There was still trouble in my community because I had traveled abroad. People were split into two groups: one group welcomed me back right away, but the other wanted to keep me out. To make the first group happy, my brother took me to Nasik, where I bathed in a holy river. Then, when we got to Rajkot, he threw a big dinner for my community. I didn’t really like all this, but I loved my brother a lot and trusted him, so I went along with what he wanted. This helped solve the problem of getting back into the community.

I never tried to join the group that rejected me, and I didn’t feel angry at the leaders who didn’t like me. Some of them didn’t like me, but I made sure not to hurt their feelings. I respected the community rules about being kicked out.

These rules said that even my close family—like my in-laws and siblings—could not spend time with me, and I couldn’t even drink water in their homes. They wanted to secretly break this rule, but I didn’t want to do anything in secret that I wouldn’t do openly.

Because I followed the rules so carefully, I never had problems with the community. In fact, most people were kind and generous to me, even those who still saw me as outcast. They even helped me with my work without asking for anything in return. I believe all this kindness came because I didn’t fight back or resist.
