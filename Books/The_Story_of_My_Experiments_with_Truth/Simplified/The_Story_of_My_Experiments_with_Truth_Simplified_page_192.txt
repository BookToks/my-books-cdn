Trying to change him almost ruined me. I ignored warnings from kind friends. I was completely blinded by my feelings.

If it weren’t for the new cook, I would never have found out the truth. Since I was influenced by that companion, I probably wouldn’t have been able to live with the distance I needed. I would have kept wasting time on him. He had the power to keep me confused and trick me.

But God helped me again, like before. My intentions were good, so I was saved despite my mistakes. This early experience warned me for the future.

The cook was almost like a messenger from Heaven. He didn’t know how to cook well, so he couldn’t have stayed working for me. But no one else could have opened my eyes. I later learned this wasn’t the first time the woman had come to my house. She had come many times before, but no one else was brave enough like the cook. Everyone knew how much I blindly trusted the companion. It was like the cook was sent just to help me, because he asked to leave right then.

“I can’t stay in your house,” he said. “You are so easily tricked. This is not the right place for me.” I let him go.

Then I found out that the person who had turned me against the clerk was actually this companion. I tried hard to make things right with the clerk for the wrong I did him. But I have always been sorry because I could never fully fix it. No matter how you try, a broken friendship is still broken.
