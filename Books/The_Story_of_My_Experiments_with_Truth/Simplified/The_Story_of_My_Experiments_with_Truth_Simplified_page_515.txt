At Colaba, there was probably going to be a huge crowd. I told him I would be happy to do what he wanted. He was glad and thanked me. So, I got off at Marine Lines. By chance, a friend’s car was passing by. It took me to Revashankar Jhaveri’s place. My friend said that the news of my arrest had made people very angry and wild. He said, "There might be a riot near Pydhuni soon. The Magistrate and police are already there."

As soon as I reached, Umar Sobani and Anasuyabehn came and asked me to go to Pydhuni right away. They said, "The people are really upset and excited. We can’t calm them down. Only you can." I got in the car. Near Pydhuni, I saw a huge crowd. When they saw me, they were very happy. They made a procession and shouted "Vande Mataram" and "Allaho Akbar" loudly.

At Pydhuni, we saw mounted police. People were throwing bricks at them. I asked the crowd to stay calm, but it seemed like we couldn’t stop the bricks from coming. The procession was leaving Abdur Rahman Street and going toward Crawford Market when the mounted police blocked the way. The crowd was very tight and almost pushing through the police. It was hard for me to be heard.

Then, the officer told the police to break up the crowd. The mounted police charged at the people with their lances. For a moment, I thought I might get hurt, but the lances only brushed past the car. The crowd was broken up and became confused, then ran away.

Some people were trampled, others were hurt badly. In that huge crowd, there was barely any space for the horses to move, and no way for the people to escape.
