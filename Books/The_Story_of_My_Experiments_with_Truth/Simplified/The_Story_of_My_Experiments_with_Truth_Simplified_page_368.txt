My first time in jail was in 1908. I noticed that some rules the prisoners had to follow were similar to what a brahmachari, someone trying to control themselves, would choose to do. For example, we had to finish our last meal before sunset. Indian and African prisoners weren’t allowed to drink tea or coffee. They could add salt to their cooked food if they wanted, but they couldn’t eat things just for taste.

I asked the jail doctor to give us curry powder and to let us add salt while cooking. He said, “You are not here to enjoy your food. From a health point of view, curry powder isn’t needed, and it doesn’t matter if you add salt during or after cooking.” Later, these rules were changed, but it was hard to do. Both rules helped us practice self-control.

Rules made by others don’t work well, but when you choose to follow them yourself, they help a lot. So right after I left jail, I made myself follow these two rules. I stopped drinking tea as much as I could and always finished my last meal before sunset. Now, it’s easy for me to follow these habits.

But one time, I had to stop eating salt completely, and I did this without missing salt for ten years.

I had read in vegetarian books that salt isn’t necessary for people and that a diet without salt is better for health. I thought a brahmachari would get more benefits from not eating salt. I also learned that people with weak bodies should avoid beans and lentils, but I liked eating them a lot.

At that time, Kasturbai, after her operation, started bleeding again, and it was hard to stop.

Water treatments alone didn’t help. She didn’t really believe in my treatments, but she didn’t stop me from trying. She also didn’t ask for help from others.
