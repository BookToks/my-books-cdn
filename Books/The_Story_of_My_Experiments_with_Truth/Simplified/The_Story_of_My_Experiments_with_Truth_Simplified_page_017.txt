I started writing, but just after I turned the first page, riots began in Bombay and work stopped completely. Then many things happened that ended with me being put in jail at Yeravda. One of my fellow prisoners, Sjt. Jeramdas, asked me to stop everything else and finish writing my autobiography. I told him I already had a study plan and couldn’t do anything else until I finished it. I probably would have finished the autobiography if I had stayed in jail for my full time because I still had a year left when I was let out.

Swami Anand asked me again to write it, and since I finished the history of Satyagraha in South Africa, I felt like starting the autobiography for Navajivan. Swami Anand wanted me to write it as a separate book, but I don’t have much free time. I can only write one chapter each week. Since I have to write something every week for Navajivan, why not make it the autobiography? Swami Anand agreed, and now I am working hard on it.

But a friend who believes in God was worried and told me so during my day of silence. He asked, “Why are you doing this? Writing an autobiography is mostly a Western thing. I don’t know anyone in the East who has done this except those influenced by the West. What if tomorrow you change your beliefs or plans? People who follow your words might get confused or misled. Wouldn’t it be better not to write an autobiography, at least not yet?” This made me think. But I’m not trying to write a full autobiography. I just want to share the story of my many experiments with truth. Since my life is basically about these experiments, the story will naturally become like an autobiography.
