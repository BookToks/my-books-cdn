He said he might recommend me for some government help to study in England. I liked that idea and got ready to leave for Porbandar. Back then, there were no trains. It took five days to travel by bullock cart. I already said I was a scaredy-cat, but at that moment, my fear disappeared because I really wanted to go to England. I hired a bullock cart to Dhoraji, and from there I rode a camel to Porbandar to save a day. That was my first time riding a camel.

When I finally arrived, I bowed to my uncle and told him everything. He thought about it and said, "I’m not sure if it’s possible to live in England without it hurting your religion. From what I’ve heard, I doubt it. When I meet important lawyers there, they live just like Europeans. They don’t care about food rules. They always smoke cigars and dress just like Englishmen. That doesn’t match our family traditions. I’m about to go on a pilgrimage and don’t have many years left. At this point in my life, how can I give you permission to go so far away? But I won’t stop you. Your mother’s permission is the most important. If she agrees, then good luck! Tell her I won’t interfere. You will go with my blessings." I said, "I couldn’t expect more from you. I’ll try to convince my mother now. But could you recommend me to Mr. Lely?" He said, "How can I do that? But he’s a good man. Just ask for a meeting and tell him you’re related. He’ll probably see you and might help." I don’t know why my uncle didn’t give me a recommendation letter. I think he was unsure about helping me go to England because he saw it as against our religion.

I wrote to Mr. Lely, and he asked me to visit him at his home. He saw me as he was going up the stairs and said shortly, "Pass your B.A. first, then see me."
