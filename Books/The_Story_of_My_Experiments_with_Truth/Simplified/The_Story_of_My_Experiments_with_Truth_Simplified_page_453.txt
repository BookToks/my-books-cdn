He wanted me to visit Champaran myself and see how badly the farmers were suffering there. I told him I would add Champaran to my planned trip and spend a day or two there. "One day will be enough," he said, "and you will see everything with your own eyes." After Lucknow, I went to Cawnpore. Rajkumar Shukla came with me.

"Champaran is very close. Please give me a day," he kept asking. I said, "Sorry, not this time. But I promise I will come." I gave him my word.

When I got back to the Ashram, Rajkumar was there too. "Please set the day now," he said. I replied, "Okay, I have to be in Calcutta on this date. Meet me there and take me from there." I didn’t really know where I was going or what exactly I would see.

Before I reached Bhupen Babu's place in Calcutta, Rajkumar Shukla had already arrived and was staying there. This simple but determined farmer had caught my attention.

So, early in 1917, we left Calcutta for Champaran, looking like regular country folks. I didn’t even know which train to take. He showed me, and we traveled together, getting to Patna in the morning.

This was my first time in Patna. I didn’t know anyone to stay with. I thought Rajkumar, being a simple farmer, might have some connections in Patna. I got to know him better during the journey and realized he was innocent about many things. The lawyers he called friends weren’t really friends at all. They treated Rajkumar like a servant. There was a huge gap between poor farmers and their lawyers, as wide as the flooded Ganges River.

Rajkumar took me to Rajendra Babu’s house in Patna. But Rajendra Babu had gone to Puri or somewhere else—I can’t remember where. A couple of servants were there but ignored us. I had some food with me. I wanted dates, and Rajkumar bought some from the market.

There was strong untouchability in Bihar.
