CLIENTS BECAME CO-WORKERS

The difference between the law system in Natal and the Transvaal was that in Natal, lawyers called barristers could also work as attorneys. But in the Transvaal, like in Bombay, attorneys and advocates had separate jobs.

A barrister could choose to work either as an advocate or as an attorney. So, while I became an advocate in Natal, in the Transvaal I became an attorney. This was because as an advocate, I couldn’t meet Indian clients directly, and white attorneys in South Africa wouldn’t give me work.

Even in the Transvaal, attorneys could appear in court before magistrates. One time, while I was handling a case in Johannesburg, I found out my client had lied to me. He completely broke down when he was questioned. So, without arguing, I asked the magistrate to throw out the case. The opposing lawyer was shocked, and the magistrate was happy. I scolded my client for bringing a false case. He knew I never took fake cases, and when I told him this, he admitted he was wrong. I don’t think he was mad at me for asking the magistrate to dismiss his case. This didn’t hurt my work; it actually made things easier. I saw that being honest made me respected by other lawyers, and even though I was a person of color, some of them even liked me.

When I worked, I always told my clients and coworkers when I didn’t know something. If I felt unsure, I told my client to ask another lawyer or, if they wanted to keep me, I said I would get help from a senior lawyer.

Being honest like this made my clients trust and like me a lot.

They were always ready to pay extra if I needed to talk to a senior lawyer.
