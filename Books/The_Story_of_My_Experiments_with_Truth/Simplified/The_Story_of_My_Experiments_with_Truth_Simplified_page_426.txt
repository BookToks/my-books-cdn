Wherever I went in Kathiawad, I kept hearing people complain about how hard the customs rules at Viramgam were. So, I decided to take up Lord Willingdon’s offer right away. I gathered and read everything I could find on the topic, and I became sure the complaints were true. Then, I started writing letters to the Bombay Government. I met the Private Secretary to Lord Willingdon and even waited to see Lord Willingdon himself. He felt sorry about the problem but said it was Delhi’s fault. “If it were up to us, we would have removed the cordon a long time ago. You should talk to the Government of India,” the Secretary said.

I contacted the Government of India but only got a note saying they received my letter. Later, when I had a chance to meet Lord Chelmsford, things started to change. I told him all the facts, and he was surprised because he didn’t know about this before. He listened carefully, immediately called to get papers about Viramgam, and promised to remove the cordon if the officials couldn’t explain why it was there. A few days after this meeting, I read in the newspapers that the Viramgam customs cordon had been taken down.

I saw this as the beginning of Satyagraha in India. During my talk with the Bombay Government, the Secretary didn’t like that I mentioned Satyagraha in a speech I gave in Bagasra (in Kathiawad).

“Isn’t that a threat?” he asked. “Do you think a strong government will give in to threats?” I replied, “It’s not a threat. It’s teaching people. I must tell people about all the legal ways to fix problems. A nation that wants to be free should know all the methods. Usually, violence is used as a last option. But Satyagraha is a completely non-violent way. I must explain how it works and what it can and cannot do. I know the British Government is powerful, but I also believe Satyagraha is a powerful solution.”
