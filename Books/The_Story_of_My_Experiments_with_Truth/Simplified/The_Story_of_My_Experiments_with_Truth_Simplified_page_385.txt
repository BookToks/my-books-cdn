TARES AMONG THE WHEAT

At Tolstoy Farm, Mr. Kallenbach pointed out a problem I hadn’t noticed before. Some of the boys at the Farm were bad and behaved badly. There were also some lazy kids among them. My three boys saw these kids every day, just like other children who were like my own sons. This worried Mr. Kallenbach, but he was mostly upset about my boys being around these unruly kids.

One day he said, "I don’t like how you mix your boys with the bad ones. It will only have one result. They will become bad because of this bad company." I’m not sure if I was confused at the time, but I remember what I said to him: "How can I tell my boys apart from the lazy ones? I am responsible for both. These kids came because I invited them. If I sent them away with some money, they would just go back to Johannesburg and get into trouble again. Honestly, the kids and their families probably think they owe me because I let them come here. We both know they have to deal with a lot of problems here. But my job is clear. I must keep them here, so my boys have to live with them too. And you don’t want me to teach my boys to think they are better than other kids. That would be wrong. Being with these other boys will teach them discipline. They will learn on their own to tell right from wrong. Why shouldn’t we believe that if there is anything good in my boys, it will also help their friends? Anyway, I can’t stop having them here, and if there’s some risk, we have to take it." Mr. Kallenbach didn’t agree.

In the end, I think the result wasn’t bad.
