Helping others only means something if you enjoy doing it.  

If you help just to impress people or because you're scared of what they might think, it stops you from growing and hurts your spirit.  

Helping without feeling happy doesn’t really help you or the person you’re helping.  

But all other fun and things you own don’t compare to the joy you get from helping others happily.
