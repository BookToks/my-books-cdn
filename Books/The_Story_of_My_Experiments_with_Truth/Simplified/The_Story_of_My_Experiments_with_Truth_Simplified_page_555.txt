From now on, my life has been so public that there is hardly anything people don’t know about it. Since 1921, I have worked closely with Congress leaders, so I can’t talk about my life after that without mentioning them. Even though some leaders like Shraddhanandji, Deshabandhu, Hakim Saheb, and Lalaji are no longer with us, many other experienced Congress leaders are still around and active. The story of the Congress, especially after the big changes I talked about earlier, is still being written. Most of my important experiments in the last seven years have been done through the Congress. So, if I wanted to explain these experiments more, I would have to talk about my relationships with these leaders. But I won’t do that now, partly because it wouldn’t be proper.

Finally, my conclusions from these experiments are not final yet. So, I feel it’s right to end this story here. Actually, I just don’t feel like writing more.

It’s not easy for me to say goodbye to the reader. I care a lot about my experiments. I don’t know if I have explained them well. I can only say I tried my best to tell the truth.

I have always tried to describe the truth as I see it and how I came to understand it. Doing this has given me great peace because I hope it will help people believe in Truth and Ahimsa (nonviolence).

From my experience, I am sure that Truth is the only God. If these chapters don’t show that the only way to reach Truth is through Ahimsa, then all my work writing them will be wasted. Even if my efforts don’t succeed, readers should know that the problem is with the way I presented it, not the great idea itself.
