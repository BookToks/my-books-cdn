I have to skip many other things that happened between 1897 and 1899 and go straight to the Boer War.

When the war started, I felt sorry for the Boers, but I thought I didn’t have the right to force my own opinions. I talked a lot about this struggle in my book about Satyagraha in South Africa, so I won’t repeat it here. If you’re interested, you can read those pages. What matters is that I stayed loyal to British rule and joined the British in the war. I believed that if I wanted rights as a British citizen, I had to help defend the British Empire. I also thought India could only become free by being part of the British Empire. So, I gathered as many friends as I could and, with a lot of hard work, got permission for us to serve as an ambulance corps.

Most English people thought Indians were cowards who wouldn’t take risks or think about anything beyond themselves. Because of this, many English friends didn’t support my plan. But Dr. Booth fully supported it. He trained us to work with ambulances. We got medical certificates to prove we were fit for service. Mr. Laughton and the late Mr. Escombe also liked the idea, and we finally asked to serve at the war front. The Government thanked us but said they didn’t need our help yet.

I wasn’t happy with this “no.” With Dr. Booth’s help, I met the Bishop of Natal. Many Christian Indians were in our group. The Bishop loved the idea and promised to help us get accepted.

Time helped us too. The Boers fought harder and braver than expected, and finally, our help was needed.

Our corps grew to 1,100 people, with almost 40 leaders.
