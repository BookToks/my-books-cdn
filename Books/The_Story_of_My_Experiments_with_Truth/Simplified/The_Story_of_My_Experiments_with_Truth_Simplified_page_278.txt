The Judicial Assistant’s court kept moving around a lot. He was always traveling, and the lawyers and their clients had to follow him wherever he set up. The lawyers charged more money when they had to leave the main office, so the clients ended up paying double.

The judge didn’t care about this problem.

The case I’m talking about was going to be heard in Veraval, where there was a bad plague. I remember there were about fifty cases every day in a town with only 5,500 people. The town was almost empty, and I stayed in an empty guesthouse far from the town. But where could the clients stay? If they were poor, they just had to hope for the best.

A friend who also had cases asked me to request that the court move to another place because of the plague. When I made the request, the judge asked me, “Are you scared?” I said, “It’s not about being scared. I can move, but what about the clients?” The judge said, “The plague is here to stay in India. Why be afraid? The weather in Veraval is great.” The judge himself lived far from town in a fancy tent by the sea. He thought people should learn to live outside like that. It was no use arguing with him.

The judge told his assistant, “Write down what Mr. Gandhi says and tell me if it is really hard for the lawyers or clients.” The judge believed he was doing the right thing. But how could he understand the difficulties of poor India? How could he know the needs, habits, and customs of the people? How could someone used to thinking in gold coins suddenly think about small copper coins?
