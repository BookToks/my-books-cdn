Today, I can say that I feel pretty safe, but I still haven’t fully learned how to control my thoughts, which is really important. It’s not that I don’t try, but I still don’t understand why bad thoughts keep coming into my mind. I believe there is a way to stop these unwanted thoughts, but everyone has to figure it out for themselves.

Saints and wise people have shared their experiences with us, but they haven’t given a perfect, one-size-fits-all solution. Becoming perfect or free from mistakes only happens through grace. So, people who want to connect with God have given us special words or mantras like Ramanama, which are powerful because of their own hard work and purity.

Without completely giving yourself to God’s grace, it’s impossible to fully control your thoughts. This is what every major religious book teaches, and I’m understanding this more and more as I try to live a pure and disciplined life.

But the story of my struggle will be told in later chapters. I’ll end this part by explaining how I started. At first, when I was excited, following these rules felt easy. The first big change I made was to stop sharing a bed with my wife or being alone with her.

So, brahmacharya, which I had been following casually since 1900, became a serious vow in the middle of 1906.
