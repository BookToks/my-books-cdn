Giving up everything for religion seemed like the greatest thing to me.

This made me want to learn about other religious teachers. A friend told me to read Carlyle's Heroes and Hero-Worship. I read the chapter about the Hero as a prophet and learned how great, brave, and simple a prophet's life was.

At that time, I couldn’t study much more about religion because I was busy preparing for exams. But I promised myself to read more religious books and learn about the main religions.

I also wanted to understand atheism. Every Indian knew about Bradlaugh and his atheism. I read a book about it, but I don’t remember the name. It didn’t change my mind because I had already moved past atheism. Mrs. Besant, who was famous then, had changed from atheism to believing in God, and that made me dislike atheism even more. I read her book How I Became a Theosophist.

Around that time, Bradlaugh died. He was buried in the Working Cemetery. I went to his funeral, and I think every Indian in London did too. Some clergymen were there to honor him. On the way back, we waited at the station. An atheist from the crowd teased one clergyman. “You believe in God, right?” he asked. The man quietly said, “Yes.”

The atheist smiled and said, “You also agree the Earth’s circumference is 28,000 miles, don’t you?”

“Yes,” said the clergyman.

“Then tell me the size of your God and where he is.”

The clergyman answered, “If we knew, He lives in both our hearts.”

The atheist laughed and said, “Don’t treat me like a child,” looking proud of himself.
