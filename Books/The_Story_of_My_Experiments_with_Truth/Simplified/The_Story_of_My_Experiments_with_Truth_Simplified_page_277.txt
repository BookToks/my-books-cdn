Gokhale really wanted me to settle in Bombay, work as a lawyer, and help him with public work. Back then, public work meant working with the Congress, and the main job was running the Congress organization.

I liked Gokhale’s advice, but I wasn’t very confident I would do well as a lawyer.

I still remembered my past failures, and I really hated using flattery to get cases.

So, I decided to start working in Rajkot first. Kevalram Mavji Dave, an old friend who had encouraged me to go to England, was there. He gave me three cases right away. Two were appeals in Kathiawad, and one was a new case in Jamnagar. This last one was important. When I said I wasn’t sure I could do a good job, Kevalram Dave said, “Winning or losing doesn’t matter. Just do your best, and I’ll help you.” The other lawyer was the late Sjt. Samarth. I was pretty well prepared. I didn’t know much Indian law, but Kevalram Dave had taught me well. Before going to South Africa, I had heard people say Sir Pherozeshah Mehta knew the law of evidence very well, and that was why he was successful. I remembered this and studied the Indian Evidence Act carefully during the trip. I also had some legal experience from South Africa.

I won the case and felt more confident. I wasn’t worried about the appeals, and they were successful too. This gave me hope that maybe I wouldn’t fail in Bombay after all.

Before I explain why I finally decided to go to Bombay, I want to share my experience with how careless and ignorant the English officials could be.
