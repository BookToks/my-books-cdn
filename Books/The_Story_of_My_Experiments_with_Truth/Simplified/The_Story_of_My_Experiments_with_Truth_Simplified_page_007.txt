It went out of print in about six months. Because many people wanted it and to sell it at a fair price, a new softcover version was released soon after. This version was also very popular, and all copies were sold in less than three years.

We are happy to say that the book was printed again and sold at a lower price to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Navajivan Trust during 1993-94. Since many people still want it and to help share Gandhian ideas, the eighth reprint is now coming out with a new size and font. We believe this new edition will also be liked by readers and will be a great addition to their personal libraries.
