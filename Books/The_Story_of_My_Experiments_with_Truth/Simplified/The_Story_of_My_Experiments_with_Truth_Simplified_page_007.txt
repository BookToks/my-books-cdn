It went out of print in about six months. To meet the popular demand for it and to make it available to individual readers at a reasonable price a new softcover edition was soon released. It, too, was enthusiastically received and the entire stok of the publication was sold out in less than three years.
 
 We are very happy to say that the set was reprinted and was offered at a subsidised price to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee year of Navajivan Trust during 1993-94. Looking to its continuous demand and so also to fulfil Navajivan’s objective of propagating Gandhian Literature, its eighth reprint is being published with new size and type-setting. We are sure, this new edition, too, would be well-received by individual readers, in order to enrich their personal library.
