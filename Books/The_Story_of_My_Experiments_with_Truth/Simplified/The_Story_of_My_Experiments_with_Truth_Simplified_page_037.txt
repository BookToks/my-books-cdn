I realized that bad handwriting shows a poor education. Later, I tried to improve mine, but it was too late. I could never fix the mistakes from when I was young. Let every young person learn from my example and know that good handwriting is an important part of education. Now, I think children should learn how to draw before they learn to write.

A child should learn letters by looking at them like they do with flowers or birds. Then, they should learn handwriting only after they know how to draw. This way, their writing will look nice and neat.

I want to share two more stories from my school days. I lost one year because I got married, and the teacher wanted me to catch up by skipping a class, which was usually allowed for hard-working students. So, I spent only six months in the third grade and then moved to the fourth grade after exams and summer break.

From the fourth grade, most subjects were taught in English. I felt totally lost. Geometry was a new subject, and I wasn’t very good at it. Learning it in English made it even harder. The teacher explained well, but I couldn’t keep up. I often felt like going back to the third grade because trying to learn two years in one year was too much. But going back would embarrass both me and the teacher, who had trusted I could do it. So, I stayed in the class. After a lot of hard work, when I finally understood the thirteenth rule in Euclid’s geometry, the subject suddenly seemed easy. Geometry just needed clear thinking, so it wasn’t hard after all. Since then, I found geometry easy and interesting.

But Samskrit (Sanskrit) was much harder. In geometry, I didn’t have to memorize anything, but in Samskrit, I thought I had to remember everything. This subject also started in the fourth grade. When I reached the sixth grade, I started to lose hope.
