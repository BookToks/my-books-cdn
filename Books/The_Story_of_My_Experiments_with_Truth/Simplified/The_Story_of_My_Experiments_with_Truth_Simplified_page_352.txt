I have always believed that Indian parents who teach their kids to think and speak English from when they are babies are actually doing a bad thing. They take away the special culture and traditions of the country from their children. Because of this, those children might not be able to serve their country properly.

Because of these beliefs, I always spoke to my children in Gujarati. Polak didn’t like this at all. He thought I was ruining their future. He argued strongly and lovingly that if kids learned a global language like English from a young age, they would have a big advantage in life. But he couldn’t change my mind.

I don’t remember if I convinced him I was right or if he just gave up because I was too stubborn. This was about twenty years ago, and since then, I have only become more sure about my beliefs. Even though my sons didn’t get the best formal education, knowing our native language well has been good for them and the country. They don’t seem like outsiders, which they might have if they only spoke English.

They naturally became bilingual, speaking and writing English pretty well because they spent a lot of time with English-speaking friends and lived in a country where English was the main language.
