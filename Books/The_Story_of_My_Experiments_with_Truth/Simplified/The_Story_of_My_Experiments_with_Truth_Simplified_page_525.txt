In Punjab, Sir Michael O'Dwyer blamed me for everything that had happened there. Some angry young Punjabis also blamed me for the martial law.

They said that if I had not stopped the civil disobedience, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre would not have happened. Some even threatened to kill me if I went to Punjab.

But I believed I was doing the right thing, and no smart person could misunderstand me.

I really wanted to go to Punjab. I had never been there before, so I was eager to see it myself. Dr. Satyapal, Dr. Kitchlu, and Pandit Rambhaj Dutt Chowdhari, who invited me to Punjab, were in jail then. But I was sure the government would not keep them and other prisoners locked up for long. Many Punjabis came to see me in Bombay. I encouraged them and made them feel better. My confidence was contagious.

However, I had to keep delaying my trip to Punjab. Every time I asked the Viceroy for permission, he said, “not yet,” so the wait went on.

Meanwhile, the Hunter Committee was set up to investigate what the Punjab government did during martial law. Mr. C. F. Andrews had arrived in Punjab. His letters described the terrible situation there. I felt the martial law cruelty was even worse than the news said. He asked me to join him quickly. At the same time, Malaviyaji sent messages telling me to go to Punjab immediately. I asked the Viceroy again if I could go.

He replied that I could go after a certain date. I think it was October 17.

The scene I saw when I arrived in Lahore is something I will never forget.
