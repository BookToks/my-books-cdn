They didn’t stop worrying me, and I didn’t stop answering them calmly. This finally made them feel better. Some asked my name, and when I told them, they felt sorry. They said sorry and made space for me. Being patient paid off. I was really tired and dizzy. Just when I needed it most, help came.

That’s how I finally got to Delhi and then Calcutta. The Maharaja of Cassimbazaar, who was in charge of the Calcutta meeting, hosted me. Like in Karachi, people here were very excited. Several Englishmen came to the meeting too.

Before July 31st, the Government announced that they were stopping indentured emigration from India.

In 1894, I wrote the first petition against the system. I hoped that this “semi-slavery,” as Sir W. W. Hunter called it, would end someday.

Many people helped with the protest that started in 1894, but I believe that the idea of Satyagraha helped end it faster.

If you want to know more about that protest and who was involved, you can read about it in my book, Satyagraha in South Africa.
