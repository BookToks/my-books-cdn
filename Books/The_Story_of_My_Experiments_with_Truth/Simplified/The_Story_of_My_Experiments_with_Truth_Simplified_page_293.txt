I felt hurt by the insult, but since I had been insulted many times before, I was used to it. So, I decided to forget about this one and think calmly about what to do next.

We got a letter from the Chief of the Asiatic Department saying that because I had already met Mr. Chamberlain in Durban, they had to take my name off the group that was going to meet him.

My co-workers couldn’t accept this. They wanted to cancel the whole plan to meet Mr. Chamberlain. I told them how difficult the situation was for our community.

“If you don’t speak up to Mr. Chamberlain,” I said, “people will think you have no problems. The statement we want to give is already written down. It doesn’t matter if I read it or someone else does. Mr. Chamberlain isn’t going to argue with us anyway. I guess we just have to accept the insult.” Right after I said this, Tyeb Sheth shouted, “If you’re insulted, isn’t the whole community insulted? How can we forget that you speak for us?” “That’s true,” I replied. “But even the community has to accept insults like this. Do we have any other choice?” “No matter what, why should we accept another insult? What worse could happen? Don’t we already have very few rights?” Tyeb Sheth asked.

His answer was strong, but it didn’t help much. I knew the community’s limits. I calmed my friends and suggested that Mr. George Godfrey, an Indian lawyer, should go instead of me.

So Mr. Godfrey led the group. Mr. Chamberlain mentioned my being left out in his reply. “Instead of hearing from the same person again and again, isn’t it better to have someone new?” he said, trying to make things better.

But instead of solving the problem, this made more work for the community and for me.
