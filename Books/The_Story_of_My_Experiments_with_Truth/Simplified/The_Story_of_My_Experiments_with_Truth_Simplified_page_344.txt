I couldn’t leave the work there without paying attention to it for a long time.

When I got back to Johannesburg, I told Polak about the important changes I had made. He was super happy to hear that the loan of his book had helped so much. “Can I be part of this new project?” he asked. “Of course,” I said. “You can join the Settlement if you want.” “I’m ready,” he said. “Just let me join.” His determination impressed me. He gave a month’s notice at his job at The Critic and then came to Phoenix. Because he was friendly, everyone liked him quickly, and he soon felt like part of the family. He was so simple that he didn’t find life at Phoenix strange or hard—he fit in easily.

But I couldn’t keep him there for long. Mr. Ritch wanted to finish his law studies in England, and I couldn’t handle the office alone. So I suggested Polak join the office and become a lawyer. I thought maybe one day we would both retire and live at Phoenix, but that didn’t happen. Polak was trusting and, when he trusted a friend, he tried to agree with them instead of arguing. He wrote to me from Phoenix saying he loved life there and was happy, and he wanted to help the Settlement grow. But he was also ready to leave and join the office to become a lawyer if I thought it would help us reach our goals faster. I was very happy to hear that. Polak left Phoenix, came to Johannesburg, and started working with me.

Around the same time, a Scottish theosophist I had been helping study for a local law exam also joined as a trainee lawyer after I invited him to follow Polak’s example. His name was Mr. MacIntyre.

So, even though I wanted to quickly reach the goals at Phoenix, it felt like I was getting pulled in a different direction. If God hadn’t wanted otherwise, I might have gotten stuck in this situation while trying to live simply.
