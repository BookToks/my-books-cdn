THE STORM  

We saw that the two ships dropped anchor at the port of Durban around December 18. No passengers were allowed to get off at any South African ports before having a full medical check-up. If any passenger was sick with a contagious disease, the ship had to stay in quarantine. Since there had been a plague in Bombay when we left, we were worried we might have to stay in quarantine for a while. Before the check-up, every ship had to fly a yellow flag, which was only taken down when the doctor said the ship was healthy. Friends and family of passengers could only come on board after the yellow flag was lowered.

Our ship was flying the yellow flag when the doctor came to examine us. He ordered a five-day quarantine because he thought plague germs could take up to twenty-three days to show up. So, our ship had to stay in quarantine until the twenty-third day after we left Bombay. But there were other reasons for this quarantine order besides health.

The white people living in Durban were pushing to send us back home, and this was one reason for the quarantine. Dada Abdulla and Co. kept us updated about what was happening in town every day. The whites were holding huge meetings daily. They made all kinds of threats and sometimes even offered money to Dada Abdulla and Co. They promised to pay the company if both ships were sent back. But Dada Abdulla and Co. were not afraid of threats. Sheth Abdul Karim Haji Adam, the managing partner of the firm, was determined to keep the ships at the dock and let the passengers get off no matter what. He sent me detailed letters every day.

Luckily, the late Sjt. Mansukhlal Naazar was in Durban at that time because he had come to meet me. He was strong and brave and helped guide the Indian community. Their lawyer, Mr. Laughton, was also very brave. He spoke out against the behavior of the white residents and gave advice to the community, not just as their lawyer but as a true friend.

So, Durban became the place of an unfair fight.
