LORD CURZON'S DURBAR

The Congress was over, but I had to meet the Chamber of Commerce and other people for work in South Africa, so I stayed in Calcutta for a month. Instead of staying in a hotel, I arranged to stay at the India Club. Some important Indians were members there, and I hoped to meet them and get them interested in the work in South Africa.

Gokhale often went to this Club to play billiards. When he learned I would stay in Calcutta for a while, he invited me to stay with him. I was happy to accept, but I didn’t think it was right to go alone. After waiting a day or two, he came to bring me himself. He noticed I was shy and said, "Gandhi, you have to stay in the country, and being shy won’t help. You must meet as many people as you can. I want you to do Congress work."

Before I talk more about staying with Gokhale, I want to share something that happened at the India Club.

Lord Curzon had his durbar (a big royal event) around this time. Some Rajas and Maharajas invited to the durbar were members of the Club. At the Club, they wore nice Bengali dhotis, shirts, and scarves. But on durbar day, they put on trousers like servants (khansamas) and shiny boots. I felt sad and asked one of them why they changed their clothes.

He said, "We alone know our sad situation. We alone know the insults we face just to keep our wealth and titles."

I asked, "But why wear those khansama turbans and shiny boots?"

He replied, "Do you see any difference between the servants and us? They are our servants, and we are Lord Curzon’s servants. If I don’t go to the durbar, I would be punished. If I go in my usual clothes, it would be an insult. And do you think I can talk to Lord Curzon there? Not at all!" I felt sorry for this honest friend.

This reminds me of another durbar.
