The officers in charge of the new department didn’t know how I got into the Transvaal. They asked the Indians who usually came to them, but they didn’t know for sure. One officer guessed I might have entered without a permit because of my old connections. If that was true, I could be arrested!

After a big war, it’s common for the government to get special powers. This happened in South Africa too.

The government made a law called the Peace Preservation Ordinance. It said anyone entering the Transvaal without a permit could be arrested and put in jail. They talked about arresting me under this law, but no one had the courage to ask me for my permit.

The officers sent messages to Durban, and when they found out I had a permit, they were upset. But they didn’t give up. Even though I got into the Transvaal, they still stopped me from meeting Mr. Chamberlain.

The community was then asked to pick who would represent them in the meeting. There was definitely color prejudice all over South Africa, but I didn’t expect the sneaky and unfair behavior from officials that I had seen in India. In South Africa, public departments worked for the people and listened to public opinion. So, the officials were polite and respectful, and people of color were treated better too.

When officers from Asia came, they brought their own way of ruling. In South Africa, there was a kind of responsible government or democracy. But the system brought from Asia was pure autocracy, meaning one person or group had all the power. The Asians had no responsible government because they were ruled by a foreign power.
