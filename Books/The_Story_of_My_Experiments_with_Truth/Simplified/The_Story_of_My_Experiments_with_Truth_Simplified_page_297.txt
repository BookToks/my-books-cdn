Why should I think that I would die sooner than anyone else? After all, the real protector was not me or my brother, but God. By buying life insurance, I had taken away my wife and children’s ability to depend on themselves. Why shouldn’t they be expected to take care of themselves? What about the families of the many poor people in the world? Why shouldn’t I see myself as one of them?

Many thoughts like these went through my mind, but I didn’t act on them right away. I remember paying at least one insurance payment while I was in South Africa.

Things around me also supported this way of thinking. When I first stayed in South Africa, Christian ideas kept my religious feelings alive. Now, theosophy made my faith even stronger.

Mr. Ritch was a theosophist and introduced me to the theosophy group in Johannesburg. I never joined because I had some disagreements, but I got to know almost all the theosophists there. I talked about religion with them every day. We read theosophical books together, and sometimes I spoke at their meetings. The main idea of theosophy is to promote brotherhood. We talked a lot about this, and I pointed out when their actions didn’t match their beliefs. Criticizing them helped me think about myself more deeply.
