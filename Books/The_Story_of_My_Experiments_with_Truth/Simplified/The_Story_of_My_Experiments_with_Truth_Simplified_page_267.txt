So I went there one day.

Justice Mitter’s house was nearby, so I also went to the temple that same day. On the way, I saw a group of sheep being taken to be sacrificed to Kali. Beggars were standing along the path to the temple. There were also religious men asking for money. Even back then, I didn’t like giving money to beggars who seemed strong. A group of them followed me.

One man was sitting on a porch. He stopped me and asked, “Where are you going, my boy?” I told him.

He asked my friend and me to sit down, and we did.

I asked him, “Do you think this sacrifice is true religion?” He said, “Who would think killing animals is religion?” I asked, “Then why don’t you speak against it?” He said, “That’s not our job. Our job is to worship God.” I asked, “But can’t you worship God somewhere else?” He said, “All places are the same for us. People are like sheep, following their leaders. It’s not our concern.” We didn’t argue more and went to the temple. There was blood everywhere. I couldn’t stay there. I felt angry and upset. I have never forgotten that sight.

That evening, I was invited to dinner with some Bengali friends.

I talked to a friend about this cruel way of worship. He said, “The sheep don’t feel anything. The loud noise and drums cover up their pain.” I didn’t believe him. I said if sheep could talk, they would say something different. I thought this cruel tradition should stop. I thought about Buddha’s story but knew I couldn’t fix this problem alone.

I still feel the same way today. To me, a lamb’s life is just as important as a human’s. I would never want to kill a lamb just to save a human body.
