The bag was going to hold my coat, a dhoti, a towel, and a shirt.

I also had a blanket to cover myself and a water jug. With all these things, I started my trip. Gokhale and Dr. Ray came to the station to say goodbye.

I told them not to bother coming, but they insisted. Gokhale said, "I wouldn’t have come if you traveled first class, but since you didn’t, I had to."

No one stopped Gokhale from going onto the platform. He wore a silk turban, a jacket, and a dhoti. Dr. Ray wore his Bengali clothes. The ticket collector stopped him, but when Gokhale said he was his friend, the collector let him through.

So, with their good wishes, I began my journey.
