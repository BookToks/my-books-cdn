I wanted her to do it happily. So I raised my voice and said, "I will not put up with this nonsense in my house." My words hurt her like a sharp arrow.  

She yelled back, "Keep your house to yourself and let me go." I lost control, and all my kindness disappeared. I grabbed her hand, pulled her to the gate right by the ladder, and started to open it, planning to push her out. She was crying hard and said, "Don’t you feel ashamed? How can you forget yourself like this? Where am I supposed to go? I have no family here to help me. Just because I am your wife, you think I have to take your hits and kicks? Please calm down and close the gate. We shouldn’t be making scenes like this!"  

I tried to act tough but was really embarrassed, so I shut the gate. If my wife couldn’t leave me, then I couldn’t leave her either. We fought a lot, but we always made up in the end. My wife, with her amazing patience, always won.  

Now I can talk about this without getting upset because it happened a long time ago. I’m no longer a blind, obsessed husband, and I’m not trying to teach my wife anymore. Kasturba can be just as difficult with me today as I used to be with her. We are good friends now and don’t see each other as just objects of desire. She has taken care of me faithfully during my illnesses without expecting anything in return.  

This happened in 1898, before I understood brahmacharya (self-control). Back then, I thought a wife existed only for her husband’s desires and was meant to obey him, not to be his partner or friend in good and bad times.  

My thinking changed a lot in 1900, and by 1906, it became clear and strong. But I will talk about that at the right time.
