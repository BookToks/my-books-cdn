I now understand how things work here, and I get why it’s difficult. I don’t mind if you bring the dinner to my room. I hope we can make a better plan tomorrow. I was shown to a room and waited alone for dinner, thinking about things. There weren’t many guests in the hotel, and I thought the waiter would come quickly with my food. But instead, Mr. Johnston came in. He said, “I felt bad for asking you to eat here. So I talked to the other guests about you and asked if it was okay for you to eat in the dining room. They said it was fine and that you could stay here as long as you want. Please come to the dining room if you like.” I thanked him, went to the dining room, and enjoyed a good meal.

The next morning, I met with the lawyer, Mr. A. W. Baker. Abdulla Sheth had told me about him, so I wasn’t surprised that he welcomed me warmly. He asked me kindly about myself, and I told him everything. Then he said, “We don’t need you as a lawyer because we have hired the best one. This case is long and difficult, so I’ll only ask for your help to get some information. You will also help me talk to my client, asking for any information through you, which makes things easier.”

He added, “I haven’t found a place for you to stay yet. I wanted to see you first. There is a lot of racial prejudice here, so it’s hard to find rooms for people like you. But I know a poor woman married to a baker. She might take you as a boarder and make some extra money. Let’s go see her.” He took me to her house, talked with her in private, and she agreed to let me stay for 35 shillings a week.

Besides being a lawyer, Mr. Baker was a strong lay preacher. He is still alive and now works only as a missionary, having stopped practicing law.
