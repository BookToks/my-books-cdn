I didn’t get any rest. Right after the workers’ strike in Ahmedabad ended, I had to start working on the Kheda Satyagraha.

There was almost a famine in Kheda because the crops failed badly. The Patidars in Kheda were thinking about asking the government to stop collecting taxes for that year.

Amritlal Thakkar had already looked into the problem and talked with the Commissioner. Before I gave advice to the farmers, Mohanlal Pandya and Shankarlal Parikh also joined the fight. They raised the issue in the Bombay Legislative Council with help from Vithalbhai Patel and the late Sir Gokuldas Kahandas Parekh. Several groups had even met the Governor about it.

At that time, I was President of the Gujarat Sabha. The Sabha sent petitions and telegrams to the government and accepted the rude behavior and threats from the Commissioner without complaint. The way the officials acted was so silly and disrespectful that it’s hard to believe now.

The farmers’ demand was very simple and fair. According to the Land Revenue Rules, if the crop was four annas or less, they could ask to stop paying taxes for the year. Officials said the crop was more than four annas, but the farmers said it was less. The government didn’t want to listen and saw their request as disrespectful. When all their petitions failed, I talked with my team and told the Patidars to start Satyagraha.

Besides the volunteers from Kheda, my main partners in this struggle were Vallabhbhai Patel, Shankarlal Banker, Shrimati Anasuyabehn, Indulal Yajnik, Mahadev Desai, and others.
