I would want India to offer all her able-bodied young men to help the Empire when it really needs it. I believe that by doing this, India would become the Empire’s closest partner, and people would stop caring about race differences. But most educated Indians have chosen a less strong way to help, and now it’s clear that educated Indians do influence the common people.

Since I came back from South Africa to India, I have been very close to the farmers, and I want to tell you that many of them want Home Rule. I was at the last Congress meeting, and I helped agree on the decision that India should get full self-government by a set time through a law made by Parliament. I know this is a bold move, but I believe that nothing less than a clear plan for Home Rule soon will satisfy the Indian people. Many in India think no sacrifice is too big to get this goal, and they understand they must be ready to sacrifice for the Empire where they want to reach their final place.

So, we can speed up our journey to freedom by quietly and fully dedicating ourselves to saving the Empire from danger. Not understanding this basic truth would be like killing our own nation.

We must realize that if we help save the Empire, we will also get Home Rule.

While I believe we should give the Empire every man we can for its defense, I don’t think the same about giving money. From my close talks with the farmers, I know India has already given more money than she can afford. When I say this, I’m speaking for most Indians.

This meeting is a clear step for me, and I think for many others, to fully commit our lives to this common cause, but our situation is unique.
