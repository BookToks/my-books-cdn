But when it was time for the test, all the ways they tried to hand out the sweets didn’t work. Every time they started, the crowd got mixed up and confused after a few minutes. The leaders tried really hard to fix the mess, but they couldn’t.

The crowd got so crowded and crazy that many sweets were crushed under people’s feet. Finally, they had to stop trying to give out sweets outside. It was hard, but they managed to take the rest of the sweets to Sheth Ambalal’s house in Mirzapur. The next day, the sweets were given out calmly inside the house yard.

This situation is funny in some ways, but also very sad.

Later, they found out that many beggars in Ahmedabad heard about the sweets being given out under the Ek-Tek tree. They came in big groups and their hunger made them push and shove, causing all the chaos.

The extreme poverty and hunger in our country force more and more people to become beggars each year. Their fight to survive makes them forget about behaving properly or keeping their pride. Instead of helping them find work and support themselves, some good people just give them money or food without asking them to work for it.
