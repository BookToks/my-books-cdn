One of the gifts was a gold necklace worth fifty guineas, meant for my wife.
 
 But even that gift was given because of my public work, and so it could not be separated from the rest.
 
 The evening I was presented with the bulk of these things I had a sleepless night. I walked up and down my room deeply agitated, but could find no solution. It was difficult for me to forego gifts worth hundreds, it was more difficult to keep them.
 
 And even if I could keep them, what about my children? What about my wife?
 
 They were being trained to a life of service and to an understanding that service was its own reward.
 
 I had no costly ornaments in the house. We had been fast simplifying our life.
 
 How then could we afford to have gold watches? How could we afford to wear gold chains and diamond rings? Even then I was exhorting people to conquer the infatuation for jewellery. What was I now to do with the jewellery that had come upon me?
 
 I decided that I could not keep these things. I drafted a letter, creating a trust of them in favour of the community and appointing Parsi Rustomji and others trustees. In the morning I held a consultation with my wife and children and finally go rid of the heavy incubus.
 
 I knew that I should have some difficulty in persuading my wife, and I was sure that I should have none so far as the children were concerned. So I decided to constitute them my attorneys.
 
 The children readily agreed to my proposal. 'We do not need these costly presents, we must return them to the community, and should we ever need them, we could easily purchase them,' they said.
 
 I was delighted. 'Then you will plead with mother won't you?' I asked them.
