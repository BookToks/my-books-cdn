One of the gifts was a gold necklace worth fifty guineas, meant for my wife.

But even that gift was given because of my public work, so it couldn’t be separated from the rest.

The night I got most of these gifts, I couldn’t sleep. I walked around my room feeling very upset but couldn’t find a solution. It was hard to refuse gifts worth hundreds, but it was even harder to keep them.

And even if I kept them, what about my children? What about my wife?

They were learning to live a life of service and understand that serving others was its own reward.

We didn’t have any expensive jewelry at home. We were trying to live simply.

So how could we afford gold watches? How could we wear gold chains and diamond rings? I was always telling people to stop loving jewelry so much. What was I supposed to do with all this jewelry now?

I decided I couldn’t keep these things. I wrote a letter to create a trust for them to help the community and made Parsi Rustomji and others responsible for it. In the morning, I talked with my wife and kids and finally got rid of this heavy burden.

I knew it would be hard to convince my wife, but I was sure the kids would agree. So, I made them my representatives.

The kids agreed right away. "We don’t need these expensive gifts. We should return them to the community, and if we ever need them, we can buy them again," they said.

I was very happy. "Then you will ask Mom, right?" I asked.

"Of course," they said.
