I thanked him and told him that I had already made plans. He told me not to be afraid to ask for anything I needed.

It was dark now. I went back home, ate my dinner, and went to my room. I lay down, thinking deeply. I didn’t have any urgent work to do. I told Abdulla Sheth about it. I wondered, what does Mr. Baker’s interest in me mean? What will I get from his religious friends? How much should I study Christianity? How can I get books about Hinduism? And how can I understand Christianity properly without knowing my own religion well?

I came to one conclusion: I should study everything calmly and look at Mr. Baker’s group the way God guides me. I shouldn’t think about changing my religion until I fully understand my own.

While thinking like this, I fell asleep.
