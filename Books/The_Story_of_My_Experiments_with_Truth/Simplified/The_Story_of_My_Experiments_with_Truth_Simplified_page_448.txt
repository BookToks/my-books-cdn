ABOLITION OF INDENTURED EMIGRATION

Let's take a break from talking about the Ashram, which had to face many problems at the start, and talk about something else that caught my attention.

Indentured labourers were people who left India to work under a contract for five years or less. In 1914, because of a deal between Smuts and Gandhi, a £3 tax on these workers going to Natal was removed. But the whole problem of people leaving India to work still needed to be fixed.

In March 1916, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji asked the Imperial Legislative Council to end the indenture system. When he accepted this, Lord Hardinge said he got a promise from the British government to end the system sometime in the future.

I thought India shouldn’t be happy with such a vague promise. We should push for it to end right away. India had ignored this problem for too long, and I believed it was time to fight for change. I talked to some leaders, wrote in newspapers, and saw that many people agreed it should end now. Could this be a good issue for Satyagraha (a kind of peaceful protest)? I was sure it was, but I wasn’t sure how to start.

Meanwhile, the Viceroy made it clear that “eventual abolition” meant ending the system after some time to find other ways to replace it. So in February 1917, Pandit Malaviyaji asked permission to introduce a law to end the system immediately. Lord Chelmsford said no. It was now time for me to travel across India to start a big protest.

Before I began the protest, I thought it was right to meet the Viceroy. I asked to see him, and he quickly agreed. His private secretary, Mr. Maffey (later Sir John Maffey), was there too. I had a good talk with Lord Chelmsford, who didn’t make any clear promises but said he would try to help.
