Manilal got better, but I saw that the Girgaum house was not a good place to live. It was damp and dark. So, after talking with Shri Revashankar Jagjivan, I decided to rent a well-ventilated bungalow in a suburb of Bombay. I looked around Bandra and Santa Cruz. We didn’t choose Bandra because of the slaughterhouse nearby. Ghatkopar and places close to it were too far from the sea. Finally, we found a nice bungalow in Santa Cruz and rented it because it was the healthiest option.

I bought a first-class season ticket from Santa Cruz to Churchgate. I remember feeling proud when I was the only first-class passenger in my train car. Sometimes, I walked to Bandra to catch the fast train straight to Churchgate.

My work went better than I thought it would. My South African clients often gave me jobs, which was enough to support myself.

I hadn’t gotten any work in the High Court yet, but I went to the ‘moot’ meetings held back then. I never tried to speak there. I remember Jamiatram Nanabhai was very active. Like other new lawyers, I went to watch cases in the High Court mostly to enjoy the cool breeze from the sea, not to learn much. I noticed others did this too. It seemed normal and nothing to be embarrassed about.

But I started using the High Court library and met new people. I felt sure I would get work in the High Court soon.

So, while I was starting to feel more confident about my career, Gokhale, who always watched out for me, was making plans for me. He came to my office two or three times a week, often with friends he wanted me to meet, and he kept me updated on how he worked.
