The idea was talked about carefully, with sharp arguments but in a calm and reasonable way. When they voted, most people agreed and the decision passed by a big majority. This happened a lot because of the influence of Sjt. Vallabhbhai and Abbas Tyabji.

Abbas Tyabji was the president, and he supported the non-cooperation plan.

The All-India Congress Committee decided to have a special Congress meeting in September 1920 in Calcutta to discuss this important issue.

They made big preparations for it. Lala Lajpat Rai was chosen as President. Special trains for Congress and Khilafat supporters ran from Bombay to Calcutta. Many delegates and visitors gathered there.

Maulana Shaukat Ali asked me to write a draft of the non-cooperation resolution while we were on the train. Until then, I usually avoided using the word "non-violent" in my drafts, though I used it in my speeches. I was still figuring out the right words. I realized that Muslim audiences didnâ€™t understand the Sanskrit word for non-violent, so I asked Maulana Abul Kalam Azad for another word. He suggested "ba-aman" for non-violent and "tark-imavalat" for non-cooperation.

So, while I was still working on good Hindi, Gujarati, and Urdu words for non-cooperation, I had to write the resolution for this important Congress. In my first draft, I forgot to include the word "non-violent." I gave the draft to Maulana Shaukat Ali, who was in the same train compartment, without noticing the mistake. That night I saw the error. The next morning, I sent Mahadev with a message to fix it before printing. But I think the draft was printed before the change was made. The Subjects Committee was supposed to meet that evening.
