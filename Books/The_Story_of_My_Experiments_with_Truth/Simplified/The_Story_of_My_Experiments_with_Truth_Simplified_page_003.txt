Gandhiji was not just a great leader who helped free India from foreign rule without violence, but also a deep thinker who shared important ideas about how people and countries should treat each other.

He believed it was very important to use pure and good methods to reach good goals. He said, “The means are like a seed, and the end is like a tree; just like a seed grows into a tree, the way you do something affects the result.”  

Gandhiji never gave up on this idea, even when fighting for India’s freedom. He was sure that doing the right thing was the best way, even if it took a long time.  

To him, real progress didn’t mean having more and more things, but choosing to live with less and being happy with it. He believed in “simple living and high thinking.”  

He worked hard to create jobs for millions of hungry people in India, but he also said it was important to improve people’s lives in a moral and ethical way.  

He warned that just having lots of money and things could actually harm society. He said, “True economics never goes against high moral standards.” He thought that an economy that only helps the rich get richer by taking from the poor is a bad system.  

Today, many rich countries face problems because of this “tragedy of having too much.” So, it’s good to remember Gandhiji’s call for higher values to build a better world.  

As a recent article said, “People want governments that make decisions based on what is right, not just what is easy or useful.”
