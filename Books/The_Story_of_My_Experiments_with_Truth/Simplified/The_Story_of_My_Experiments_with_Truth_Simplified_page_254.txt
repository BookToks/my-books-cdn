I got lucky. Lokamanya was put in the same building as me. I remember he arrived a day later.

As expected, Lokamanya always had visitors. If I were an artist, I could paint him sitting on his bed— the whole scene is very clear in my mind. Out of the many people who came to see him, I only remember one: the late Babu Motilal Ghose, editor of the Amrita Bazar Patrika. Their loud laughter and talks about the wrong things done by the rulers are unforgettable.

Now, I want to talk more about the appointments in this camp. The volunteers kept arguing with each other. You would ask one volunteer to do something, and he would pass it on to another, who would then pass it to a third, and so on. The people they passed tasks to were all over the place and not really doing anything.

I made friends with some volunteers. I told them about South Africa, and they felt a bit ashamed. I tried to explain the true meaning of service to them. They seemed to get it, but service doesn't just happen overnight. First, you need the will, and then experience. These young men had the will, but no experience. The Congress would meet only three days a year and then stop working.

How could anyone get training from just three days a year? The delegates were just like the volunteers. They also had little or no training. They never did anything themselves. They kept telling the volunteers, "Do this," or "Do that."

Even here, I faced untouchability to some extent. The Tamilian kitchen was far away from the others. The Tamil delegates believed that even seeing others while eating was pollution. So, a special kitchen had to be made for them inside the college, enclosed with wicker walls. It was full of smoke that made you cough. This kitchen was also the dining room and washroom, all in one cramped, closed space with no proper ventilation. To me, this was a twisted version of Varnadharma¹. If untouchability existed among the Congress delegates, I could only imagine how bad it must be among their people. I sighed thinking about it.

There was no limit to the dirt and lack of cleanliness.
