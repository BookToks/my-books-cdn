Early in the morning, I told Rajagopalachari the whole story.

Last night, I had a dream that we should ask the whole country to take part in a general hartal. Satyagraha is about cleaning ourselves inside, and our fight is very important. So, I thought it would be right to start it with an act of self-purification. I asked all the people of India to stop their work for one day and spend the day fasting and praying. Since Muslims might not fast for more than one day, the fast should last 24 hours. I wasn’t sure if all regions would join, but I was confident that Bombay, Madras, Bihar, and Sindh would. Even if only these places took part properly, it would be enough. Rajagopalachari liked my idea immediately. Other friends also agreed when I told them later. I wrote a short message asking people to join.

We first planned the hartal for March 30, 1919, but later changed it to April 6. People had only a short time to get ready. Since we had to act quickly, it wasn’t possible to give more notice.

But who could have guessed what happened? All over India, in cities and villages, people completely stopped working on that day. It was an amazing sight.
