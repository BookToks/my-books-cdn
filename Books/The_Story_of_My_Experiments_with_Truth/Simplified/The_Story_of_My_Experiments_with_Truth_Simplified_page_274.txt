The panda didn’t skip any of the usual formal steps with me. The puja ended at twelve o’clock, and then I went to the Kashi Vishvanath temple to see the place.

What I saw there made me very sad. When I worked as a lawyer in Bombay in 1891, I had listened to a talk about visiting Kashi. So, I was ready to be a little disappointed. But what I saw was worse than I expected.

To get there, I had to walk through a narrow, slippery alley. It was not quiet at all.

There were so many flies and the noise from shopkeepers and pilgrims was really annoying.

Instead of a calm and peaceful feeling, there was none. You had to find that peace inside yourself. I did see some women praying quietly, not paying attention to the noise around them. But the temple leaders couldn’t take credit for that. They should make sure the temple area is clean and peaceful, both outside and inside. Instead, I found a market where smart shopkeepers were selling sweets and trendy toys.

When I got to the temple, the entrance smelled bad because of rotten flowers. The floor was made of nice marble, but it was broken in places because some visitor had put coins in it, which just collected dirt.

I went near the Jnana-vapi (Well of knowledge). I looked for God there but didn’t find Him. So, I wasn’t in a good mood. The area around the well was dirty too. I didn’t want to give a donation, so I offered a small coin.

The panda in charge got mad and threw the coin away. He swore at me and said, “This insult will send you straight to hell.” That didn’t bother me. I said, “Maharaj, whatever happens to me, it’s not right for you to use such bad language. You can take this coin if you want, or lose it.”

He replied, “Go away. I don’t want your coin.”
