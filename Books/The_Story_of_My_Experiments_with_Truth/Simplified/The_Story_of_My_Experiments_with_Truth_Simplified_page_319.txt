She completely trusted me, and even more, she shared her deepest thoughts and feelings with me. She asked for my advice when choosing her husband, and I had the honor of giving her away at her wedding. After Miss Dick became Mrs. Macdonald, she had to leave me, but even after she got married, she always answered whenever I needed her help.

But I needed a permanent stenotypist to replace her, and I was lucky to find another girl. Her name was Miss Schlesin, introduced to me by Mr. Kallenbach, who you will learn about later. She is now a teacher at a high school in the Transvaal. She was about seventeen when she started working with me. Sometimes her strange habits were hard for Mr. Kallenbach and me to handle. She came more to learn than just to work as a stenotypist. She didn’t care about skin color and didn’t respect age or experience much. She would even tell a man exactly what she thought of him, even if it was rude. Her quick temper sometimes caused problems for me, but her honest and simple nature always fixed them. I often signed letters she typed without checking because her English was better than mine, and I trusted her completely.

She gave up a lot. For a long time, she didn’t take more than £6 a month and refused to accept more than £10. When I told her to take more, she would scold me and say, “I’m not here to get a salary. I’m here because I like working with you and your ideas.” Once she took £40 from me, but she said it was a loan and paid it all back last year. She was brave and made big sacrifices. She is one of the few women I have met with a clear character and courage that could shame a warrior.

She is an adult now. I don’t know her as well as I did when she worked with me, but my time with her will always be a special memory for me.
