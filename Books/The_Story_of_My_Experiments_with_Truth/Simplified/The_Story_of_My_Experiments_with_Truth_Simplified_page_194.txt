The officer had a better memory than me. He never forgot a word after seeing it once. I often found it hard to read Urdu letters. I tried really hard, but I could never catch up with the officer.

I made good progress with Tamil. There was no one to help me, but the Tamil Self-Teacher book was well written, so I didn’t need much extra help.

I wanted to keep studying after I got to India, but it was impossible. Since 1893, most of my reading was done in jail. I did improve a little in Tamil and Urdu while in jail—Tamil in South African jails and Urdu in Yeravda jail. But I never learned to speak Tamil, and what little I could read is now forgotten because I don’t practice.

I still feel that not knowing Tamil or Telugu was a big problem. The kindness that the Dravidians in South Africa showed me is a special memory. Whenever I meet a Tamil or Telugu friend, I remember the faith, hard work, and selfless sacrifice of many of their people in South Africa. Most of them couldn’t read or write, men and women alike.

The fight in South Africa was for people like them, and it was fought by people who couldn’t read or write. It was for the poor, and the poor took part fully. Not knowing their language didn’t stop me from winning the hearts of these simple, good people. They spoke broken Hindustani or English, but we still worked well together. I wanted to repay their kindness by learning Tamil and Telugu. I made some progress in Tamil, but in Telugu, which I tried to learn in India, I only got as far as the alphabet. Now I’m afraid I will never learn these languages, so I hope the Dravidians will learn Hindustani. The ones in South Africa who don’t speak English do speak Hindi or Hindustani, even if not very well. It’s only the English-speaking ones who won’t learn it, as if knowing English stops them from learning their own languages.

But I have gone off topic.
