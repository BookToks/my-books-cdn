RESULT OF THINKING DEEPLY

In 1893, when I met some Christian friends, I was very new to their ideas. They tried hard to explain Jesus’ message to me, and I listened carefully with an open mind. At that time, I naturally studied Hinduism as much as I could and also tried to understand other religions.

By 1903, things had changed a bit. Some Theosophist friends wanted me to join their group, but they also wanted to learn from me as a Hindu. Their books were full of Hindu ideas, so they thought I could help them. I told them I didn’t know much Sanskrit, hadn’t read Hindu scriptures in the original language, and only knew a little from translations. But since they believed in rebirth and past lives, they expected me to help anyway. I felt very important, like a big fish among small ones.

I started reading books about yoga with some friends. We read Swami Vivekananda's Rajayoga, M. N. Dvivedi's Rajayoga, Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, and the Bhagavad Gita together. We made a group called the Seekers' Club where we met regularly to read and learn. I already trusted the Gita and found it very interesting. Now I saw I needed to understand it better. I had one or two translations and used them to try to get the meaning of the original Sanskrit. I also decided to memorize one or two verses every day.

To do this, I used my morning washing time, which took about thirty-five minutes—fifteen for brushing my teeth and twenty for bathing. I stood while brushing my teeth, like people in the West. I put little papers with Gita verses on the wall opposite me and looked at them to help remember. This time was enough to memorize the new verses and recall the ones I had already learned. I remember memorizing thirteen chapters this way.

But later, memorizing the Gita had to stop because I got busy with other work and started creating and growing Satyagraha, which took up all my thinking time and still does even now.
