WHEN A GOVERNOR IS GOOD

While social work was going on, we were also collecting many complaints from the ryots (farmers). Thousands of these complaints were recorded, and they made a big impact. More and more ryots came forward, which made the planters very angry. They tried everything to stop my investigation.

One day, I got a letter from the Bihar Government. It said, politely, that my inquiry had lasted long enough and asked if I would now finish it and leave Bihar. The meaning was clear even though the words were polite.

I replied that the inquiry had to take time, and I wouldn’t leave Bihar until the people got some help. I told them they could end the inquiry by accepting the ryots’ complaints as true and fixing the problems, or by starting an official investigation right away because the ryots had made a strong case.

Sir Edward Gait, the Lieutenant Governor, asked me to meet him. He said he was willing to set up an inquiry and invited me to join the Committee. I found out who the other members were and talked with my team. I agreed to join only if I could still talk with my team during the inquiry, if the Government accepted that I was still working for the ryots, and if I could help the ryots decide what to do if the inquiry’s results were not good.

Sir Edward Gait agreed that was fair and announced the inquiry. Sir Frank Sly was made the Chairman of the Committee.

The Committee decided in favor of the ryots. They recommended that the planters pay back some of the money they had taken illegally and that the tinkathia system (a tax system) should be stopped by law.
