After some time, I finally met him. I was ready to be amazed by him. I had heard about the famous titles he had, like the 'Lion of Bombay' and the 'Uncrowned King of the Presidency.' But he didn’t scare me. He greeted me like a caring father meeting his grown-up son.  

We met in his room. He was with a group of friends and followers. Among them were Mr. D. E. Wacha and Mr. Cama, who I was introduced to. I already knew about Mr. Wacha. He was known as Sir Pherozeshah’s right-hand man, and Sjt. Virchand Gandhi had told me he was a great expert in statistics. Mr. Wacha said, “Gandhi, we must meet again.” These introductions took less than two minutes. Sir Pherozeshah listened to me carefully. I told him I had met Justices Ranade and Tyabji.

“Gandhi,” he said, “I see I must help you. I will call a public meeting here.” Then he told Mr. Munshi, the secretary, to set the date for the meeting. The date was fixed, and he said goodbye, asking me to come see him the day before the meeting. This talk made me feel better, and I went home happy.  

While I was in Bombay, I visited my brother-in-law, who was sick and staying there. He didn’t have much money, and my sister (his wife) couldn’t take care of him well. His illness was serious, so I offered to take him to Rajkot. He agreed, so I went home with my sister and her husband. His sickness lasted longer than I thought. I put him in my room and stayed with him all day and night. I had to stay awake some nights and even worked on my South African tasks while taking care of him. Sadly, he died, but I felt comforted that I could care for him in his last days.  

Over time, I started to really enjoy nursing people. It became a strong passion for me, so much that sometimes I ignored my work. Sometimes, I even got my wife and the whole family involved in helping care for others.
