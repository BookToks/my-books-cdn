My belief in vegetarianism grew stronger every day. Salt's book made me want to learn more about diets. I read all the books I could find about vegetarianism. One of them, Howard Williams' The Ethics of Diet, was a history of books about humane diets from long ago to now. It said that many famous thinkers and teachers, like Pythagoras and Jesus, were vegetarians. I also liked Dr. Anna Kingsford's book The Perfect Way in Diet. Dr. Allinson wrote helpful stuff about health and hygiene.

He believed in curing people by controlling their diets.

He was a vegetarian himself and told his patients to eat only vegetarian food. Reading all these books made me start trying different diets. At first, I did it mainly for my health. But later, religion became the main reason.

Meanwhile, my friend kept worrying about me. He cared about me and thought if I kept refusing to eat meat, I would become weak and not fit in with English society. When he found out I was reading about vegetarianism, he was afraid it would confuse me. He thought I might waste my life on experiments and forget my real work, becoming strange. So, he tried one last time to change me. One day, he asked me to go to the theatre with him. Before the show, we were going to eat at the Holborn Restaurant, which seemed huge and fancy to me, the first big restaurant I had been to since leaving the Victoria Hotel.

Staying at that hotel hadn’t helped much because I wasn’t really thinking clearly there. My friend planned to take me to the restaurant, probably thinking I wouldn’t ask many questions. The restaurant was crowded with many people eating, and my friend and I shared a table. The first dish was soup. I wondered what it was made of but didn’t dare ask my friend about it.
