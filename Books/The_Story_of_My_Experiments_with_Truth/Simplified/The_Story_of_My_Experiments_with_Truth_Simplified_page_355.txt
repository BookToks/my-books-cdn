Besides this job, I had to mix and give out medicine for the white soldiers. This was pretty easy for me because I had trained for a year at Dr. Booth's small hospital. This work let me meet a lot of Europeans.

We were part of a fast-moving group. Our orders were to go wherever there was danger. Most of us were mounted infantry, which means we rode horses. But when our camp moved, we had to walk carrying stretchers on our shoulders. Sometimes, we had to walk forty miles in one day.

No matter where we went, I am glad we were doing good work. We carried on our stretchers the Zulu friends who were hurt by accident, and we took care of them as nurses.
