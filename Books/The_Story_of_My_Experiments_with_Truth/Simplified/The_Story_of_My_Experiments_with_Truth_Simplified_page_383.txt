It would be useless for me, if I were a liar, to teach boys to tell the truth. A scared teacher could never make his boys brave, and someone who can’t control themselves could never teach self-control. So, I realized I had to be a good example for the boys and girls living with me. They became my teachers too, and I learned I had to be good and live honestly, at least for their sake. I can say that the strict rules I set for myself at Tolstoy Farm were mostly because of those kids.

One of them was wild, naughty, liked to lie, and often fought. One time he got very angry. I was really upset. I never punished my boys before, but this time I was angry. I tried to talk to him calmly, but he wouldn’t listen and even tried to trick me. Finally, I picked up a ruler nearby and hit his arm. I felt scared as I hit him. I think he noticed that. This was a new experience for all of them. The boy shouted and begged me to forgive him. He didn’t cry because it hurt — he was strong and could have fought back — but because he saw how sad I was to have to do that. After that, he never disobeyed me again. But I still feel sorry for using violence. I think I showed the rude, angry side of myself that day, not the kind side.

I have always been against hitting children as punishment. I remember only one time I hit one of my boys. So, I have never been sure if I was right or wrong to use the ruler. It was probably wrong because I was angry and wanted to punish him. If I had only done it because I was upset, I might have thought it was okay. But this time, my feelings were mixed.

This event made me think and helped me learn a better way to correct students. I don’t know if that way would have worked with that boy. He soon forgot what happened, and I don’t think he really changed much.
