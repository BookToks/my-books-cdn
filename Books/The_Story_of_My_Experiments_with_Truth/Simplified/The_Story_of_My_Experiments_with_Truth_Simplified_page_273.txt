I have noticed that traveling third class in 1902 was pretty much the same as traveling third class from 1915 to 1919.

I can think of only one way to fix this terrible situation – educated people should make it a point to travel third class and help change how people behave there. They should also keep bothering the railway officials by sending complaints whenever needed, never using bribes or tricks to get better treatment, and never accepting rule-breaking by anyone. I believe this would make things a lot better.

Because of a serious illness in 1918-19, I had to stop traveling third class. This was very painful and embarrassing for me, especially since people were starting to fight against the problems third class passengers faced. The struggles of poor train and ship travelers, made worse by bad habits and unfair government rules favoring foreign trade, are important issues. They should be handled by some hardworking people who can focus on fixing them full time.

But I will stop talking about third class passengers and tell you about my time in Benares. I got there in the morning. I decided to stay with a panda (a religious guide). Many Brahmans came to me as soon as I got off the train, and I picked one who seemed cleaner and better than the others. It turned out to be a good choice. There was a cow in his yard, and he gave me a room upstairs. I didn’t want to eat without first washing properly in the Ganges River, following the usual religious way.

The panda got ready for this. I had told him before that I could only give him a rupee and four annas as a tip, and he should keep that in mind while getting ready.

The panda agreed easily. He said, “Whether a pilgrim is rich or poor, the service is the same. But the tip we get depends on the pilgrim’s will and ability.”
