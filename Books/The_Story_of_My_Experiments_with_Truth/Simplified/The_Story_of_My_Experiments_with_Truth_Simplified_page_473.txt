Sir Edward Gait played a big role in making sure the Committee agreed on a report and getting the agrarian bill passed based on what the Committee said. If he hadn’t been so firm and used all his skills, the report wouldn’t have been agreed on by everyone, and the Agrarian Act wouldn’t have been passed. The planters had a lot of power and fought hard against the bill even though the report supported it. But Sir Edward Gait stayed strong until the very end and made sure the Committee’s ideas were followed.

The tinkathia system, which had been around for about 100 years, was finally ended, and with it, the planters’ control stopped. The ryots, who had always been treated badly, began to get some freedom. Also, the old belief that the stain of indigo could never be cleaned off was proven wrong.

I wanted to keep doing good work for a few more years, like building more schools and reaching villages better. The path was ready, but, as often happens, things didn’t go as planned. Fate had other plans and made me move on to work somewhere else.
