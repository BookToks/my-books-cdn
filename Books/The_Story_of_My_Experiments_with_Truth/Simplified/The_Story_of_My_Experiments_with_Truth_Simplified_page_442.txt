Changing who controlled the keys to this pilgrims' bridge was too much, even for my loyalty back then.

The Svargashram, which you get to after crossing the bridge, was a really sad place. It was just a bunch of old, rusty sheds made of metal sheets. I was told these were for sadhakas (people trying to reach spiritual goals). There weren’t many people living there at the time. The ones in the main building didn’t leave a good impression.

But my time in Hardwar turned out to be very valuable for me. It helped me a lot to decide where I wanted to live and what I wanted to do.
