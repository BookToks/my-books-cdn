THE CALM AFTER THE STORM

I hadn’t left the police station yet when, after two days, I was taken to see Mr. Escombe. Two policemen were sent to protect me, even though there was no real danger at that time.

On the day I arrived, as soon as the yellow flag was lowered, a reporter from The Natal Advertiser came to interview me. He asked me many questions, and I was able to prove that all the accusations against me were wrong. Thanks to Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, I had only given written speeches in India, and I had copies of all of them, plus my other writings. I gave all this to the reporter and showed him that I had said nothing in India that I hadn’t already said in South Africa, and often in stronger words. I also told him that I had nothing to do with bringing the passengers of the Courland and Naderi to South Africa. Many of those people had lived here for a long time, and most actually wanted to go to the Transvaal, not stay in Natal. Back then, Transvaal had better chances for making money, so most Indians preferred to go there.

This interview and my choice not to take legal action against the attackers made a big impression. The Europeans in Durban felt ashamed of what they had done. The newspapers said I was innocent and criticized the violent crowd. So, in the end, the attack was actually a good thing for me and the cause I was fighting for. It made the Indian community in South Africa more respected and helped me with my work.

After three or four days, I went back to my house and soon got back to normal life. The event also helped my career as a lawyer.

But while it raised the community’s respect, it also made people more prejudiced against us. Once it was clear that Indians could stand up and fight back, many saw us as a threat. Two new laws were introduced in the Natal government. One was meant to hurt Indian traders, and the other was to strictly limit Indian immigration.
