That Unforgettable Week! – II

So, I went to meet Commissioner Mr. Griffith. Around the stairs to his office, I saw soldiers fully armed, ready for action. The hallway was very busy. When I entered the office, I saw Mr. Bowring sitting with Mr. Griffith.

I told the Commissioner about what I had seen. He replied shortly, "I didn’t want the procession to go to the Fort because trouble was sure to happen there. Since the people wouldn’t listen, I had no choice but to order the mounted police to charge through the crowd." 

"But," I said, "you knew what would happen. The horses would hurt people. I think it wasn’t necessary to send those mounted men." 

"You can’t judge that," Mr. Griffith said. "We police officers understand better how your teaching affects the people. If we didn’t act strongly, things would get out of control. The people will disobey the law because they don’t understand the importance of peace. I believe your intentions are good, but the people won’t get them. They will just follow their natural feelings."

"That’s where I disagree," I answered. "People are not naturally violent; they want peace." We argued a lot. Finally, Mr. Griffith said, "But if you really believed your teaching didn’t work on the people, what would you do?"

"I would stop civil disobedience if I believed that," I said. 

"What do you mean? You told Mr. Bowring you would go to Punjab as soon as you were free."

"Yes, I wanted to go on the next train available."
