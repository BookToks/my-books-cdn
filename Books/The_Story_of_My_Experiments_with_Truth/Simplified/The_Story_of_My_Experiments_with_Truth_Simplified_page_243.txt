One time, the Johannesburg Indians threw a big dinner to honor him. The scarf he wore was wrinkled and needed ironing. There wasn’t enough time to send it to the laundry and get it back. So, I said I would try to iron it myself.

Gokhale said, “I trust you as a lawyer, but not as someone who does laundry.”

I asked, “What if you ruin it? Do you know how important this scarf is to me?” Then he happily told me the story behind the gift. I promised I would do a good job, got his permission, and ironed the scarf. He even gave me his approval.

After that, I didn’t care if anyone else doubted me.

Just like I stopped depending on the laundry, I also stopped relying on barbers. Everyone who goes to England learns how to shave, but almost no one learns to cut their own hair. I had to learn that too. Once, I went to an English barber in Pretoria, but he rudely refused to cut my hair. I felt hurt, but I bought clippers and cut my own hair while looking in the mirror. I did okay with the front, but messed up the back. My friends at court laughed a lot.

They said, “What happened to your hair, Gandhi? Did rats chew it?” I said, “No. The white barber wouldn’t touch my black hair, so I cut it myself, even if it looks bad.” My friends weren’t surprised.

The barber wasn’t really to blame for refusing me. He might lose customers if he served black men. We don’t even let our barbers serve people from lower castes. I faced this in South Africa many times, but I understood it was because of our own mistakes, so I didn’t get angry.

Later, my strong love for doing things myself and keeping life simple showed up in bigger ways. The idea had been planted long ago. It just needed care to grow, bloom, and bear fruit—and that happened when the right time came.
