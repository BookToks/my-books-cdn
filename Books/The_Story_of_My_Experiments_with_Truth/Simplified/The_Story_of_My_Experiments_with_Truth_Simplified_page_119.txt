Prices in Bombay have gone up a lot. I needed to be smart about business. But I was stubborn. I didn’t pay any commission and still got Mamibai’s case. It was an easy case. I charged Rs. 30 as my fee. The case would probably finish in one day.

This was my first time in the Small Causes Court. I was the lawyer for the defendant, so I had to question the other side’s witnesses. I stood up, but I felt very nervous. My head was spinning, and it felt like the whole court was spinning too. I couldn’t think of any questions to ask. The judge probably laughed, and the other lawyers must have enjoyed it. But I couldn’t see anything clearly. I sat down and told the agent I couldn’t handle the case. He should hire Patel and get my fee back. Mr. Patel was hired for Rs. 51. For him, the case was very easy.

I quickly left the Court, not knowing if my client won or lost. I was embarrassed and decided not to take any more cases until I was brave enough. I didn’t go back to Court again until I went to South Africa. It wasn’t a good reason, just that I couldn’t do it well. No one would trust me with their case if I just lost it!

But another case came to me in Bombay. It was a memorial to write. A poor Muslim man’s land was taken away in Porbandar. He came to me because I was the son of a respected man. His case seemed weak, but I agreed to write the memorial. He would pay for the printing.

I wrote the memorial and read it to friends. They liked it, which made me feel more confident that I could write memorials well, which I really could.

My work could do well if I wrote memorials for free. But that wouldn’t help me earn money. So I thought about becoming a teacher.

My English was good enough, and I wanted to teach English to high school students. This way, I could pay some of my expenses. I saw an ad in the paper: “Wanted, an English teacher to teach one hour daily.”
