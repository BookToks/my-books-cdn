I donâ€™t think of Urdu as a separate language because it uses Hindi grammar. Most of its words come from Persian and Arabic.  

If you want to learn good Urdu, you also need to learn Persian and Arabic.  

This is similar to how someone who wants to learn good Gujarati, Hindi, Bengali, or Marathi must learn Sanskrit.
