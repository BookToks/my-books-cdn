When I was sixteen, my father was very sick and had to stay in bed because of a serious wound. My mother, who had worked in our house for a long time, and I took care of him the most. I acted like a nurse by cleaning his wound, giving him medicine, and making medicine at home when needed. Every night, I rubbed his legs and only stopped when he told me to or when he fell asleep. I liked helping him and never missed doing this. After finishing my daily tasks, I split my time between school and looking after my father. I only went out for a walk in the evening if he said it was okay or if he was feeling well.

At the same time, my wife was going to have a baby. Looking back, this was embarrassing for me in two ways. First, I didn’t control myself well even though I was still a student. Second, my desires made me ignore my duties to study and to care for my parents, which was very important to me since childhood. Every night while I was rubbing my father’s legs, I was thinking about going to the bedroom, even though religion, medicine, and common sense all said it was a bad time for that. I was happy when I finished my duty and went to the bedroom after showing respect to my father.

Meanwhile, my father’s health was getting worse day by day. Different doctors had tried many treatments, including special ointments, plasters, and medicines from local healers. An English surgeon also tried to help and suggested surgery as the last option. But the family doctor didn’t want the surgery because my father was old. This doctor was famous and trusted, so everyone listened to him.

Because of that, the surgery was cancelled, and the medicines didn’t help. I feel that if the surgery had been done, the wound might have healed easily.
