The other passengers were left behind. I now understood why the Captain had warned me.

After Lamu, the next stop was Mombasa, and then Zanzibar. We stayed there a long time—eight or ten days—and then switched to another boat.

The Captain liked me a lot, but things took a bad turn. He invited an English friend and me to go out with him, and we all went ashore in his boat. I had no idea what was really going on. The Captain didn’t know I was clueless about these things either. A man took us to some women’s rooms. We each went into a room. I just stood there, feeling very embarrassed. I don’t know what the woman thought of me. When the Captain called me, I came out just like I went in. He saw I didn’t understand. At first, I felt really ashamed, but then I thought about it and felt horror instead. After that, I wasn’t ashamed anymore. I was glad I wasn’t affected by what I saw. I felt weak and sorry for myself because I didn’t have the courage to say no.

This was the third time something like this happened in my life. Many young people, who start out innocent, get pulled into bad things because they feel ashamed to refuse. I can’t say I’m proud I stayed clean. I could only be proud if I had refused to go in. I have to thank God for protecting me.

This experience made me believe in God more and helped me stop feeling the wrong kind of shame.

Since we had to stay in this port for a week, I rented a room in town and explored the area. Only Malabar can give you an idea of how lush Zanzibar is. I was amazed by the huge trees and big fruits.

The next stop was Mozambique, and from there we reached Natal near the end of May.
