As long as a person doesn’t choose to put others before themselves, they can’t really be saved. Being truly non-violent means being very humble.

Before I say goodbye for now, I ask the reader to pray with me to the God of Truth. I hope He will help me to practice non-violence in my thoughts, words, and actions.
