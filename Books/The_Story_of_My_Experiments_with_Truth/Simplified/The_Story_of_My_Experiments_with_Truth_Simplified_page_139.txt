He grabbed my arm and tried to pull me down. I held tightly to the brass rails of the coachbox, determined not to let go even if it hurt my wrist. The other passengers saw what was happening. The man was yelling at me, pulling and hitting me, but I stayed still. He was strong, and I was weak. Some passengers felt sorry for me and said, "Hey, leave him alone. Don’t hit him. He’s not doing anything wrong. If he can’t stay there, let him sit with us." 

"No way," the man shouted, but he looked a bit sad and stopped hitting me. He let go of my arm, cursed a little more, and asked the Hottentot servant sitting on the other side to move to the footboard so he could take that seat.

The passengers sat down, the whistle blew, and the coach started moving.

My heart was pounding, and I wondered if I would get to my destination safely. The man looked at me angrily now and then and pointed his finger, growling, "Watch out. When we get to Standerton, I’ll show you what I can do." I didn’t say anything and prayed to God to help me.

After dark, we reached Standerton, and I felt relieved when I saw some Indian faces. When I got off, these friends said, "We’re here to meet you and take you to Isa Sheth’s shop. We got a telegram from Dada Abdulla." I was happy, and we went to Sheth Isa Haji Sumar’s shop. The Sheth and his clerks gathered around me. I told them everything that had happened. They felt sorry and shared their own bad experiences to comfort me.

I wanted to tell the Coach Company agent about everything. So I wrote him a letter, explaining what had happened and warning him about the man’s threats. I also asked if I could sit inside with the other passengers the next morning. The agent replied: "From Standerton, we have a bigger coach with different drivers. The man you complained about won’t be there tomorrow, and you will have a seat with the other passengers."
