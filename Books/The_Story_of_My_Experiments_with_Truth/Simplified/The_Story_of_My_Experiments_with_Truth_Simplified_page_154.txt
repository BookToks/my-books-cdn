WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A 'COOLIE'

I won’t explain everything about how Indians lived in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State here. If you want to know more, you can read my book, History of Satyagraha in South Africa. But I will give a quick summary.

In the Orange Free State, Indians lost all their rights because of a special law made in 1888 or earlier. If they wanted to stay there, they could only work as waiters in hotels or do other low-paying jobs. Traders were forced to leave, with only a small amount of money given to them.

They tried to complain and ask for help, but it didn’t work.

In the Transvaal, a strict law was made in 1885 and changed a little in 1886. According to this law, all Indians had to pay a £3 tax just to enter the Transvaal. They were not allowed to own land except in certain areas set aside for them, and even then, they didn’t really own it. They were not allowed to vote either. These rules were made especially for Asians, and other laws for colored people applied to them too.

Under these laws, Indians couldn’t walk on public sidewalks and were not allowed outside after 9 p.m. without a special permit. The police didn’t always enforce this strictly for Indians. Some Indians who looked like 'Arabs' were sometimes allowed to ignore this rule, depending on the police’s mood.

I experienced these rules myself. I often went for night walks with Mr. Coates, and we usually got home after 10 o’clock. What if the police caught me? Mr. Coates worried more about this than I did. He had to give passes to his Black servants, but he couldn’t give one to me. Only a master could give a permit to a servant. Even if I wanted one and Mr. Coates wanted to help, it wouldn’t have been legal—it would have been cheating.
