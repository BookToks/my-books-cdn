Pratt, the Commissioner, was very angry when I met him. I talked to him calmly and said I was sorry about the trouble. I told him that martial law was not needed and said I was ready to help bring back peace. I asked if I could hold a public meeting at the Sabarmati Ashram. He liked the idea, and the meeting happened on Sunday, April 13. Martial law was lifted that day or the next.

At the meeting, I tried to make people understand how wrong their actions were. I said I would fast for three days to show I was sorry, and I asked others to fast for one day. I also told those who had done violent things to admit what they did.

I knew what I had to do. It was really hard for me to see the workers, who I had spent a lot of time with and helped, take part in the riots. I felt guilty too because of this.

Just like I asked the people to admit their mistakes, I also asked the Government to forgive the crimes. But neither of them agreed.

Later, Sir Ramanbhai and some other people from Ahmedabad asked me to stop Satyagraha. But I had already decided to pause Satyagraha until people learned to be peaceful. The friends were happy to hear this.

However, some others were unhappy with my decision. They thought that if I wanted peace everywhere before starting Satyagraha, then a big Satyagraha would never happen. I didn’t agree with them. If the people I worked with couldn’t be peaceful and patient, then Satyagraha was impossible. I strongly believed that leaders must be able to keep people peaceful, and I still believe that today.
