I asked, "And, what will the payment be?"  
"Not more than a year. We will pay for your first class return ticket and give you £105, all expenses paid."  

This wasn’t really going as a lawyer. It was more like going as a helper for the company.  

But I wanted to leave India somehow. I was also tempted by the chance to see a new country and have new experiences. Plus, I could send £105 to my brother to help with the household expenses.  

I accepted the offer without arguing and got ready to go to South Africa.
