The priest in charge of the Haveli was very nice to my family. So he said we could check everything and suggest any changes we wanted. There was a part of the Haveli that even he had never seen. It was where people threw trash and leaves they used as plates over the wall. Crows and kites liked to hang out there. The toilets were, of course, dirty. I didnâ€™t stay in Rajkot long enough to see which of our ideas the priest actually used.

It made me sad to see so much dirtiness in a place of worship. You would think that people would be very careful about keeping such a holy place clean and healthy. The writers of the Smritis, which I already knew about, had always stressed how important it is to be clean both inside and outside.
