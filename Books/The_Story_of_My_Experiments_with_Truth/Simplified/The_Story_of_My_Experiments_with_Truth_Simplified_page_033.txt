All my strictness came from love. I wanted my wife to be the perfect wife. I wanted her to live a pure life, learn what I learned, and think the same way I did.

I don’t know if Kasturbai wanted the same thing. She couldn’t read or write. She was simple, strong-willed, and quiet around me. She didn’t mind not knowing much, and I don’t remember her ever wanting to study like I did. So, I think only I had this goal. I loved her deeply and wanted her to love me back. But even if she didn’t, it wasn’t all bad because I loved her a lot.

I really loved her. Even when I was at school, I thought about her. I always looked forward to meeting her after school.

Being apart was really hard. I used to keep her awake late at night by talking too much. If I didn’t have a strong sense of duty, my passion might have made me sick or unhappy. But I had important work to do every day, and I couldn’t lie to anyone. That helped me avoid many problems.

As I said, Kasturbai couldn’t read or write. I wanted to teach her, but my strong feelings left me no time. Also, she didn’t want to learn, and I had to teach her at night. I couldn’t meet her in front of older people or talk to her openly because of strict rules in Kathiawad. These rules made things difficult. So, most of my attempts to teach her when we were young didn’t work. Later, when I stopped being so focused on love, I started public work and had even less time. Private tutors didn’t help much either. Now, Kasturbai can barely write simple letters or understand simple Gujarati. I’m sure that if my love hadn’t been mixed with desire, she would be educated today because I could have helped her overcome her dislike of studying.
