After getting used to the new way of life for a long time, it was maybe just as annoying for them to go back to the old way. But now I see that we feel much freer and lighter after leaving behind the fake stuff of 'civilization.'

On the same ship as us were some family members and friends.

I often saw these people and other passengers on the deck because the boat belonged to my client’s friends, so I could go anywhere I wanted.

The ship was going straight to Natal without stopping at other ports, so the trip lasted only eighteen days. But about four days before reaching Natal, a terrible storm hit us, like a warning for the real storm waiting on land. December is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and storms are common in the Southern sea then. This storm was so strong and long that everyone got scared. It was a serious moment. Everyone came together because of the danger. They forgot their differences and thought only of God — Muslims, Hindus, Christians, all of them. Some made promises to God. Even the captain prayed with the passengers. He told them that the storm was dangerous but he had been through worse ones. He said a strong ship could handle almost any weather. But people were still very upset. Every minute, they heard sounds like something was breaking or leaking. The ship rocked so much it felt like it might tip over. No one could stay on deck. "Let God decide" was what everyone said.

I think we were stuck like this for about twenty-four hours. Finally, the sky cleared, the sun came out, and the captain said the storm was over. Everyone looked happy, and as soon as the danger was gone, they stopped saying God’s name. Eating, drinking, singing, and having fun started again. The fear of dying was gone, and the serious feelings of prayer were replaced by fun and distractions.
