I was happy that they believed in me. I met Rev. Murray. I saw that many people were praying for me. I liked some of their songs; they sounded very nice.

The Convention lasted for three days. I could understand and respect how serious the people there were about their faith. But I didn’t see any reason to change my own religion. I couldn’t believe that I would only go to heaven or be saved if I became a Christian. When I honestly told some Christian friends this, they were surprised. But I couldn’t help how I felt.

My problems were deeper than that. It was hard for me to believe that Jesus was the only real son of God, and that only people who believed in Him would live forever. If God could have sons, then all of us were His sons. If Jesus was like God, or God Himself, then all people were like God and could be God too. My mind wasn’t ready to believe that Jesus died and shed his blood to take away the world’s sins. Maybe that was true in a symbolic way. Also, Christianity says only humans have souls, but I believed other living things have souls too. I could see Jesus as a brave person who sacrificed a lot and was a great teacher, but not as the most perfect man ever. His death on the cross was an important example, but I couldn’t believe there was anything magical or mysterious about it.

The good lives of Christians didn’t seem different from the good lives of people from other religions. I had seen similar changes in people’s lives in other faiths. The ideas in Christianity didn’t seem very special to me. When it came to sacrifice, I thought Hindus did even more than Christians. I couldn’t think of Christianity as the best or the greatest religion.

I talked about these thoughts with my Christian friends whenever I could, but their answers didn’t satisfy me.

So, since I couldn’t accept Christianity as perfect or the greatest religion, I also wasn’t sure Hinduism was either.
