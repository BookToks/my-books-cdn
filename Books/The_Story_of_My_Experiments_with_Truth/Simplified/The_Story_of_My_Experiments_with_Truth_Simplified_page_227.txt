Luckily, the fight for voting rights ended with a decision that no law could be made against Indians just because of their race or color. The bills mentioned before applied to everyone, but their real goal was to put more limits on the Indian people living in Natal.

These bills made my public work much busier and made the community more aware of their responsibilities. We translated the bills into Indian languages and explained them carefully so everyone could understand what they really meant. We asked the Colonial Secretary to help, but he refused, and the bills became law.

After that, public work took up most of my time. Sjt. Mansukhlal Naazar, who was already in Durban, came to live with me. Since he also worked for the community, he helped me with some of the work.

While I was away, Sheth Adamji Miyakhan did a great job. He got more people to join and raised about £1,000 for the Natal Indian Congress. The bills and protests made people wake up, so I asked for more members and money, and we raised £5,000. I wanted the Congress to have its own money so it could buy property and pay for its work using the rent.

This was my first time managing a public group. I shared my idea with my team, and they liked it. We bought property and rented it out, and the rent was enough to pay for the Congress’s expenses. The property was kept by a strong group of trustees and still exists today, but it later caused many arguments, and now the rent money is stuck in court.

These problems happened after I left South Africa, but I had already changed my mind about having permanent funds for public groups long before these issues came up.
