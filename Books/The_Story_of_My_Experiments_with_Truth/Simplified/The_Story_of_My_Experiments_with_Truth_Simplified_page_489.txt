Dr. Besant's smart Home Rule movement definitely reached the farmers, but it was the Kheda campaign that really made educated workers connect with the real lives of the peasants. They learned to understand and stand with them. They found the right kind of work to do and became more willing to make sacrifices. What Vallabhbhai realized during this campaign was a big deal. We saw how important it was during the flood help last year and the Bardoli Satyagraha this year. Public life in Gujarat got a fresh burst of energy and strength. The Patidar farmers realized how strong they really were. Everyone learned that saving themselves depended on their own ability to suffer and sacrifice. Because of the Kheda campaign, Satyagraha became deeply rooted in Gujarat.

Even though I didn't feel excited when the Satyagraha ended, the Kheda peasants were very happy. They knew what they got matched their hard work, and they had found a true and sure way to fix their problems. This knowledge was enough reason for them to celebrate.

Still, the Kheda peasants didnâ€™t completely understand the real meaning of Satyagraha, and they would learn this the hard way, as we will see in the next chapters.
