My job was going well, but it didn’t make me happy.

I kept thinking about living a simpler life and helping others in a real way. One day, a leper came to my door. I couldn’t just send him away with food, so I let him stay, cleaned his wounds, and took care of him. But I couldn’t keep doing that forever. I didn’t have the money or the strength to keep him with me all the time. So, I sent him to the Government Hospital for indentured workers.

Still, I felt uneasy. I wanted to do some kind of lasting help for people. Dr. Booth was in charge of St. Aidan’s Mission. He was kind and treated patients for free. Thanks to a donation from Parsi Rustomji, a small charity hospital was opened where Dr. Booth worked. I really wanted to help as a nurse there. Giving out medicine took one or two hours each day, so I decided to take that time from my office work to help in the hospital’s pharmacy.

Most of my job was paperwork, like handling legal stuff and small cases, which Mr. Khan, who lived with me, could take care of if I was away. So, I found time to work at the hospital every morning for two hours, including travel time. This work made me feel calm. I would ask patients about their problems, tell the doctor, and give out the medicines. I got to meet many suffering Indians, mostly indentured Tamil, Telugu, or North Indian men.

This experience helped me a lot when the Boer War started, and I offered to nurse sick and injured soldiers.

I was also always thinking about how to raise children well.
