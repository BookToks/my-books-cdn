BALASUNDARAM The heart’s true and pure wish always comes true. I have seen this happen many times in my life. I have always wanted to help poor people, and this wish has always brought me close to them and helped me understand their lives.

Even though the Natal Indian Congress had members who were born in the colony and people with office jobs, the poor workers and indentured laborers were still not part of it. They couldn’t join because they couldn’t afford to pay the fees. The Congress had to earn their trust by helping them.

One day, an opportunity came when neither the Congress nor I was fully ready. I had only been practicing for three or four months, and the Congress was still new. A Tamil man came to me, wearing old, torn clothes, holding his headgear in his hand. Two of his front teeth were broken, and his mouth was bleeding. He was shaking and crying. He had been badly beaten by his master.

My clerk, who was also Tamil, told me about him. His name was Balasundaram. He was working as an indentured laborer for a well-known European in Durban. His master got angry and lost control, hitting Balasundaram hard and breaking his teeth.

I sent Balasundaram to a doctor. At that time, only white doctors were available. I wanted a doctor’s note about his injuries. After getting the certificate, I took Balasundaram to the magistrate and gave him the written statement. The magistrate was very upset and sent a summons to the employer.

I didn’t want the employer to be punished. I just wanted Balasundaram to be free from him. I learned about the laws for indentured laborers.

If a normal servant left without notice, the master could sue them in civil court. But the rules were very different for indentured laborers.
