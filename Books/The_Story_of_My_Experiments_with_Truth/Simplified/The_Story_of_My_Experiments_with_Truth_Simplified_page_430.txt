I think the famous school didn’t lose anything by trying the experiment for a short time, and some of what they learned definitely helped the teachers.

I planned to stay at Shantiniketan for a while, but things didn’t go as I hoped. I had only been there a week when I got a telegram from Poona telling me that Gokhale had died. Everyone at Shantiniketan was very sad. Many people came to me to share their sympathy. A special meeting was held in the Ashram temple to honor the loss. It was a serious and sad event. That same day, I left for Poona with my wife and Maganlal. Everyone else stayed behind at Shantiniketan.

Andrews went with me as far as Burdwan. He asked, “Do you think there will be a time for Satyagraha in India? And if yes, do you know when?” I said, “It’s hard to say. For one year, I’m not supposed to do anything. Gokhale made me promise to travel around India to learn more and not to share my opinions about public issues until that year is over. Even after that, I won’t rush to speak out. So, I don’t think Satyagraha will happen for about five years.” I should add that Gokhale used to laugh at some of my ideas in Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule and said, “After you spend a year in India, your views will change.”
