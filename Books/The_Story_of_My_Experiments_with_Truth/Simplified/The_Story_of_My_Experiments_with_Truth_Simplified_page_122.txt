The matter had gone to the Political Agent, who did not like my brother. I knew this officer from when I was in England, and he had been somewhat friendly to me. My brother thought I should use that friendship to say good things about him and try to change the Political Agent’s mind. I did not like this idea at all. I felt it was wrong to use a small connection from England to help. If my brother was really guilty, my recommendation wouldn’t help. If he was innocent, he should write a formal petition and trust that the truth would come out.

My brother didn’t like what I said. “You don’t know Kathiawad,” he said, “and you don’t understand how the world works. Only influence matters here. You’re my brother, so you should do your duty and speak up for me to the officer you know.” I couldn’t say no, so I went to see the officer even though I didn’t want to. I knew I had no right to ask for this favor and I felt like I was losing my self-respect. But I asked for a meeting, and he agreed.

I reminded him we had met before, but I quickly saw that Kathiawad was very different from England. An officer on leave was not the same as an officer working there. The Political Agent remembered our meeting but seemed uncomfortable. It was like he was saying, “You haven’t come here to misuse that connection, have you?” Still, I explained my brother’s case.

The officer was impatient. “Your brother is a troublemaker. I don’t want to hear more from you. If your brother has something to say, he should apply in the right way.” That answer was harsh but maybe fair. Still, I kept talking. The officer stood up and said, “You must leave now.” “Please listen to me,” I said. That made him angrier. He called his assistant and told him to show me out. The assistant came in, put his hands on my shoulders, and pushed me out.

The officer and the assistant left, and I walked away feeling angry and upset.
