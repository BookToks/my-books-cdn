I immediately wrote and sent a note saying: "You have insulted me. Your helper attacked me. If you don’t fix this, I will take action against you." Soon, I got an answer through his messenger: "You were rude to me. I told you to leave, but you didn’t. I had no choice but to tell my helper to show you the door. Even after he asked you to leave, you stayed. So he had to use some force to get you out. You can do whatever you want now."

Feeling sad, I went home and told my brother everything. He felt bad but didn’t know how to help me. He talked to his lawyer friends because I didn’t know how to deal with the sahib. At that time, Sir Pherozeshah Mehta was in Rajkot for a case. But I was just a junior lawyer and didn’t think I could meet him. So I sent him my papers through the lawyer who hired him and asked for advice.

He said, "Tell Gandhi, many lawyers have gone through this. He is new from England and quick to anger. He doesn’t know British officers well. If he wants to do well and have an easy life here, he should tear up the note and accept the insult. He won’t gain anything by fighting the sahib and might even ruin himself. Tell him he still has a lot to learn about life."

His advice was hard to hear, but I had to accept it. I kept the insult to myself but learned from it. I promised myself, "I will never put myself in such a bad spot again, and I won’t misuse friendship like this." Since then, I have stuck to that promise. This hard experience changed my life.
