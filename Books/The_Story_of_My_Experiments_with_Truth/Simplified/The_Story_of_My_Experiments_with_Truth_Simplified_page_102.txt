I had heard a lot about you, so I thought I should come and thank you for the good work you did for the strikers. I usually visit wise people around the world, and that’s why I came to see you. This is what he said in Gujarati, and I translated it.

"I’m happy you came. I hope you enjoy your time in London and meet many people here. God bless you." After saying this, the Cardinal stood up and said goodbye.

One time, Narayan Hemchandra came to my place wearing just a shirt and dhoti. The new landlady didn’t know him, so when she saw him, she got scared and ran to me saying, "A kind of crazy person wants to see you." I went to the door and was surprised to see Narayan Hemchandra. I was shocked, but he just smiled like usual.

I asked, "Did the kids on the street bother you?" He said, "They chased me, but I didn’t mind, and they soon stopped."

Narayan Hemchandra stayed in London for a few months, then went to Paris. He started learning French and translating French books. I knew enough French to check his work, so he gave me his translations to read. They weren’t just translations, they were the main ideas of the books.

In the end, he decided to visit America. It was really hard for him to get a ticket for the ship. While in the U.S., he got in trouble for "being indecently dressed" because he wore a shirt and dhoti in public. I remember he was let go without punishment.
