We decided to have these meetings, as far as I can remember, once a week or maybe once a month. They happened pretty regularly, and during these meetings, people shared their ideas freely. Because of this, I got to know every Indian in Pretoria and learned about their situations.

This made me want to meet the British Agent in Pretoria, Mr. Jacobus de Wet. He cared about the Indians but didn’t have much power.

Still, he promised to help as much as he could and told me I could visit him anytime.

I also contacted the railway officials and told them that, even by their own rules, the way Indians were treated when traveling was unfair. They replied that Indians dressed “properly” could get first and second class tickets. But this wasn’t really helpful because the Station Master decided what “properly dressed” meant.

The British Agent showed me some papers about Indian issues. Tyeb Sheth had also given me similar papers. From these, I learned how badly Indians were forced to leave the Orange Free State.

In short, my time in Pretoria helped me understand the social, economic, and political problems Indians faced in the Transvaal and Orange Free State. I didn’t know this knowledge would be so useful later. I had planned to go back home by the end of the year, or even sooner if the case finished early.

But things didn’t turn out that way.
