Why did I stop them from reaching their goals? Why did I get in the way of them finishing school and picking their own jobs?

I don’t think these questions really matter. I’ve met many students. I’ve tried, myself or through others, to push my own ideas about education on kids and have seen what happened. I know some young men about the same age as my sons. I don’t think they are any better than my sons, or that my sons have a lot to learn from them.

But what really matters is what will happen in the future. I’m talking about this so people who study history can understand the difference between learning at home with rules and learning at school, and also how changes parents make affect their kids. This chapter also wants to show what happens to someone who really tries to find the truth, and what it takes to fight for freedom. If I didn’t care about self-respect and had only wanted my kids to get an education better than others, I would have taken away the lesson about freedom and respect that I gave them, even though it cost their schooling.

And if you have to choose between freedom and education, who wouldn’t say freedom is way more important?

The young people I called out in 1920 from those places of control – their schools and colleges – and told it was better to stay uneducated and do hard work for freedom than to get a book education while being controlled, can probably now understand where I was coming from.
