EXPERIMENTS IN EARTH AND WATER TREATMENT

As my life became simpler, I started to dislike taking medicines more and more. When I was in Durban, I was weak and had painful joint inflammation. Dr. P. J. Mehta visited me and gave me treatment, and I got better. After that, until I went back to India, I don’t remember being very sick.

But when I was in Johannesburg, I often had constipation and headaches. I stayed okay by using laxatives sometimes and eating a balanced diet. Still, I didn’t feel fully healthy, and I kept wondering when I would stop needing those laxative medicines.

Around this time, I read about a group in Manchester called the ‘No Breakfast Association.’ They said English people ate too much and too often, and their doctor bills were high because of eating late at night. They suggested at least skipping breakfast to feel better. Even though this didn’t completely fit me, I thought it partly did. I ate three big meals a day plus afternoon tea. I wasn’t a light eater and liked many vegetarian foods without spices. I rarely got up before six or seven in the morning. So, I thought that if I stopped eating breakfast, my headaches might go away. I tried it. The first few days were tough, but then my headaches disappeared. I realized I was eating more than I needed.

But skipping breakfast did not stop my constipation. I tried Kuhne’s hipbaths, which helped a little but didn’t fix it. Meanwhile, a German friend or someone from a vegetarian restaurant gave me a book called Just’s Return of Nature. In the book, I read about earth treatment. The author also said fresh fruit and nuts were the natural foods for people. I didn’t start eating only fruit right away, but I did begin trying earth treatment, and it gave me amazing results.
