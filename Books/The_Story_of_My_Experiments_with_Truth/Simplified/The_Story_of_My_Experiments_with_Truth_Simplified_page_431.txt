At Burdwan, we saw how hard it is for a third class passenger just to get a ticket. They told me third class tickets aren’t sold too early. I went to the Station Master, but that was hard too. Someone kindly showed me where he was, and I explained our problem. He gave me the same answer. When the booking window opened, I tried to buy the tickets. But it wasn’t easy. Stronger passengers pushed me out. I was one of the last in the crowd to get a ticket.

When the train came, getting on was another problem. Passengers inside and outside the train shouted and pushed each other. We ran along the platform, but everywhere I was told, “No room here.” I asked the guard for help. He said, “Try to get in somewhere or take the next train.” I told him I had important business, but he didn’t listen. I felt upset. I told Maganlal to get on wherever he could, and I got into a better class compartment with my wife. The guard saw us.

At Asansol station, the guard came to charge us extra money. I said, “It was your job to find us a seat. We couldn’t get one, so we sat here. If you can find us room in third class, we will move there.” The guard said, “Don’t argue with me. You must pay extra or get off.” I wanted to reach Poona badly, so I paid the extra fare. But I felt this was unfair.

In the morning, we reached Mogalsarai. Maganlal had found a seat in third class, so I moved there too. I told the ticket examiner everything and asked him to give me a paper saying I had moved to the third class compartment at Mogalsarai.
