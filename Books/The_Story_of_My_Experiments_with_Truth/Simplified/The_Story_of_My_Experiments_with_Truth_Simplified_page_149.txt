One time, I was introduced to a family who belonged to the Plymouth Brethren, a Christian group.

Many of the people Mr. Coates introduced me to were good and seemed to really respect God. But when I met this family, one of the Plymouth Brethren challenged me with an argument I wasn’t ready for.

He said, “You can’t understand how beautiful our religion is. From what you say, it sounds like you’re always thinking about your mistakes, trying to fix them and say sorry. How can doing this over and over ever save you? You’ll never find peace. You admit we’re all sinners, but look at how perfect our belief is. Trying to improve and make up for sin doesn’t work. But we still need to be saved.

How do we deal with the weight of sin? We have to give it to Jesus. He is the only sinless Son of God. His word says that anyone who believes in Him will live forever. That’s God’s mercy. When we believe Jesus paid for our sins, our own sins don’t trap us. We will sin because it’s impossible to live without sin in this world. That’s why Jesus suffered and fixed all of humanity’s sins. Only those who accept His gift can have true peace. Think about how restless your life is and how peaceful ours is.”

His argument didn’t convince me at all. I said, “If this is what all Christians believe, I can’t accept it. I’m not just trying to be saved from the results of my sin. I want to be saved from sin itself, or even from just thinking about sin. Until I reach that, I’m okay with feeling restless.”

The Plymouth Brother answered, “I promise you, your way won’t work. Think again about what I said.” And he kept his word.
