He spoke to me very seriously about what I owed him. He said I shouldn’t think I was smarter than our father. I had to support the family just like he did. I told him that I was doing exactly what our father had done. If we thought of “family” in a slightly bigger way, my choice would make more sense.

My brother gave up on me and almost stopped talking to me. I felt very sad, but I thought it was worse to stop doing what I believed was right, so I chose the smaller sadness. Still, I cared about him just as much as before. His deep love for me was really why he was so upset. He didn’t want my money so much as he wanted me to behave well with the family. Near the end of his life, though, he understood my side. When he was almost dying, he realized I had been right and wrote me a very emotional letter. He said sorry to me, even though usually a father doesn’t apologize to his son. He asked me to take care of his sons and raise them how I thought best, and said he was eager to see me. He sent a message that he wanted to come to South Africa, and I sent one back saying he could. But it didn’t happen. He died before he could come.

His sons grew up with the old way of thinking and didn’t change. I couldn’t bring them closer to me. It wasn’t their fault. Who can say “stop” to the natural way they are? Who can erase the feelings and habits they are born with? It’s useless to expect children to always follow the same path as their parents.

This story shows, at least a little, how big and hard the job of being a parent really is.
