THE ZULU 'REBELLION'

Even after I thought I had settled down in Johannesburg, my life was not going to be peaceful. Just when I felt calm, something unexpected happened. The newspapers reported that the Zulu 'rebellion' had started in Natal. I didn’t hate the Zulus because they hadn’t hurt any Indians. I wasn’t even sure if the 'rebellion' was real. But I believed the British Empire was there to help the world. Because of this, I didn’t want anything bad to happen to the Empire. Whether the 'rebellion' was right or wrong didn’t change my decision. Natal had a Volunteer Defence Force, and they could recruit more men. I read that this force was already called up to stop the 'rebellion.'

I saw myself as a citizen of Natal because I was closely connected to it. So I wrote to the Governor, saying I was ready to create an Indian Ambulance Corps if needed. He quickly accepted my offer.

I didn’t expect such a fast answer. Luckily, I had already made all the plans before writing the letter. If my offer was accepted, I decided to close my home in Johannesburg. Polak was going to have a smaller house, and my wife would move to Phoenix. She agreed with this plan. I don’t remember her ever stopping me in decisions like this. As soon as I got the Governor’s reply, I told my landlord I would leave in a month, sent some of my things to Phoenix, and left some with Polak.

I went to Durban and asked men to join. We didn’t need a big group.

There were twenty-four of us. Besides me, four were Gujaratis.

The rest were former indentured workers from South India, except one who was a free Pathan.

To give me a rank and help with the work, the Chief Medical Officer made me a temporary Sergeant Major. Three men I chose became sergeants, and one became a corporal.
