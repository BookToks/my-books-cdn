Taking the vow made me feel really excited. My imagination ran wild, showing me endless ways I could help others.

While I was busy working hard both physically and mentally, we heard that the rebellion was almost over and that we would be let go soon. A day or two later, we were discharged and a few days after that, we returned home.

Not long after, I got a letter from the Governor thanking the Ambulance Corps for their service.

When I got back to Phoenix, I talked eagerly about brahmacharya with Chhaganlal, Maganlal, West, and others. They liked the idea and agreed that taking the vow was important, but they also pointed out that it would be really hard. Some of them tried their best to follow it, and I know some actually succeeded.

I also decided to take the vow to practice brahmacharya for life. I have to admit, I didn’t fully understand how big and tough this promise was at first. Even now, it’s still a challenge for me. I’m realizing more and more how important this vow is. Life without brahmacharya seems dull and like that of an animal. Animals don’t know self-control. People are different because they can control themselves. What once seemed like exaggerated praise of brahmacharya in our religious books now makes complete sense to me based on my experience.

I learned that brahmacharya, which is very powerful, is not easy at all. It’s not just about controlling the body. It starts with controlling your actions, but it doesn’t stop there. True brahmacharya means not even having impure thoughts. A real brahmachari would never even think about satisfying physical desires, and until someone reaches that level, they still have a long way to go.

For me, even following the basic rules of brahmacharya has been really hard.
