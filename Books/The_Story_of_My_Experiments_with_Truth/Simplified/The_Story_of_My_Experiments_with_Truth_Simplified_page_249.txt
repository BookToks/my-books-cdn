When I finished my war duty, I felt that my work should be in India, not South Africa. It wasn’t that there was nothing to do in South Africa, but I worried that my main job might just become about making money. My friends at home also wanted me to come back, and I believed I could help more in India. Besides, there were others like Mr. Khan and Mansukhlal Naazar to take care of things in South Africa. So, I asked my co-workers to let me go. After a lot of trouble, they agreed but only if I promised to return to South Africa within a year if the community needed me. It was a tough condition, but because I loved the community, I accepted it.

Mirabai once said, “The Lord has bound me with the cotton-thread of love; I am His bondslave.” For me, the love tying me to the community was just as strong. The people’s wishes felt like God’s voice, and I couldn’t ignore my friends’ wishes. So, I agreed to their condition and got permission to leave.

At that time, I was closely connected only with Natal. The Indian people there showed me so much love. Farewell meetings were held everywhere, and I was given expensive gifts.

I had received gifts before when I returned to India in 1899, but this farewell was more than I expected. The gifts included gold and silver items, and even some expensive diamonds.

I wondered if I had the right to accept all these gifts. How could I tell myself I was helping the community without pay if I accepted them? Most of the gifts, except a few from my clients, were given because of my service to the community. I couldn’t separate my clients from my co-workers because the clients also supported my public work.
