Dr. Mehta looked a bit angry at what I was doing and stopped me. But it was already too late. This incident was a warning for me. It was my first lesson in European manners, and Dr. Mehta explained it to me with a bit of humor. "Don’t touch other people’s things," he said. "Don’t ask a lot of questions when you first meet someone like we do in India. Don’t talk loudly. And don’t call people ‘sir’ like we do in India; only servants call their bosses that way." He told me many other things too. He also said living in a hotel was very expensive and suggested I live with a private family instead. We decided to think about it more on Monday.

Sjt. Mazmudar and I found staying in the hotel very hard. It was also very costly. Luckily, a Sindhi man from Malta, who was friends with Sjt. Mazmudar and knew London well, offered to find rooms for us. We said yes, and on Monday, after we got our bags, we paid the hotel bill and went to the rooms the Sindhi friend had rented for us. I remember my hotel bill was £3, which shocked me.

Even though I paid a lot, I barely ate anything! I didn’t like the food. When I asked for something else, I had to pay for both. So, I mostly ate the food I had brought from Bombay.

I felt very uncomfortable even in the new rooms. I kept thinking about my home and country. I missed my mother’s love a lot. At night, I cried, and I couldn’t sleep because I was full of sad memories. I couldn’t share my sadness with anyone. Even if I could, I didn’t think it would help.

Everything was strange — the people, their habits, and their homes. I didn’t know English manners and had to be careful all the time. On top of that, I was a vegetarian, which made things harder.

Even the food I could eat tasted bad and boring. I felt stuck between two bad choices. I didn’t like England, but going back to India was not an option.
