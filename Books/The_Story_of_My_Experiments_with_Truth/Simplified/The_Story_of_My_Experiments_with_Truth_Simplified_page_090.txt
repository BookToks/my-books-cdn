I couldn’t start a conversation or even joke around. But she helped me get comfortable. I started to learn, and over time, I looked forward to every Sunday and began to enjoy talking with my young friend.

The old lady kept getting more involved every day. She cared about our meetings. Maybe she had her own plans for us.

I was confused. “I wish I had told her I was married!” I thought. “Then she wouldn’t have expected us to get engaged. But it’s never too late to be honest. If I tell her the truth, I might avoid more trouble.” With these thoughts, I wrote her a letter, saying something like this:

“Since we met at Brighton, you have been very kind to me. You took care of me like a mother does for her son. You also want me to get married, so you introduced me to young ladies. Before things go any further, I must tell you the truth. I should have said from the start that I am married. I knew Indian students in England often hid this fact, so I did the same. But now I see I was wrong. I was married when I was very young, and I have a son. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier, but I’m glad I have the courage to speak honestly now. Will you forgive me?

I promise I have not acted badly with the young lady you introduced me to. I knew my limits. Since you didn’t know I was married, you hoped we would get engaged. To stop things from going any further, I had to tell you the truth.

If after this you think I was unworthy of your kindness, I will understand. You have been very kind to me, and I am forever grateful. But if you still want to treat me well, I will work hard to deserve it and be happy to accept your kindness.”

The reader should know that I couldn’t have written this letter quickly or without thinking.
