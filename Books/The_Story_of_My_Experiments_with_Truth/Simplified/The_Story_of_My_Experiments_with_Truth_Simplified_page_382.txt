TRAINING OF THE SPIRIT

Teaching the boys about their spirit was much harder than teaching them about their bodies or minds. I didn’t rely much on religious books for this. I thought every student should know the basics of their own religion and have a general idea about their holy books, so I made sure they learned that. But to me, that was more like learning facts, which is part of training the mind.

Before I started teaching the kids at Tolstoy Farm, I already knew that training the spirit was something different. Growing the spirit means building a good character and helping someone understand God and themselves. I believed this was very important for young people. Without training the spirit, all other learning is useless, and maybe even harmful.

Some people believe that understanding yourself deeply can only happen late in life, after giving up everything. But we know that waiting until old age for this often just leads to feeling weak and helpless. I remember thinking this even when I was teaching in 1911-12, even if I didn’t say it exactly like this back then.

So, how did I teach the spirit? I had the children memorize and say hymns and read from books about being good. But I wasn’t happy with just that. When I spent more time with them, I realized you can’t teach the spirit from books alone. Just like you need to do exercises to train your body, and practice to train your mind, you need to practice living to train your spirit. And this depends completely on the teacher’s life and character. The teacher always has to act carefully, whether the boys are watching or not.

Even a teacher far away can still influence the spirit of their students by the way they live.
