You know how I’m connected to your father, so you should listen to what I say.  
“I know about that,” I replied. “You’re older than me, but I can’t change my mind about going to England. My father’s friend, a smart Brahman, says it’s okay for me to go. My mom and brother also said yes.”  
“But what about the rules of our caste?”  
“I really can’t help it. I don’t think the caste should control this.”  

This made the Sheth angry. He cursed me, but I didn’t react. Then he gave his order: “From today, this boy is outcast. Anyone who helps him or sees him off at the dock will have to pay a fine of one rupee four annas.”  

His order didn’t bother me, and I said goodbye. But I wondered how my brother would feel. Luckily, he stayed strong and wrote to say I had his permission to go, no matter what the Sheth said.  

This made me even more eager to leave. What if they pressured my brother? What if something unexpected happened? While I was worrying, I heard a lawyer from Junagadh was going to England on a boat leaving September 4th. I met the friends my brother trusted, and they agreed I shouldn’t miss this chance to travel with them. There was no time to waste.  

I sent a message to my brother asking for permission, and he said yes. I then asked my brother-in-law for money, but he said no because of the Sheth’s order and not wanting to lose caste. So, I asked a family friend to lend me money for the trip and other costs, promising to pay him back from my brother. The friend kindly said yes and encouraged me. I was very grateful.  

With some of the money, I bought my ticket right away.
