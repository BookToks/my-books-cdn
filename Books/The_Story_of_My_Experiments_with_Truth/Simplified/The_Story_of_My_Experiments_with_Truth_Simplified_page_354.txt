We also got our uniforms from the Government. Our group was active for almost six weeks. When we arrived at the place of the 'rebellion,' I saw that there was nothing really like a rebellion. There was no fight or resistance to see. The reason people called it a rebellion was because a Zulu chief told his people not to pay a new tax, and he had hurt a sergeant who came to collect the tax.

Anyway, I felt sorry for the Zulus, and I was happy when I got to headquarters and heard that our main job was to care for the wounded Zulus. The Medical Officer in charge welcomed us. He said white people didn’t want to take care of the wounded Zulus, their wounds were getting worse, and he didn’t know what to do. He was very glad we came and gave us bandages, disinfectants, and took us to the makeshift hospital. The Zulus were happy to see us. The white soldiers would look through the railings that separated us and tried to stop us from helping the wounded. When we didn’t listen, they got angry and yelled horrible things at the Zulus.

Over time, I got closer to these soldiers, and they stopped bothering us. Some of the leaders were Col. Sparks and Col. Wylie, who didn’t like me back in 1896. They were surprised by how I acted and even thanked me. They introduced me to General Mackenzie.

Don’t think these were professional soldiers. Col. Wylie was a well-known lawyer in Durban. Col. Sparks owned a butcher’s shop there. General Mackenzie was a famous farmer in Natal. All of them were volunteers who had military training and experience.

The people we took care of weren’t hurt in battle. Some were prisoners suspected of being rebels. The General had ordered them to be whipped. The whipping caused bad sores that got infected because no one treated them. The others were Zulu friends. Even though they had badges to show they were not enemies, soldiers accidentally shot them.
