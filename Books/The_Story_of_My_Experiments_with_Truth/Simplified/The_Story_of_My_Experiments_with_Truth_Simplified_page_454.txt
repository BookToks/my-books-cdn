I didn’t draw water from the well while the servants were using it because I was afraid that drops from my bucket might mix with theirs. The servants didn’t know what caste I belonged to. Rajkumar told me to use the indoor toilet, but the servant quickly sent me to the outdoor one.  

None of this surprised or upset me because I was used to these kinds of things. The servants were just doing what they thought Rajendra Babu wanted them to do.  

These interesting experiences made me appreciate Rajkumar Shukla more and helped me understand him better. I realized that Rajkumar Shukla couldn’t guide me, so I needed to take control myself.
