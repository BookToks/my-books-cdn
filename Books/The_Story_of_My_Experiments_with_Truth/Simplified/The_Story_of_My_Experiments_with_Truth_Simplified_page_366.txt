I told him that his wife was too weak to be moved. She couldn’t handle any kind of rough treatment. I wouldn’t be surprised if she died on the way. But if he really wanted to go, he could. If he didn’t give her beef tea, I wouldn’t risk keeping her in my house even for one day. So, we decided to leave immediately.

It was drizzling, and the station was quite far. We had to take a train from Durban to Phoenix, then travel about two and a half miles by road to reach our Settlement. I knew it was very risky, but I trusted God and went ahead with the plan. I sent a messenger ahead to Phoenix to tell West to meet us at the station with a hammock, some hot milk, hot water, and six men to carry Kasturbai in the hammock. I got a rickshaw to take her to the next train, put her in it even though she was in bad shape, and started moving.

Kasturbai didn’t need cheering up. Instead, she comforted me, saying, “Nothing will happen to me. Don’t worry.” She was just skin and bones because she hadn’t eaten for days. The station platform was very big, and since the rickshaw couldn’t go inside, I had to carry her in my arms for quite a distance to reach the train. We put her in the compartment. From Phoenix, we carried her in the hammock, and slowly she started getting better with water-based treatment.

A few days after we reached Phoenix, a Swami came to see us. He had heard that we had refused the doctor’s advice strongly and came to talk to us kindly. My second and third sons, Manilal and Ramdas, were there when the Swami visited. He talked about how it was okay to eat meat according to religious rules, quoting from Manu. I didn’t like that he argued in front of my wife, but I let him because I wanted to be polite. I already knew those verses from the Manusmriti and didn’t need them to believe what I did. I also knew some people thought those verses were added later. But even if they were real, I believed in vegetarianism for reasons beyond religion, and Kasturbai’s faith in it was strong.
