THE BOMBAY MEETING

The day after my brother-in-law died, I had to go to Bombay for a public meeting. I didn’t have much time to prepare my speech. I was very tired after staying awake for days and nights, and my voice was weak. Still, I went to Bombay trusting God. I never thought about writing my speech down.

The day before the meeting, I went to Sir Pherozeshah’s office at 5 p.m., like he told me.

“Is your speech ready, Gandhi?” he asked.

“No, sir,” I said, feeling scared. “I plan to speak without notes.”

“That won’t work in Bombay,” he said. “You need to write your speech and have it printed by tomorrow morning. Can you do that?” I felt nervous but said I would try.

“Okay, when should Mr. Munshi come to get your speech?” he asked.

“At eleven o’clock tonight,” I said.

The next day at the meeting, I understood why Sir Pherozeshah gave that advice. The meeting was in the Sir Cowasji Jehangir Institute hall. I had heard that when Sir Pherozeshah Mehta spoke, the hall was always full, mostly with students eager to listen. This was my first experience like that. I saw my voice could only be heard by a few people. I was shaking when I started reading my speech. Sir Pherozeshah kept telling me to speak louder. But instead of helping, I think it made my voice even weaker.

My old friend Keshavrao Deshpande helped me out. I gave him my speech. He had the perfect voice for it. But the audience didn’t want to listen. They kept shouting “Wacha,” “Wacha.” So Mr. Wacha stood up and read the speech instead. It worked really well.
