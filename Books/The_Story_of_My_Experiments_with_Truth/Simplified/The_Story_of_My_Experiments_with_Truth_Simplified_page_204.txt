THE BOMBAY MEETING On the very day after my brother-in-law's death I had to go to Bombay for the public meeting. There had hardly been time for me to think out my speech. I was feeling exhausted after days and nights of anxious vigil, and my voice had become husky. However, I went to Bombay trusting entirely to God. I had never dreamt of writing out my speech.
 
 In accordance with Sir Pherozeshah's instructions I reported myself at his office at 5 p.m. on the eve of the meeting.
 
 'Is your speech ready, Gandhi?' he asked.
 
 'No, sir,' said I, trembling with fear, 'I think of speaking extempore.' 'That will not do in Bombay. Reporting here is bad, and if we would benefit by this meeting, you should write out your speech, and it should be printed before daybreak tomorrow. I hope you can manage this?' I felt rather nervous, but I said I would try.
 
 'Then, tell me, what time Mr. Munshi should come to you for the manuscript?' 'Eleven o'clock tonight,' said I.
 
 On going to the meeting the next day, I saw the wisdom of Sir Pherozeshah's advice. The meeting was held in the hall of the Sir Cowasji Jehangir Institute. I had heard that when Sir Pherozeshah Mehta addressed meetings the hall was always packed, – chiefly by the students intent on hearing him, – leaving not an inch of room. This was the first meeting of the kind in my experience. I saw that my voice could reach only a few. I was trembling as I began to read my speech. Sir Pherozeshah cheered me up continually by asking me to speak louder and louder. I have a feeling that, far from encouraging me, it made my voice sink lower and lower.
 
 My old friend Sjt. Keshavrao Deshpande came to my rescue. I handed my speech to him. His was just the proper voice. But the audience refused to listen. The hall rang with the cries of 'Wacha,' 'Wacha.' So Mr. Wacha stood up www.mkgandhi.org Page 203 An Autobiography or My Experiments with Truth and read the speech, with wonderful results.
