There were still two days before the Congress meeting started. I decided to help out at the Congress office to get some experience. So, right after I finished washing up when I got to Calcutta, I went straight to the Congress office.

Babu Bhupendranath Basu and Sjt. Ghosal were the secretaries. I went to Bhupenbabu and offered to help. He looked at me and said, "I don’t have any work right now, but maybe Ghosalbabu has something for you. Please go to him." So, I went to Ghosal. He looked me over and smiled, saying, "I can only give you clerical work. Will you do it?" I said, "Of course. I’m here to do anything I can." He replied, "That’s the right attitude, young man." Then, talking to the volunteers around him, he said, "Did you hear what this young man said?" Then, back to me, he said, "Here’s a big pile of letters to sort through. Take that chair and start. Lots of people come to see me. What should I do? Meet them all, or answer these letters? I have no clerks to help. Most letters don’t have anything important, but you please check them. Reply to the ones that deserve it, and send the important ones to me." I was really happy he trusted me like that.

Sjt. Ghosal didn’t know me when he gave me the work. He only asked about me later.

I found the work easy — sorting through all those letters. I finished quickly, and Sjt. Ghosal was very happy. He liked to talk a lot and would chat for hours. When he learned about my background, he felt sorry for giving me clerical work. But I told him, "Please don’t worry."
