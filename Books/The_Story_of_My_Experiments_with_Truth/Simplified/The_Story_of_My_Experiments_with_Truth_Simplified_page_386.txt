I don’t think my sons were harmed by the experiment. In fact, I believe they gained something from it. If they had any feeling of being better than others, that disappeared, and they learned to get along with all kinds of kids. They were challenged and taught discipline.

This and other experiments have shown me that if good kids are taught together with bad ones and spend time with them, they won’t lose anything, as long as their parents and guardians watch over them carefully.

Kids who are protected too much are not always safe from bad influences or temptation. However, when boys and girls from different backgrounds are taught and kept together, parents and teachers face a big challenge. They have to stay alert all the time.
