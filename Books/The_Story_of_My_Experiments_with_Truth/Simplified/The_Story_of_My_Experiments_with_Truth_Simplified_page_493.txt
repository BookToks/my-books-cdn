RECRUITING CAMPAIGN

So, I went to the conference. The Viceroy really wanted me to support the recruiting resolution. I asked if I could speak in Hindi-Hindustani.

The Viceroy agreed but also suggested I speak in English. I didn’t have a full speech prepared. I only said one sentence: "With a full sense of my responsibility I beg to support the resolution." Many people congratulated me for speaking in Hindustani. They said it was the first time in living memory that anyone spoke Hindustani at such a meeting. 

Their congratulations and the fact that I was the first to speak Hindustani at a Viceregal meeting made me feel bad about my country. I felt like shrinking inside. It was sad that the country’s own language was not allowed at meetings held in the country, for work related to the country, and that just one person speaking Hindustani was a big deal! Moments like this remind me how low we have fallen.

The one sentence I said at the conference meant a lot to me. I couldn’t forget the conference or the resolution I supported. I had one important job left while I was still in Delhi. I had to write a letter to the Viceroy. It wasn’t easy. I felt it was my duty, for both the Government and the people, to explain why I went to the conference and what the people wanted from the Government.

In the letter, I said I was sorry that leaders like Lokamanya Tilak and the Ali Brothers were left out of the conference. I also shared the people’s basic political demands and the Muslims’ requests because of the war situation. I asked if I could publish the letter, and the Viceroy happily said yes.

The letter had to be sent to Simla, where the Viceroy went right after the conference. The letter was very important to me, and sending it by mail would have taken too long.
