These ideas are explained in detail in my book.

But in India, I had to give up some of my beliefs in real life. While working on the recruiting campaign in Kheda, I got very sick because of a diet mistake and almost died. I tried to get better without drinking milk, but it didn’t work. I asked doctors, vaidyas, and scientists I knew to suggest a milk replacement. Some said mung water, some said mowhra oil, and some said almond milk. I tried all of these, but none helped me get out of bed. The vaidyas read me verses from Charaka to show that religious food rules don’t matter in healing. So they couldn’t help me live without milk. And how could those who easily recommended beef-tea and brandy help me stick to a milk-free diet?

I couldn’t take cow’s or buffalo’s milk because of a promise I made. That promise meant giving up all milk, but since I only thought about cow and buffalo milk when I made it, and because I wanted to live, I tricked myself into focusing on the exact words of the promise and started drinking goat’s milk. I knew very well that by drinking goat’s milk, I was breaking the spirit of my promise.

But I was determined to lead a campaign against the Rowlatt Act.

And with that goal, I wanted to live. So, one of the biggest experiments in my life had to stop.

Some people say the soul doesn’t care about what you eat or drink, since the soul doesn’t eat or drink. They say it’s not what you take in, but what you show from inside that matters. There is some truth in this. But instead of arguing about it, I will just say that for someone who wants to live in fear of God and meet Him face to face, controlling what you eat and how much you eat is just as important as controlling your thoughts and speech.

In a case where my theory didn’t work, I believe I should share this and warn others about trying it.
