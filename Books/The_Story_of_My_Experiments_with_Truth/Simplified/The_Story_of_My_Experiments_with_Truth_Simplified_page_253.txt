I was going back home to India. The ship stopped for a while in Mauritius, so I got off and learned about the place. I stayed one night as a guest of Sir Charles Bruce, the Governor there.

When I got to India, I traveled around the country. It was 1901 when the Congress met in Calcutta, and Mr. (later Sir) Dinshaw Wacha was the president. I went to the meeting. It was my first time at the Congress.

From Bombay, I rode the same train as Sir Pherozeshah Mehta because I needed to talk to him about South Africa. He lived very well and had a special train car just for himself. I was allowed to use his car for one part of the trip to speak with him. So, I went to his car and told him I was there.

With him were Mr. Wacha and Mr. (now Sir) Chimanlal Setalvad. They were talking about politics. When Sir Pherozeshah saw me, he said, "Gandhi, it looks like nothing can be done for you. We will agree to your request, but what rights do we have in our own country? I believe that as long as we have no power here, you canâ€™t do better in other places." I was surprised. Mr. Setalvad seemed to agree, and Mr. Wacha looked sorry for me.

I tried to convince Sir Pherozeshah, but it was impossible to change his mind. I was just happy I could present my resolution.

Mr. Wacha said, "Please show me your resolution," to encourage me. I thanked him and left the train at the next stop.

We arrived in Calcutta. The President was welcomed with great excitement by the Reception Committee. I asked a volunteer where to go next.

He took me to Ripon College, where many delegates were staying.
