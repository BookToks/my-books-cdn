Working as a waiter in a hotel was seen as something embarrassing. Many people still think that way today.

I mostly agreed with Abdulla Shethâ€™s advice. I wrote to newspapers about what happened and defended wearing my turban in court. The papers talked a lot about it and called me an "unwelcome visitor." This made me more known in South Africa soon after I arrived. Some people supported me, but others strongly criticized me for being bold.

I kept wearing my turban almost the whole time I was in South Africa.

Later, we will find out when and why I stopped wearing any head covering in South Africa.
