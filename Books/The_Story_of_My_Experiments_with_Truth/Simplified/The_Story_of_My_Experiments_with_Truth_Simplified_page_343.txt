POLAK TAKES THE PLUNGE

I’ve always felt sad that even though I started the Settlement at Phoenix, I could only stay there for short times. At first, I wanted to slowly stop working as a lawyer, live at the Settlement, work with my hands to earn money, and find happiness in helping build Phoenix. But things didn’t turn out that way.

I’ve learned that people make plans, but often God changes them. Still, if you’re looking for truth, even when your plans get messed up, it’s never really bad and sometimes turns out better than you expected. The changes at Phoenix weren’t bad, but it’s hard to say they were better than what we hoped for.

To help everyone make a living by manual work, we divided the land around the press into three-acre plots. One of these was mine. We didn’t want to, but we had to build houses with corrugated iron on these plots. We had hoped to build simple mud huts with straw roofs or small brick houses like regular farmers live in, but that wasn’t possible. They would have cost more and taken longer, and everyone wanted to settle down quickly.

Mansukhlal Naazar was still the editor. He didn’t agree with our new plan and ran the paper from Durban, where there was an Indian Opinion office. Even though we hired some workers, we wanted everyone in the Settlement to learn how to set type, which is the easiest but most boring job in printing. So, those who didn’t know it learned. I stayed bad at it the whole time. Maganlal Gandhi was the best. Even though he never worked in a press before, he became an expert very fast. He worked quickly and also learned all the other printing jobs. I think he didn’t even realize how talented he was.

We had barely settled in and finished building when I had to leave our new home and go to Johannesburg.
