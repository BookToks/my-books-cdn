It was around midnight when Patwardhan, who was working with me then, called to tell me about his death. I was with my friends at that time. Without thinking, I said, "My strongest support is gone."

The non-co-operation movement was happening strongly, and I was really hoping to get help and inspiration from him. What he would have thought about the final part of the movement is something we can only guess, and it doesn't really matter now.

But one thing is sure â€“ his death left a big empty space that everyone in Calcutta felt deeply.

Everyone missed his advice during this difficult time in our country's history.
