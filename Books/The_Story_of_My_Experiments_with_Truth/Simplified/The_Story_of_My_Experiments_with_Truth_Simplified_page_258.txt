At last, I was in the Congress. The huge hall and the volunteers standing in neat rows, along with the elders sitting up front, amazed me. I wondered where I would fit in such a big crowd.

The president’s speech was very long. It was impossible to listen to the whole thing, so only a few parts were read out.

After that, they started choosing the Subjects Committee. Gokhale took me to the meetings of this committee.

Sir Pherozeshah had agreed to accept my resolution, but I wasn’t sure who would present it or when. Every resolution had long speeches, all in English, and famous leaders supporting them. Mine felt weak compared to their strong voices. As the night went on, I got nervous. The last resolutions were rushed quickly because everyone wanted to leave. It was 11 o’clock, and I didn’t have the courage to speak. I had already talked to Gokhale, who had looked at my resolution. So I went up to him quietly and said, “Please help me.” He replied, “Your resolution is not forgotten. See how fast they are going. But I won’t let yours be ignored.”

“So, are we done?” asked Sir Pherozeshah Mehta.

“No, there is still the resolution on South Africa. Mr. Gandhi has been waiting a long time,” Gokhale said.

“Have you seen the resolution?” asked Sir Pherozeshah.

“Of course.”

“Do you like it?”

“It is quite good.”

“Well then, let’s have it, Gandhi.”
