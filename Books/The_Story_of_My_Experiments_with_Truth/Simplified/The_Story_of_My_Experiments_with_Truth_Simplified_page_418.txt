The Customs Officer said, "I like the old Parsi. I’m sorry he made a fool of himself. But you know I have to do my job. I must follow what the Attorney General says, so I suggest you try your best to convince him."

I said, "I would be grateful if you don’t force him to go to court." After he promised, I started writing to the Attorney General and also met him. I’m happy to say he appreciated my honesty and believed I told him everything.

I can’t remember if it was about this case or another one, but my honesty and persistence made him say, "I see you will never accept a no for an answer." The case against Parsi Rustomji was settled. He had to pay a fine twice as much as what he admitted to smuggling. Rustomji wrote down all the facts, framed the paper, and hung it in his office to remind his family and other merchants forever.

Rustomji’s friends warned me not to trust this sudden change of heart. When I told Rustomji about their warning, he said, "What would happen to me if I lied to you?"
