I was stuck in bed in Bombay. But I was well enough to look for a spinning wheel there. Finally, I found two spinners. They charged one rupee for a seer of yarn, which is about three-quarters of a pound. I didn’t know much about the cost of Khadi then. I thought no price was too high to get handspun yarn. When I compared their prices to those in Vijapur, I realized I was being cheated. The spinners refused to lower their prices, so I stopped using them. But they were useful because they taught spinning to Shrimatis Avantikabai, Ramibai Kamdar, the widowed mother of Sjt. Shankarlal Banker, and Shrimati Vasumatibehn. The wheel happily spun in my room, and I can honestly say its hum helped me get better. I believe it helped more mentally than physically, but that shows how much our body reacts to our mind. I also tried spinning, but didn’t do much at the time.

Back in Bombay, I again had trouble getting handmade slivers. A carder with a bow used to walk by Sjt. Revashankar’s house every day. I called him and learned he carded cotton for mattress stuffing. He agreed to card cotton for slivers but asked for a high price, which I paid. I sold the yarn to some Vaishnava friends, who used it to make garlands for the pavitra ekadashi. Sjt. Shivji started a spinning class in Bombay. These experiments cost a lot, but patriotic friends who loved the motherland gladly helped pay. In my opinion, the money was not wasted. It gave us valuable experience and showed us what the spinning wheel could do.

I was now eager to wear only Khadi for my clothes.

My dhoti was still made of Indian mill cloth. The rough Khadi made in the Ashram and Vijapur was only 30 inches wide. I told Gangabehn that unless she gave me a Khadi dhoti 45 inches wide within a month, I would have to wear a coarse, short Khadi dhoti.
