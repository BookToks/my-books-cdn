"But you never even go out for walks," I said. "Is it any wonder you're always feeling sick? Doesn't your public work leave any time for exercise?"  
 
"When do you ever see me free to go for a walk?" he answered.  

I really respected Gokhale, so I didn’t argue with him. Even though I wasn’t happy with his answer, I stayed quiet.  

I believed then, and I still believe now, that no matter how busy someone is, they should always make time to exercise, just like they make time to eat.  

In my opinion, exercising doesn’t take away from your ability to work—it actually helps you work better.
