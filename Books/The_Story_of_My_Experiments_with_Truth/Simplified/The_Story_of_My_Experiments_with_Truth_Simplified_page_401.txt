I also shared the complaints and requests I had heard. People were really unhappy because section leaders were chosen without asking the members of the Corps what they thought. They wanted those choices to be taken back and for the Corps to be allowed to vote for their own section leaders, with the Commander's approval.

The Commanding Officer didn’t like this idea. He said it went against military rules for the Corps to pick their own leaders, and that taking back the appointments already made would ruin discipline.

So, we had a meeting and decided to protest by stopping our activities. I explained to the members that this kind of protest could have serious consequences. But most of them voted to say that unless the Corporal appointments were canceled and the Corps could elect their own Corporals, they would stop drilling and weekend camping.

Then I wrote a letter to the Commanding Officer saying how disappointed I was by his refusal. I told him I didn’t like forcing my authority and that I really wanted to help. I reminded him of a past example: during the Boer War, even though I had no official rank in the South African Indian Ambulance Corps, Colonel Gallwey always checked with me to know what the Corps wanted before making decisions. I also sent him a copy of the resolution we passed.

This didn’t make the Officer any happier. He thought the meeting and resolution were a serious break of discipline.

After that, I wrote a letter to the Secretary of State for India, explaining everything and sending a copy of the resolution. He replied by saying that conditions in South Africa were different, and that the rules said the Commanding Officer should pick the section commanders. But he promised that next time, the Commanding Officer would think about my suggestions when choosing the leaders.
