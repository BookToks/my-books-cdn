The teacher was really strict and seemed eager to push the boys hard. There was a kind of competition between the Samskrit and Persian teachers. The Persian teacher was easygoing. The boys used to say that Persian was very simple and the Persian teacher was nice and understanding. This made me curious, so one day I went to the Persian class.

The Samskrit teacher felt sad. He called me over and said, "How can you forget that you are the son of a Vaishnava father? Don’t you want to learn the language of your own religion? If you have any problems, just come to me. I want to teach you Samskrit as best as I can. As you learn more, you will find many interesting things in it. Don’t give up. Come back to the Samskrit class." His kindness made me feel bad, and I couldn’t ignore how much he cared.

Today, I feel thankful to Krishnashankar Pandya. If I hadn’t learned even a little Samskrit back then, I would have had a hard time understanding our sacred books. I wish I had learned more because now I see that every Hindu boy and girl should know Samskrit well.

I believe that all Indian schools should teach Hindi, Samskrit, Persian, Arabic, and English, along with the local language. This list might seem big, but it shouldn’t scare anyone. If education was better organized, and students didn’t have to learn through a foreign language, learning all these languages would be fun, not hard. Knowing one language well makes it easier to learn others.

Actually, Hindi, Gujarati, and Samskrit are like one language, and Persian and Arabic are like another group. Even though Persian comes from the Aryan family and Arabic from the Semitic family, they are closely connected because both grew through the rise of Islam.
