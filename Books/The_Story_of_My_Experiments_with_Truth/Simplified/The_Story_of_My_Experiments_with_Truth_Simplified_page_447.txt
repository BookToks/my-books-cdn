Danibehn was a regular woman. Dudabhai was a man with a little education but good sense. I liked how patient he was. Sometimes he got angry, but mostly I admired how calm he stayed. I asked him to ignore small insults. He agreed and even convinced his wife to do the same.

The family joining the Ashram taught us an important lesson. Right from the start, we said the Ashram would not accept untouchability. People who wanted to help knew this, which made our work easier. Most of the money to run the Ashram came from strict Hindus, which shows that untouchability is being challenged. There are many other signs, but the fact that good Hindus don’t mind helping an Ashram where we eat with untouchables is a big proof.

I’m sorry I have to skip many details about this topic, like how we handled tricky problems, faced unexpected challenges, and other things important to my story of searching for Truth. The next chapters will also miss some details because many people are still alive, and it’s not right to use their names without permission. It’s also hard to get their approval or to have them check the chapters about them. Plus, that would be beyond the purpose of this autobiography. So, I’m afraid the rest of the story, which I think is important for those seeking Truth, will have some gaps.

Still, I hope, if God allows, to continue this story up to the time of Non-cooperation.
