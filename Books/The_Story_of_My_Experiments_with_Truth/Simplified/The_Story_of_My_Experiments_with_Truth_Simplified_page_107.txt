Broom's Common Law was a big but interesting book, and it took me a lot of time to read. Snell's Equity was also interesting, but it was a bit hard to understand. White and Tudor's Leading Cases had some important cases I had to study, and it was both interesting and helpful. I also read Williams' and Edward's Real Property and Goodeve's Personal Property with interest.

Williams' book was easy to read, almost like a story. The only other book I remember reading with the same strong interest after I returned to India was Mayne's Hindu Law. But it’s not the right place to talk about Indian law books here.

I passed my exams, became a lawyer on June 10, 1891, and signed up at the High Court on June 11. The next day, June 12, I sailed home.

Even though I studied a lot, I still felt helpless and scared. I didn’t think I was ready to work as a lawyer.

I need a whole separate chapter to explain how helpless I felt.
