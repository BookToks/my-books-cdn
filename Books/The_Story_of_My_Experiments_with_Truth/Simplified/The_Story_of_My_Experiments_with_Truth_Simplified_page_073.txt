I called the waiter over. My friend saw me and seriously asked what was wrong. I hesitated but told him I wanted to ask if the soup was vegetable soup. "You’re too awkward for polite company," he said angrily. "If you can’t behave, you should leave. Eat somewhere else and wait for me outside." I was happy about this and went out. There was a vegetarian restaurant nearby, but it was closed.

So, I didn’t eat that night. I went with my friend to the theatre, but he never mentioned what happened. I didn’t say anything either.

That was our last friendly fight. It didn’t change our friendship at all. I knew my friend cared about me, and I respected him even more because we thought and acted differently.

I decided I needed to make him feel comfortable. I promised I wouldn’t be awkward anymore and would try to act more polished. To make up for being a vegetarian, I wanted to learn other things that fit in with polite society. So, I took on the hard task of trying to become an English gentleman.

I thought the clothes I wore from Bombay didn’t fit English society, so I bought new ones at the Army and Navy stores.

I also got a tall hat that cost nineteen shillings—a lot of money back then. Not stopping there, I spent ten pounds on a fancy suit made in Bond Street, the fashion center in London. My kind brother sent me a double gold watch chain. It wasn’t proper to wear a ready-made tie, so I learned how to tie one myself. In India, I only used a mirror when the barber shaved me. Here, I spent ten minutes every day in front of a big mirror, fixing my tie and parting my hair the right way. My hair wasn’t soft, so brushing it was a daily struggle. Every time I put on my hat, my hand would automatically go to my head to fix my hair—a habit I noticed even when sitting with polite company.
