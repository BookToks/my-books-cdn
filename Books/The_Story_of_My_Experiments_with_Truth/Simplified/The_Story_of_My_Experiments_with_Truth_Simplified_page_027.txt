I usually didn’t like reading anything except my school books. I had to finish my daily lessons because I didn’t want my teacher to scold me, and I didn’t want to lie to him either. So, I did my lessons, but often my mind wasn’t really focused. When I couldn’t even do my lessons properly, I definitely didn’t read anything extra. But one day, I noticed a book my dad bought called Shravana Pitribhakti Nataka, which is a play about Sharavana’s love for his parents. I read it with a lot of interest.

Around the same time, some traveling showmen came to our town. They showed me a picture of Shravana carrying his blind parents on a pilgrimage using slings on his shoulders. That book and picture made a big impact on me. I thought, “This is someone I should try to be like.” I still remember how sad the parents were when Shravana died. The sad song moved me a lot, and I even played it on a concertina my dad bought for me.

Something similar happened with another play. Around then, my dad let me watch a play by a drama group. The play was about Harishchandra, and I loved it. I never got tired of watching it. But I couldn’t go often. It stayed in my mind, and I acted out Harishchandra’s part many times by myself. I kept asking myself, “Why can’t everyone be as truthful as Harishchandra?” The idea of always telling the truth and going through hard times like Harishchandra inspired me a lot.

I really believed the story of Harishchandra. Sometimes, thinking about it made me cry. Now, I know Harishchandra probably wasn’t a real person. But Harishchandra and Shravana still feel very real to me, and I’m sure I would feel the same way if I read those plays again today.
