Everything was boring. Every day, the old lady asked me if I liked the food, but what could she do? I was still very shy and didn’t dare ask for more than what was given to me. She had two daughters who tried to give me extra slices of bread. But they didn’t know that only a whole loaf would have really filled me up.

But I was starting to feel more comfortable now. I hadn’t started my regular studies yet. I had just begun reading newspapers, thanks to Sjt. Shukla. Back in India, I had never read a newspaper. But here, I started to like them by reading regularly. I looked through The Daily News, The Daily Telegraph, and The Pall Mall Gazette. This only took me about an hour. After that, I began to explore the city.

I went looking for a vegetarian restaurant. The landlady had told me there were some in the city. I would walk ten or twelve miles each day, go into cheap restaurants, and eat as much bread as I could, but I was never full. One day, I found a vegetarian restaurant on Farringdon Street. Seeing it made me as happy as a kid getting a favorite toy. Before going in, I noticed some books for sale in a glass window near the door.

Among the books, I saw one called Salt's Plea for Vegetarianism. I bought it for a shilling and went straight to the dining room. This was the first good meal I had since arriving in England. I felt like God was helping me.

I read Salt’s book from start to finish and was very impressed. After reading it, I can say I became a vegetarian by choice. I was glad I had promised my mother to avoid meat. Before, I had only stayed away from meat because of my promise and my beliefs, but I secretly wished every Indian ate meat, and I thought I might eat meat freely someday and get others to do the same. Now, I chose vegetarianism, and spreading it became my goal.
