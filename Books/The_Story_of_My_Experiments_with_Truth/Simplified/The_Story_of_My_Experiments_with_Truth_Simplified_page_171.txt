"But," they said, "we want you to take that money for public work, and we can easily collect it. Of course, this is separate from the fees you charge for private legal work."  

"No, I can't charge you for public work like that," I said. "It wouldn't need much skill from me as a lawyer. Most of my job would be to make you all work. How could I charge you for that? Also, I would have to ask you often for money for the work, and if I took my pay from you, it would be hard to ask for large amounts. We might end up stuck. Besides, I want the community to raise more than £300 a year for public work."  

"But we've known you for a while and trust you wouldn’t take more than you need. If we want you to stay here, shouldn’t we cover your expenses?"  

"It's your love and excitement that make you say this. How can we know this feeling will last forever? As your friend and helper, I might sometimes have to say tough things to you. Who knows if you would still like me then? The truth is, I must not accept any salary for public work. It’s enough that you all agree to give me your legal work. That might be hard for you because I’m not a white lawyer. I don’t know if the court will listen to me or how I will do as a lawyer. So even giving me clients is a risk for you. I see that as the reward for my public work."  

In the end, about twenty merchants agreed to pay me fees for their legal work for one year. Also, Dada Abdulla bought me the furniture I needed instead of giving me money he planned to give when I left.  

So, I settled in Natal.
