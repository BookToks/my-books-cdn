In the last chapter, I said the sea was rough in Bombay harbour. That’s normal in the Arabian Sea during June and July. The sea was choppy all the way from Aden. Almost everyone on the ship was feeling sick, but I was the only one who felt fine. I stayed on deck to watch the wild waves and enjoyed the splashes.

At breakfast, there were only one or two other people besides me. They carefully held their plates in their laps so the oatmeal porridge wouldn’t spill everywhere.

The storm outside was like a symbol of the troubles inside me. But while the storm didn’t bother me, I think I can say the same for my inner problems. I had to deal with issues about caste, which made starting my career hard. Also, since I wanted to make changes, I was thinking hard about how to begin those reforms. But there were even bigger challenges waiting for me.

My older brother came to meet me at the dock. He had already met Dr. Mehta and his older brother. Since Dr. Mehta insisted I stay at his house, we went there. What started as a meeting in England grew into a strong friendship between our families in India.

I was really eager to see my mother. But I didn’t know she had already passed away and couldn’t welcome me back. My brother had kept this from me while I was still in England because he didn’t want me to be sad so far from home. When I finally found out, it was a heavy shock.

But I won’t dwell on it. Losing her hurt even more than losing my father. Many of my dreams felt broken. Still, I didn’t let myself cry out loud. I held back my tears and acted like nothing had happened, moving on with life.
