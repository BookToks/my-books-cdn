I can’t say my experiments were completely successful. Even doctors can’t say that about their experiments.

My goal is just to show that if you want to try new things, you have to start with yourself. This helps you find the truth faster, and God always helps honest people who are trying.

Trying to get close to Europeans was just as risky as my health experiments. But those risks were different. Still, I never really thought about the dangers when I was making those connections.

I invited Polak to live with me, and we became very close, like brothers. Polak and his fiancée had been engaged for years but kept delaying their wedding to wait for a better time. I think Polak wanted to save money before getting married. He knew Ruskin’s ideas better than I did, but living in the West made it hard for him to practice those ideas right away.

I told him, “When two people love each other, it’s not right to wait to get married just because of money. If poor people waited, they’d never marry. You’re staying with me now, so you don’t have to worry about household costs. You should get married soon.”

Polak agreed right away and wrote to his fiancée in England. She happily said yes and came to Johannesburg a few months later. They didn’t spend extra on the wedding—no fancy dress or anything. They didn’t need a religious ceremony either. She was Christian, and he was Jewish, but their real bond was based on ethics.

I want to share a funny story about their wedding.

The official who registers European marriages in the Transvaal couldn’t register marriages between black or colored people. At their wedding, I was the best man.
