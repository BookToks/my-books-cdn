THE BLACK PLAGUE - I

The Indians were not moved from their homes right after the Municipality took control of the area. The city had to find them new places to live first, but since this was hard to do, the Indians had to stay in the same dirty area. However, their living conditions got worse. 

Before, when they owned their homes, they kept things somewhat clean, partly because they were afraid of the law. Now that they were tenants of the Municipality, the city didn’t care about cleanliness. More people moved in, and the place became dirtier and more chaotic.

While the Indians were worried about this, the black plague suddenly broke out. This disease, also called the pneumonic plague, is even worse and deadlier than the bubonic plague.

Luckily, the plague didn’t start in their neighborhood but in a nearby gold mine close to Johannesburg. Most of the workers there were black Africans, and their white bosses were responsible for making sure they stayed clean. Some Indians also worked at the mine. One evening, twenty-three of these Indian workers got very sick with the plague and came back to their homes in the location.

Sjt. Madanjit, who was collecting subscriptions for the Indian Opinion newspaper and raising money, happened to be there at that time. He was very brave. His heart was broken to see these sick people. He sent me a quick note saying: “There has been a sudden outbreak of the black plague. You must come right away and take quick action, or very bad things will happen. Please come immediately.”
