I told the teachers that if they and the boys stopped hiring cooks and cooked their own food, the teachers could better control the boys’ health and behavior. It would also teach the students how to help themselves. Some teachers didn’t like the idea, but others thought it was good. The boys liked it because it was something new. So, we started the experiment. When I asked the Poet what he thought, he said he didn’t mind as long as the teachers agreed. To the boys, he said, "This experiment holds the key to Swaraj." Pearson worked very hard to make it successful. He was excited about it. Some boys were in charge of cutting vegetables, others cleaned the grain, and some, like Nagenbabu, made sure the kitchen and area were clean. It made me happy to see them working with shovels in their hands.

But it was too much to expect all 125 boys and their teachers to enjoy this hard work right away. We talked about it every day. Some boys got tired quickly. But Pearson never gave up. You could always find him smiling and doing something in or near the kitchen. He took care of cleaning the big pots. Some students played sitar music to make the cleaning less boring. Everyone worked hard, and Shantiniketan became a busy place.

Once these changes started, they kept growing. Not only did the Phoenix group run their own kitchen, but the food they cooked was very simple.

They didn’t use spices. Rice, dal, vegetables, and even wheat flour were all cooked together in a steam cooker. The boys at Shantiniketan started a similar kitchen to improve cooking in the Bengali style. Some teachers and students ran this kitchen.

But after a while, the experiment was stopped.
