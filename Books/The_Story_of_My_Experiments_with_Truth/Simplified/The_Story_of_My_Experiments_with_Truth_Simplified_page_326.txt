To deal with their special problems, they created their own group, separate from the free Indian merchants and traders. Some of them were honest, open, and had good reputations. Their leaders were Sjt. Jairamsing, the president, and Sjt. Badri, who was just as important as the president. Both of them have passed away now. They were very helpful to me. Sjt. Badri worked closely with me and played a big role in the Satyagraha movement. Because of them and other friends, I got to know many Indian settlers from North and South India very well. I became more like a brother to them than just a legal advisor, and I shared their personal and public struggles and pain.

It might be interesting to know what the Indians called me. Abdulla Sheth refused to call me Gandhi. Luckily, no one ever insulted me by calling me 'saheb.' Abdulla Sheth came up with a great name for me: 'bhai,' which means brother. Others started using that name too, and they kept calling me 'bhai' until I left South Africa. The name felt warm and special when the ex-indentured Indians used it.
