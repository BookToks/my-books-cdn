WAS IT A THREAT?

After leaving Poona, I went to Rajkot and Porbandar to meet my brother's widow and other family members.

During the Satyagraha in South Africa, I changed how I dressed to look like the indentured laborers. In England, I kept wearing the same style indoors. For arriving in Bombay, I wore a Kathiawadi suit made of Indian cloth, including a shirt, dhoti, cloak, and white scarf. But since I was traveling third class from Bombay, I thought the scarf and cloak would be too much to carry, so I left them behind and bought a Kashmiri cap that cost eight to ten annas. Dressing this way made me look like a poor man.

Because of the plague at that time, third class passengers had to get a health check at Viramgam or Wadhwan – I don’t remember which. I had a slight fever. When the inspector saw my temperature, he told me to see the Medical Officer at Rajkot and wrote down my name.

Maybe someone told them I was passing through Wadhwan because the tailor Motilal, a well-known public worker there, met me at the station. He told me about the rules at Viramgam and how tough it was for railway travelers. I didn’t feel like talking much because of my fever, so I gave short answers and asked, “Are you ready to go to jail?” I thought Motilal was just a hot-headed young man who spoke without thinking. But he wasn’t. He answered calmly, “We will definitely go to jail if you lead us. As Kathiawadis, we have the first right on you. We don’t want to stop you now, but you must promise to stop here on your way back. You’ll be happy to see the work and spirit of our young people, and you can trust us to respond as soon as you call us.” Motilal impressed me a lot.
