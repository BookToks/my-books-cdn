A SACRIFICE TO VEGETARIANISM

As I started to live a simpler life and think more about religion, I became more passionate about vegetarianism. I believed the best way to spread this idea was by showing people through my own example and talking with those who wanted to learn.

In Johannesburg, there was a vegetarian restaurant run by a German man who believed in a special water treatment. I visited the restaurant and brought my English friends there. But the restaurant always had money problems and couldn’t stay open. I gave some money to help, but it eventually had to close.

Most members of the theosophist group were vegetarians too. A woman from this group opened a big vegetarian restaurant. She loved art, spent a lot, and didn’t understand money well. She had many friends and started small, but later wanted to make the restaurant bigger and asked me for help. I didn’t know her money situation, but I trusted her judgment and was able to help because some of my clients had left large deposits with me.

With permission from one client, I lent about a thousand pounds from his money. This client was very kind and trusting. He had come to South Africa as a worker and said, “Give away the money if you want. I don’t understand these things. I only trust you.” His name was Badri. Later, he joined the fight for freedom and was even put in jail. So, I gave the loan thinking I had permission.

After two or three months, I realized the money wouldn’t be paid back. I couldn’t afford to lose that much because I had many other important uses for the money.
