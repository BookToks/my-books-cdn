By this time, I had been living in South Africa for three years. I had made friends with the people there, and they knew me too. In 1896, I asked if I could go home for six months because I realized I would be staying there for a long time. I had built a pretty good practice, and people needed me. So, I decided to go home, bring my wife and kids back with me, and then come back to live there for good. I also thought that if I went home, I could help by raising awareness about the Indians in South Africa. The £3 tax was a big problem. Nothing would be peaceful until it was removed.

But who would run the Congress work and Education Society while I was away? I could think of two men – Adamji Miyakhan and Parsi Rustomji. Many workers were now available from the business community. But the two best people to be secretary, who worked hard and were respected by the Indian community, were these men. The secretary needed to know English well. I suggested Adamji Miyakhan’s name to the Congress, and they agreed to make him secretary. It turned out to be a great choice. Adamji Miyakhan impressed everyone with his hard work, kindness, friendliness, and good manners. He showed that the secretary didn’t need to be a lawyer or highly educated in English.

Around the middle of 1896, I took a ship called the SS Pongola to go home. The ship was going to Calcutta.

There were only a few passengers on the ship. Two of them were English officers, and I spent a lot of time with them. One of them and I played chess together every day for an hour. The ship’s doctor gave me a Tamil language book, and I started learning it. My time in Natal had taught me that I should learn Urdu to get closer to the Muslim community, and Tamil to connect better with the Indians from Madras.

At the request of my English friend, who read Urdu with me, I found a good Urdu teacher among the passengers on the ship. We made great progress in learning the languages.
