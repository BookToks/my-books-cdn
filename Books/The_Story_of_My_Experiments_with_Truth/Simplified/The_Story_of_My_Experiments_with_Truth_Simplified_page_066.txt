But I do think you should eat meat because you can’t live without it.’ ‘Thank you for your advice, but I promised my mother I wouldn’t eat meat, so I won’t. If it turns out I can’t live without it, I’d rather go back to India than eat meat just to stay here.’

We entered the Bay of Biscay, but I didn’t start to feel like I needed meat or alcohol. Someone told me to get certificates proving I hadn’t eaten meat, so I asked an English friend for one. He happily gave it to me, and I kept it for a while. But later, when I found out that people who ate meat could also get these certificates, I didn’t think it was special anymore. If people didn’t trust my word, what was the point of having a certificate?

We arrived in Southampton, I think on a Saturday. On the boat, I wore a black suit, but I had saved a white flannel suit that my friends gave me to wear when I got off the ship. I thought white clothes would look better when I arrived, so I wore them. It was the last days of September, and I noticed I was the only one wearing white. I left all my stuff, including my keys, with an agent from Grindlay and Co., because many others did the same and I wanted to follow the rules.

I had four letters of introduction: to Dr. P. J. Mehta, Sjt. Dalpatram Shukla, Prince Ranjitsinhji, and Dadabhai Naoroji. Someone on the ship told us to stay at the Victoria Hotel in London, so Sjt Mazmudar and I went there. I already felt embarrassed being the only one in white clothes. Then, at the hotel, I was told I couldn’t get my things from Grindlay’s the next day because it was Sunday, and that really annoyed me.

Dr. Mehta, who I had messaged from Southampton, came to see me around eight in the evening. He greeted me warmly and smiled when he saw me in flannels. While we were talking, I picked up his top hat and rubbed it the wrong way, messing up the smooth fur.
