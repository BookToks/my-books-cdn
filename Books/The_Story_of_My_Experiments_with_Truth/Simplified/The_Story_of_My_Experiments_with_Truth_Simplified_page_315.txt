INTIMATE EUROPEAN CONTACTS

This chapter has brought me to a point where I need to explain how I write this story week by week.

When I started writing, I didn’t have a clear plan. I don’t have a diary or papers to base my story on. I write whenever I feel inspired at the moment. I don’t claim that every thought or action I have is guided by the Spirit. But looking back at the biggest and smallest decisions in my life, I believe many were guided by the Spirit.

I have never seen Him or really known Him. I have accepted the world’s faith in God as my own. My faith is very strong, so I think of it as a kind of experience. But some might say calling faith an experience isn’t quite right, so maybe it’s better to say I don’t have a perfect word to explain my belief in God.

Now it might be easier to see why I believe I write this story as the Spirit guides me. When I started the last chapter, I gave it the same title as this one. But while writing, I realized I needed to add a preface before sharing my experiences with Europeans. So, I did that and changed the title.

Now, as I begin this chapter, I face a new problem. I don’t know what to include or leave out about my English friends I’m going to write about. Leaving out important details would hide the truth. It’s hard to decide what’s important when I’m not even sure if I should be writing this story at all.

Today, I understand better what I read long ago about how autobiography is never perfect history. I know I don’t write down everything I remember. Who can say how much I should share or leave out to tell the truth?
