Khadi hadn’t yet found its right place. Hasrat Saheb didn’t agree with this. He wanted to take revenge on the British Empire if they didn’t do justice about the Khilafat issue. So, he suggested boycotting only British goods as much as possible. I disagreed with this idea because of both principle and practicality, and I gave reasons that people now know well. I also shared my thoughts about non-violence.

I saw that my words made a strong impact on the crowd. Before me, Hasrat Mohani’s speech was cheered loudly, and I was worried my speech would be ignored. I spoke up because I felt it was my duty to share my views. To my surprise, people listened carefully and many leaders supported what I said. One after another, speakers came forward to back my ideas. The leaders realized that boycotting British goods would not work and would even make them look ridiculous. Almost everyone there had some British-made item on them. So, many understood that such a boycott would cause more harm than good since even those who agreed couldn’t follow through.

Maulana Hasrat Mohani said something like this: “Just boycotting foreign cloth isn’t enough. Who knows how long it will take before we can make enough Swadeshi cloth for ourselves and effectively boycott foreign cloth? We want something that will quickly affect the British. You can keep boycotting foreign cloth if you want, but give us something faster and stronger too.”

While listening to him, I also felt we needed something more than just boycotting foreign cloth. Right away boycotting foreign cloth seemed impossible. At that time, I didn’t know we could actually produce enough Khadi for all our clothes; I only found that out later.
