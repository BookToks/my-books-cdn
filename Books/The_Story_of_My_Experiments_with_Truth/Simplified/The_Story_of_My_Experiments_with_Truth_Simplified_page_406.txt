I mixed the powder in water and drank it, only to find it tasted just like milk. I looked at the bottle’s label and realized, too late, that it was actually a milk product. So, I stopped using it.

I told Lady Cecilia about what happened and asked her not to worry.

She came to see me quickly and apologized, saying her friend hadn’t read the label either. I told her not to be upset and said I was sorry I couldn’t use what she had kindly brought me. I also assured her I didn’t feel bad or guilty for drinking milk by mistake.

I won’t go into all the other kind memories I have of Lady Cecilia. I have many friends who have helped me feel better during hard times. Someone who believes in God sees these friends as a way that God makes even sad times a bit easier.

When Dr. Allinson visited next, he loosened my diet rules and let me have groundnut, butter, or olive oil for fat, and cooked vegetables with rice if I wanted. These changes were nice, but I still wasn’t fully healed. I needed careful care and had to stay mostly in bed.

Dr. Mehta sometimes stopped by to check on me and always offered to cure me if I would just follow his advice.

While all this was happening, Mr. Roberts came to see me one day and strongly told me to go home. “You can’t go to Netley like this. Worse cold weather is coming. I really think you should go back to India because only there can you fully get better.

If the war is still going on after you recover, you’ll have many chances to help there. What you have done so far is already a good contribution.” I agreed with him and started getting ready to return to India.
