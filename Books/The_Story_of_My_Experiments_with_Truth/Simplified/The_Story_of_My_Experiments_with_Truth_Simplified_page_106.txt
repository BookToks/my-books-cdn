I was specially asked to come and was really popular on that “big night.”

Back then, and even now, I don’t see how these dinners helped students get better at becoming lawyers. At one time, only a few students went to these dinners, so they could talk with the important members and listen to speeches. These events helped them learn about the world and improved their speaking skills. But in my time, the important members sat at their own table, so none of that happened. The whole thing lost its meaning, but England kept it anyway.

The study program was easy, and lawyers were jokingly called “dinner barristers.” Everyone knew the exams didn’t really mean much. When I was there, there were two exams: one in Roman Law and one in Common Law.

There were textbooks to study for these exams, and you could take them one at a time, but hardly anyone read them. I’ve seen many people pass the Roman Law exam by quickly going through notes in a couple of weeks, and the Common Law exam by reading notes for two or three months. The questions were easy, and the graders were nice. About 95 to 99% passed the Roman Law exam, and 75% or more passed the final one. So, people weren’t really scared of failing, and the exams were given four times a year. They weren’t hard.

But I decided to make it harder for myself. I felt I should read all the textbooks because it seemed wrong not to. I spent a lot of money on them. I chose to read Roman Law in Latin. The Latin I learned earlier helped me a lot. This reading was useful later when I was in South Africa, where Roman Dutch law is common. Reading Justinian helped me understand their law better.

It took me nine months of hard work to read through English Common Law.
