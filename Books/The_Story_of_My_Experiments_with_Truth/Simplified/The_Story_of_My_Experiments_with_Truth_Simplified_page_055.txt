People said he healed his leprosy not with medicine, but by putting bilva leaves on the sores. These leaves were leftovers from offerings made to the statue of Mahadeva in the Bileshvar temple. He also kept repeating the name of Rama. They said his strong belief helped him get better. This might be true or not. But we believed the story.

What is true is that when Ladha Maharaj started reading the Ramayana, his body was completely free of leprosy. He had a beautiful voice. He would sing the Dohas (short poems) and Chopais (four-line verses) and explain them. He got so into it that he pulled his listeners into the story too. I was about thirteen then, and I clearly remember how much I loved listening to him. That was when I started to really love the Ramayana. Now, I think the Ramayana by Tulasidas is the best book in all devotional writings.

A few months later, we moved to Rajkot. There, no one read the Ramayana. But the Bhagavat was read every Ekadashi day.

Sometimes I went to listen, but the reader wasn’t very exciting. Now I know the Bhagavat is a powerful book that can inspire deep religious feelings. I have read it in Gujarati with great interest. But when I heard parts of the original read by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya during my twenty-one days’ fast, I wished I had listened to someone like him when I was a kid. Hearing good books early in life helps you connect with them deeply. I always regret not hearing more great books read when I was younger.

In Rajkot, I also learned to respect all kinds of Hinduism and other religions. My parents would visit the Haveli and Shiva’s and Rama’s temples, and they would take or send us kids there too. Jain monks often visited my father and even accepted food from us, even though we were not Jains. They talked with my father about religious and everyday topics.

My father also had Muslim and Parsi friends. They would talk about their own religions, and he always listened respectfully and with interest.
