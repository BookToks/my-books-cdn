His strong determination and honest nature were amazing and made me like him a lot. It was fun to compete with him.

The pressure from my fast on the group he led hurt me deeply. Also, Sarladevi, his wife, cared for me like a sister, and I felt bad seeing her upset because of what I was doing.

On the first day, Anasuyabhen and some other friends and workers joined me in the fast. But after some struggle, I convinced them not to keep fasting longer.

Because of this, everyone started feeling more friendly towards each other.

The mill owners felt touched and began looking for a way to solve the problem. They held meetings at Anasuyabehn’s house. Mr. Anandshankar Dhruva helped as a mediator, and the strike ended after I had fasted for three days.

The mill owners celebrated by giving sweets to the workers, and after 21 days of striking, the issue was settled.

At the celebration meeting, both the mill owners and the Commissioner were there. The Commissioner told the workers, “You should always listen to Mr. Gandhi.” Soon after, I had a disagreement with this same man. But things had changed, and so had he. He started warning the Patidars of Kheda not to follow my advice!

I must share a funny but sad moment about the sweets. The mill owners ordered a lot of sweets, and it was hard to figure out how to give them to thousands of workers. They decided to hand them out under the tree where we had made our pledge because gathering everyone somewhere else would have been too difficult.

I thought that since the men had been disciplined for 21 days, they would stand calmly and wait their turn to get sweets, without rushing or pushing.
