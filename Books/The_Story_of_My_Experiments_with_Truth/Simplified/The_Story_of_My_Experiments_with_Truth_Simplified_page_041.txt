I was told that some of the people were high-school boys too.

I felt surprised and upset. I asked my friend why, and he said, “We are weak because we don’t eat meat. The English can control us because they eat meat. You know I am strong and a good runner. That’s because I eat meat. Meat eaters don’t get boils or tumors, and if they do, they heal fast. Our teachers and important people who eat meat are smart. They know meat is good for you. You should try it. See how strong it makes you.” He didn’t say this all at once but many times.

This was the main point my friend kept trying to make. My older brother had already died, so he agreed with my friend. Compared to my brother and friend, I looked weak. They were stronger, tougher, and braver. My friend’s skills amazed me. He could run long distances very fast. He was great at high and long jumps. He could take lots of punishment without giving up. He often showed me what he could do, and I was impressed because I couldn’t do those things. I wanted to be like him. I couldn’t jump or run well. Why couldn’t I be strong like him?

Also, I was a scaredy-cat. I was afraid of thieves, ghosts, and snakes. I didn’t dare go outside at night. The dark scared me. I could hardly sleep without a light because I imagined ghosts coming from one side, thieves from another, and snakes from a third. I couldn’t tell my wife about my fears. She wasn’t a kid anymore, but still young, and slept next to me. She was braver than me. She wasn’t scared of snakes or ghosts and could go out in the dark anytime. My friend knew I was scared. He told me he could hold live snakes, wasn’t afraid of thieves, and didn’t believe in ghosts.
