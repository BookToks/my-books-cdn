I didn’t know my friend was really good at this skill. It caught my attention, and I joined in. Just as I was about to go too far and stop paying attention to the cards and the game, my friend gave me a warning: “What’s gotten into you, boy? Stop now!” I felt embarrassed. I listened to him and felt thankful inside. Remembering the promise I made to my mother, I quickly left. I went to my room shaking and scared, like an animal running away from a hunter.

I remember this was the first time a woman, other than my wife, made me feel attracted in a way I hadn’t before. I couldn’t sleep that night because so many thoughts were running through my mind.

Should I leave this house? Should I run away? Where was I? What would have happened if I hadn’t stayed alert? I decided to be very careful from then on, not to leave the house, but to find a way to leave Portsmouth. The Conference would only last two more days, and I left Portsmouth the next evening while my friend stayed longer.

At that time, I didn’t really understand religion or God, or how God works in us.

I only had a small idea that God had saved me that day. God has saved me through all my tough times. Now, when I say “God saved me,” it means much more to me, though I still don’t fully understand it. Only more experience will help me understand it better.

But in all my spiritual struggles, as a lawyer, running organizations, and in politics, I can say God saved me. When I had no hope left, when helpers disappeared and comfort was gone, help came from somewhere I can’t explain. Prayer, worship, and asking for help are not silly or fake; they are more real than eating, drinking, sitting, or walking. Honestly, they are the only real things, and everything else is not.

Prayer or worship isn’t just fancy words or saying things without meaning. It comes from the heart. If we can make our hearts pure and full of love, and keep everything in balance, then our feelings will flow like beautiful music, even if no one can see it.
