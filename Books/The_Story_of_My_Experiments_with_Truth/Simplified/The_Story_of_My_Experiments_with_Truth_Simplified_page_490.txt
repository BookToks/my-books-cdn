PASSION FOR UNITY

The Kheda campaign started while the deadly war in Europe was still happening. A big problem came up, and the Viceroy invited many leaders to a meeting about the war in Delhi. I was also asked to come. I have already talked about the friendly relationship between Lord Chelmsford, the Viceroy, and me.

When I got the invitation, I went to Delhi. But I didn’t want to join the meeting because some important leaders, like the Ali Brothers, were not allowed to come. They were in jail at the time. I had only met the Ali Brothers once or twice, but I had heard a lot about them. Everyone said they were brave and had done great work. I didn’t know Hakim Saheb well yet, but Principal Rudra and Dinabandhu Andrews told me many good things about him. I had met Mr. Shuaib Qureshi and Mr. Khwaja at the Muslim League in Calcutta. I also met Drs. Ansari and Abdur Rahman. I wanted to be friends with good Muslims and understand their thoughts by spending time with honest and patriotic Muslim leaders. So, I never needed any push to go with them wherever they wanted to go to get closer to them.

I understood early in South Africa that Hindus and Muslims didn’t have real friendship. I always tried to remove the problems between them. I was not the kind of person to please others by flattering them if it meant losing respect for myself. But my experiences in South Africa showed me that Hindu-Muslim unity would be the hardest test for my nonviolence. It would also be the biggest chance for me to try out my ideas about nonviolence. I still believe this. Every moment, I feel that God is testing me.

Because I believed so strongly in this idea when I came back from South Africa, I wanted to get close to the Ali Brothers. But before we could become close, they were separated from others.
