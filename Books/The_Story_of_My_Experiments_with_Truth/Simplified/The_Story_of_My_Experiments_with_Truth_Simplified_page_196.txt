In India, while I was going to Bombay, the train stopped at Allahabad for forty-five minutes. I decided to use the time to drive around the town. I also needed to buy some medicine from a chemist. The chemist was half asleep and took a very long time to give me the medicine. Because of this, when I got back to the station, the train had just started moving. The Station Master had waited one minute for me, but since he didn’t see me, he had my luggage taken off the train.

I stayed at Kellner's hotel and decided to start working right away. I had heard a lot about The Pioneer newspaper from Allahabad, and I thought it didn’t support Indian hopes. I think Mr. Chesney Jr. was the editor then. I wanted help from everyone, so I wrote to Mr. Chesney explaining how I missed the train and asked for a meeting so I could leave the next day.

He gave me a meeting quickly, which made me happy, especially because he listened carefully. He said he would pay attention to anything I wrote but couldn’t promise to support all Indian demands since he also had to understand the views of the Colonials.

I said, "That’s enough. I just want you to study the issue and talk about it in your paper. I only ask for the basic justice we deserve." I spent the rest of the day looking around and admiring the beautiful place where three rivers meet, called the Triveni, while planning my work.

This surprise meeting with the editor of The Pioneer started a chain of events that later led to me being attacked in Natal.

I went straight to Rajkot without stopping in Bombay and began preparing to write a pamphlet about the situation of Indians in South Africa. Writing and publishing the pamphlet took about a month. It had a green cover and was later called the Green Pamphlet. In it, I described the conditions of Indians in South Africa in a calm and careful way.
