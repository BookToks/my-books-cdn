'RETURN SOON' From Madras, I went to Calcutta, but I ran into a lot of problems. I didn’t know anyone there, so I rented a room at the Great Eastern Hotel.

There, I met Mr. Ellerthorpe, who worked for The Daily Telegraph. He invited me to the Bengal Club, where he was staying. But he didn’t know that Indians weren’t allowed in the club’s drawing-room.

When he found out, he took me to his room instead. He felt bad about the local Englishmen’s unfair rules and apologized for not being able to bring me to the drawing-room.

I had to meet Surendranath Banerji, the 'Idol of Bengal'. When I met him, he was with many friends. He said, 'I’m afraid people won’t care about your work. We have many problems here. But you should try your best. You need to get the support of the Maharajas. Also, meet the British Indian Association leaders. You should see Raja Sir Pyarimohan Mukarji and Maharaja Tagore. They are open-minded and active in public work.'

I met these men, but it didn’t go well. They were cold to me and said it was hard to hold a public meeting in Calcutta. If anything could happen, it would depend on Surendranath Banerji.

I saw my job was getting harder. I went to The Amrita Bazar Patrika office. The man there thought I was a wandering Jew.

The Bangabasi was even worse. The editor made me wait for an hour. He had many people to see but didn’t even look at me after that. When I finally started to talk about my topic, he said, 'Can’t you see we are busy? We get many visitors like you. You should leave. I don’t want to listen.'

For a moment, I felt hurt, but then I understood the editor’s situation. I had heard about The Bangabasi’s fame and saw they had a constant flow of visitors.
