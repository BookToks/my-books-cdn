I remember a time when I had to send £75 every month.

But after all these years, I feel the journal has helped the community a lot.

It was never meant to make money. As long as I was in charge, the changes in the journal showed changes in my life. Back then, Indian Opinion, like Young India and Navajivan today, reflected part of my life. Week after week, I shared my thoughts in its pages and explained the ideas and practice of Satyagraha the way I understood them. For ten years, until 1914, except when I was forced to rest in prison, almost every issue of Indian Opinion had an article from me.

I can’t remember writing anything in those articles without thinking carefully, or exaggerating on purpose, or just trying to please people. Actually, the journal helped me learn self-control, and it gave my friends a way to stay connected with my ideas. Critics had very little to complain about. The style of Indian Opinion even made critics hold back their harsh words. Satyagraha probably wouldn’t have been possible without Indian Opinion. Readers looked forward to it because it gave a true report of the Satyagraha campaign and the real situation of Indians in South Africa. For me, it was a way to study human nature in all its forms, since I always wanted a close and honest connection between the editor and readers. I got many letters full of feelings from people. Some were friendly, some were critical, and some were angry, depending on the writer. It was a great learning experience for me to read, understand, and reply to all these letters. It felt like the community was talking openly with me through their letters. This helped me fully understand the responsibility of a journalist. The trust I gained this way made future campaigns effective, respectful, and unstoppable.

From the very first month of Indian Opinion, I knew that journalism should only aim to serve people. The newspaper is very powerful, but just like a wild flood can destroy whole fields and farms, an uncontrolled pen can only cause damage.
