Back then, vegetarianism was pretty new in England, and it was new to me too. As you know, I used to eat meat without any doubt, but later I started to believe in vegetarianism after thinking about it carefully. Excited about my new choice, I wanted to start a vegetarian club where I lived, in Bayswater. I asked Sir Edwin Arnold, who lived nearby, to be the Vice-President.

Dr. Oldfield, who was the editor of The Vegetarian magazine, became the President. I took the job of Secretary. The club did well for a little while, but after a few months, it ended. This happened because I moved away, which I often did, changing places every now and then. 

Even though the club didnâ€™t last long, this small experience helped me learn how to organize and run groups.
