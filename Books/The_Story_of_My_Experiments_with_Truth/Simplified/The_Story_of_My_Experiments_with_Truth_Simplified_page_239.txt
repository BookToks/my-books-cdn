Even though I am over fifty-six years old, I still realize how hard this is. Every day I understand more that it feels like walking on a sharp sword, and I know I must always stay alert.

Controlling what I eat is the most important part of keeping my promise. I found that if I control my food completely, it becomes much easier. So, I tried different diets not only like a vegetarian but also like someone who practices brahmacharya (self-control). After trying many things, I learned that brahmacharya food should be simple, not spicy, and if possible, raw.

After six years of trying this, I saw that the best food for brahmacharya is fresh fruit and nuts. When I ate only this, I felt free from strong desires. But when I stopped eating just fruits and nuts and started drinking milk, it became much harder to keep my self-control. I will explain later why I had to add milk back to my diet. I am sure that drinking milk makes it harder to keep the brahmacharya promise. But I don’t want anyone to think that all brahmacharis must stop drinking milk. Different foods affect people differently, and you can only know by trying many times. I still haven’t found a fruit that can replace milk as a good source of strength and is easy to digest. Doctors and healers have not helped me with this. So, even though I know milk can excite the senses a bit, I can’t tell anyone to stop drinking it right now.

Along with choosing the right food, fasting is very important to help with brahmacharya. Our senses are so strong that we can only control them if we trap them completely, from all sides. Everyone knows that without food, the senses become weak, so fasting to control the senses definitely helps. But for some people, fasting does not work. They think that just not eating is enough to make them strong in self-control, but they still spend all their time thinking about what they will eat or drink after the fast is over.
