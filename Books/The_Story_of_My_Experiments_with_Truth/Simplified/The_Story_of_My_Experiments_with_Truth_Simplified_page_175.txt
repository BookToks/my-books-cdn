The law does not treat white and colored people differently. So, the Court had no reason to stop Mr. Gandhi from becoming a lawyer. They accepted his application. Mr. Gandhi, you can now take the oath.' I stood up and took the oath in front of the Registrar. Right after I finished, the Chief Justice told me, 'You must now take off your turban, Mr. Gandhi. You have to follow the Court’s dress rules for lawyers.' I understood my limits. I took off the turban I had insisted on wearing in the District Magistrate’s Court because the Supreme Court ordered me to.

It’s not that I couldn’t have fought the order. But I wanted to save my energy for bigger fights. I didn’t want to waste my effort just to keep my turban. That fight was more important.

Sheth Abdulla and other friends didn’t like that I gave in (or maybe they thought I was weak). They believed I should have stood up for my right to wear the turban while working in Court. I tried to explain to them. I told them the saying, 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do.' I said, 'It would be right to refuse if an English officer or judge in India told you to take off your turban. But since I’m an officer of the Court here in Natal, I should respect the Court’s customs.' I calmed my friends with these points, but I don’t think I fully convinced them about why sometimes you need to see things from different views in different situations. 

All my life, being honest has helped me understand the value of compromise. Later, I saw that this attitude was an important part of Satyagraha (nonviolent resistance). It often put my life at risk and made some friends upset. But truth is both strong like steel and gentle like a flower.

The Law Society’s opposition gave me more attention in South Africa.
