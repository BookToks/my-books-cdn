My mom would always ask me to come and eat my food and want to know why I didn’t want to eat. I would tell her, “I don’t feel hungry today; something is wrong with my stomach.” I felt bad making up these excuses. I knew I was lying, and lying to my mom. I also knew that if my mom and dad found out I was eating meat, they would be very upset. This made me feel really troubled inside.

So I told myself, “Even though eating meat is important, and also important for changing food habits in the country, lying to my parents is worse than not eating meat. While they are alive, I won’t eat meat. When they are gone and I am free, I will eat meat openly. But until then, I will stop eating meat.” I told my friend about this decision, and I have never gone back to eating meat. My parents never knew that two of their sons had started eating meat.

I stopped eating meat because I didn’t want to lie to my parents, but I didn’t stop hanging out with my friend. Trying to change him caused me problems, but I didn’t realize it at the time.

Being with my friend could have made me cheat on my wife. But I was saved just in time. One time, my friend took me to a brothel. He told me what to do, and everything was planned. The payment was already made. I went into a place full of sin, but God kindly protected me from myself. I was almost shocked and speechless there. I sat next to the woman on her bed but couldn’t say a word. She got angry with me and kicked me out, yelling bad words. I felt like my pride was hurt, and I wanted to disappear out of shame. But I have always thanked God for saving me. I remember four more times like this in my life, and mostly it was luck, not my own effort, that saved me. From a moral point of view, these moments were still mistakes because the desire was there, and that is almost the same as doing the wrong thing.
