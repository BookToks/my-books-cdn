We bought this too, and it cost us a thousand pounds in total.

The late Mr. Rustomji always supported me in projects like this. He liked the idea. He gave me old corrugated iron sheets from a big warehouse and other building materials, so we could start working. Some Indian carpenters and masons who had worked with me during the Boer War helped me build a shed for the press. This building was 75 feet long and 50 feet wide, and it was finished in less than a month.

Mr. West and others stayed with the workers even though it was risky. The place was empty, covered with tall grass, full of snakes, and clearly not safe to live in. At first, everyone lived in tents. We moved most of our things to Phoenix in about a week. Phoenix was fourteen miles from Durban and two and a half miles from Phoenix station.

Only one issue of Indian Opinion had to be printed outside, at the Mercury press.

I then tried to bring to Phoenix the relatives and friends who had come with me from India to find success. They were busy with their own businesses and looking for money, so it was hard to convince them, but some agreed. Among them, I can especially mention Manganlal Gandhi. The others went back to their businesses.

Manganlal Gandhi gave up his business forever to join me. Because of his skill, sacrifice, and dedication, he became one of my closest original helpers in my ethical experiments. As a self-taught craftsman, he was unique among them.

Thatâ€™s how the Phoenix Settlement started in 1904. Despite many challenges, Indian Opinion has kept being published there.

But the early problems, changes, hopes, and disappointments need a whole separate chapter.
