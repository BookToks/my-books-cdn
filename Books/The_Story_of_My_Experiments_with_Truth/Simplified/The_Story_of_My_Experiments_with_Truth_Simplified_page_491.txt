Maulana Mahomed Ali used to write me long letters from Betul and Chhindwada whenever his jailers let him. I asked for permission to visit the Brothers, but it didn’t work.

After the Ali Brothers were put in jail, some Muslim friends invited me to a Muslim League meeting in Calcutta. They asked me to speak, so I told them that Muslims should work to get the Brothers released. Soon after, these friends took me to the Muslim College at Aligarh. There, I asked the young men to dedicate themselves to serving the country.

Next, I started writing to the Government to ask for the Brothers’ release. While doing this, I learned about their ideas and work on the Khilafat issue. I talked with Muslim friends and felt that if I wanted to be a true friend to Muslims, I should help get the Brothers out of jail and support a fair solution to the Khilafat problem. I didn’t need to fully agree or disagree with the issue, as long as their demands weren’t wrong. People believe different things about religion, and everyone thinks their own beliefs are the most important. If we all believed the same thing, there would be just one religion in the world. 

As time went on, I saw that the Muslim demands about the Khilafat were not against any good moral principles. Even the British Prime Minister said their demands were fair. So, I felt I had to help make sure the Prime Minister kept his promise. His promise was so clear that I only needed to check the demands to feel right about helping.

Some friends and critics didn’t like how I acted about the Khilafat question.

Even with the criticism, I don’t feel I should change my mind or be sorry for working with the Muslims. I would do the same thing again if a similar situation came up.

So, when I went to Delhi, I planned to tell the Viceroy about the Muslim case. The Khilafat issue wasn’t as serious then as it became later.

But when I got to Delhi, another problem came up that made it hard for me to go to the conference.
