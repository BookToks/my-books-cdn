Back then, some people thought tea and coffee were bad for you and said cocoa was better. Since I believed you should only eat things that help your body, I stopped drinking tea and coffee and started drinking cocoa instead.

The restaurants I went to had two sections. One was for richer people, where you could pick many dishes and pay for each one, and dinner cost one to two shillings. The other section had three-course dinners with bread for sixpence. When I was saving money, I usually ate in the cheaper section.

I also tried some small experiments with my diet. For example, I once stopped eating starchy foods, another time I ate only bread and fruit, and once I ate only cheese, milk, and eggs. That last experiment didn’t last even two weeks. Someone who didn’t eat starch said eggs weren’t meat and were okay to eat because no animals were hurt. I believed that and ate eggs, even though I had promised not to. But it didn’t last long. I realized I wasn’t following my promise properly. My mother, who helped me keep the promise, said eggs counted as meat. Once I understood that, I stopped eating eggs and ended that experiment.

There’s an interesting point about what counts as meat. In England, I found three ideas. The first said meat means only the flesh of birds and animals, so vegetarians who believed this ate fish and eggs. The second said meat means the flesh of all living things, so no fish but eggs were okay. The third said meat includes all flesh and all products from animals, like eggs and milk. If I believed the first idea, I could eat eggs and fish. But I knew my mother’s idea was the right one for me. So, to keep my promise, I had to stop eating eggs.
