WHEN I GOT TO POONA WITH GOKHALE

As soon as I reached Bombay, Gokhale told me that the Governor wanted to see me and that it would be good to meet him before I left for Poona. So, I went to see His Excellency. After the usual greetings, he said, "I want you to come and see me whenever you plan to do anything about the Government."

I answered, "I can promise that easily because, as a Satyagrahi, I always try to understand the other side and agree with them as much as possible. I followed this rule in South Africa and will do the same here."

Lord Willingdon thanked me and said, "You can come to me anytime, and you'll see that my Government doesn’t do anything wrong on purpose." I replied, "That trust is what keeps me going."

After that, I went to Poona. I can’t write down all the special memories from that time. Gokhale and the members of the Servants of India Society showed me a lot of love. I think Gokhale brought them all together to meet me. We had open talks about everything.

Gokhale really wanted me to join the Society, and I wanted to too. But the members thought that since my ideas and ways of working were very different from theirs, it might not be right for me to join.

Gokhale believed that even though I stuck to my own principles, I was also willing and able to accept theirs.

"But," he said, "the members of the Society don’t yet understand how willing you are to compromise. They hold tightly to their principles and are very independent. I hope they will accept you, but if they don’t, don’t think for a second that they don’t respect or love you."
