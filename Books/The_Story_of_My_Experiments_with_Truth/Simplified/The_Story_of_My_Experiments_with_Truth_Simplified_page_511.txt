THAT MEMORABLE WEEK! – I

After a short trip in South India, I reached Bombay, probably on April 4th. I had gotten a message from Sjt. Shankarlal Banker asking me to be there for the celebrations on April 6th.

But before that, Delhi had already done the hartal on March 30th.

The words of the late Swami Shraddhanandji and Hakim Ajmal Khan Saheb were very important there. The message about postponing the hartal to April 6th arrived too late. Delhi had never seen a hartal like this before. Hindus and Muslims seemed united as one. Swami Shraddhanandji was even invited to give a speech in the Jumma Masjid, which he did. This was more than the authorities could handle. The police stopped the hartal procession as it went to the railway station and opened fire, hurting many people. This started a time of harsh control in Delhi. Shraddhanandji urgently called me to come to Delhi. I replied that I would go right after the April 6th celebrations in Bombay.

Similar events happened in Lahore and Amritsar with some changes. From Amritsar, Drs. Satyapal and Kitchlu sent me an urgent invitation to visit. I didn’t know them then but told them I planned to come after Delhi.

On the morning of April 6th, many people in Bombay gathered at Chowpati to bathe in the sea. After that, they joined a procession to Thakurdvar. The procession had many women and children, and many Muslims joined too. At Thakurdvar, some Muslim friends took us to a nearby mosque where Mrs. Naidu and I were asked to give speeches. Sjt. Vithaldas Jerajani suggested that we should give the Swadeshi and Hindu-Muslim unity pledges right then, but I said no. I thought pledges shouldn’t be taken too quickly and that people were already doing enough by their actions.
