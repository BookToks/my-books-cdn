The wife of the Police Superintendent, who knew me, happened to be passing by. The brave lady came up, opened her parasol even though there was no sun, and stood between the crowd and me. This stopped the angry mob because it was hard for them to hit me without hurting Mrs. Alexander.

Meanwhile, an Indian young man who saw what was happening ran to the police station. The Police Superintendent, Mr. Alexander, sent a group of men to surround me and take me safely to where I needed to go. They got there just in time. The police station was on our way. When we arrived, the Superintendent asked me to stay inside the station for safety, but I politely said no. I believed the crowd would calm down once they realized their mistake. I trusted them to be fair.

With the police protecting me, I reached Mr. Rustomji’s place without any more trouble. I had bruises all over, but only one small scrape.

Dr. Dadibarjor, the ship’s doctor who was nearby, helped me as best as he could.

Inside the house, it was quiet, but outside, white people surrounded the place. Night was coming, and the yelling crowd shouted, “We want Gandhi.” The smart Police Superintendent was already there trying to control the crowd, not by threatening them, but by calming them down. But he was still worried. He sent me a message: “If you want to save your friend’s house and family, you should escape from the house in disguise, like I suggest.” So, on the same day, I faced two very different situations.

When the danger to my life seemed imaginary, Mr. Laughton told me to go out openly. I agreed. When the danger was very real, another friend told me to hide, and I agreed too. Who can say if I did the right thing by standing up to the crowd bravely at first or by escaping in disguise later? Maybe I did it because my life was really in danger, or maybe because I didn’t want to risk my friend’s house or my family’s safety. No one can know for sure.

It’s pointless to judge right or wrong about things that have already happened.
