I probably shouldn’t have gone to that officer, but his anger was way too much for such a small mistake. It didn’t deserve kicking me out. I’m sure I only took about five minutes of his time. But he just couldn’t stand me talking. He could have asked me nicely to leave, but he was so full of power that he acted like a bossy jerk. Later, I found out that being patient wasn’t one of his good qualities. He usually insulted people who came to see him. Even a tiny problem would make him lose his temper.

Most of my work had to be done in his court. I couldn’t make him like me, and I didn’t want to try either. In fact, I had once threatened to take action against him, so I didn’t want to just keep quiet.

While all this was happening, I started learning about the small, messy politics in the country.

Kathiawad was made up of many little states, so there were lots of political dramas. Small fights between states and power struggles among officers happened all the time. The princes were often controlled by others and liked listening to flattery. Even the officer’s messenger had to be persuaded, and the officer’s assistant, called the shirastedar, was more powerful than his boss. The shirastedar was like the officer’s eyes, ears, and translator. His word was law, and he was said to earn more than the officer himself. That might be an exaggeration, but he definitely lived better than his salary should allow.

This whole situation felt toxic to me, and I was always worried about how to stay safe in it.

I felt really down, and my brother noticed. We both thought that if I could find a different job, I could get away from all this drama. But without being involved in politics, I couldn’t get a good job like minister or judge. Also, my fight with the officer made it hard for me to work.

At that time, Probandar was under government control, and I had some tasks there, like trying to get more power for the prince. I also had to meet the Administrator about the high land rent charged to the Mers.
