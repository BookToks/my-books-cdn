The train got to Charlestown in the morning. Back then, there was no railway between Charlestown and Johannesburg, only a stagecoach that stopped overnight at Standerton. I had a ticket for the coach, and it wasn’t canceled even though I stopped for a day at Maritzburg. Also, Abdulla Sheth had sent a message to the coach agent at Charlestown.

But the agent just needed an excuse to refuse me. When he saw I was a stranger, he said, "Your ticket is canceled." I gave him the right answer. The real reason wasn’t that there was no room. Passengers had to sit inside the coach, but since I was seen as a 'coolie' and looked like a stranger, the leader—the white man in charge—thought it was okay not to seat me with the white passengers. The coach had seats on each side of the coachbox. Usually, the leader sat on one of these seats. That day, he sat inside and gave me his seat. I knew this was unfair and an insult, but I thought it was better to accept it. I couldn’t force my way inside, and if I had complained, the coach would have left without me. That would have wasted another day, and who knows what would have happened next. So, even though I was upset inside, I wisely sat next to the coachman.

Around three o’clock, the coach reached Pardekoph. The leader wanted to sit where I was because he wanted to smoke and get some fresh air. He took a piece of dirty sackcloth from the driver, spread it on the footboard, and said to me, "Sami, you sit here, I want to sit near the driver." This insult was too much for me. Nervously, I said, "You were the one who made me sit here, even though I should have been inside. I accepted the insult. Now you want to sit outside and smoke, and you expect me to sit at your feet? I won’t do that, but I’m ready to sit inside." As I said this, the man came down on me and started hitting my ears hard.
