GETTING INTO THE VILLAGES

We tried to put one man and one woman in charge of each school. These volunteers had to take care of basic medical help and cleanliness. Women in the villages had to be reached out to through other women.

The medical help was very simple. The volunteers only had castor oil, quinine, and sulphur ointment to use. If someone had a coated tongue or was constipated, they gave castor oil. If someone had a fever, they gave quinine after a dose of castor oil. For boils and itching, they used sulphur ointment after cleaning the skin well. No one was allowed to take medicine home.

If there was a serious problem, Dr. Dev was called. He visited each center on certain days every week.

Many people used this simple medical help. This plan worked well because the common sicknesses were few and easy to treat, so expert doctors were not always needed. The people liked this system a lot.

Keeping the villages clean was harder. People did not want to do the work themselves. Even the farm workers didn’t want to clean up after themselves. But Dr. Dev didn’t give up. He and the volunteers worked hard to make a village very clean. They swept roads and yards, cleaned wells, filled in pools, and convinced villagers to choose volunteers from among themselves. In some places, they made people feel guilty until they helped, and in others, people were so excited they even fixed roads so my car could reach their village. These good moments were mixed with bad ones when some villagers openly said they didn’t like this work.

I want to share a story I have told before at many meetings. Bhitiharva was a small village where one of our schools was located.
