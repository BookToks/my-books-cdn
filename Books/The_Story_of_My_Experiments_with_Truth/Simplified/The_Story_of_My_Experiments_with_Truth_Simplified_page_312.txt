Many things in my life have brought me close to people from different religions and communities. From my experience, I have never seen a difference between family and strangers, people from my country or from other places, white or colored, Hindus or people of other faiths like Muslims, Parsis, Christians, or Jews. My heart just does not make these kinds of differences. I don’t think this is a special skill, it’s just who I am. But for things like non-violence, celibacy, and not owning too much, I know I have to keep working hard to improve.

When I was working in Durban, my office helpers often stayed at my house. Some were Hindus, some were Christians, and they came from different places like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. I never thought of them as anything but family. I treated them like my own people, and I argued with my wife if she tried to stop me from doing that. One helper was a Christian, but he was born into a very low caste, called Panchama.

Our house was built in a Western style, so the rooms didn’t have pipes for dirty water. Each room had a chamber pot. Instead of having a servant or cleaner wash the pots, my wife or I would clean them ourselves.

The helpers who were used to the house would clean their own pots. But the Christian helper was new, so it was our job to clean his pot. My wife cleaned the others’ pots, but she didn’t want to clean the one used by the person from the Panchama caste. This caused fights between us. She couldn’t stand me cleaning that pot, and she didn’t want to do it herself. I still remember her angry face, her eyes red and tears falling, as she went down the stairs holding the pot. But I was a strict husband. I thought I was teaching her something, so I pushed her because I loved her, even if it was hard.
