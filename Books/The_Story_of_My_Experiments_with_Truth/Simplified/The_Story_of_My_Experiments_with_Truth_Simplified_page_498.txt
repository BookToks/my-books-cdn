Right now, we are not part of the partnership. Our commitment is based on hope for a better future. I would be dishonest to you and my country if I didn’t clearly tell you what that hope is. I don’t expect it to happen easily, but if that hope is crushed, it will lead to disappointment and loss of trust.

There’s one important thing I can’t leave out. You’ve asked us to put aside our personal differences. But if that means accepting unfair treatment or bad actions by officials, I can’t agree. I will fight against organized injustice with everything I have. The request should be that officials do not mistreat anyone and that they listen to and respect the people more than ever before. In Champaran, by standing up to long-lasting unfairness, I showed that British justice can be fair. In Kheda, people who once hated the government now feel that they hold the real power when they are willing to suffer for what is right. Because of this, they are losing their anger and thinking the government should be for the people, since it allows peaceful and respectful protest against injustice. So, my work in Champaran and Kheda is my clear and special way of helping the war effort.

If you ask me to stop working toward this, it would be like asking me to stop living. If I can teach people to use ‘soul-force,’ which means love and non-violence, instead of physical force, I believe I could help create an India that could stand strong against any challenge. I will keep practicing and showing this idea of suffering for truth at all times, and if I do anything else, it is to prove how powerful this way is.

Finally, I want you to ask His Majesty’s Ministers to clearly promise to protect the Muslim States. I know every Muslim cares deeply about them. As a Hindu, I cannot ignore their cause.
