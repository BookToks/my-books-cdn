I believe that true love can overcome any challenge.

I already talked about one thing that helped me avoid the problems of lustful love. There is another important point. Many examples have shown me that God helps those whose intentions are pure. In Hindu society, besides the harsh custom of child marriages, there is another tradition that helps reduce some of the problems caused by child marriage. Parents don’t let young couples spend a lot of time together. The child-wife usually spends more than half her time at her parents’ home. This was true for us too. During the first five years of our marriage (from ages 13 to 18), we lived together for only about three years in total.

We rarely spent more than six months together before her parents would call her back. Those calls were annoying at the time, but they actually helped us both. When I was eighteen, I went to England, which meant we were apart for a long and healthy time. Even after I came back, we didn’t stay together for more than six months at a time because I had to travel a lot between Rajkot and Bombay. Later, I received a call to go to South Africa, and by then, I was already less bothered by physical desires.
