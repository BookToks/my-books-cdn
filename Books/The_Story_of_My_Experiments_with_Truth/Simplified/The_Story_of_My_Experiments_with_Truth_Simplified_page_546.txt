From the very beginning, the Khadi movement, which was called the Swadeshi movement back then, got a lot of criticism from the mill-owners. Umar Sobani, who was a smart mill-owner, not only shared his own knowledge and experience with me but also kept me updated on what other mill-owners thought. One argument from a mill-owner really caught his attention. He asked me to meet this man, and I agreed. Mr. Sobani set up the meeting.

The mill-owner started the talk.

“You know there was a Swadeshi protest before, right?”  
“Yes, I do,” I answered.

“You also know that during the Partition, we mill-owners took full advantage of the Swadeshi movement. When it was at its peak, we raised cloth prices and did even worse things.”  
“Yes, I heard about that, and it made me sad.”  
“I get why you’re sad, but I don’t see why. We don’t run our business to be kind, we do it to make money and please the shareholders. The price depends on how much people want the product. Who can stop the law of demand and supply? The Bengalis should have known that their protest would make Swadeshi cloth more expensive because more people wanted it.”  

I interrupted, “Bengalis like me were trusting by nature. We truly believed the mill-owners wouldn’t be so selfish and unpatriotic to betray their country when it needed them most, or even go so far as to trick people by selling foreign cloth as Swadeshi.”  

“I knew you were trusting,” he said. “That’s why I asked you to come, so I could warn you not to make the same mistake as these simple-hearted Bengalis.”  

With that, the mill-owner called his clerk, who was standing nearby, to show samples of the cloth made in his mill.
