I know that neither my belief nor my doubt was based on solid proof, but I still remember the feeling I had back then, so I thought I should mention it here.

When the plague started, I wrote a strong letter to the newspaper blaming the Municipality for being careless after they took charge of the area. I said they were responsible for the plague outbreak. This letter helped me meet Mr. Henry Polak and also helped me become friends with the late Rev. Joseph Doke.

I mentioned before that I used to eat at a vegetarian restaurant. That’s where I met Mr. Albert West. We would meet there every evening and go for walks after dinner. Mr. West worked at a small printing company. He read my letter about the plague in the newspaper, and when he didn’t see me at the restaurant, he got worried.

Since the plague started, my friends and I were eating less because I always tried to eat light during epidemics. So, I stopped having dinner in the evening and made sure to finish lunch before other guests came. I knew the restaurant owner well and told him I wanted to avoid meeting friends because I was busy taking care of plague patients.

After not seeing me for a couple of days, Mr. West came to my house early one morning while I was getting ready for a walk. When I opened the door, he said, “I didn’t find you at the restaurant and was really worried something might have happened to you. So I came early to make sure you were okay. I’m here to help with nursing the patients. I don’t have anyone depending on me.” I thanked him and quickly replied, “I won’t have you as a nurse. If no new cases come up, we’ll be done in a day or two. But there is one thing.” “Yes, what is it?”
