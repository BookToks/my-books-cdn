In April 1893, I was excited to try my luck in South Africa.

Our first stop was Lamu, which we reached in about thirteen days. By then, the Captain and I had become good friends. He liked playing chess, but since he was still learning, he wanted an even newer player to play with. So, he asked me to be his partner. I had heard a lot about chess but never played before. People said it was a game that made you think a lot. The Captain offered to teach me, and I was a good student because I was very patient. I lost every time, which made him want to teach me even more. I liked the game, but I only played it on the boat and only knew the basic moves.

At Lamu, the ship stayed anchored for about three to four hours, so I went ashore to see the port. The Captain went ashore too, but he warned me that the harbor was dangerous and told me to come back on time.

Lamu was a very small place. I went to the Post Office and was happy to see Indian clerks working there. I talked with them and also met some Africans. I tried to learn about their way of life, which interested me a lot.

This took up some time.

I had met some other passengers on the ship who had gone ashore to cook their food and eat quietly. I saw them getting ready to return to the ship, so we all got into the same boat. The tide was high, and our boat was overloaded. The current was so strong that we couldn’t keep the boat steady by the ship’s ladder. The boat would touch the ladder but then be pulled away by the water. The first whistle for the ship to leave had already blown. I was worried. The Captain saw what was happening from the bridge and ordered the ship to wait five more minutes. A friend hired another boat nearby for me for ten rupees. This boat picked me up from the crowded one. The ladder had already been pulled up, so I had to be pulled up to the ship with a rope, and then the ship left right away.
