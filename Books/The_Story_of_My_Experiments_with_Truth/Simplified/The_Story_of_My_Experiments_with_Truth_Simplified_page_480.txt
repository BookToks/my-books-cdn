It would be enough if you could keep your promise. You know we have no money, and we don’t want to keep striking while relying on help from others. So, you should try to do some kind of work to earn just enough to get by. This way, you won’t worry no matter how long the strike lasts. As for my fast, I will only stop it once the strike is over.

Meanwhile, Vallabhbhai was trying to find jobs for the strikers with the local government, but it didn’t look very hopeful.

Maganlal Gandhi suggested that since we needed sand to build the foundation for our weaving school in the Ashram, some of the strikers could be hired to carry sand. The workers liked the idea. Anasuyabehn led the way, carrying a basket of sand on her head, and soon many workers were carrying baskets of sand from the riverbed. It was an amazing sight. The workers felt stronger and happier, and it became hard to keep up with paying their wages.

My fast wasn’t perfect either. As I said before, I had a good relationship with the mill owners, and my fasting could influence their decision. As a Satyagrahi, I knew I shouldn’t fast against them directly, but let the strike of the workers affect them. I was fasting not because of what the mill owners did, but because of the workers’ mistakes, since I felt responsible for them as their leader. With the mill owners, I could only ask nicely; fasting against them would be like forcing them. Still, even knowing my fast would pressure them, I felt I had to do it. It was my duty.

I tried to make the mill owners feel comfortable. “You don’t have to change your mind,” I told them. But they ignored me and even made sharp, sneaky jokes, which they had the right to do.

The main person behind the mill owners’ stubborn attitude toward the strike was Sheth Ambalal.
