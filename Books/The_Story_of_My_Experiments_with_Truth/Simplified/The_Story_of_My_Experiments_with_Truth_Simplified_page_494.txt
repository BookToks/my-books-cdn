I wanted to save time, but I didn’t want to send the letter with just anyone. I wanted a good, honest person to deliver it in person to the Viceregal Lodge. Dinabandhu Andrews and Principal Rudra suggested Reverend Ireland from the Cambridge Mission. He agreed to carry the letter if he could read it first and liked it. I had no problem with that because the letter wasn’t private. He read it, liked it, and said he would deliver it. I offered to pay for a second-class ticket, but he said he usually traveled in the intermediate class, even for night trips. I liked how simple and straightforward he was.

Because the letter was delivered by a good person, I felt it worked well. It made me feel better and cleared the way ahead.

The next part of my task was to find people to join the cause. Where else could I start but in Kheda? And who else could I ask first but my own friends and helpers? As soon as I got to Nadiad, I met with Vallabhbhai and others. Some didn’t like the idea right away. Those who liked it still weren’t sure it would work. People didn’t trust the government because they had bad experiences with officials before.

Still, they agreed to start the work. When I began, I realized things weren’t going to be easy. I was shocked. During the earlier campaign, people happily gave their carts for free and volunteers came in quickly. Now, it was hard even to rent a cart, and volunteers were few. But we didn’t give up.

We decided not to use carts and to walk everywhere instead. We had to walk about 20 miles a day. Without carts, it was unlikely people would feed us, and it didn’t feel right to ask for food. So, we decided every volunteer would carry their own food in their bags. We didn’t need bedding or sheets because it was summer.

We held meetings wherever we went.
