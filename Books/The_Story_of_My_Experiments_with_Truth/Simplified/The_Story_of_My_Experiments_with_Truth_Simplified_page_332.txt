“Could you take charge of the Indian Opinion press in Durban? Mr. Madanjit will probably be busy here, and someone is needed in Durban. If you can go, I would feel much better about it.”  
“You know I have a press. I will probably be able to go, but can I give you my final answer in the evening? We can talk about it during our evening walk.”  

I was really happy. We talked, and he agreed to go. Money didn’t matter to him because that wasn’t his goal. But we decided on a salary of £10 per month plus a share of any profits.  

The very next day, Mr. West left for Durban on the evening mail, leaving me to collect the money owed. From that day until I left South Africa, he was a partner in both my happiness and my troubles.  

Mr. West came from a farming family in Louth, Lincolnshire. He had a normal school education but learned a lot through experience and working hard on his own. I have always known him to be a good, sober, kind, and religious Englishman.  

We will learn more about him and his family in the next chapters.
