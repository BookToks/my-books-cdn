Through these women, we could reach the village women a little bit.

But I didn’t want to stop at just giving basic education. The villages were dirty, the streets full of trash, the wells surrounded by mud and bad smells, and the yards very messy. The older people really needed to learn about cleanliness. They all had different skin diseases. So, we decided to do as much cleaning work as possible and get involved in every part of their lives.

We needed doctors for this work. I asked the Servants of India Society to help us with Dr. Dev. We were good friends, and he agreed to help for six months. The teachers – both men and women – had to work under him.

Everyone was told not to get involved with complaints against the planters or politics. If people had any problems, they were to tell me. No one was allowed to go outside their area. The team followed these rules very well. I don’t remember any time when they didn’t listen.
