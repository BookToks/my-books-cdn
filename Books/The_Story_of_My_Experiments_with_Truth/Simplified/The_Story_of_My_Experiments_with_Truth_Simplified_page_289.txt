I had packed my bags and was ready to go. I thanked Superintendent Alexander and left for Pretoria.

I understood the problems I might face ahead. When I got to Pretoria, I wrote the memorial.

The Indians in Pretoria already knew the officers wanted to keep me out.

But another part of this sad yet funny story needs to be told.
