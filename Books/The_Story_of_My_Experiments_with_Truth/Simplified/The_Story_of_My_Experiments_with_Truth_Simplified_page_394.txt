The friends who disagreed thought it was the right time to boldly state what Indians wanted and to improve their position.

But I believed that we shouldn’t use England’s need during the war to push our demands. It was better and smarter not to ask for anything while the war was going on. So, I gave my advice and asked anyone willing to join as volunteers. Many people joined, from almost every province and religion.

I wrote a letter to Lord Crewe, telling him about this and saying we were ready to be trained for ambulance work if that was needed before accepting our offer.

Lord Crewe accepted our offer after some doubt and thanked us for offering help to the Empire at such an important time.

The volunteers started their first aid training with the famous Dr. Cantlie. The course lasted six weeks and covered everything about first aid.

We were about 80 people in the class. After six weeks, we took a test and all but one passed. The government then gave us military drill and other training. Colonel Baker was in charge of this.

London was an amazing sight then. There was no fear, but everyone was busy helping as best they could. Adults who could fight started training, but what about the old, weak, and women? They found work by making clothes and bandages for the wounded.

The Lyceum, a women’s club, decided to make as many clothes as possible for the soldiers. Shrimati Sarojini Naidu was part of this club and worked very hard on it. This was the first time I met her.

She showed me a pile of clothes cut into pieces and asked me to sew them together and give them back. I liked her request and, with the help of friends, made as many clothes as I could while training for first aid.
