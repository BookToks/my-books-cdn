I had given up hope of going back to India anytime soon. I had promised my wife I would be home within a year. But the year passed with no chance of returning, so I decided to send for her and the kids.

On the boat bringing them to South Africa, my third son Ramdas broke his arm while playing with the ship's captain. The captain took good care of him and the ship’s doctor treated the arm. Ramdas arrived with his arm in a sling. The doctor said we should have a real doctor look at it as soon as we got home. But at that time, I believed strongly in my experiments with earth treatment. I had even convinced some clients to try my earth and water treatment.

What could I do for Ramdas? He was only eight. I asked if he would let me treat his arm. He smiled and said yes. Even though he was young and couldn’t decide what was best, he knew the difference between real medicine and my home treatments. He trusted me. Nervously, I took off the bandage, cleaned the wound, put a clean earth poultice on it, and wrapped his arm again.

I did this every day for about a month until the wound healed. It healed as quickly as the doctor had said it would with normal treatment.

This and other experiments made me believe more in these home remedies. I started using earth, water, and fasting treatments for wounds, fevers, stomach problems, jaundice, and other illnesses. Most of the time, it worked. But now, I don’t have the same confidence I had in South Africa. Experience has shown me these experiments can be risky.

So, when I talk about these experiments, I’m not trying to say they always work.
