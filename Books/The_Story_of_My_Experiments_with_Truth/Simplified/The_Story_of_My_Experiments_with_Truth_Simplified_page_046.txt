From a normal point of view, a person who doesn’t actually do something wrong is seen as saved. I was saved only in that way. Sometimes, avoiding certain actions is a real blessing both for the person who avoids them and for the people around them.

When a person realizes what is right again, they feel thankful to God for helping them escape trouble. We know people often give in to temptation, even if they say they won’t. But sometimes, something bigger than us helps save them anyway. How this works—how much freedom we have and how much is decided by fate—is a mystery that will stay unknown.

Now, to continue my story. Even after this, I didn’t see how bad my friend’s influence really was. I still had many tough experiences ahead before I finally saw his true nature clearly. I will tell you about those later, as the story goes on.

But there is one thing I must say now, because it happened during that time.

One reason I fought with my wife was because of this friend. I loved my wife but was also very jealous, and my friend made me more suspicious of her. I always trusted what he said. I have never forgiven myself for acting violently and hurting my wife because of what he told me. Maybe only a Hindu wife would put up with this. That’s why I think women are the most patient people. If a servant is wrongly accused, they might quit their job. A son might leave his father’s house. A friend might end a friendship. But if a wife is suspected by her husband, she suffers the most. Where can she go? A Hindu wife can’t ask for a divorce in court. The law doesn’t help her.

I will never forget or forgive myself for causing my wife so much pain.

The poison of suspicion only went away when I truly understood the idea of non-violence (Ahimsa) in every way.
