Abdulla Sheth warned me. "Look," he said, "this country is different from India.

Thank God, we have plenty of everything here. Please don’t hold back on anything you need." I thanked him and told him not to worry.

The train reached Maritzburg, the capital of Natal, around 9 p.m. They usually gave out bedding at this station. A railway worker came and asked if I wanted some. "No," I said, "I have my own." He left. But then another passenger came, looked at me carefully, and saw that I was a 'coloured' man.

This upset him. He left and came back with one or two officials.

They stayed quiet until another official came and said, "Come with me, you have to go to the van compartment." "But I have a first-class ticket," I said.

"That doesn’t matter," he replied. "You must go to the van compartment." "I was allowed to travel here at Durban, and I want to stay here," I said. "No, you won’t," said the official. "You have to leave now, or I’ll call a police officer to make you." "Go ahead. I won’t leave on my own." The police officer came, took me by the hand, and pushed me out. They took my luggage out too. I refused to go to the other compartment, and the train left without me. I sat in the waiting room with my handbag, leaving the rest of my luggage where the railway people had taken it.

It was winter, and winters in high places in South Africa are very cold.

Maritzburg is high up, so the cold was really harsh. My overcoat was in my luggage, but I didn’t ask for it because I was afraid of being insulted again. So I just sat there, shivering. The room had no light. Around midnight, a passenger came in and maybe wanted to talk to me.
