The day finally came. It’s hard to explain exactly how I felt. On one side, I was excited about making a big change in my life. On the other side, I felt ashamed because I had to hide like a thief to do it. I don’t know which feeling was stronger.

My friend and I went to a quiet place by the river. There, I saw meat for the first time in my life. There was also some bread. I didn’t like either. The goat’s meat was really tough, and I couldn’t eat it. I felt sick and had to stop.

That night was really bad. I had a terrible nightmare. Every time I started to fall asleep, it felt like a goat was bleating inside me, and I would wake up feeling sorry. But then I reminded myself that eating meat was the right thing to do, and I felt a little better.

My friend didn’t give up easily. He started cooking different tasty meat dishes and made them look nice. Instead of eating by the river, we now ate at a State house dining hall, with tables and chairs. My friend had made a secret deal with the head cook there.

This plan worked. I stopped hating bread, gave up feeling sorry for the goats, and began to enjoy meat dishes, even if I didn’t love the meat itself. This went on for about a year. But we only had about six meat meals in total. The State house wasn’t available every day, and it was hard to make fancy, expensive meat dishes often. I didn’t have money to pay for this change. My friend always found a way to pay, but I didn’t know how. He was determined to make me eat meat. But since money was limited, these special meals had to be rare.

Whenever I ate these secret meals, I couldn’t eat dinner at home.
