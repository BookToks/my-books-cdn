I started my trip from Bombay. Mr. Jehangir Petit agreed to organize the meeting for the Imperial Citizenship Association. The Executive Committee of the Association met first to decide the resolutions for the meeting. Dr. Stanley Reed, Sjt. (now Sir) Lallubhai Samaldas, Sjt. Natarajan, and Mr. Petit were there.

The main topic was setting a deadline for the Government to end the system. There were three ideas: end it "as soon as possible," end it "by July 31st," or end it "immediately." I wanted a clear date so we could plan what to do if the Government didn’t agree by then.

Sjt. Lallubhai wanted it ended "immediately." He said "immediate" meant sooner than July 31st. I told him people wouldn’t understand what "immediate" really meant. If we wanted people to act, the word had to be clear. Everyone would understand July 31st the same way, but "immediate" could mean different things to different people, like the Government and the public. If nothing happened by July 31st, we could take further steps. Dr. Reed agreed, and eventually, Sjt. Lallubhai did too. We chose July 31st as the final date to announce abolition. A resolution was passed at the public meeting, and meetings all over India agreed.

Mrs. Jaiji Petit worked hard to organize a group of women to meet the Viceroy. Some women from Bombay in the group were Lady Tata and the late Dilshad Begam. The meeting had a big impact. The Viceroy gave a hopeful reply.

I went to Karachi, Calcutta, and other places. The meetings were great everywhere, and people were very excited. I didn’t expect such strong support when we started.

Back then, I traveled alone and had amazing experiences.

The C.I.D. men were always following me. But since I had nothing to hide, they didn’t bother me, and I didn’t cause them any trouble.
