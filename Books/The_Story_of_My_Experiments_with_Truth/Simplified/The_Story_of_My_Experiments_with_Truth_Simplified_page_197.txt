The language I used was calmer than the two pamphlets I mentioned before because I knew things heard from far away often seem worse than they really are.

Ten thousand copies were printed and sent to all the newspapers and leaders of every party in India. The Pioneer was the first to write about it in an editorial. Reuter sent a summary of the article to England, and then Reuter's London office sent a shorter summary to Natal. This message was very short, only three lines in print. It made the situation of Indians in Natal seem bigger than I described, and it wasn’t in my own words. We will see later what effect this had in Natal. Meanwhile, every important paper talked a lot about the issue.

Getting these pamphlets ready to send out was not easy. It also would have cost a lot if I had paid someone to prepare the wrappers and other things.

But I found a simpler way. I gathered all the children in my neighborhood and asked them to volunteer two or three hours one morning when they didn’t have school. They happily agreed. I promised to bless them and give them used postage stamps I had collected as a reward.

They finished the work quickly. That was my first time having little children help as volunteers. Two of those kids still work with me today.

At about this time, a plague started in Bombay, causing panic everywhere.

People were afraid it might spread to Rajkot. Since I thought I could help with cleaning and health, I offered to work for the State. They accepted, and I joined the committee set up to deal with the problem. I focused especially on keeping latrines clean. The committee decided to check latrines on every street. Poor people didn’t mind the inspections and even made the improvements we suggested. But when we tried to check the houses of rich people, some wouldn’t even let us in or listen to our advice. We often found that the rich people’s latrines were dirtier than the poor people’s.
