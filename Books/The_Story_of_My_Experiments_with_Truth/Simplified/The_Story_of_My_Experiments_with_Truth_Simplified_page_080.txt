As I thought more about myself, I realized I needed to change both inside and outside. Right when I started changing how I spent money and lived, I also began to change my diet. I noticed that writers about vegetarianism had looked at it very carefully. They studied it from religious, scientific, practical, and medical points of view.

They believed that humans shouldn’t hurt animals just because we are stronger. Instead, we should protect animals and help each other, like people do. They also said people eat to live, not just for fun. Some even stopped eating meat, eggs, and milk.

Scientifically, some said humans are meant to eat fruits and not cooked food, and that after drinking mother’s milk, we should start eating solid foods. Doctors suggested avoiding spices and sauces. Practically, they showed that eating vegetarian food costs less money. These ideas influenced me a lot. I met many kinds of vegetarians in vegetarian restaurants. There was even a Vegetarian Society in England with a weekly magazine. I subscribed to it, joined the group, and soon became part of the leaders. That’s when I began trying out different diets for myself.

I stopped eating sweets and sauces I used to get at home. Since my mind changed, I stopped liking sauces and started enjoying plain boiled spinach, even though before I thought it was boring without sauce. These experiments taught me that real taste comes from the mind, not just the tongue.

I always kept in mind that saving money was important too.
