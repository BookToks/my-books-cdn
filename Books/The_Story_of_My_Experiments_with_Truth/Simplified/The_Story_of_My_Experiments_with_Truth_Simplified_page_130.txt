The port of Natal is called Durban, also known as Port Natal. Abdulla Sheth was there to meet me. When the ship arrived and I saw people coming on board to meet their friends, I noticed that Indians were not treated with much respect. I could see that the people who knew Abdulla Sheth acted a bit snobby toward him, and it hurt me. Abdulla Sheth was used to it. The people who looked at me were curious. My clothes made me stand out from other Indians. I wore a frock-coat and a turban that looked like the Bengal pugree.

I was taken to the firm's office and shown the room for me, next to Abdulla Sheth’s. He didn’t understand me, and I couldn’t understand him.

He read the papers his brother sent through me and felt confused. He thought his brother had sent him something useless. My way of dressing and living seemed expensive, like the Europeans. There was no work for me to do then. Their case was going on in the Transvaal. It didn’t make sense to send me there right away. How could he trust me to be honest and do a good job? He wouldn’t be in Pretoria to watch me. The defendants were there, and they might try to influence me. If I couldn’t work on the case, what else could I do? The clerks did the work better. They could be punished if they made mistakes. But what if I made a mistake? Could I be punished? If I couldn’t be trusted with work, I would just be kept around for no reason.

Abdulla Sheth couldn’t read or write much, but he had a lot of experience.

He was very smart and knew it. He had learned enough English to talk and do business. He used it to deal with bank managers, European merchants, and explain his case to his lawyers. Indians respected him a lot. His firm was one of the biggest Indian firms at the time.
