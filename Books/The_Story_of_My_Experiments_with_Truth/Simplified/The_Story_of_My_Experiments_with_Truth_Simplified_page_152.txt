I stressed that it was important to forget all the differences like Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Christians, Gujaratis, Madrasis, Punjabis, Sindhis, Kachchhis, Suratis, and others.

At the end, I suggested starting a group to talk to the authorities about the problems faced by Indian settlers. I also said I would help as much as I could with my time and efforts.

I noticed that my speech made a strong impact on the people at the meeting.

After I spoke, there was a discussion. Some people offered to give me information. This made me feel hopeful.

I saw that most people there didn’t know English. Since I thought knowing English would be helpful in that country, I told those who had free time to try learning it. I said anyone could learn a new language, even if they were older, and gave examples of people who had done so. I also said I would teach a class or help individuals who wanted to learn English.

The class didn’t start, but three young men said they wanted to learn when they could, as long as I came to teach them. Two were Muslims – one a barber and the other a clerk – and the third was a Hindu who ran a small shop. I agreed to teach them all. I was confident I could teach well. Sometimes my students were busy when I visited, but I stayed patient. None of them wanted to study English deeply, but two made good progress in about eight months. Two learned enough to do their accounts and write normal business letters. The barber only wanted to learn enough English to talk to his customers. Because of their lessons, two of them were able to earn a good income.

I was happy with how the meeting turned out.
