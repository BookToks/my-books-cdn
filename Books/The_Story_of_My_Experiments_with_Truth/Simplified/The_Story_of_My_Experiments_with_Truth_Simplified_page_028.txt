CHILD MARRIAGE

I wish I didn’t have to write about this, but I have to tell the truth. It’s hard for me to say that I got married when I was only thirteen. When I see kids my age now, I feel sorry for myself and happy for them that they didn’t have to go through what I did. I don’t think there is any good reason to get married so young.

Let me be clear. I wasn’t just promised to be married; I was actually married. In Kathiawad, there are two different ceremonies – one is a promise called betrothal, and the other is marriage. Betrothal is when the parents agree to marry their children, but it’s not final. If the boy dies, the girl doesn’t become a widow. The kids don’t have anything to do with this promise, and sometimes they don’t even know about it. I was promised to marry three times without knowing. Two girls chosen for me died, so I guess I was engaged three times. I remember a little bit about the third promise when I was seven, but I don’t remember being told about it. In this chapter, I’m talking about my actual marriage, which I remember clearly.

We were three brothers. The oldest was already married. The family decided to marry my second brother, who was a little older than me, a cousin, and me, all at the same time.

They didn’t think about what was best for us or what we wanted. They only cared about what was easy and saved money for themselves.

Marriage in Hindu families is not simple. The parents of the bride and groom often spend too much money and time on it. It takes months to get ready by making clothes, jewelry, and planning big dinners.
