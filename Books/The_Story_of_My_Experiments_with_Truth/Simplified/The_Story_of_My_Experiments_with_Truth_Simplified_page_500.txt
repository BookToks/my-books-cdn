I almost ruined my health during the recruiting campaign. Back then, I mostly ate groundnut butter and lemons. I knew eating too much butter could be bad for me, but I still did it. This caused me to get a mild case of dysentery. I didn’t think it was serious and went to the Ashram that evening, like I usually did. I hardly took any medicine at that time. I believed that skipping a meal would help me get better, and I did feel a bit better when I skipped breakfast the next day. But I knew to fully recover, I needed to fast longer and only drink fruit juices if I ate anything.

There was a festival that day, and even though I told Kasturbai I wouldn’t eat lunch, she convinced me to eat. Since I had promised not to eat milk or milk products, she made me a sweet wheat porridge with oil instead of ghee.

She also saved a bowl of mung beans for me. I liked these foods, so I ate them, hoping I wouldn’t get sick and just wanted to please Kasturbai and enjoy the taste. But the trouble was waiting for a chance. Instead of eating just a little, I ate a lot. That was enough to make the dysentery come back strong in less than an hour.

That same evening, I had to go back to Nadiad. I struggled to walk to the Sabarmati station, which was only a short distance away. Vallabhbhai joined me in Ahmedabad and saw I was sick, but I didn’t let him know how much pain I was in.

We got to Nadiad around ten o’clock. Our headquarters, the Hindu Anathashram, was only half a mile from the station, but it felt much farther to me. I barely made it to the place, and the stomach pain kept getting worse. Instead of going to the usual bathroom, which was far away, I asked for a commode to be put in the next room.
