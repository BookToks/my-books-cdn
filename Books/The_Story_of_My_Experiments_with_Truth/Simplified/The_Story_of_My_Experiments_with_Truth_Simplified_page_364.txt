Kasturbai was very brave. Three times in her life, she almost died because she was very sick. Each time, home remedies helped her get better. 

The first time she got sick, Satyagraha was happening or about to start. She had bleeding often. A doctor friend said she needed surgery. She agreed after thinking about it. She was very weak, so the doctor did the operation without chloroform. It worked, but she was in a lot of pain. She stayed very strong through it all. The doctor and his wife took good care of her. This happened in Durban. The doctor told me I could go to Johannesburg and not to worry about her.

But after a few days, I got a letter saying Kasturbai was worse. She was too weak to sit up and had even fainted once. The doctor knew he couldn’t give her wine or meat without my okay. So he called me in Johannesburg to ask if it was okay to give her beef tea. I said no, but if she could decide, she could choose what she wanted. The doctor said he wouldn’t ask her and told me I had to come or let him decide. If I didn’t, he wouldn’t be responsible if she died. I took the train to Durban right away. The doctor then told me quietly that he had already given her beef tea when he called me. I said, “Doctor, that’s lying.”

The doctor said, “We doctors don’t see it as lying if it helps the patient. Sometimes, we have to trick patients or their families to save them.” I felt very sad but stayed calm.
