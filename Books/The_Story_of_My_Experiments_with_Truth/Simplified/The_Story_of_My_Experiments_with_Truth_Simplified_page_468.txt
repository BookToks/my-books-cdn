If someone earned four annas a day, they were seen as very lucky.

I talked with my friends and decided to start primary schools in six villages. We told the villagers that they should provide the teachers with food and a place to stay, while we would pay for everything else.

The villagers didn’t have much money, but they could give food like grain and raw materials. They were already willing to help with these things.

Finding teachers was a big problem. It was hard to find local teachers who would work for little or no pay.

I believed that children shouldn’t be taught by ordinary teachers. It was more important for teachers to have good character than just good grades.

So, I asked for volunteer teachers, and many people replied.

Sjt. Gangadharrao Deshpande sent Babasaheb Soman and Pundalik. Shrimati Avantikabai Gokhale came from Bombay, and Mrs. Anandibai Vaishampayan came from Poona. I sent Chhotalal, Surendranath, and my son Devdas from the Ashram.

Around this time, Mahadev Desai and Narahari Parikh and their wives joined me. Kasturbai was asked to help too. This was a strong group. Avantikabai and Anandibai were well-educated, but Durga Desai and Manibehn Parikh only knew a little Gujarati, and Kasturbai didn’t even know that. How could they teach Hindi to the children?

I told them that they didn’t have to teach grammar or all the basics perfectly. Their main job was to teach cleanliness and good manners. I also explained that the letters in Gujarati, Hindi, and Marathi were not very different, and teaching the alphabet and numbers to young kids was not so hard.

Because of this, the classes they taught went really well. The teachers felt more confident and interested in their work. Avantikabai’s school became a model school. She worked with all her heart and used her special talents to make it great.
