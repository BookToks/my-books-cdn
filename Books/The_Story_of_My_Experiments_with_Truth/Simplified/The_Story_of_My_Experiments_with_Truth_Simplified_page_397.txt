As long as he lives in society, he can't avoid being part of the harm that society sometimes causes. When two countries are fighting, someone who believes in non-violence should try to stop the war. But if a person can’t stop the war or resist it, they might take part in it while still trying their best to end the violence for themselves, their country, and the world.

I once hoped to improve my life and the lives of my people by working with the British Empire. While I was in England, I was protected by the British Navy, and by depending on their military power, I was also part of their potential violence. So, if I wanted to stay connected to the Empire and live under its rule, I had three choices: I could openly resist the war and refuse to support the Empire until it changed its war policies; or I could break some of its laws peacefully and accept punishment; or I could join the war on the Empire’s side to gain the ability to fight against violence later. I didn’t have the ability to resist, so I thought I had no choice but to serve in the war.

I do not see a difference, when it comes to non-violence, between fighters and those who help them. Someone who helps bandits by carrying their supplies, watching for danger, or taking care of their wounds is just as guilty as the bandits. Similarly, people who only treat the wounded in war are still part of the war’s harm.

I had thought all this through by myself before I got a message from Polak. After I received it, I talked about these ideas with some friends and decided it was my duty to offer to serve in the war. Even now, I don’t think I was wrong, and I don’t regret what I did because I believed in the British connection at that time.

I know that back then, not all my friends agreed with my decision.
