THE FAST

For the first two weeks, the mill workers showed a lot of courage and self-control. Every day they held huge meetings. At these meetings, I reminded them of their promise, and they shouted back that they would rather die than break their word.

But after a while, they started to get tired and lose hope. Just like when people get weak, they also got angry easily. They began to act more threatening toward the blacklegs (workers who didn’t join the strike). I started to worry that they might cause trouble. Fewer and fewer people came to the daily meetings, and those who did looked sad and hopeless. Finally, I heard that the strikers were starting to give up. I felt very worried and thought hard about what I should do. I had been through a big strike in South Africa before, but this was different. The mill workers had made their promise because I asked them to. They said it again and again in front of me, so it was hard for me to believe they would break it. Maybe it was pride or maybe it was because I cared deeply for the workers and wanted to be honest — I don’t know.

One morning, during a meeting with the mill workers, when I was still confused and unsure, an idea suddenly came to me. Without planning it, I said out loud, “If the strikers don’t keep going and stay on strike until we reach an agreement or leave the mills, I will stop eating.” The workers were shocked. Tears ran down Anasuyabehn’s cheeks. The workers shouted, “Not you! We will fast, not you. It would be terrible if you fasted. Please forgive us for almost giving up. We promise to stay true to our word until the end.” I told them, “You don’t need to fast.”
