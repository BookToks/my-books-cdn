I realized that fasting could be used not just to control myself but also to enjoy things more. Later, many experiences of mine and others showed this surprising truth. I wanted to get stronger and train my body, but mainly I wanted to control my eating habits. So, I chose one food after another and ate less of each. But the taste kept chasing me. When I stopped one food and started another, the new food tasted even better than the last.

When I tried these things, I had friends with me, especially Hermann Kallenbach. I have already talked about him in my story about Satyagraha in South Africa, so I won’t repeat it here. Mr. Kallenbach was always with me during fasting and diet changes. I stayed at his place when the Satyagraha fight was very intense.

We talked about our food changes and enjoyed the new diet more than the old one. Back then, talking about how good food tasted seemed fine and not wrong at all. But later I learned that focusing on enjoying food too much is not good. We should eat not to enjoy food, but just to keep our body working. When all our senses help the body and soul, the strong taste of food disappears. Only then does eating work the way nature meant it to.

Trying many experiments and making big sacrifices is never too much to live in harmony with nature. But sadly, most people today are going the opposite way. We don’t feel bad about hurting many other lives just to make our bodies look nice or live a little longer. This ends up hurting both our body and soul. When we try to fix one old sickness, we create many new ones. And when we chase after pleasure with our senses, we lose the ability to enjoy anything at all.
