I talked everything over with Mr. West and told him how the book Unto This Last had changed my thinking. I suggested moving Indian Opinion to a farm where everyone would work and get the same pay, no matter their race or background. They would do the press work in their free time. Mr. West liked the idea, and we decided to give everyone £3 a month as their allowance.

But we weren’t sure if all ten or more workers at the press would want to live on a remote farm and be happy with just basic living. So, we said that those who didn’t want to join could keep their salaries and slowly try to become part of the settlement.

I explained this plan to the workers, but Sjt. Madanjit didn’t like it. He thought it was a bad idea that would ruin everything. He worried people would quit, Indian Opinion would stop, and the press would have to close.

One of the workers was my cousin, Chhaganlal Gandhi. I talked to him about the plan at the same time as I did with Mr. West. Even though he had a wife and kids, he had chosen to work with me since he was young and trusted me completely. So, without any argument, he agreed and has stayed with me ever since. The machinist Govindaswami also agreed. The others didn’t join but said they would go wherever I moved the press.

I think it took me less than two days to sort all this out with the men.

After that, I quickly looked for land near a railway station close to Durban. We got an offer for a place called Phoenix. Mr. West and I went to see it. Within a week, we bought twenty acres of land. It had a nice little spring and some orange and mango trees. Next to it was another 80 acres with many fruit trees and an old cottage.
