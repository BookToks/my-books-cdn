I woke up in the morning determined not to drink milk anymore. This made me feel better. I was scared to talk to Gokhale about it, but I trusted him to respect my choice.

In the evening, Kallenbach and I went to see Gokhale at the National Liberal Club.

The first thing he asked was, "Have you decided to follow the doctor’s advice?" I answered gently but firmly, "I will agree to everything except one thing—I won’t take milk, milk products, or meat. If avoiding these means I will die, then I am ready to face that." Gokhale asked, "Is this your final decision?"

I said, "I’m sorry, but I can’t decide otherwise. I know this will upset you, and I ask for your forgiveness." Gokhale was sad but caring. He said, "I don’t agree with your decision. I don’t see any religious reason in it. But I won’t push you anymore." Then he told Dr. Jivraj Mehta, "Please don’t bother him. Give him whatever you want, as long as it fits his rules."

The doctor didn’t like this, but he couldn’t do anything. He suggested I drink mung soup with a little asafoetida. I tried it for a day or two, but it made my pain worse. So I went back to eating fruits and nuts. The doctor kept giving me other treatments from outside, which helped a little, but my strict diet was a problem for him.

After that, Gokhale went home because he couldn’t handle London’s October fog.
