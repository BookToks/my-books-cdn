These experiments were not good enough. I couldn’t spend as much time with my children as I wanted. Because I couldn’t give them enough attention and for other reasons, I couldn’t give them the kind of school education I hoped for. All my sons have complained about this. When they meet someone with a degree like an M.A. or B.A., or even someone who finished school, they feel like they missed out because they didn’t get that kind of education.

Still, I think that if I had forced them to go to public schools, they would have missed out on important life lessons. They wouldn’t have learned from real experience or by being close to their parents. If they had gone to schools in England or South Africa, I would have worried about them all the time. That kind of education might have made them act fake, which could have been a problem for my public work. So, even though I couldn’t give them the school education they wanted or I wanted for them, I’m not sure I didn’t do my best as a parent.

I don’t regret not sending them to public schools. I think the bad habits I see in my oldest son today come from my own wild and unclear youth. That time was full of half-learned ideas and a lot of freedom. It happened when my oldest son was growing up, and naturally, he doesn’t see it as my time of mistakes. Instead, he thinks those were my best years, and that the changes I made later were just wrong ideas called progress. And he has a point. Why wouldn’t he think my early years were a time of new ideas, and my later years were confusing and selfish?

Many friends have asked me: What harm would it have done if I had given my boys a formal education?
