The symbol of a court is a pair of scales held evenly by a wise woman who is blindfolded. She is blind so she doesn’t judge people by how they look, but by what is inside them.

But the Law Society of Natal wanted the Supreme Court to go against this idea and ignore its symbol.

I applied to become a lawyer in the Supreme Court. I had a certificate from the Bombay High Court. When I joined there, I had to give them my English certificate. To apply, I needed two character certificates. I thought it would help if these were from Europeans, so I got them from two well-known European merchants I knew through Sheth Abdulla. The application had to be sent by a lawyer. Usually, the Attorney General sent such applications for free. Mr. Escombe, who was a legal adviser to Dada Abdulla & Co., was the Attorney General. I met him, and he agreed to send my application.

Then the Law Society surprised me by opposing my application. One reason was that I didn’t include the original English certificate. But their main reason was that when the rules were made, they hadn’t thought a coloured man would apply. Natal grew because of European business, so they wanted Europeans to be the majority of lawyers. If coloured people were allowed, they might become more than Europeans, and the protection for Europeans would weaken.

The Law Society hired a famous lawyer to oppose me. He was also connected to Dada Abdulla & Co., and through Sheth Abdulla, he told me to come and meet him.
