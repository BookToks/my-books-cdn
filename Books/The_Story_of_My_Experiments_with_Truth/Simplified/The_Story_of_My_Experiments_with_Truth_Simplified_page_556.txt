Even though I have tried really hard to follow Ahimsa (non-violence), I know I haven’t been perfect at it.

The little moments when I’ve understood Truth don’t fully show how amazing it really is. Truth is way brighter and stronger than the sun we see every day. What I’ve seen is just a tiny bit of that huge brightness. But I’m sure that to truly see Truth perfectly, you have to completely understand and live Ahimsa.

To see the Spirit of Truth everywhere, you have to love even the smallest and weakest things like you love yourself. If you want that, you can’t stay away from any part of life. That’s why my love for Truth led me to get involved in politics. I honestly believe that people who say religion has nothing to do with politics don’t really understand what religion means.

You can’t feel connected to everything alive without cleaning your own heart and mind first. Without that, following Ahimsa is just a dream. You can’t understand God if your heart isn’t pure. So, self-purification means cleaning yourself in every part of your life. And when you do that, it spreads and helps make the world around you better too.

But cleaning yourself isn’t easy. To be perfectly pure, you have to get rid of all strong feelings like hate, love, and dislike, not just in your actions but also in your thoughts and words.

I know I haven’t reached that perfect purity yet, even though I keep trying all the time. That’s why praise from others doesn’t impress me much; sometimes it even hurts. Beating these hidden feelings inside me is much harder than winning battles with weapons. Since coming back to India, I’ve learned about these hidden feelings in me. Knowing about them makes me feel embarrassed but not defeated. These experiences have helped me and made me happy, but I know I still have a tough journey ahead.

I must completely humble myself and start from zero.
