Before this, I always used some kind of transport whenever I went anywhere, and had to find extra time for walks. The new plan combined walking and saving money because it saved me bus fares and gave me walks of eight or ten miles a day. It was mostly this habit of long walks that kept me almost free from sickness during my time in England and made my body fairly strong.

So, I rented a set of rooms; one for a sitting room and another for a bedroom. This was the second step. The third step was still to come.

These changes cut my expenses in half. But how was I going to use the extra time? I knew that Bar exams didn’t need much studying, so I didn’t feel rushed. My weak English was always a worry for me.

Mr. (later Sir Frederic) Lely’s words, “Graduate first and then come to me,” still stayed in my mind. I thought I should not only become a lawyer but also get a university degree. I checked out courses at Oxford and Cambridge and talked to some friends. I found out that going to either of those places would cost a lot more money and mean staying in England much longer than I wanted. A friend suggested that if I really wanted to challenge myself, I should pass the London Matriculation exam. It would take a lot of hard work and give me more general knowledge, but it wouldn’t cost much extra. I liked the idea. But the syllabus scared me. Latin and a modern language were required! How could I manage Latin? But my friend strongly encouraged me: “Latin is very important for lawyers. Knowing Latin helps you understand law books. One Roman Law paper is completely in Latin. Also, knowing Latin makes your English better.” That convinced me, and I decided to learn Latin no matter how hard it was. I had already started French, so I chose that as my modern language. I joined a private Matriculation class. Exams were every six months, and I had only five months to prepare. It was almost impossible for me. But, wanting to become a proper English gentleman, I decided to be a serious student. I made a strict study schedule down to the minute; but I wasn’t sure my brain or memory could handle learning Latin and French along with other subjects in such a short time.
