A TRAGEDY

I had only a few friends in high school, and at different times, I was really close to two of them. One of these friendships didn’t last long because my friend stopped being friends with me after I became friends with the other guy. The second friendship was a big problem in my life. It lasted a long time. I started it because I wanted to help him change for the better.

This friend was actually my older brother’s friend. They were in the same class.

I knew he had some faults, but I still thought he was a loyal friend. My mom, my oldest brother, and my wife told me I was hanging out with the wrong person. I was too proud to listen to my wife, but I didn’t want to ignore what my mom and brother said. I told them, “Yes, he has the problems you say, but you don’t see the good things in him. He won’t lead me the wrong way because I want to help him change. If he changes, he will be a great man. Please don’t worry about me.” I don’t think this made them feel better, but they let me be.

Later, I realized I was wrong. Someone who wants to change another person shouldn’t be very close friends with them. True friendship is like souls being the same, and that’s rare. Only people who are alike can have a strong and lasting friendship. Friends influence each other.

So, in friendship, there isn’t much chance to change the other person. I think it’s best to avoid very close friendships because people pick up bad habits more easily than good ones. If someone wants to be friends with God, they must be alone or friends with everyone. I might be wrong, but my try to have a close friendship didn’t work out.

At the time I met this friend, there was a wave of reform going on in Rajkot. He told me that many of our teachers were secretly eating meat and drinking wine. He also said that many well-known people in Rajkot were doing the same.
