Sir Pherozeshah had made things easier for me. So from Bombay, I went to Poona. There were two groups here. I wanted help from people with all kinds of opinions.

First, I met Lokamanya Tilak. He said, "You’re right to want help from everyone. There can’t be any argument about the South African issue. But you need a neutral person to be your president. Meet Professor Bhandarkar. He hasn’t been involved in public movements lately. Maybe this issue will get him interested. Talk to him and tell me what he says. I want to help you as much as I can. Of course, you can meet me anytime. I’m here for you." This was my first time meeting Lokamanya. It showed me why so many people liked him.

Next, I met Gokhale. I found him at Fergusson College. He welcomed me warmly, and I immediately liked him. Even though it was our first meeting, it felt like meeting an old friend. Sir Pherozeshah seemed like a mountain, Lokamanya like the ocean, but Gokhale was like the Ganges River. You can’t climb a mountain or easily sail the ocean, but you can enjoy the river by boat. Gokhale looked me over like a teacher checking a student applying to school. He told me who to talk to and how to do it. He wanted to see my speech. He showed me around the college, said I could always come to him, asked me to tell him what Dr. Bhandarkar said, and sent me off very happy. In politics, the place Gokhale held in my heart then and now is truly special.
