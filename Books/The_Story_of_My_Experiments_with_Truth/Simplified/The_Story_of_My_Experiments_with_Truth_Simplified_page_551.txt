I had to fix some mistakes in the printed copies of my draft. Later, I realized it would have been really hard if I hadn’t been prepared with my draft.

Still, I was in a tough spot. I had no idea who would support the resolution and who would be against it. I also didn’t know what Lalaji would think. All I saw was a strong group of experienced leaders ready to fight in Calcutta. Some of them were Dr. Besant, Pandit Malaviyaji, Sjt. Vijayaraghavachari, Pandit Motilalji, and the Deshabandhu.

In my resolution, non-cooperation was suggested only to fix the problems in Punjab and the Khilafat issue. But Sjt. Vijayaraghavachari didn’t agree. He said, “If we’re going to do non-cooperation, why only for some problems? The biggest problem is the lack of Swaraj (self-rule). That’s what we should be fighting against.” Pandit Motilalji also wanted Swaraj to be included in the resolution. I agreed and added it. After a long and serious, sometimes heated, discussion, the resolution was passed.

Motilalji was the first to join the movement. I remember the nice talk I had with him about the resolution. He suggested some changes in the wording, which I accepted. He promised to convince the Deshabandhu to join too. The Deshabandhu liked the idea but wasn’t sure if people could actually do it. It was only at the Nagpur Congress that he and Lalaji fully agreed to it.

I felt the loss of the late Lokamanya very deeply at the special session. I have always believed that if Lokamanya had been alive then, he would have supported me. But even if he hadn’t and had opposed the movement, I would have still respected his opposition and learned from it. We often disagreed, but never in a bitter way. He always let me feel that we were very close. Even now, when I write this, I can clearly remember how he died.
