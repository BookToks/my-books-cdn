THE FIRST CASE

While I was in Bombay, I started learning about Indian law and also trying out different diets. My friend Virchand Gandhi joined me in the diet experiments. Meanwhile, my brother was working hard to get me some legal work.

Studying Indian law was really boring. I couldn’t understand the Civil Procedure Code at all. But I liked the Evidence Act better. Virchand was preparing for the Solicitor’s Exam and told me lots of stories about lawyers. He said, “Sir Pherozeshah is great because he knows the law so well. He has the Evidence Act memorized and knows all the cases on section thirty-two. Badruddin Tyabji argues so well that judges respect him.” Hearing about these famous lawyers made me nervous.

Virchand also said, “It’s common for a barrister to struggle for five or seven years. That’s why I’m training to be a solicitor instead. You should feel lucky if you can handle your own cases in three years.” My expenses kept going up every month. I didn’t want to put up a barrister’s sign outside my house while I was still learning to be a barrister. So I couldn’t focus fully on my studies. I started to like the Evidence Act and read Mayne’s Hindu Law with interest, but I didn’t feel brave enough to take on a case. I felt totally lost, like a new bride visiting her father-in-law’s house for the first time!

Around this time, I took on the case of a woman named Mamibai. It was a small case. Someone told me I had to pay a commission to a tout, but I said no.

“But even that famous criminal lawyer, Mr. So-and-So, who earns three to four thousand rupees a month, pays commission!” they said.

“I don’t want to be like him,” I replied. “I’m okay with earning just 300 rupees a month. My father didn’t make more than that.” 

“But those days are over,” they told me.
