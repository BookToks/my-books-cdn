We might have to work all night. I think this machine can still be fixed.' 'I don’t want to wake the carpenters. Our men are really too tired,' said West.

'Well, I’ll talk to them,' I said.

'Then maybe we can finish the work,' West replied.

I woke up the carpenters and asked for their help. They didn’t need to be pushed. They said, 'If we can’t help in an emergency, what’s the point? You guys rest, and we’ll work on the wheel. It’s easy for us.' Our own men were ready too.

West was very happy and started singing a song as we got to work. I worked with the carpenters, and others took turns joining us. We kept going until 7 a.m. There was still a lot to do. So I told West to wake the engineer and ask him to try starting the engine again. If it worked, we might finish on time.

West woke him up, and the engineer went straight to the engine room. And guess what? The engine started almost immediately. Everyone cheered loudly. 'How is this possible? Why didn’t it work last night but started now like nothing was wrong?' I asked.

'It’s hard to say,' said West or the engineer, I don’t remember. 'Sometimes machines seem like they need rest just like us.' For me, the engine breaking down was a test, and it working just in time was the reward for all our hard work.

The papers were sent out on time, and everyone was happy.

This first strong effort made sure the paper was published regularly and created a feeling of independence in Phoenix. Later, we even stopped using the engine on purpose and worked only by hand.

Those days were, I think, the best times for Phoenix’s spirit and morale.
