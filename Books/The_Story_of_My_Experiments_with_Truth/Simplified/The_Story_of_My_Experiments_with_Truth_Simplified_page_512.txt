Once you make a promise, I said, you should never break it. So, it was really important that everyone fully understood what the Swadeshi pledge meant. They also needed to realize how serious the promise was about keeping Hindus and Muslims united. In the end, I said that those who wanted to take the pledge should meet again the next morning.

The hartal (strike) in Bombay was a total success. We were ready to start civil disobedience. We talked about a few things for this. We decided to break only those laws that people could easily disobey. The salt tax was very unpopular, and many people had been trying to get it removed for a while. So, I suggested that people make salt at home from sea water, ignoring the salt laws. 

Another idea was about selling banned books. Two of my books, Hind Swaraj and Sarvodaya (a Gujarati version of Ruskin's Unto This Last), were banned. Printing and selling these books openly was an easy way to protest. We printed enough copies and planned to sell them after a big meeting that evening, after breaking the fast.

On the evening of the 6th, many volunteers went out to sell these banned books. Shrimati Sarojini Devi and I also went in cars. All the copies sold out quickly. The money from the sales was used to support the civil disobedience movement.

Both books cost four annas each, but I donâ€™t think anyone just paid that price. Many people gave all the money they had to buy a copy. People gave five and ten rupee notes to pay for one book, and I even remember selling one copy for fifty rupees!
