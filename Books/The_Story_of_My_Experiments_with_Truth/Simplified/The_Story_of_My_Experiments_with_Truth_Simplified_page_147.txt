The next day at one o'clock, I went to Mr. Baker's prayer meeting. There, I met Miss Harris, Miss Gabb, Mr. Coates, and some others. Everyone knelt down to pray, and I did the same. The prayers were asking God for different things, depending on what each person wanted. Usually, they prayed for a peaceful day or for God to open people's hearts.

A special prayer was said for me: "Lord, show the way to this new brother who has joined us. Give him the peace that You have given us. May the Lord Jesus, who saved us, save him too. We ask this in Jesus' name." There was no singing or music at these meetings. After the special prayer each day, we all went our separate ways to have lunch. The prayer only took about five minutes.

Miss Harris and Miss Gabb were both older unmarried women. Mr. Coates was a Quaker. The two ladies lived together and always invited me to have tea at their house every Sunday at four o'clock.

On Sundays, I would give Mr. Coates my religious diary from the week and talk with him about the books I had read and what I thought about them. The ladies shared their happy experiences and talked about the peace they had found.

Mr. Coates was honest and strong in his beliefs. We took walks together, and he also introduced me to other Christian friends.

As we got closer, he started giving me books he thought I should read, and soon my shelf was full of them. He gave me so many books that it felt like he was piling them on me. I agreed to read all of them with faith, and we talked about the books as I read.

In 1893, I read many of these books. I don’t remember all their names, but some were Dr. Parker’s Commentary from the City Temple, Pearson’s Many Infallible Proofs, and Butler’s Analogy. Some parts were hard for me to understand.
