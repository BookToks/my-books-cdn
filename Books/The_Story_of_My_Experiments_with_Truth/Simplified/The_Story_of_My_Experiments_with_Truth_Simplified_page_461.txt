The trial started. The Government lawyer, the Magistrate, and other officials were very nervous. They didn’t know what to do. The Government lawyer wanted the Magistrate to delay the case. But I stepped in and asked the Magistrate not to delay it because I wanted to admit that I disobeyed the order to leave Champaran. I read a short statement:

"With the Court’s permission, I want to explain why I took the serious step of disobeying the order under section 144. I believe this is just a difference of opinion between the local government and me. I came here to help people in need because they said they were being treated unfairly by the indigo planters. To help, I had to study the problem first. So, I came to learn more, hoping to work with the government and planters. I have no bad intentions, and I don’t think my presence will cause any trouble or harm anyone. I have experience in these matters, but the government thinks differently. I understand their problem and admit they acted based on the information they had. As a law-abiding citizen, I would normally obey the order. But I couldn’t do that without going against my duty to help these people. The only way I can help now is by staying with them. So, I won’t leave on my own.

Because of this conflict, I leave it to the government to decide what to do with me. I know that, as someone important in India’s public life, I must set a good example. I truly believe that in the complicated situation we live in, the right and honorable thing for a proud person like me is to accept the punishment for disobeying the order without complaining."
