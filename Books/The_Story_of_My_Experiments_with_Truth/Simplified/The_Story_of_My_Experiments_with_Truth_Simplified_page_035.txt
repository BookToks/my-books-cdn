When I was married, I was still going to high school.

My three brothers went to the same school. The oldest was in a much higher class, and the brother who got married at the same time as me was just one class ahead. Because we got married, both of us lost a year in school. It was even worse for my brother because he stopped studying completely. I don’t know how many young people face this problem. In our Hindu society, marriage and school often happen at the same time.

I kept studying. People at school didn’t think I was dumb. My teachers liked me a lot. Every year, they sent reports about my progress and behavior to my parents. I never got a bad report. Actually, I even won prizes after finishing the second grade.

In fifth and sixth grade, I got scholarships of four and ten rupees. I was lucky more than anything because the scholarships were only for the best boys from the Sorath area of Kathiawad. Back then, there weren’t many boys from Sorath in a class of forty or fifty students.

I didn’t think I was very smart. I was surprised every time I won a prize or scholarship. But I cared a lot about my character. Even a small mistake would make me cry. If a teacher thought I deserved a scolding, it was really hard for me. I remember once I got punished physically. I didn’t mind the punishment itself, but I was upset that I deserved it. I cried a lot. This happened when I was in first or second grade. Another time like this was when I was in seventh grade.

Dorabji Edulji Gimi was the headmaster then. He was popular with the students because he was strict, organized, and a good teacher. He made gymnastics and cricket mandatory for older boys. I didn’t like either. Before they became compulsory, I never joined any exercise, cricket, or football. Part of the reason was that I was shy. Now I realize that was wrong.
