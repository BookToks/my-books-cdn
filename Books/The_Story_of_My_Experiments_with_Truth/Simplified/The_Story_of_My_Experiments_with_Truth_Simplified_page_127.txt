ARRIVAL IN NATAL

When I was about to leave for South Africa, I didn’t feel the same sadness I had felt when leaving for England. My mother had passed away. I had learned some things about the world and traveling, so going from Rajkot to Bombay didn’t feel strange anymore.

This time, the only hard part was saying goodbye to my wife. We had another baby since I came back from England. Our love wasn’t perfect yet, but it was slowly getting better. Since I returned from Europe, we hadn’t spent much time together. Now, since I was teaching her and helping her make some changes, we both felt we needed to be together more to keep working on those changes. But the chance to go to South Africa made the separation easier. I told her, “We will see each other again in a year,” to comfort her, and then I left Rajkot for Bombay.

In Bombay, I was supposed to get my ticket through an agent from Dada Abdulla and Company.

But there were no seats available on the ship. If I didn’t leave then, I would be stuck in Bombay. The agent said, “We tried hard to get a first-class ticket, but no luck—unless you want to travel on the deck. You can eat in the nice dining area.” Back then, I always traveled first class, and I couldn’t imagine going on the deck like that. So I said no. I also didn’t fully trust the agent because I didn’t think all the first-class seats were taken. With the agent’s permission, I tried to get the ticket myself. I went on the ship and talked to the chief officer. He told me honestly, “We don’t usually have this many passengers, but the Governor-General of Mozambique is on this ship, so all the seats are booked.” I asked, “Can you maybe make room for me?”

He looked me up and down and smiled. “There’s only one way,” he said.

“There’s an extra bed in my cabin that usually isn’t for passengers. But I’m willing to let you use it.” I thanked him and asked the agent to buy the ticket for me.
