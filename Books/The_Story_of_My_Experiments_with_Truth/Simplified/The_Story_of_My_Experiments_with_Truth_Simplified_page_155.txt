Coates or one of his friends took me to see the State Attorney, Dr. Krause.  

We found out that we were both lawyers from the same group. The rule that I needed a pass to be outside after 9 p.m. was too much for him. He felt sorry for me. Instead of giving me a pass, he gave me a letter that let me be outside anytime without the police bothering me. I always carried this letter when I went out. It was just luck that I never actually had to use it.  

Dr. Krause invited me to his house, and we became friends.  

Sometimes I visited him, and through him, I met his more famous brother, who was the public prosecutor in Johannesburg. During the Boer War, his brother was put on trial for planning to kill an English officer and was sent to prison for seven years. He also lost his license to practice law. After the war ended, he was let out, got his license back, and started working as a lawyer again.  

These connections helped me later in my public life and made my work easier.  

The rules about using sidewalks caused me some problems. I liked to walk down President Street to an open area. President Krugerâ€™s house was on this street. It was a simple house, not fancy and without a garden, and looked like the other houses nearby. Many rich people in Pretoria had much fancier houses with gardens. President Kruger was known for being simple. Only the police standing outside showed that it was an important house. I usually walked past the police on the sidewalk without any trouble.  

The police guard changed sometimes. One time, a new guard suddenly pushed and kicked me into the street without warning or asking me to leave the sidewalk. I was shocked. Before I could say anything, Mr. Coates, who was riding by on his horse, called out to me and said: "Gandhi, I saw everything."
