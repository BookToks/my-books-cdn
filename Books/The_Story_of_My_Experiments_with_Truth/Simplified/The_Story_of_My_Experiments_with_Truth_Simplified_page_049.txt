I realized that actually killing myself was much harder than just thinking about it. Since then, whenever I heard someone say they wanted to kill themselves, it didn’t really affect me much.

The idea of suicide made both of us stop the bad habits of smoking leftover cigarette butts and stealing money from the servant to buy cigarettes.

After I grew up, I never wanted to smoke. I always thought smoking was gross, dirty, and bad for health. I don’t understand why so many people around the world like smoking. I can’t stand being in a place full of smokers because it makes me feel like I’m choking.

But the theft I did later was more serious than stealing small money.

I first stole some money when I was about twelve or thirteen, maybe younger. But when I was fifteen, I stole a small piece of gold from my brother’s armlet. My brother owed about twenty-five rupees, and he wore a solid gold armlet. It wasn’t hard to cut a little piece off it.

I did it, and paid off his debt. But I felt really bad afterwards. I decided I would never steal again. I also wanted to tell my dad the truth. I wasn’t scared he would hit me—he never hit us—but I was scared of hurting him with the news. Still, I thought I had to be honest to feel better.

Finally, I wrote a note confessing what I did and asking my dad to forgive me. I also told him to punish me if needed but asked him not to blame himself for what I did. I promised never to steal again.

I was shaking when I gave the note to my father.
