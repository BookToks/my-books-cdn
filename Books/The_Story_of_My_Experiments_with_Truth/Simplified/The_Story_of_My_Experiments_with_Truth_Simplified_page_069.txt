MY CHOICE

Dr. Mehta went to the Victoria Hotel on Monday, thinking I would be there. But he found out we had left, got our new address, and met me at our new place.

By mistake, I got ringworm on the boat. We used sea-water for washing and bathing, and soap doesn’t mix with sea-water. I used soap anyway because I thought it was civilized. But instead of cleaning me, it made my skin greasy and caused ringworm. I showed it to Dr. Mehta, who told me to put acetic acid on it. I remember how the burning acid made me cry.

Dr. Mehta looked at my room and didn’t like it. “This place won’t do,” he said. “We come to England not just to study, but to learn about English life and customs. To do that, you need to live with a family. But first, you should spend some time learning from _____.” He said he would take me there. I was thankful and moved to my friend’s place.

My friend was very kind and treated me like a brother. He taught me English ways and helped me get used to speaking the language. But food was a big problem. I didn’t like boiled vegetables without salt or spices. The landlady didn’t know what to cook for me. We had oatmeal porridge for breakfast, which was okay, but I was always hungry at lunch and dinner. My friend kept telling me to eat meat, but I said I had made a promise and stayed quiet.

For lunch and dinner, we had spinach, bread, and jam. I was a good eater and could eat a lot, but I felt shy asking for more than two or three slices of bread because it didn’t seem right. Also, there was no milk for lunch or dinner. One day, my friend got frustrated and said, “If you were my brother, I would have kicked you out. What good is a promise made to an uneducated mother, without knowing how things work here? It’s not a real promise. It’s just a silly superstition to stick to such a vow.”
