Then there was another round of insults.

I picked up the pie and started to leave, feeling proud that the Brahman had lost a pie and I had saved one. But the Maharaj wasn’t the kind of person to just let the pie go. He called me back and said, "Okay, leave the pie here. I don’t want to be like you. If I refuse your pie, it will be bad for you." Without saying anything, I gave him the pie and walked away with a sigh.

Since then, I have been to Kashi Vishvanath twice, but only after I was already called Mahatma and the kind of things I described before stopped happening. People who wanted to see me wouldn’t let me see the temple. The problems of Mahatmas are only known to other Mahatmas. Still, the dirt and noise were just like before.

If anyone doubts how kind God is, they should look at these holy places. How much fake behavior and disrespect does the Prince of Yogis have to put up with in His name? He said a long time ago: "Whatever a man sows, that shall he reap." The law of Karma is strict and can’t be avoided. So, God doesn’t really need to get involved. He made the Law and then kind of stepped back.

After visiting the temple, I went to see Mrs. Besant. I knew she was just getting better from being sick. I gave her my name. She came right away. Since I just wanted to show my respect, I said, "I know you’re not feeling well. I just wanted to pay my respects. I’m grateful you could see me even though you’re not feeling great. I won’t keep you any longer." Then I said goodbye.
