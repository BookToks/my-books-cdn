A SPIRITUAL PROBLEM

When people in South Africa heard that I and other Indians had offered to help in the war, I got two messages. One was from Mr. Polak, who asked if what I was doing matched my belief in ahimsa, or non-violence.

I kind of expected this because I had already talked about this issue in my book, Hind Swaraj, and with friends in South Africa. We all agreed that war is wrong. If I didn’t want to attack someone who hurt me, I definitely shouldn’t join a war, especially when I didn’t know if the reasons for the war were fair. My friends knew I had fought in the Boer War before, but they thought I had changed my mind since then.

Actually, the same reasons that made me join the Boer War also made me join this one. I knew fighting in a war didn’t fit with ahimsa. But sometimes, it’s hard to be sure what your duty is. People who want to follow the truth often have to figure things out in confusion.

Ahimsa means more than just not hurting others. We are all small humans caught in a world full of violence. The idea that “life lives on life” means that living always involves some harm to other life. We can’t live without causing some damage, even if it’s very small. So, someone who believes in ahimsa stays true to it if they act with kindness, avoid hurting even the smallest creature as much as possible, try to save life, and work hard to stay away from violence. They will keep growing in self-control and kindness, but they can never completely avoid causing some harm.

Also, because ahimsa is based on the idea that all life is connected, the mistakes of one person affect everyone. So, no one can be completely free from causing harm.
