He did wrong things on purpose and didn’t seem bothered by them.

But before I met these friends, I already knew that not all Christians believed in this idea of atonement. Mr. Coates himself respected God a lot. He had a good heart and believed people could make themselves better.

The two women also believed this. Some of the books I read were full of devotion. So, even though Mr. Coates was upset by what I had just gone through, I was able to calm him down and tell him that the wrong belief of one Plymouth Brother wouldn’t make me lose faith in Christianity.

My real problems were with the Bible and how people usually understood it.
