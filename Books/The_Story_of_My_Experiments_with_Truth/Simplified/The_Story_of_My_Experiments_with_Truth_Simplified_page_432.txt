He refused to do that. I asked the railway authorities to help and got this reply: "We usually don’t refund extra fares without a certificate, but we will make an exception for you. However, we cannot refund the extra fare from Burdwan to Mogalsarai." Since then, I have had many experiences traveling third class, which could fill a whole book if I wrote about them all. But here, I will only mention them briefly. I have always been very sad that my health problems forced me to stop traveling third class.

The problems of third class passengers are mostly because the railway authorities act unfairly. But the passengers themselves are also to blame for being rude, dirty, selfish, and ignorant. Sadly, they often don’t realize they are acting badly or selfishly. They think everything they do is normal. This happens because educated people don’t seem to care about them.

We got to Kalyan feeling very tired. Maganlal and I got some water from the station pipe and washed ourselves. When I was about to help my wife wash, Sjt. Kaul from the Servants of India Society saw us. He was also going to Poona. He kindly offered to take my wife to the second class bathroom.

I was unsure about accepting his kind offer. I knew my wife wasn’t supposed to use the second class bathroom, but I finally let it happen. I know this was wrong because I believe in being truthful. It wasn’t that my wife really wanted to use it, but I cared more about her than about always being truthful. The Upanishad says that the truth is hidden behind a golden veil of illusion.
