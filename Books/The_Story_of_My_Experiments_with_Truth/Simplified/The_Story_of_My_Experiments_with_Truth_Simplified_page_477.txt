A LOOK INSIDE THE ASHRAM Before I talk about the labor dispute, I want to share a bit about the Ashram. While I was in Champaran, I kept thinking about the Ashram and sometimes visited it quickly.

At that time, the Ashram was in Kochrab, a small village near Ahmedabad.

Then, a plague broke out in the village, and I worried about the safety of the Ashram children. No matter how clean we kept the Ashram, the dirty surroundings were dangerous. We couldnâ€™t make the villagers follow cleanliness rules or help the village much.

We wanted the Ashram to be far enough from town and village to be safe, but still close enough to reach easily. We were determined to find our own land someday.

The plague showed us it was time to leave Kochrab. A man named Punjabhai Hirachand, a merchant from Ahmedabad, knew the Ashram well and helped us a lot without asking for anything. He had good knowledge of Ahmedabad and offered to find land for us. I went with him looking for land north and south of Kochrab, and I asked him to look for land about three or four miles north. He found the place we have now. I liked that it was close to the Sabarmati Central Jail because I knew people who fought for justice often went to jail, and jails are usually in clean areas.

In about eight days, we bought the land. There were no buildings or trees, but it was by the river and quiet, which was good.

We decided to live in tents and have a small kitchen shed until we could build permanent houses.

The Ashram was growing slowly.
