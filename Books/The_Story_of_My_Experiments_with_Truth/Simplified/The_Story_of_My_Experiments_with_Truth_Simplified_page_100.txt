For him, 'horse' was a verb and 'run' was a noun. I remember many funny moments like that. But he didn’t get confused by not knowing grammar. What little I knew about grammar didn’t make any difference to him. He never felt ashamed of not knowing grammar.

He said casually, “I never went to school like you. I never needed grammar to share my thoughts. Do you know Bengali? I do. I have traveled in Bengal. I brought Maharshi Devendranath Tagore’s works to people who speak Gujarati. I want to translate many other languages into Gujarati too. And I don’t translate word for word. I just try to bring out the feeling. Others who know grammar better might do more later. But I’m happy with what I’ve done without grammar. I know Marathi, Hindi, Bengali, and I’m starting to learn English. I want to learn lots of words. And do you think that’s all? No way! I want to go to France and learn French. I heard their books are amazing. I’ll try to go to Germany too and learn German.” He talked like this all the time. He really wanted to learn languages and travel far.

“So will you go to America too?” “Of course. How can I go back to India without seeing the New World?” “But where will you get the money?” “What money? I don’t live fancy like you. I only need a little food and clothes. What little I earn from books and friends is enough. I always travel third class. Even going to America, I’ll travel on the deck.” Narayan Hemchandra was simple and honest. He wasn’t proud, except he did believe in his own skill as a writer.

We met every day.
