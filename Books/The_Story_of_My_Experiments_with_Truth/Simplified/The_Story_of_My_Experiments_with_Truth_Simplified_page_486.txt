But since the people did not give up, the Government started forcing them. The officers sold people's cattle and took whatever things they could find. They gave penalty notices, and sometimes they even took crops that were still growing. This scared the farmers. Some of them paid what they owed, while others tried to hide valuable things so the officers would take those instead. But some were ready to fight until the very end.

While all this was happening, one of Sjt. Shankarlal Parikh's tenants paid the tax for his land. This caused a big surprise. Sjt. Shankarlal Parikh quickly fixed his tenant's mistake by giving away the land for charity.

This saved his honor and showed others a good example.

To help those who were scared, I told the people, led by Sjt. Mohanlal Pandya, to take the onion crop from a field that I thought was unfairly taken by the government. I didn’t think this was breaking the law, but even if it was, I said taking standing crops was wrong and like stealing. So, it was the people’s duty to take the onions back, even if the government ordered otherwise. This was a good chance for people to learn about being ready to face fines or jail for standing up for what’s right. Sjt. Mohanlal Pandya loved this idea. He wanted someone to go to jail for following the rules of Satyagraha, so he offered to take the onions with seven or eight friends.

The Government had no choice but to arrest them. The arrest of Sjt. Mohanlal and his friends made the people even more excited. When people stop being afraid of jail, being treated badly makes them stronger. Many people surrounded the court on the day of the trial.
