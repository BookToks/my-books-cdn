QUICKENED SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE

Before I tell you about the fight for the rights of Indian settlers in the Transvaal and how we dealt with the Asiatic Department, I need to talk about some other parts of my life.

Until now, I had mixed feelings. I wanted to help others but also wanted to save something for the future.

Around the time I started working in Bombay, an American insurance agent came to see me. He was friendly and talked as if we were old friends. He asked if I had life insurance and said I should get some because life is uncertain. He told me that in America, it’s almost like a duty to have insurance. At first, I didn’t want to buy it because I thought insurance meant I didn’t trust God. But the agent’s words made me think of my wife and children. I remembered I had sold most of my wife’s jewelry. I thought, “If something happens to me, my brother, who has been like a father to us, would have to take care of them. Would that be right?” So, I decided to buy a policy for Rs. 10,000.

Later, when my life changed in South Africa, my way of thinking changed too. All I did during that tough time was for God and His service. I didn’t know how long I would stay in South Africa and was afraid I might never return to India. So, I decided to keep my wife and children with me and work to support them. This made me regret buying the insurance and feel ashamed for trusting the agent. I thought, “If my brother is like a father to us, he wouldn’t mind taking care of my wife if something happened to me.”
