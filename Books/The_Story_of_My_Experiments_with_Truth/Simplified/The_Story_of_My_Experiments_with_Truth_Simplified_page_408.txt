I talked to a few Englishmen, but the conversations were mostly polite and formal. There weren’t many friendly chats like the ones we had on the South African boats. I think this happened because Englishmen felt they were the ones in charge, while Indians felt they were under their control.

I really wanted to get home and escape this kind of atmosphere.

When we reached Aden, we started to feel a bit more comfortable. We knew the people there well, especially Mr. Kekobad Kavasji Dinshaw and his wife, whom we had met in Durban.

A few days later, we arrived in Bombay. It was so happy to be back in my country after being away for ten years.

Gokhale had arranged a welcome for me in Bombay, even though he wasn’t feeling well. I had hoped to connect with him deeply and feel free. But things didn’t turn out that way.
