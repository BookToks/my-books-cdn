Young India was changed back to being a weekly paper. It would have been hard and expensive for me to publish two weeklies from two different places. Since Navajivan was already printed in Ahmedabad, I suggested moving Young India there too.

There were other reasons for this change. From my experience with Indian Opinion, I learned that such journals needed their own printing press.

Also, the printing laws in India then were strict. If I wanted to share my honest opinions freely, regular printing presses, which were run as businesses, might not want to print them. So, it became very important to have our own press. Since this was easiest to do in Ahmedabad, Young India had to be printed there too.

Through these journals, I started to educate people about Satyagraha as best as I could. Both papers were very popular, with about forty thousand copies each at one point. Navajivan’s circulation grew quickly, but Young India’s grew slowly. After I was put in jail, the number of readers for both papers dropped a lot and now is below eight thousand.

From the beginning, I decided not to take ads in these papers. I don’t think they lost anything because of that. In fact, I believe it helped them stay independent.

These journals also helped me stay calm inside. Since I couldn’t start civil disobedience right away, they let me share my thoughts freely and encourage people. I believe both papers did good work for the people during this tough time and helped lessen the harshness of martial law.
