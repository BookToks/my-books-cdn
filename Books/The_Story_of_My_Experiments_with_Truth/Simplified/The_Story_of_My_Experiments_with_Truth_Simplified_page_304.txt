The treatment was putting a bandage made of clean earth mixed with cold water on the stomach. This was spread like a soft paste on thin cloth.

I put this on before going to sleep and took it off during the night or in the morning whenever I woke up. It worked really well. Since then, I have tried it on myself and my friends and never regretted it.

In India, I couldn’t try this treatment as easily. I didn’t have time to stay in one place and test it properly. But I still believe in using earth and water for healing. Even now, I use the earth treatment sometimes and tell my coworkers about it when I can.

I have been sick twice in my life, but I think most people don’t need to take a lot of medicine. Almost all problems can be fixed by eating right, using water and earth treatments, and simple home remedies. People who go to the doctor or use many medicines for every small sickness not only shorten their life but also lose control over themselves and stop being strong.

Don’t ignore what I’m saying just because I am writing this while I am sick. I know why I got sick, and I accept that it’s my fault. Because I understand this, I haven’t given up hope. In fact, I have thanked God for these illnesses because they taught me lessons. I have also managed to avoid taking many medicines. I know I can be stubborn and this can be hard for my doctors, but they are patient with me and haven’t given up.

But I should not get off track. Before going on, I want to warn readers. If you buy Just’s book because of this chapter, don’t believe everything in it as absolute truth. A writer usually shows only one side of a story, but every story can be looked at in many ways, all of which can be true but not all at the same time. Also, many books are written to get fame and customers. So, readers should be careful, ask advice from someone experienced before trying these methods, and read the books carefully before acting on them.
