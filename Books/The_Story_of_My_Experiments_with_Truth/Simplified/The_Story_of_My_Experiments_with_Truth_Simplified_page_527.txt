My work with the inquiry showed me that Punjab could be a great place for Khadi work.

As I looked more into the terrible things done to the people, I found stories of the government being very cruel and unfair. These stories shocked me and made me very sad. What surprised me even more was that Punjab had sent many soldiers to help the British during the war, but still, the people accepted all these harsh treatments without fighting back.

I was also asked to write the report for this Committee. I suggest anyone interested in these events read the report to understand the kind of cruelty the people of Punjab faced. I want to say that nothing in the report is exaggerated, and every claim has proof.

Also, the proof shared in the report was only a small part of what the Committee had. No statement that could be doubted was included in the report.

This report was made only to tell the truth, and it shows how far the British Government would go and the terrible things it did to keep its power. As far as I know, no one has ever proven anything in the report wrong.
