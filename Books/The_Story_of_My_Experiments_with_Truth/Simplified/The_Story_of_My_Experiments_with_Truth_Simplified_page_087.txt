I have learned that being quiet is an important part of staying true to what is real. People often like to make things sound bigger, or change the truth on purpose or by accident. Being quiet helps us avoid that.

People who don’t talk much usually think carefully before they speak. But many people are always in a hurry to talk. At meetings, the leader often gets lots of requests to speak. When someone is allowed to talk, they usually go over their time, ask for more, and keep talking without asking.

All this talking doesn’t really help anyone. It just wastes time. My shyness has actually been my protection. It has helped me grow and understand the truth better.
