01 ThegeneralformoftheoperationΩ(cid:48)(η)istherefore: [ξ,N(ξ)](cid:48)(η) (= [η, ξ, N(ξ)]).
 
 This is the most general form of transition from one proposition to another.
 
 6.02 And thus we come to numbers: I define x = Ω0(cid:48)x Def. and Ω(cid:48)Ων(cid:48)x = Ων+1(cid:48)x Def.
 
 According, then, to these symbolic rules we write the series x, Ω(cid:48)x, Ω(cid:48)Ω(cid:48)x, Ω(cid:48)Ω(cid:48)Ω(cid:48)x.....
 
 as: Ω0(cid:48)x,Ω0+1(cid:48)x,Ω0+1+1(cid:48)x,Ω0+1+1+1(cid:48)x.....
 
 Therefore I write in place of “[x,ξ,Ω(cid:48)ξ]”, “[Ω0(cid:48)x,Ων(cid:48)x,Ων+1(cid:48)x]”.
 
 And I define: 0+1 = 1 Def.
 
 0+1+1 = 2 Def.
 
 0+1+1+1 = 3 Def.
 
 and so on.
 
 6.021 A number is the exponent of an operation.
 
 6.022 The concept number is nothing else than that which is common to all numbers, the general form of number.
 
 The concept number is the variable number.
 
 And the concept of equality of numbers is the general form of all special equalities of numbers.
 
 6.03 The general form of the cardinal number is: [0,ξ,ξ +1].
 
 6.031 The theory of classes is altogether superfluous in mathematics.
 
 This is connected with the fact that the generality which we need in mathematics is not the accidental one.
 
 6.1 The propositions of logic are tautologies.
