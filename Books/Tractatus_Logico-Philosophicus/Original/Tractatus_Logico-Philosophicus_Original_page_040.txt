344 What signifies in the symbol is what is common to all those symbols by which it can be replaced according to the rules of logical syntax.
 
 3.3441 We can, for example, express what is common to all notations for the truth-functions as follows: It is common to them that they all, for example, can be replaced by the notations of “∼p” (“not p”) and “p∨q” (“p or q”).

 3.4 The proposition determines a place in logical space: the existence of this logical place is guaranteed by the existence of the constituent parts alone, by the existence of the significant proposition.
 
 3.41 The propositional sign and the logical co-ordinates: that is the logical place.
 
 3.411 The geometrical and the logical place agree in that each is the possibility of an existence.
 
 3.42 Although a proposition may only determine one place in logical space, the whole logical space must already be given by it.
 
 (Otherwise denial, the logical sum, the logical product, etc., would always introduce new elements—in co-ordination.) (Thelogicalscaffoldingroundthepicturedeterminesthelogical space. The proposition reaches through the whole logical space.) 3.5 The applied, thought, propositional sign is the thought.
 
 4 The thought is the significant proposition.
