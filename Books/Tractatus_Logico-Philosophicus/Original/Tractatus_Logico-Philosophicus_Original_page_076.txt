But logic must have contact with its application.
 
 Therefore logic and its application may not overlap one another.
 
 5.5571 If I cannot give elementary propositions a priori then it must lead to obvious nonsense to try to give them.
 
 5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
 
 5.61 Logic fills the world: the limits of the world are also its limits.
 
 We cannot therefore say in logic: This and this there is in the world, that there is not.
 
 For that would apparently presuppose that we exclude certain possibilities, and this cannot be the case since otherwise logic must get outside the limits of the world: that is, if it could consider these limits from the other side also.
 
 What we cannot think, that we cannot think: we cannot therefore say what we cannot think.
 
 5.62 Thisremarkprovidesakeytothequestion, towhatextentsolipsism is a truth.
 
 In fact what solipsism means, is quite correct, only it cannot be said, but it shows itself.
 
 That the world is my world, shows itself in the fact that the limits of the language (the language which only I understand) mean the limits of my world.
 
 5.621 The world and life are one.
 
 5.63 I am my world. (The microcosm.) 5.631 The thinking, presenting subject; there is no such thing.
 
 If I wrote a book “The world as I found it”, I should also have therein to report on my body and say which members obey my will and which do not, etc. This then would be a method of isolating the subject or rather of showing that in an important sense there is no subject: that is to say, of it alone in this book mention could not be made.
 
 5.632 The subject does not belong to the world but it is a limit of the world.
