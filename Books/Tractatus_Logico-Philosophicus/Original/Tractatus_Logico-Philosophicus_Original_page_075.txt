554 The enumeration of any special forms would be entirely arbitrary.
 
 5.5541 It should be possible to decide a priori whether, for example, I can get into a situation in which I need to symbolize with a sign of a 27-termed relation.
 
 5.5542 May we then ask this at all? Can we set out a sign form and not know whether anything can correspond to it?
 
 Has the question sense: what must be in order that something can be the case?
 
 5.555 It is clear that we have a concept of the elementary proposition apart from its special logical form.
 
 Where,however,wecanbuildsymbolsaccordingtoasystem, there this system is the logically important thing and not the single symbols.
 
 And how would it be possible that I should have to deal with forms in logic which I can invent: but I must have to deal with that which makes it possible for me to invent them.

 5.5561 Empirical reality is limited by the totality of objects. The boundary appears again in the totality of elementary propositions.
 
 The hierarchies are and must be independent of reality.
 
 5.5562 If we know on purely logical grounds, that there must be elementary propositions, then this must be known by everyone who understands the propositions in their unanalysed form.
 
 5.5563 All propositions of our colloquial language are actually, just as they are, logically completely in order. That most simple thing which we ought to give here is not a simile of truth but the complete truth itself.
 
 (Our problems are not abstract but perhaps the most concrete that there are.) 5.557 The application of logic decides what elementary propositions there are.
 
 What lies in the application logic cannot anticipate.
 
 73 TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS It is clear that logic may not collide with its application.
