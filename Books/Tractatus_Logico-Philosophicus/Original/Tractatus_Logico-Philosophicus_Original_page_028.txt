Logic treats of every possibility, and all possibilities are its facts.) Just as we cannot think of spatial objects at all apart from space, or temporal objects apart from time, so we cannot think of any object apart from the possibility of its connexion with other things.
 
 If I can think of an object in the context of an atomic fact, I cannot think of it apart from the possibility of this context.
 
 2.0122 The thing is independent, in so far as it can occur in all possible circumstances, but this form of independence is a form of connexion with the atomic fact, a form of dependence. (It is impossible for words to occur in two different ways, alone and in the proposition.) 2.0123 If I know an object, then I also know all the possibilities of its occurrence in atomic facts.
 
 (Every such possibility must lie in the nature of the object.) A new possibility cannot subsequently be found.
 
 2.01231 In order to know an object, I must know not its external but all its internal qualities.
 
 2.0124 If all objects are given, then thereby are all possible atomic facts also given.
 
 2.013 Every thing is, as it were, in a space of possible atomic facts. I can think of this space as empty, but not of the thing without the space.
 
 2.0131 A spatial object must lie in infinite space. (A point in space is a place for an argument.) A speck in a visual field need not be red, but it must have a colour; it has, so to speak, a colour space round it. A tone must have a pitch, the object of the sense of touch a hardness, etc.
 
 2.014 Objects contain the possibility of all states of affairs.
 
 2.0141 The possibility of its occurrence in atomic facts is the form of the object.
 
 2.02 The object is simple.
 
 2.0201 Every statement about complexes can be analysed into a state26 TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS ment about their constituent parts, and into those propositions which completely describe the complexes.
