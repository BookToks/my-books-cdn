4.31 The truth-possibilities can be presented by schemata of the following kind (“T” means “true”, “F” “false”. The rows of T’s and F’s under the row of the elementary propositions mean their truth-possibilities in an easily intelligible symbolism).

 4.41 The truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions are the conditions of the truth and falsehood of the propositions.

 Absence of this mark means disagreement.
