0272 The configuration of the objects forms the atomic fact.
 
 2.03 In the atomic fact objects hang one in another, like the members of a chain.
 
 2.031 In the atomic fact the objects are combined in a definite way.
 
 2.032 The way in which objects hang together in the atomic fact is the structure of the atomic fact.
 
 2.033 The form is the possibility of the structure.
 
 2.034 The structure of the fact consists of the structures of the atomic facts.
 
 2.04 The totality of existent atomic facts is the world.
 
 2.05 Thetotalityofexistentatomicfactsalsodetermineswhichatomic facts do not exist.
 
 2.06 The existence and non-existence of atomic facts is the reality.
 
 (The existence of atomic facts we also call a positive fact, their non-existence a negative fact.) 2.061 Atomic facts are independent of one another.
 
 2.062 From the existence or non-existence of an atomic fact we cannot infer the existence or non-existence of another.
 
 2.063 The total reality is the world.
 
 2.1 We make to ourselves pictures of facts.
 
 2.11 The picture presents the facts in logical space, the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.
 
 2.12 The picture is a model of reality.
 
 2.13 To the objects correspond in the picture the elements of the picture.
 
 2.131 Theelementsofthepicturestand, inthepicture, fortheobjects.
 
 2.14 The picture consists in the fact that its elements are combined with one another in a definite way.
 
 2.141 The picture is a fact.
 
 2.15 That the elements of the picture are combined with one another in a definite way, represents that the things are so combined with one another.
 
 28 TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS This connexion of the elements of the picture is called its structure, and the possibility of this structure is called the form of representation of the picture.
