Every truth-operation creates from truth-functions of elementary propositions another truth-function of elementary propositions, i.e. a proposition.
 
 The result of every truth-operation on the results of truth-operations on elementary propositions is also the result of one truthoperation on elementary propositions.
 
 Every proposition is the result of truth-operations on elementary propositions.
 
 5.31 The Schemata No. 4.31 are also significant, if “p”, “q”, “r”, etc.
 
 are not elementary propositions.
 
 And it is easy to see that the propositional sign in No. 4.442 expresses one truth-function of elementary propositions even when “p” and “q” are truth-functions of elementary propositions.
 
 5.32 All truth-functions are results of the successive application of a finite number of truth-operations to elementary propositions.
 
 5.4 Here it becomes clear that there are no such things as “logical objects” or“logicalconstants” (inthesenseofFregeandRussell).
 
 5.41 For all those results of truth-operations on truth-functions are identical, which are one and the same truth-function of elementary propositions.
 
 5.42 That ∨, ⊃, etc., are not relations in the sense of right and left, etc., is obvious.
 
 Thepossibilityofcrosswisedefinitionofthelogical“primitive signs” of Frege and Russell shows by itself that these are not primitive signs and that they signify no relations.
 
 And it is obvious that the “⊃” which we define by means of “∼” and “∨” is identical with that by which we define “∨” with the help of “∼”, and that this “∨” is the same as the first, and so on.
 
 5.43 That from a fact p an infinite number of others should follow, namely ∼∼p, ∼∼∼∼p, etc., is indeed hardly to be believed, and it is no less wonderful that the infinite number of propositions of logic(ofmathematics)shouldfollowfromhalfadozen“primitive propositions”.
 
 But all propositions of logic say the same thing. That is, nothing.
