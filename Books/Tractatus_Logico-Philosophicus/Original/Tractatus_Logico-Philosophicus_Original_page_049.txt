 The series of numbers is ordered not by an external, but by an internal relation.
 
 Similarly the series of propositions “aRb”, “(∃x) : aRx.xRb”, “(∃x,y) : aRx.aRy .yRb”, etc.
 
 (If b stands in one of these relations to a, I call b a successor of a.) 4.126 In the sense in which we speak of formal properties we can now speak also of formal concepts.
 
 (I introduce this expression in order to make clear the confusionofformalconceptswithproperconceptswhichrunsthrough the whole of the old logic.) That anything falls under a formal concept as an object belongingtoit, cannotbeexpressedbyaproposition. Butitshows itself in the sign of this object itself. (The name shows that it signifies an object, the numerical sign that it signifies a number, etc.) Formal concepts cannot, like proper concepts, be presented by a function.
 
 For their characteristics, the formal properties, are not expressed by the functions.
 
 The expression of a formal property is a feature of certain symbols.
 
 The sign that signifies the characteristics of a formal concept is, therefore, a characteristic feature of all symbols, whose meanings fall under the concept.
 
 The expression of the formal concept is therefore a propositional variable in which only this characteristic feature is constant.
 
 4.127 The propositional variable signifies the formal concept, and its values signify the objects which fall under this concept.
 
 4.1271 Every variable is the sign of a formal concept.
 
 For every variable presents a constant form, which all its values possess, and which can be conceived as a formal property of these values.
