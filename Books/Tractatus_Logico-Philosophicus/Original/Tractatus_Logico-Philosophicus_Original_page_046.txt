4.064 Every proposition must already have a sense; assertion cannot give it a sense, for what it asserts is the sense itself. And the same holds of denial, etc.
 
 4.0641 One could say, the denial is already related to the logical place determined by the proposition that is denied.
 
 The denying proposition determines a logical place other than does the proposition denied.
 
 The denying proposition determines a logical place, with the help of the logical place of the proposition denied, by saying that it lies outside the latter place.
 
 That one can deny again the denied proposition, shows that what is denied is already a proposition and not merely the preliminary to a proposition.

 4.11 The totality of true propositions is the total natural science (or the totality of the natural sciences).
 
 4.111 Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences.
 
 (The word “philosophy” must mean something which stands above or below, but not beside the natural sciences.) 4.112 The object of philosophy is the logical clarification of thoughts.
 
 Philosophy is not a theory but an activity.
 
 A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations.
 
 The result of philosophy is not a number of “philosophical propositions”, but to make propositions clear.
 
 Philosophy should make clear and delimit sharply the thoughts which otherwise are, as it were, opaque and blurred.
 
 4.1121 Psychology is no nearer related to philosophy, than is any other natural science.
 
 The theory of knowledge is the philosophy of psychology.
 
 Does not my study of sign-language correspond to the study of thought processes which philosophers held to be so essential 44 TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS to the philosophy of logic?
