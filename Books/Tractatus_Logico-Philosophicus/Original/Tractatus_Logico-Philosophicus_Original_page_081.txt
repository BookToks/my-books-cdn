∼q) runs thus:— Ifhereweput“p” insteadof“q” andexaminethecombination of the outermost T and F with the innermost, it is seen that the truth of the whole proposition is co-ordinated with all the truth-combinations of its argument, its falsity with none of the truth-combinations.
 
 6.121 The propositions of logic demonstrate the logical properties of propositions, by combining them into propositions which say nothing.
 
 This method could be called a zero-method. In a logical proposition propositions are brought into equilibrium with one another, andthestateofequilibriumthenshowshowthesepropositions must be logically constructed.
 
 6.122 Whence it follows that we can get on without logical propositions, for we can recognize in an adequate notation the formal properties of the propositions by mere inspection.
 
 6.1221 If for example two propositions “p” and “q” give a tautology in the connexion “p ⊃ q”, then it is clear that q follows from p.
 
 E.g. that “q” follows from “p ⊃ q .p” we see from these two propositions themselves, but we can also show it by combining themto“p ⊃ q.p :⊃: q” andthenshowingthatthisisatautology.
 
 6.1222 This throws light on the question why logical propositions can no more be empirically established than they can be empirically refuted. Not only must a proposition of logic be incapable of being contradicted by any possible experience, but it must also be incapable of being established by any such.
