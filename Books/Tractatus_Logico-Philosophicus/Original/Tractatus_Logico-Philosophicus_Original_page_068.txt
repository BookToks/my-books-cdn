(Even if we believe that we have done so.) Thus “Socrates is identical” says nothing, because we have given no meaning to the word “identical” as adjective. For when it occurs as the sign of equality it symbolizes in an entirely different way—the symbolizing relation is another—therefore the symbol is in the two cases entirely different; the two symbols have the sign in common with one another only by accident.

 5.476 It is clear that we are not concerned here with a number of primitive ideas which must be signified but with the expression of a rule.
 
 5.5 Every truth-function is a result of the successive application of the operation (– – – – –T)(ξ,....) to elementary propositions.
 
 This operation denies all the propositions in the right-hand bracket and I call it the negation of these propositions.
 
 5.501 An expression in brackets whose terms are propositions I indicate—if the order of the terms in the bracket is indifferent—by a sign of the form “(ξ)”. “ξ” is a variable whose values are the termsoftheexpressioninbrackets, andthelineoverthevariable indicates that it stands for all its values in the bracket.
 
 (Thus if ξ has the 3 values P, Q, R, then (ξ) = (P, Q, R).) The values of the variables must be determined.
 
 The determination is the description of the propositions which the variable stands for.
 
 Howthedescriptionofthetermsoftheexpressioninbrackets takes place is unessential.
 
 We may distinguish 3 kinds of description: 1. Direct enumeration. In this case we can place simply its constant values instead of the variable. 2. Giving a function fx, whose values for all values of x are the propositions to be described. 3. Giving 66 TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS a formal law, according to which those propositions are constructed.
