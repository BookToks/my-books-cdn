3.317 To figure out what values a propositional variable has, you show which propositions share the same mark as that variable.

This figuring out is basically describing those propositions.

So, the focus is only on the symbols, not what they mean.

What really matters is that this description only talks about symbols and doesn’t say anything about what the symbols stand for.

How we describe the propositions doesn’t really matter.

3.318 I think of a proposition—like Frege and Russell did—as a function made up of the expressions inside it.

3.32 A sign is the part of the symbol that we can see or hear.

3.321 Two different symbols can share the same sign (like the same written word or sound), but they mean different things.

3.322 The sign can’t show what two objects have in common just because we use the same sign for both but in different ways. The sign is random. We could pick two different signs instead, so then where would the common part be in the symbolizing?

3.323 In everyday language, the same word often means different things and so belongs to different symbols, or two different words can seem to be used the same way in a sentence even though they mean different things.

For example, the word “is” can be used as a linking word, a sign of equality, or to show existence; “to exist” can be like a verb meaning “to go”; “identical” can be an adjective. Sometimes we talk about a thing, and sometimes about the fact that something is happening.

In the sentence “Green is green”—where the first “Green” is a name and the last “green” is an adjective—these words don’t just have different meanings, they are actually different symbols.
