There is only one complete way to analyze a sentence.

A sentence shows clearly and in a specific way what it means: the sentence is made up of parts.

A name cannot be broken down any further by a definition: it is a basic sign.

Every defined sign refers to other signs used in its definition; these definitions guide us.

Two signs, one basic sign and one defined by basic signs, cannot refer to things in the same way.

Names cannot be broken down into definitions.

(No sign has meaning all by itself.) What the signs do not show is revealed by how we use them. What the signs leave out is explained by how we use them.

The meanings of basic signs can be explained by explanations. Explanations are sentences that include these basic signs. So, they can only be understood if we already know what these signs mean.

Only sentences make sense; names only have meaning when they are part of a sentence.

Every part of a sentence that helps explain its meaning is called an expression (or a symbol).

(The sentence itself is also an expression.) An expression is anything important for the meaning of a sentence that different sentences can share.

An expression shows a form and a content.

An expression depends on the forms of all sentences where it can appear. It is the common feature of a group of sentences.

It is shown by the general form of the sentences it describes.

In this form, the expression stays the same while everything else can change.

So, the expression is shown by a variable, and the values of that variable are the sentences that contain the expression.

In a special case, the variable becomes a constant, and the expression becomes a sentence.
