6.2321 And, that the propositions of mathematics can be proved means nothing else than that their correctness can be seen without our having to compare what they express with the facts as regards correctness.
 
 6.2322 The identity of the meaning of two expressions cannot be asserted. For in order to be able to assert anything about their meaning, I must know their meaning, and if I know their meaning, I know whether they mean the same or something different.
 
 6.2323 The equation characterizes only the standpoint from which I consider the two expressions, that is to say the standpoint of their equality of meaning.
 
 6.233 To the question whether we need intuition for the solution of mathematical problems it must be answered that language itself here supplies the necessary intuition.
 
 6.2331 The process of calculation brings about just this intuition.
 
 Calculation is not an experiment.
 
 6.234 Mathematics is a method of logic.
 
 6.2341 The essential of mathematical method is working with equations. On this method depends the fact that every proposition of mathematics must be self-intelligible.
 
 6.24 The method by which mathematics arrives at its equations is the method of substitution.
 
 For equations express the substitutability of two expressions, and we proceed from a number of equations to new equations, replacingexpressionsbyothersinaccordancewiththeequations.
 
 6.241 Thus the proof of the proposition 2×2 = 4 runs: (Ων)µ(cid:48)x = Ων×µ(cid:48)x Def.
 
 Ω2×2(cid:48)x = (Ω2)2(cid:48)x = (Ω2)1+1(cid:48)x = Ω2(cid:48)Ω2(cid:48)x = Ω1+1(cid:48)Ω1+1(cid:48)x = (Ω(cid:48)Ω)(cid:48)(Ω(cid:48)Ω)(cid:48)x = Ω(cid:48)Ω(cid:48)Ω(cid:48)Ω(cid:48)x = Ω1+1+1+1(cid:48)x = Ω4(cid:48)x.
 
 6.3 Logical research means the investigation of all regularity. And outside logic all is accident.
