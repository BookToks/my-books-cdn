6.2321 Saying that math statements can be proved means that we can see they are true without having to check them against real-world facts.

6.2322 We can’t just say two expressions mean the same thing without understanding what they mean first. If I know what they mean, I can tell if they are the same or different.

6.2323 When we write an equation, it shows how we are looking at the two expressions—that they mean the same thing from our point of view.

6.233 When asked if we need a special kind of understanding to solve math problems, the answer is that language itself gives us that understanding.

6.2331 Doing calculations actually helps create this understanding.

Calculating is not the same as doing an experiment.

6.234 Math is a type of logical thinking.

6.2341 The main part of math is working with equations. This is why every math statement makes sense on its own.

6.24 Math finds its equations by using substitution.

Equations show that you can replace one expression with another, and we use this to get new equations by swapping parts based on the equations we have.

6.241 For example, proving that 2×2 = 4 goes like this: (Ων)µ(cid:48)x = Ων×µ(cid:48)x Def.

Ω2×2(cid:48)x = (Ω2)2(cid:48)x = (Ω2)1+1(cid:48)x = Ω2(cid:48)Ω2(cid:48)x = Ω1+1(cid:48)Ω1+1(cid:48)x = (Ω(cid:48)Ω)(cid:48)(Ω(cid:48)Ω)(cid:48)x = Ω(cid:48)Ω(cid:48)Ω(cid:48)Ω(cid:48)x = Ω1+1+1+1(cid:48)x = Ω4(cid:48)x.

6.3 Logical research is about studying all patterns and rules. Everything outside logic is just random chance.
