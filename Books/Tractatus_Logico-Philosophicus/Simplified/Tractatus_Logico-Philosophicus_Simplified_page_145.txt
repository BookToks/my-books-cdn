The "experience" we need to understand logic is not about how something behaves, but that something exists. But this is not really an experience.

Logic comes before any experience—before knowing that something is a certain way.

It comes before the "how," not before the "what."

If this wasn’t true, how could we use logic? Someone might say: If logic existed even without a world, how can logic exist since there is a world?

Russell said there are simple relations between different numbers of things (individuals). But between which numbers? And how do we decide? By experience?

There is no perfect number.

Saying any specific form is completely random.

We should be able to say before experience if, for example, I might need to use a sign showing a 27-place relation.

But can we even ask this? Can we create a sign and not know if it matches anything?

Does the question make sense: What must be true for something to be possible?

It’s clear we have an idea of the basic sentence, aside from its special logical form.

Where symbols can be made by a system, that system is what matters logically, not the individual symbols.

And how could I deal with logic forms I invent? I must deal with what makes it possible for me to invent them.
