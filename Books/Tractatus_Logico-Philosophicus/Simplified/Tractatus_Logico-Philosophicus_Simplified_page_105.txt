I call a variable like this a "sentence variable."

The expression only makes sense within a sentence. Every variable can be seen as a sentence variable.

If we change a part of a sentence into a variable, there is a group of sentences that are all the possible values of this new variable sentence. This group usually depends on what we decide the parts of the sentence mean. But if we change all the parts whose meaning we chose ourselves into variables, the group still exists. Now, this group does not depend on any decision but only on the nature of the sentence itself. It matches a logical form—a basic logical pattern.

Which values the sentence variable can take is decided.

Choosing the values is what makes the variable.

Choosing the values of the sentence variables means naming the sentences that share the variable as a feature.

This choice is a description of those sentences.

So, the choice only talks about symbols, not their meaning.

And what really matters about the choice is that it only describes symbols and says nothing about what they stand for.

How the sentences are described does not matter.

I understand a sentence—as Frege and Russell did—as a function of the expressions inside it.

A sign is the thing you can see or hear in a symbol.

Two different symbols can share the same sign (like a written or spoken character)—but they mean different things.

It can never mean the shared feature of two objects that we use the same sign for them but in two different ways.
