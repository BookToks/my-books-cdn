We can talk about certain formal qualities of objects and simple facts, or about the qualities of how facts are put together. In the same way, we can talk about formal connections and connections in structures.

Instead of saying “property of the structure,” I also say “internal property.” Instead of “relation of structures,” I say “internal relation.” I use these words to explain why many philosophers get confused between internal and external (or proper) relations. 

These internal qualities and connections can’t be directly stated in sentences, but they show up in the sentences that describe the simple facts and objects.

An internal quality of a fact is also called a feature of that fact, like how we talk about facial features.

A property is internal if you can’t imagine its object not having it. For example, a lighter blue and a darker blue are in the internal connection of brighter and darker automatically. You can’t think of these two without that connection. When the words “property” and “relation” change meaning, the word “object” changes meaning too.

The existence of an internal property in a possible situation isn’t said directly by a sentence, but it shows itself in the sentence that describes that situation, through an internal quality of the sentence.

It makes no sense to say a sentence has or doesn’t have a formal property because that property is part of what the sentence is.

You can’t tell forms apart by saying one has this property and the other has that, because that would mean it makes sense to say either property about either form.

If there is an internal connection between possible situations, this shows up in language as an internal connection between the sentences that describe them.

This way, the argument about whether all connections are internal or external disappears.
