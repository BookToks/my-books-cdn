Everything that can be said about the form of all statements can be explained at once.

All logical operations are already included in simple statements. For example, saying “fa” means the same as saying “There exists an x such that fx and x equals a.”

Where there is a combination, there is an argument and a function, and where these exist, all logical constants are already there.

You could say: the one logical constant is what all statements naturally share.

That is the general form of a statement.

The general form of a statement is the true nature of a statement.

To explain the true nature of a statement is to explain the true nature of all descriptions, and therefore the true nature of the world.

Describing the most general form of a statement means describing the one and only basic symbol in logic.

Logic must take care of itself.

A possible symbol must also be able to mean something. Everything that is possible in logic is allowed. For example, “Socrates is identical” means nothing because there is no property called “identical.” The statement makes no sense not because the symbol is wrong, but because we didn’t give it a clear meaning. In a way, we can’t make mistakes in logic.

Self-evidence, which Russell talked a lot about, can only be rejected in logic if language itself stops any logical mistakes. Logic is a priori because we cannot think illogically.

We cannot give a symbol the wrong meaning.

Occam’s razor is not just a random rule or one that works by chance. It simply says that extra parts in a symbol system mean nothing.

Symbols that serve a purpose are logically the same, while symbols that serve no purpose are meaningless in logic.

Frege says: Every properly made statement must have a meaning. I say: Every possible statement is properly made, and if it has no meaning, it’s only because we didn’t give some of its parts a meaning.
