The symbol he uses is (p, ξ, N(ξ)). Here’s what it means: p stands for all basic statements called atomic propositions.

ξ stands for any group of statements.

N(ξ) means the opposite (negation) of all the statements in ξ.

The whole symbol (p, ξ, N(ξ)) means you start with some basic statements, then you make all of them opposite, then you pick any group from these new statements, mix them with some of the original ones, and keep doing this over and over. He says this is the general way to build any statement and also the general form of a statement.

It’s not as complicated as it sounds. The symbol shows a process where, starting from basic statements, you can make all other statements. This process is based on three ideas: (a) Sheffer proved that all truth functions can come from saying “not-p and not-q” at the same time; (b) Wittgenstein’s idea that general statements come from combining statements with “and” or “or”; (c) The idea that a statement can only be part of another statement as an input to a truth function. 

Because of these, all statements that aren’t basic can be made from the basic ones by one simple process. This is what Wittgenstein’s symbol shows.

Using this method, the theory of how we make logical conclusions becomes much simpler. Wittgenstein says all statements can be made this way from basic statements, and this defines all statements. (There are some exceptions, but we will talk about them later.) He also says that statements are just truth-functions of basic statements, and if one statement follows from another, its meaning is inside the other one. This means you can’t get new facts from a basic statement. All logical statements, he says, are tautologies, like “p or not p.”
