You could say that the real name is what all the symbols that stand for something have in common. This happens step by step, so no part of the name is really more important than the others.

Our symbols might seem random sometimes, but they’re not truly random. When we choose something randomly, something else must follow. This is because of how the symbols work.

A special way of naming something might not matter much, but what’s always important is that this way of naming is possible. This is true for philosophy too: each small part might not seem important, but the fact that each part could exist helps us understand the world better.

Definitions are like rules for changing from one language to another. Every correct symbol language has to be able to change into another language by following these rules. This is what all symbol languages share.

What a symbol stands for is what all symbols that can replace it according to logical rules have in common.

For example, the common thing about all ways to write truth functions is that they can all be replaced by the symbols “∼p” (not p) and “p∨q” (p or q).

This shows how one special way of writing something can help us understand things in a general way. The symbol for a complex idea doesn’t break apart randomly when we analyze it, so its parts always fit together the same way in every sentence.

A sentence sets a place in the logical space. The existence of this logical place is guaranteed just by the existence of its parts and the fact that the sentence makes sense.

The sentence sign and the logical coordinates together make up the logical place.
