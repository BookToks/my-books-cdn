1.1 The world is made up of facts, not things.

1.11 The world is decided by the facts and by all the facts together.

1.12 Because all the facts decide what is true and what is not true.

1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.

1.2 The world is made up of facts.

1.21 Something can be true or not true while everything else stays the same.

2 What is true, the fact, is the existence of situations.

2.01 A situation is a connection between things.

2.011 It is important for a thing that it can be part of a situation.

2.012 In logic, nothing is by chance: If a thing can be in a situation, the possibility of that situation must already be in the thing.

2.0121 It would seem like a coincidence if a thing that could exist alone suddenly fit into a situation.

If things can be part of situations, it must already be part of them.
