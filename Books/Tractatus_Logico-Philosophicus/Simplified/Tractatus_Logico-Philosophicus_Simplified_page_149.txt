So: Ω0(x), Ω0+1(x), Ω0+1+1(x), Ω0+1+1+1(x), and so on.

Instead of writing “[x, ξ, Ω(x)ξ]”, I write “[Ω0(x), Ων(x), Ων+1(x)]”.

And I define: 0+1 = 1 by definition.

0+1+1 = 2 by definition.

0+1+1+1 = 3 by definition.

(and so on) 6.021 The number is the exponent of an operation.

6.022 The concept of number is nothing but what all numbers have in common, the general form of number.

The concept of number is the variable number.

And the idea of number equality is the general form of all specific equalities of numbers.

6.03 The general form of a whole number is: [0, ξ, ξ + 1].

6.031 The theory of classes is completely unnecessary in mathematics.

This is because the generality we need in math is not random.

6.1 The statements of logic are tautologies.

6.11 So, statements of logic don’t really say anything. (They are analytic statements.) 6.111 Theories that make a logical statement seem meaningful are always wrong. For example, you might think that the words “true” and “false” are just two properties among others, and so it would seem strange that every statement has one of these properties. But this isn’t at all obvious, just like the sentence “all roses are either yellow or red” wouldn’t sound obvious even if it was true.
