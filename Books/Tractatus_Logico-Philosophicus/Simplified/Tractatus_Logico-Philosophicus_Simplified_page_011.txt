A shape can be shown in many different ways. Each way is like a different language, but the important parts of the shape stay the same no matter how you show it.

These important parts are like what a sentence and the fact it talks about have in common. If a sentence is true, it must share something with the fact.

This is easy to see sometimes. For example, if you talk about two people, you need to use two names. If you want to say how they are connected, the sentence has to show a connection between the two names. If we say “Plato loves Socrates,” the word “loves” connects “Plato” and “Socrates.” Because of this, the sentence can show the relationship between these two people. We shouldn’t say the sentence just says the relation; instead, it says that Plato stands in that relation to Socrates.

Mr. Wittgenstein starts his idea about symbols by saying: “We make pictures of facts.” A picture is like a model of real life. The things in real life match parts of the picture, and the picture itself is a fact. The fact that things relate to each other is shown by how the parts of the picture relate to each other. For a picture to represent reality, it must share something with reality. What they share is the way the picture shows things.

When we say “logical picture of reality,” we mean that the picture looks like the fact only in the way it’s built, not in any other way. Wittgenstein calls a logical picture of a fact a "Gedanke" (thought). A picture can match the fact and be true, or not match and be false, but in both cases, the picture has the same logical form as the fact. He explains this by saying things like a record, the music it plays, the written music, and the sound waves all have a special connection, like the connection between language and the world.
