If you paid money to get a Project Gutenberg electronic book and you don’t agree to the rules here, you can ask for your money back from whoever you paid.

Project Gutenberg is a registered name. Only people who agree to follow these rules can use it with their electronic books. You can do some things with most Project Gutenberg books without following all the rules. Check paragraph 1.C for more. If you follow the rules and help keep Project Gutenberg free, you can do a lot more. See paragraph 1.E for details.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (called "the Foundation") owns the collection of Project Gutenberg books. Almost all the books are old enough to be free to use in the United States. If a book is free to use in the US and you live there, you can copy, share, perform, or change it as long as you remove any mention of Project Gutenberg. But they hope you will support their goal by sharing the books for free and keeping the Project Gutenberg name attached. You can follow the rules easily by keeping the book in the same format and including the full Project Gutenberg License when you share it for free.

Copyright laws where you live also affect what you can do with the books. These laws change a lot. If you live outside the US, check your country’s laws before downloading, copying, showing, performing, sharing, or changing any Project Gutenberg book. The Foundation doesn’t guarantee the copyright status of books outside the US.

If you don’t remove all mentions of Project Gutenberg, you must always show this sentence clearly whenever the book is accessed, shown, performed, copied, or shared: “This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org.”
