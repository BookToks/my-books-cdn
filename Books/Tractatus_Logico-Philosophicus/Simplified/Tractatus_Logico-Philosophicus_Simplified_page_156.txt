6.2321 When we say math sentences can be proven, it just means we can understand they are true without having to check them against real-world facts.

6.2322 We can't say two expressions always mean the same thing. To say something about their meaning, I have to know what they mean. And if I know that, I can tell if they mean the same or different things.

6.2323 An equation just shows the point of view from which we look at the two expressions—that they have the same meaning.

6.233 The question of whether we need intuition to solve math problems is answered by saying that language itself gives us the needed intuition.

6.2331 The process of calculating gives us this kind of intuition.

Calculating is not the same as doing an experiment.

6.234 Math is a way of using logic.

6.2341 The main thing about math is working with equations. Because of this method, every math statement should be clear and understandable by itself.

6.24 The way math gets its equations is by substitution.

Equations show that you can replace one expression with another. We move from one set of equations to new ones by replacing expressions according to the equations.

6.241 Here is the proof that 2 × 2 = 4: (Ων)µx = Ων×µx by definition.

Ω2×2x = (Ω2)2x = (Ω2)1+1x = Ω2Ω2x = Ω1+1Ω1+1x = (ΩΩ)(ΩΩ)x = ΩΩΩΩx = Ω1+1+1+1x = Ω4x.
