There can’t be a ranking of the simplest kinds of sentences. We can only predict what we create ourselves.

The real world is limited by all the things in it. This limit also shows up in all the simplest sentences.

Rankings exist, but they have to be separate from reality.

If we know for sure from logic alone that simplest sentences must exist, then everyone who understands these sentences without breaking them down should know this too.

All the sentences we use every day are actually perfectly ordered in a logical way, just as they are. What we’re supposed to show here isn’t just an example of truth but the full truth itself.

(Our problems aren’t vague—they might be the most real problems there are.) Whether a simplest sentence exists depends on how we apply logic.

What depends on how we use something can’t be predicted by logic.

That’s clear: Logic can’t conflict with how it’s used.

But logic has to connect with how it’s used.

So, logic and its use can’t overlap or mix.

If I can’t say what the simplest sentences are before using them, then trying to say what they are would lead to obvious nonsense.

The limits of my language are the limits of my world.

Logic fills the world; the limits of the world are also its limits.

So, we can’t say in logic: this thing exists in the world, but that thing doesn’t.

Because that would mean we exclude some possibilities, which can’t happen; otherwise, logic would have to go beyond the world’s limits, as if it could see those limits from the outside.
