If one thing follows from another, then the first thing gives the second a probability of 1, which means it is certain. Logical conclusions are just a special case of probability where the chance is 100%.

A statement by itself is not more or less likely to be true. Something either happens or it doesn’t; there’s no in-between.

Imagine you have a box with the same number of black and white balls. You pick one ball, then put it back, and keep doing this. Over time, the number of black and white balls you pick will be about the same.

This is not just a math fact.

If I say it’s equally likely to pick a black or white ball, I mean that all the things I know (including natural laws I assume) give the chance of picking one color no higher than the other. So, each color has a probability of 1.

What I can check in an experiment is that picking black or white doesn’t depend on things I don’t know about.

The basic idea of probability is: The things I don’t know about give a certain chance for an event to happen.

Probability is a general idea.

It describes how likely something is when we don’t know for sure.

If we don’t know everything about a fact but understand part of it, probability helps us guess.

A statement might not show the whole picture, but it always shows a complete part of it. Probability is like a summary of other statements.
