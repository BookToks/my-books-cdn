When the equal sign is used, it means something different—it shows a different kind of relationship. So, the symbol means different things in each case; the two symbols only happen to look the same by chance.

The number of basic steps needed depends only on how we write things down.

What matters is creating a system of signs with a certain number of dimensions—a specific kind of mathematical space.

It’s clear that this isn’t about naming basic ideas, but about expressing a rule.

Every truth function comes from applying the operation (– – – – –W)(ξ,....) step by step to simple sentences.

This operation denies all the sentences inside the right bracket, and I call it the negation of those sentences.

A bracket expression, whose parts are sentences, is shown—if the order of parts doesn’t matter—by a symbol like “(ξ)”. “ξ” is a variable whose values are the parts inside the bracket; the line over the variable shows that it stands for all its values inside the bracket.

(So if ξ has the three values P, Q, R, then (ξ) = (P, Q, R).) The values of the variable are fixed.

Fixing the values means describing the sentences the variable stands for.

How we describe the parts inside the bracket doesn’t really matter.

We can describe them in three ways: 1. By listing them directly. In this case, we just use their fixed values instead of the variable. 2. By giving a function fx, whose values for every x are the sentences we want to describe.
