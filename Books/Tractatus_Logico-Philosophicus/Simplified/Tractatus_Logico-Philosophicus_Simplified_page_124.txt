If we write this column as a series, the symbol looks like this: “(WW–W)(p, q)” or more clearly “(WWFW)(p, q)”.

(The number of spaces in the left bracket depends on the number of parts in the right one.) For n basic sentences, there are L possible groups of truth conditions.

The groups of truth conditions that belong to the possible truth values of some basic sentences can be arranged in a series.

Among the possible groups of truth conditions, there are two extreme cases.

In one case, the sentence is true for every possible truth value of the basic sentences. We say these truth conditions are tautological.

In the second case, the sentence is false for every possible truth value. These truth conditions are contradictory.

In the first case, we call the sentence a tautology, and in the second case, a contradiction.

The sentence shows what it says; tautologies and contradictions show that they say nothing.

A tautology has no truth conditions because it is true no matter what; and a contradiction is never true under any condition.

Tautologies and contradictions are meaningless.

(Like a dot where two arrows go off in opposite directions.) (For example, I don’t learn anything about the weather if I know it’s raining or not raining.)

But tautologies and contradictions are not nonsense; they belong to symbolism, kind of like how “0” belongs to arithmetic symbolism.
