I’m talking about doing several steps one after another on some sentences.

The general pattern of a series like a, Oa, OOa, ... I write like this: “[a, x, Ox]”. This bracket thing is like a variable. The first part is the start of the series, the second is any part in the series, and the third is the part that comes right after the second.

Doing one step after another means the same as saying “and so on.”

One step can undo what another step did. Steps can cancel each other out.

Sometimes a step can disappear, like when you have two negatives in a row: “not not p” is the same as “p.”

All sentences come from truth steps using basic sentences.

A truth step is how you get a truth function from basic sentences.

Just like you make a new truth function from basic sentences, you can also make a new one from other truth functions. Every truth step takes truth functions from basic sentences and makes a new truth function from basic sentences, which is a sentence. The result of any truth step with results from other truth steps with basic sentences is still the result of a truth step with basic sentences.

Every sentence is the result of truth steps with basic sentences.

The patterns in No. 4.31 still make sense, even if “p,” “q,” or “r” aren’t basic sentences.

And it’s easy to see that the symbol in No. 4.442, even if “p” and “q” are truth functions of basic sentences, still shows a truth function of basic sentences.
