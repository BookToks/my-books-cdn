No! A sentence is true when things are really the way the sentence says. If we use “p” to mean something and “∼p” to mean the opposite, and things are really like we said, then “p” is true in this new way and not false.

It’s important that the symbols “p” and “∼p” can say the same thing. This shows that the symbol “∼” (which means “not”) doesn’t actually stand for anything real.

Just because a sentence has a “not” in it doesn’t change its meaning (like ∼∼p = p).

The sentences “p” and “∼p” have opposite meanings, but they both relate to the same real situation.

Here’s an example to explain what truth means: imagine a black spot on white paper. You can describe the shape of the spot by saying for each point if it’s black or white. Saying a point is black is a positive fact, saying it’s white (not black) is a negative fact. If I name a point (a truth value), I am making an assumption to judge it, and so on.

But to say whether a point is black or white, I first need to know what counts as black and what counts as white. To say “p” is true or false, I have to decide when I call “p” true, and this decides the meaning of the sentence.

The problem with this example is: we can point to a spot on the paper even if we don’t know what black or white means. But a sentence without meaning doesn’t stand for anything—it doesn’t name something that can be true or false. The verb in a sentence isn’t “is true” or “is false,” like Frege thought; what “is true” already has this verb inside it.

Every sentence must already have meaning; just saying it’s true doesn’t give it meaning, because saying it’s true already assumes its meaning. The same goes for saying it’s not true and so on.

You could say: the “not” refers to the logical place that the original sentence points to.

A negative sentence points to a different logical place than the sentence it denies.
