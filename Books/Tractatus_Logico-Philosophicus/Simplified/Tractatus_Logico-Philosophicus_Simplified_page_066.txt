Why are there suddenly words here? This needs to be explained.

But there is no explanation, and there can’t be one because the process isn’t actually allowed. If a new shortcut is needed in one place, we have to ask: Where should this shortcut always be used? Its place in logic has to be clear.

5.453 All numbers in logic must be able to be explained.

Or actually, it should be clear that there are no numbers in logic.

There are no special numbers.

5.454 In logic, things can’t be placed side by side, and there can be no sorting.

In logic, there can’t be something more general or something more specific.

5.4541 Solving logical problems must be simple because they set the example for simplicity.

People have always believed there must be a group of questions where the answers are balanced and connected in a neat, complete system.

A group where the statement “simple sign of truth” is true.

5.46 When we correctly use logical signs, the meaning of all their combinations is already included: so not only “p or q” but also “not (p or not q),” and so on. We should already know how all possible bracket combinations work; then it would be clear that the real basic signs aren’t “p or q” or “there exists an x such that fx,” but the most general form of their combinations.

5.461 The small fact that signs like “or” and “implies” need brackets—unlike real relations—is very important.

Using brackets with these signs shows they are not the real basic signs; and no one would think brackets have meaning on their own.

5.4611 Logical operation signs are like punctuation marks.
