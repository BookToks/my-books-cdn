344 A symbol means what it has in common with other symbols that can replace it following certain logical rules.

3.3441 For example, all ways of showing how truth works share something: they can all be written using “∼p” (which means “not p”) and “p∨q” (which means “p or q”).

(This shows how a special way of writing can teach us general ideas.) 3.3442 The meaning of a complex symbol isn’t decided randomly; it stays the same in every logical setup.

3.4 A proposition points to a spot in logical space. This spot exists just because its parts exist and because the proposition itself is meaningful.

3.41 The proposition sign and its logical position together make the logical place.

3.411 Logical places are like points in geometry because both show where something can exist.

3.42 Even though one proposition points to one place in logical space, it already shows the whole logical space must exist.

(If not, things like denial or combining statements would always add something new.) (The logical framework around the picture sets the logical space. The proposition connects to all of logical space.) 3.5 When we use a propositional sign in thought, that is the thought itself.

4 A thought is a meaningful proposition.

4.001 All propositions together make up a language.

4.002 People can make languages that express any meaning, even if they don’t know how each word works—just like we speak without knowing how each sound is made.

Colloquial language is part of humans and is just as complex as we are.
