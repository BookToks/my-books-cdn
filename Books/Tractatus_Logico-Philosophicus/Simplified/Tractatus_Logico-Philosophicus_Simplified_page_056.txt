Neither of them can decide what’s real or not.

4.464 A statement that’s always true (a tautology) is certain. A statement that could be true or false is possible. A statement that can’t be true (a contradiction) is impossible. These ideas—certain, possible, impossible—help us understand probability.

4.465 When you combine a tautology with another statement, the meaning stays the same as the original statement. So, the combination is basically the same as the statement itself. You can’t change the symbol’s meaning without changing what it means.

4.466 A specific logical combination of signs matches a specific logical combination of their meanings. Random combinations only match random signs.

Propositions that are true no matter what can’t just be random signs, because then they would only match definite objects.

If a logical combination doesn’t match anything, then no objects match it either. Tautologies and contradictions are the extreme cases where combinations of symbols break down.

4.4661 Of course, signs are still connected in tautologies and contradictions—they relate to each other—but these connections don’t actually mean anything important.

4.5 Now, it looks like we can describe the most general kind of proposition. That means we can create a system of signs where every possible meaning can be shown by a symbol that fits the system, and every symbol in the system can stand for some meaning if we pick the right names.

In describing this most general form, we only include what’s really important—nothing extra. That’s why it’s the most general form.

We know this general form exists because there can’t be a proposition with a form we didn’t expect.
