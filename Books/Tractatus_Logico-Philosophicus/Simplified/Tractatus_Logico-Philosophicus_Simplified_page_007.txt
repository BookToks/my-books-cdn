NOTE When making Mr. Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus available for English readers, we decided to show the original text side by side with the translation. This way was chosen because the vocabulary is pretty hard and the writing style is unusual.

Because of this, we could be a bit flexible with some parts that might seem too literal if translated exactly.

The author himself carefully checked the proofs of the translation and the original version that came out in the last issue of Ostwald’s Annalen der Naturphilosophie in 1921. The editor also wants to thank Mr. F. P. Ramsey from Trinity College, Cambridge, for helping with the translation and getting the book ready to print.
