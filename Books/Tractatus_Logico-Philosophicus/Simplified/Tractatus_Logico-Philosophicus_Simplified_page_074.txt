We actually notice two different things.

If I look closely at corner a and just glance at b, a seems closer and b farther away, and if I do the opposite, b seems closer and a farther.

Now, we need to answer questions about all possible forms of simple sentences.

A simple sentence is made up of names. But since we can’t say how many names with different meanings there are, we can’t explain how a simple sentence is put together.

Our main idea is that any question that logic can answer can be solved easily without extra trouble.

If we have to check the real world to answer such a problem, it means we are thinking about it the wrong way.

The “experience” needed to understand logic isn’t about knowing that something is true; it’s just about knowing that something exists—but that isn’t really an experience.

Logic comes before any experience—before we know that something is true.

It happens before we ask how something is true, not before we ask what is true.

If this wasn’t true, how could we use logic? We might say: if logic existed even without the world, then how could logic exist just because the world exists?

Russell said there are simple connections between different numbers of things (individuals). But which numbers?

And how could we figure this out—by experience?

There isn’t a most important number.
