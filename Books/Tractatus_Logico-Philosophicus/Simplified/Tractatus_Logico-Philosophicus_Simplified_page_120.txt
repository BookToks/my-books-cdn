(Frege and Russell missed this; the way they try to express general sentences like the one above is wrong because it contains a circular problem.) 

We can find the general member of a series of forms by giving the first member and the general way to get the next member from the previous sentence.

4.1274 Asking if a formal concept exists is pointless.

Because no sentence can answer that question.

(For example, you can’t ask: "Are there unanalyzable subject-predicate sentences?") 4.128 Logical forms are endless.

That’s why in logic, there aren’t special numbers, and there’s no philosophical idea of only one or two main things.

4.2 The meaning of a sentence is how it matches or doesn’t match the possibilities of facts existing or not existing.

4.21 The simplest sentence, the elementary sentence, says that a fact exists.

4.211 A sign of the elementary sentence is that no other elementary sentence can contradict it.

4.22 The elementary sentence is made up of names. It’s a connection, a chain, of names.

4.221 It’s clear that when we analyze sentences, we must come down to elementary sentences made of names directly connected.

Now the question is, how do sentences connect?

4.2211 Even if the world is infinitely complex, so every fact has infinite parts and every fact is made of infinite objects, there still must be objects and facts.

4.23 A name only appears in a sentence as part of an elementary sentence.
