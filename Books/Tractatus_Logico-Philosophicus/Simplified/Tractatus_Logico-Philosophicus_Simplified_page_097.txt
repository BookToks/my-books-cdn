Objects have the possibility of all situations.

The way an object can appear in situations is the form of the object.

An object is simple.

Any statement about groups can be broken down into statements about their parts and sentences that fully describe those groups.

Objects make up the substance of the world. So, they cannot be made by combining other things.

If the world had no substance, whether a sentence makes sense would depend on whether another sentence is true.

Then, it would be impossible to create a picture of the world that is true or false.

It’s clear that even a world imagined very differently from the real one must share something—a form—with the real world.

This fixed form is made up of objects.

The substance of the world can only be a form, not physical properties. These only come from sentences and how objects are arranged.

By the way: objects have no color.

Two objects with the same logical form are only different from each other because they are not the same.

Either an object has properties that make it stand out, so you can describe it and point it out; or there are many objects that share all their properties, and then you can’t point to just one of them.

If an object can’t be pointed out by anything special, then I can’t point it out at all—because pointing it out would make it special.
