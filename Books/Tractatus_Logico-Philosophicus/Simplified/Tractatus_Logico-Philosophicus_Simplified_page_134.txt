All truth functions come from applying a limited number of truth operations step by step to basic statements.

Here, it becomes clear that there are no “logical objects” or “logical constants” like Frege and Russell thought.

Because all results from truth operations with truth functions are the same if they represent the same truth function of basic statements.

It’s obvious that symbols like ∨ and ⊃ are not relationships like left and right.

The fact that the basic logical symbols of Frege and Russell can be defined using each other shows they are not really basic symbols, and they don’t represent relations.

Also, the “⊃” we define using “∼” and “∨” is the same as the one we get when we define “∨” using “∼” and “⊃”, and that “∨” is the same as the first one, and so on.

It’s hard to believe that from one fact p, infinitely many others follow, like ∼∼p, ∼∼∼∼p, etc. It’s also strange that infinite logical (or mathematical) sentences come from just a few basic “laws.”

But all logical sentences say the same thing. Actually, they say nothing.

Truth functions are not real-world functions.

For example, if you can make a positive statement by denying a denial twice, does that mean the denial is part of the positive statement in some way? Does “∼∼p” deny “∼p,” or does it affirm p, or both?

The statement “∼∼p” isn’t about denial as a thing; but the possibility of denial is already included in affirmation.

If there was an object called “∼,” then “∼∼p” would say something different than “p.” Because one would be about “∼,” and the other wouldn’t.

This disappearing of the so-called logical constants also happens when you write “∼(∃x).”
