“∼fx” means the same as “(x).fx”, or “(∃x).fx.x = a” means the same as “fa”.

If we have a sentence, then we also have the results of all the truth operations based on that sentence.

If there are logical symbols, then a proper logic must clearly explain how they relate to each other and why they exist.

The structure of logic from its symbols must be clear.

If logic has basic concepts, they must be independent from each other. When a basic concept is introduced, it has to be used the same way everywhere it appears. You can’t introduce it first for one case and then again for another. For example, if negation (the “not” sign) is introduced, we must understand it the same way in sentences like “∼p”, “∼(p ∨ q)”, and “(∃x).∼fx”. We can’t treat it differently in different cases because then it wouldn’t be clear if it means the same thing, and there would be no reason to use the same symbol in both cases.

In short, when introducing symbols, the same rules apply as what Frege said about introducing signs by definitions.

Introducing a new tool or symbol in logic must be a serious decision. No new tool should be added casually or without careful thought.

In the “Principia Mathematica” by Russell and Whitehead, definitions and basic rules appear in words.

Why are words used here? This needs an explanation. But there isn’t one, and there can’t be, because this way of doing it is not allowed.

If a new tool really needs to be introduced, then we have to immediately ask: where must this tool be used from now on? Its place in logic must be clearly explained.
