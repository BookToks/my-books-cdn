Every sentence already has a meaning; just saying it doesn't give it meaning because what it says is the meaning itself. The same goes for saying something is not true, and so on.

You could say that when you deny something, you're already connected to the idea that the original sentence was about.

The sentence that denies something points to a different logical place than the sentence it denies.

The denying sentence shows this different place by saying it is outside the place of the original sentence.

If you can deny a denied sentence again, it means what is being denied is already a full sentence, not just the start of one.

A sentence shows whether simple facts exist or don’t exist.

All the true sentences together make up all natural science.

Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences.

The word "philosophy" means something that is either above or below natural sciences, but not next to them.

Philosophy's job is to make thoughts clear.

Philosophy is not about making theories but about doing work.

A philosophy book mainly explains things clearly.

Philosophy doesn’t give you a list of "philosophical sentences," but it makes sentences easier to understand.

Philosophy should make thoughts clear and separate, because otherwise they are confusing and blurry.

Psychology is no closer to philosophy than any other natural science.

The study of knowledge is the philosophy of psychology.

Isn’t my study of sign language like studying how people think, which philosophers used to say was very important for philosophy of logic?
