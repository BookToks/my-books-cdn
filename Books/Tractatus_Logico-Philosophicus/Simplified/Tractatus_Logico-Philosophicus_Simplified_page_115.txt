A sentence that says something is not true shows a place by using the place of the sentence it denies, but it describes that place as outside of it.

The fact that you can deny a negative sentence again shows that what is being denied is already a full sentence, not just the start of one.

4.1 A sentence shows whether things exist or don’t exist.

4.11 All the true sentences together make up all of natural science (or all the natural sciences).

4.111 Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences.

(The word “philosophy” must mean something that is above or below, but not next to, the natural sciences.)

4.112 The purpose of philosophy is to clear up our thinking.

Philosophy is not a set of teachings, but an activity.

A philosophical work mainly explains things.

The result of philosophy is not “philosophical sentences,” but understanding sentences clearly.

Philosophy should make thoughts that are usually unclear and fuzzy become clear and sharply defined.

4.1121 Psychology is no closer to philosophy than any other natural science.

Epistemology is the philosophy of psychology.

Doesn’t my study of sign language match the study of thinking that philosophers saw as very important for the philosophy of logic? But they often got stuck in unimportant psychological details, and my method can have the same problem.

4.1122 Darwin’s theory has no more to do with philosophy than any other natural science idea.
