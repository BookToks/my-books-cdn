If you have all the objects, then you already have all the objects you need.

If you have all the basic sentences, then you already have all the basic sentences there are.

It's wrong to say that the sentence "(∃x).fx" means "fx is possible," like Russell said.

Whether something is certain, possible, or impossible isn't shown by a sentence itself. Instead, it's shown by whether an expression is always true (a tautology), makes sense, or is a contradiction.

The important part has to be inside the symbol itself.

You can describe the whole world using fully general sentences. That means you don’t have to name any specific object from the start.

To talk in normal language, you just say something like "there is exactly one x that..." and then say "This x is a."

A fully general sentence is made up just like any other sentence. You can see this because in "(∃x,φ).φx" you have to mention "φ" and "x" separately. Both refer to the world on their own, just like in sentences that aren't general.

A sign that a symbol is made up of parts is that it shares something with other symbols.

Changing whether a sentence is true or false changes the overall structure of the world. The range that this structure allows is limited by the fully general sentences.

(If one basic sentence is true, then at least one more basic sentence is true.)

I show that two objects are the same by showing that their signs are the same, not by using an equals sign.

Different objects are shown by different signs.
