We can only understand things if cause and effect are necessary, like how logical steps must follow each other.

Knowing something and what we know are connected by logical rules.

Saying "A knows that p is true" doesn’t make sense if p is always true no matter what.

If something seems obvious to us, that doesn’t mean it’s actually true. Just being obvious isn’t a good reason to believe it.

If one statement comes from another, then the second statement tells us more than the first.

If one statement follows from another, and the second also follows from the first, then they are basically the same.

A statement that’s always true (a tautology) follows from all statements but doesn’t tell us anything new.

Contradiction is something that separates statements; no two statements share a contradiction. Tautology is what all statements share, even if they have nothing else in common.

Contradiction is like the outside limit of statements, while tautology is like their empty center.

If T is the number of reasons why a statement “r” is true, and T is the number of reasons why another statement “s” is true that also apply to “r,” then the ratio of these numbers shows how likely “r” makes “s” to be true.

If we count the number of “T”s in statement r and the number of those same “T”s in statement s, then the chance that r gives to s is the ratio between these counts.

There’s nothing special about statements that talk about probability.

Statements that don’t share any reasons for being true are called independent.
