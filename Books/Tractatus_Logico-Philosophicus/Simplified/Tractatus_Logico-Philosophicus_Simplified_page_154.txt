Without worrying about meaning or sense, we create logical sentences from others just by following rules about signs.

The proof of logical sentences means we get them from other logical sentences by applying certain steps one after another, which always produce tautologies. (Only tautologies come from a tautology.) Of course, this way of proving that sentences are tautologies doesn’t really matter much in logic. That’s partly because the sentences we start from have to show without proof that they are tautologies.

In logic, the process and the result are the same. (So, it’s not surprising.) Proof in logic is just a mechanical tool to help us recognize tautologies when they get complicated.

It would be strange if you could prove a meaningful sentence logically from others, and also prove a logical sentence. It’s clear from the start that proving a meaningful sentence and proving something in logic are two very different things.

A meaningful sentence says something, and its proof shows that it’s true; in logic, every sentence is like a proof form.

Every logical sentence is a mode of modus ponens shown with signs. (And you can’t express modus ponens by a sentence.) You can always see logic so that every sentence is its own proof.

All logical sentences are equal; there aren’t really basic laws and derived sentences among them.

Every tautology shows by itself that it is a tautology.

It’s clear that the number of “basic logical laws” is random, because you could get all of logic from just one basic law, for example by making the logical product from Frege’s basic laws.
