All numbers in logic have to make sense.

Or better said: it turns out that there are actually no numbers in logic.

There are no special numbers.

In logic, things don't just stand side by side, so you can’t really group or classify them.

In logic, there isn’t something more general or more specific.

The answers to logical problems have to be simple because they set the standard for simplicity.

People have always guessed that there must be a set of questions where the answers are balanced from the start and fit together perfectly.

A place where the rule “simple is the mark of the true” applies.

If you introduce logical symbols the right way, then you also introduce the meaning of all their combinations. So not just “p or q” but also “not (p or not q)” and so on.

You also get the meaning of all possible ways to use brackets. This shows that the most basic symbols are not things like “p or q” or “there exists x such that f(x),” but the most general form of combining these symbols.

It’s important to notice that logical symbols like “or” (∨) and “implies” (⊃) need brackets to make sense—unlike real relationships.

Using brackets with these symbols shows they are not the real basic symbols. And nobody thinks that brackets mean something on their own.

Logical operation signs are like punctuation marks.

It’s clear that anything you can say about the form of all sentences can be said all at once.

All logical operations are already in the simplest sentences. For example, “fa” means the same as “there exists an x such that f(x), and x equals a.”

Wherever things are combined, there is an argument and a function, and where those exist, all logical constants are already there.
