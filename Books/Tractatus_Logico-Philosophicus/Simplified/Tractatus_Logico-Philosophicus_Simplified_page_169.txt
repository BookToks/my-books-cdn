If a Project Gutenberg electronic book comes from the public domain (which means it doesn’t say it’s posted with permission from the copyright owner), you can copy and share it with anyone in the United States for free.

But if you share a work that has "Project Gutenberg" on it, you have to follow certain rules from paragraphs 1.E.1 to 1.E.7 or get permission as explained in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

If a Project Gutenberg work is shared with permission from the copyright owner, you must follow the rules in paragraphs 1.E.1 to 1.E.7 and any extra rules the owner sets. These extra rules will be linked at the start of the work.

Don’t remove or separate the full Project Gutenberg License from this work or any related files.

When you copy, show, perform, or share this work or any part of it, you must clearly show the sentence from paragraph 1.E.1 with active links or easy access to the full Project Gutenberg License.

You can change the file format to things like zipped files, word documents, or web pages. But if you share it in a format different from the official “Plain Vanilla ASCII” version on the Project Gutenberg website, you must also provide the original version for free if someone asks for it. Any new format must include the full Project Gutenberg License.

You cannot charge money for accessing, viewing, copying, or sharing any Project Gutenberg works unless you follow the rules in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

You are allowed to charge a fair fee for copies or access to Project Gutenberg works if you pay 20% of your profits from that to the owner of the Project Gutenberg trademark. This fee is donated to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. You must pay this royalty within 60 days after you file your taxes.
