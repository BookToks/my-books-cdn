Substance is what exists no matter what is happening.

It is both shape and content.

Space, time, and color are ways objects show their form.

Only if objects exist can the world have a solid shape.

The solid, the real, and the object are all the same.

The object is the solid, real thing; the arrangement is what changes and is not fixed.

How objects are arranged makes up a fact.

In a fact, objects depend on each other like links in a chain.

In a fact, objects relate to each other in a certain way.

The way objects connect in a fact is called the structure of that fact.

Form is the possibility of structure.

The structure of a fact is made up of the structures of smaller facts.

All the facts that exist together make up the world.

All the facts that exist also decide which facts do not exist.

Whether facts exist or not is reality.

(When a fact exists, we call it a positive fact; when it does not, a negative fact.) Facts are independent of each other.

Just because one fact exists or doesn’t exist, we can’t say anything for sure about another fact.

All of reality together is the world.
