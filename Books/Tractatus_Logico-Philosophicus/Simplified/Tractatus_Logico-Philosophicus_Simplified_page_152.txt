6.121 Logical sentences show the logical features of sentences by connecting them to sentences that don’t say anything meaningful.

You could call this a “zero method.”

In a logical sentence, sentences are balanced with each other, and the balance shows how these sentences must be logically.

6.122 This means we don’t really need logical sentences because, with the right symbols, we can see the formal features of sentences just by looking at them.

6.1221 For example, if two sentences “p” and “q” combined as “p ⊃ q” always turn out true (a tautology), it’s clear that q follows from p.

If “q” follows from “p ⊃ q . p,” we can see it from these sentences themselves, or we can show it by connecting them as “p ⊃ q . p :⊃: q” and proving this is a tautology.

6.1222 This helps explain why logical sentences can’t be confirmed or disproved by experience.

A logical sentence can’t be proven wrong by any experience, and it also can’t be proven right by experience.

6.1223 Now it’s clear why people often felt like “logical truths” are something we can demand: because we can demand a good enough notation.

6.1224 It also explains why logic is called the study of forms and reasoning.

6.123 It’s clear: logical laws shouldn’t depend on other logical laws.

(As Russell thought, there isn’t a separate law of contradiction for each “type,” one is enough because it doesn’t apply to itself.)
