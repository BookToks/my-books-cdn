Objects make up everything in the world. So, they can’t be made of other things.

If the world didn’t have any substance, then whether a statement made sense would depend on whether another statement was true.

Because of that, it would be impossible to imagine a picture of the world that is either true or false.

Even if an imagined world is very different from the real one, it still has to share something—a kind of shape or form—with the real world.

This fixed form is made up of objects.

The substance of the world can only decide the shape, not the material stuff. The material stuff shows up first in statements, which come from how objects are arranged.

In simple terms: objects don’t have color by themselves.

Two objects that have the same logical form are only different because they are not the same thing.

Either a thing has unique features that let us describe and point to it, or many things share all their features, making it impossible to single one out.

If something isn’t different in any way, I can’t tell it apart from others—because if I could, it would be different.

Substance is what exists no matter what happens.

It includes both form and content.

Space, time, and color are all forms of objects.

Only if there are objects can the world have a fixed form.

The fixed, the real, and the object are all the same.

The object is what stays the same; the way things are arranged can change.
