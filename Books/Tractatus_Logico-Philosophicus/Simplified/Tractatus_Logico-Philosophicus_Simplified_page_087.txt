(As with the system of numbers one must be able to write downanyarbitrarynumber, sowiththesystemofmechanicsone must be able to write down any arbitrary physical proposition.) 6.342 And now we see the relative position of logic and mechanics.
 
 (We could construct the network out of figures of different kinds, as out of triangles and hexagons together.) That a picture like that instanced above can be described by a network of a given form asserts nothing about the picture. (For this holds of every picture of this kind.) But this does characterize the picture, the fact, namely, that it can be completely described by a definite net of definite fineness.
 
 So too the fact that it can be described by Newtonian mechanics asserts nothing about the world; but this asserts something, namely, that it can be described in that particular way in which it is described, as is indeed the case. The fact, too, that it can be described more simply by one system of mechanics than by another says something about the world.
 
 6.343 Mechanics is an attempt to construct according to a single plan all true propositions which we need for the description of the world.
 
 6.3431 Through the whole apparatus of logic the physical laws still speak of the objects of the world.
 
 6.3432 We must not forget that the description of the world by mechanics is always quite general. There is, for example, never any mention of particular material points in it, but always only of some points or other.
 
 6.35 Although the spots in our picture are geometrical figures, geometry can obviously say nothing about their actual form and position. Butthenetworkispurely geometrical, andallitsproperties can be given a priori.
 
 Laws, like the law of causation, etc., treat of the network and not of what the network described.
 
 6.36 If there were a law of causality, it might run: “There are natural laws”.
 
 85 TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS But that can clearly not be said: it shows itself.
