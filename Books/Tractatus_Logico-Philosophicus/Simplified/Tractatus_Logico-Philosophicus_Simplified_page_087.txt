Just like with numbers, where you need to be able to write down any number you want, with mechanics you need to be able to write down any physical statement.

Now we understand how logic and mechanics are connected.

We could build a network using different shapes, like triangles and hexagons together. Saying a picture can be shown by a network of a certain kind doesn’t really tell us anything about the picture itself. This is true for any picture like this. But what does matter is that the picture can be fully described by a specific kind of network with a certain level of detail.

Similarly, the fact that Newtonian mechanics can describe something doesn’t say much about the world. But it does say that the world can be described in that particular way, which is true. Also, if one system of mechanics explains something more simply than another, that tells us something about the world.

Mechanics tries to build all the true statements we need to describe the world using just one system.

Even though logic is used, the physical laws still talk about real things in the world.

We should remember that mechanics always describes the world in a general way. It never talks about specific objects but only some objects in general.

Even though the spots in our picture are shapes, geometry can’t say anything about their exact form or place. But the network itself is just geometry, and all its features can be known beforehand.

Laws, like cause and effect, are about the network itself, not what the network represents.

If there was a law of cause and effect, it might say: “There are natural laws.”

But this can’t really be said; it just shows itself.
