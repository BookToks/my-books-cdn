1252 Series that are ordered by relations inside themselves I call formal series.

The series of numbers is ordered not by something outside, but by something inside the series.

The same goes for the series of statements like “aRb”, “(∃x): aRx.xRb”, “(∃x,y): aRx.aRy.yRb”, and so on.

(If b is related to a in one of these ways, I call b a successor of a.)  

4.126 When we talk about formal properties, we can also talk about formal concepts.

(I use this phrase to clear up confusion between formal concepts and proper concepts, which has been a problem in old logic.) You can’t say with a sentence that something belongs to a formal concept. Instead, you can see it in the sign for that thing. (For example, a name shows it stands for an object, a number sign shows it stands for a number, and so on.) Formal concepts can’t be shown by a function like proper concepts can.

This is because their special features, the formal properties, aren’t shown by functions.

Instead, a formal property shows up as a feature of certain symbols.

So, the sign that shows the traits of a formal concept is a special feature of all symbols whose meanings fit under that concept.

Showing a formal concept is like using a sentence variable where only this special feature stays the same.

4.127 The sentence variable stands for the formal concept, and its possible values stand for the things that belong to this concept.

4.1271 Every variable is a sign of a formal concept.

Because every variable shows a constant form that all its possible values share, and this can be seen as a formal property of those values.
