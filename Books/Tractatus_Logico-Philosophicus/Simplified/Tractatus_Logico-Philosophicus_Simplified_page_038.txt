324 Confusions happen a lot, especially in philosophy.

3.325 To avoid these mistakes, we need to use symbols carefully. We shouldn’t use the same sign to mean different things, and we should follow clear rules for how symbols work together. This is called logical grammar or logical syntax.

(The logical symbols used by Frege and Russell are an example of this kind of language, but even they don’t avoid all mistakes.) 3.326 To understand a symbol, we have to look at how it’s used.

3.327 A sign only shows its logical form when used with the right rules.

3.328 If a sign isn’t needed, then it doesn’t mean anything. This idea is called Occam’s razor.

(If everything in the system acts like a sign has meaning, then it really does.) 3.33 In logical syntax, the meaning of a sign shouldn’t be the main focus; we should be able to understand the rules without talking about what the signs mean, just by looking at how the expressions are written.

3.331 From this, we learn more about Russell’s Theory of Types. Russell made a mistake because when he created his rules, he had to talk about what the signs mean.

3.332 No statement can talk about itself, because a statement can’t include itself. This is the main idea of the Theory of Types.

3.333 A function can’t use itself as an input, because it already has a model of its input and can’t include itself.

For example, if we imagine a function F(fx) using itself as input, we get something like “F(F(fx))”. Here, the outside F and the inside F have to mean different things. The inside is like φ(fx), and the outside is like ψ(φ(fx)). The only thing they share is the letter “F”, which by itself doesn’t mean anything.
