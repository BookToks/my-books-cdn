2.151 A picture works because its parts can be put together just like the things it shows.

2.1511 So, the picture is connected to real life; it reaches out to it.

2.1512 It’s like using a ruler to measure something real.

2.15121 Only the ends of the ruler actually touch the thing you want to measure.

2.1513 This means the way a picture shows something is actually part of the picture itself.

2.1514 The way the parts of the picture match up with the real things is what makes the picture work.

2.1515 These connections are like the picture’s way of feeling or touching reality.

2.16 For something to be a picture, it has to share something with what it shows.

2.161 The picture and what it shows must have something the same, so one can represent the other.

2.17 What the picture shares with real life to show it—whether it’s right or wrong—is called its form of representation.

2.171 A picture can show anything that has the same form as it does.

For example, a spatial picture shows space, and a colored picture shows colors.

2.172 But a picture can’t show its own form of representation; it only reveals it.

2.173 A picture shows its object from the outside (it uses its form of representation), so it can be right or wrong.

2.174 But the picture can’t step outside its own form of representation.

2.18 Every picture, no matter what kind, has to share the same logical form with reality to represent it at all—right or wrong.
