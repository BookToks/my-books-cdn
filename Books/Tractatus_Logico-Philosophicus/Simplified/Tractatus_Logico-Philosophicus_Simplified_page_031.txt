2.151 The form of representation is the possibility that the things are combined with one another as are the elements of the picture.
 
 2.1511 Thus the picture is linked with reality; it reaches up to it.
 
 2.1512 It is like a scale applied to reality.
 
 2.15121 Only the outermost points of the dividing lines touch the object to be measured.
 
 2.1513 According to this view the representing relation which makes it a picture, also belongs to the picture.
 
 2.1514 The representing relation consists of the co-ordinations of the elements of the picture and the things.
 
 2.1515 These co-ordinations are as it were the feelers of its elements with which the picture touches reality.
 
 2.16 In order to be a picture a fact must have something in common with what it pictures.
 
 2.161 In the picture and the pictured there must be something identical in order that the one can be a picture of the other at all.
 
 2.17 What the picture must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it after its manner—rightly or falsely—is its form of representation.
 
 2.171 The picture can represent every reality whose form it has.
 
 The spatial picture, everything spatial, the coloured, everything coloured, etc.
 
 2.172 The picture, however, cannot represent its form of representation; it shows it forth.
 
 2.173 The picture represents its object from without (its standpoint is its form of representation), therefore the picture represents its object rightly or falsely.
 
 2.174 But the picture cannot place itself outside of its form of representation.
 
 2.18 What every picture, of whatever form, must have in common 29 TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS with reality in order to be able to represent it at all—rightly or falsely—is the logical form, that is, the form of reality.
