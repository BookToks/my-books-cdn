Propositions can only be true or false if they show something real.

If you don’t realize that propositions have meaning on their own, separate from facts, you might think that true and false are just two equal ways signs relate to things.

Then, for example, you might say “p” means the same as “not p,” but one is true and the other false.

Can we use false propositions to communicate like we do with true ones, as long as we know they’re false? No! A proposition is true only if what it says is actually the case. If “p” means “not p” and that’s true, then “p” is true, not false.

The fact that “p” and “not p” can say the same thing is important because it shows that “not” doesn’t actually match anything real.

Having a “not” in a proposition doesn’t change what it means (like “not not p” equals “p”).

“p” and “not p” have opposite meanings, but they both relate to the same reality.

Here’s an example to explain truth: Imagine a black spot on white paper. You can describe the spot by saying if each point is black or white. Saying a point is black is a positive fact; saying it’s white (not black) is a negative fact. If I point to a spot, it’s like making a judgment about it.

But to say a point is black or white, I must first know what “black” and “white” mean. To say “p” is true or false, I must know what makes “p” true, and that defines the meaning of the proposition.

The example breaks down here: I can point to a spot without knowing what black or white means, but a proposition without meaning represents nothing at all. It doesn’t stand for any truth or falsehood. The verb in a proposition is not “is true” or “is false” — the truth is already built into what the proposition says.
