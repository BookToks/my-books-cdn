The general way to move from one idea to another is shown like this: [ξ, N(ξ)](η) which means [η, ξ, N(ξ)].

This is the most basic way to change from one statement to the next.

Now, about numbers: I say x = Ω0(x) by definition, and Ω(Ων(x)) = Ων+1(x) by definition.

Using these rules, we write a series like this: x, Ω(x), Ω(Ω(x)), Ω(Ω(Ω(x)))...

Or like this: Ω0(x), Ω1(x), Ω2(x), Ω3(x)...

So instead of writing “[x, ξ, Ω(ξ)]”, I write “[Ω0(x), Ων(x), Ων+1(x)]”.

I also define: 0 + 1 = 1, 0 + 1 + 1 = 2, 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, and so on.

A number is like the power or level of an operation.

The idea of “number” is just what all numbers have in common, the general way to think about numbers.

The idea of numbers being equal is the general way to understand when numbers are the same.

The basic form of a counting number is: [0, ξ, ξ + 1].

The theory about groups or classes isn’t really needed in math.

That’s because the kind of general ideas we need in math aren’t just random.

In logic, statements are always true by their form.
