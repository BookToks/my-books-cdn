22 In a sentence, the name stands for the object.

3.221 I can only name objects. Signs show what they are. I can only talk about them. I cannot say exactly what they are. A sentence can only say how something is, not what it really is.

3.23 The idea that simple signs are possible means that the meaning is clear and definite.

3.24 A sentence about a whole thing is connected to a sentence about its parts.

You can only describe a whole thing by its parts, and the description can be right or wrong. If a sentence talks about something that doesn’t exist, it’s not nonsense, it’s just false.

When a part of a sentence stands for a whole thing, it shows that the sentence isn’t completely clear yet. We know that not everything is decided by this sentence. (General sentences use a model.) You can explain a whole thing by combining simple signs into one symbol with a definition.

3.25 There is only one full way to analyze a sentence.

3.251 A sentence clearly shows what it means; it is clear and understandable.

3.26 A name cannot be broken down any further by definitions. It is a basic sign.

3.261 Every defined sign means something through the signs used to define it, and the definitions show how.

Two signs, one basic and one defined, don’t mean the same way. Names can’t be broken apart by definitions, and no sign that has meaning on its own can be.

3.262 What a sign doesn’t show is revealed by how it is used. The use of signs tells what they hide.

3.263 The meanings of basic signs can be explained by examples. Examples are sentences that use the basic signs. They can only be understood if you already know what those signs mean.
