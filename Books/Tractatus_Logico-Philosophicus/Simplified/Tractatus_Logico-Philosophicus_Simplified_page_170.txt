Royalty payments should be clearly labeled and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address given in Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

If a user tells you in writing or by email within 30 days that they don’t agree with the full Project Gutenberg License, you must give them a full refund. You also have to make sure they return or destroy all physical copies of the works and stop using or accessing any other Project Gutenberg copies.

If someone finds a problem with an electronic work and reports it to you within 90 days, you must give them a full refund or a replacement copy, according to paragraph 1.F.3.

You must follow all other rules in this agreement for sharing Project Gutenberg works for free.

If you want to charge money or share Project Gutenberg electronic works in a way different from this agreement, you need written permission from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart, who owns the Project Gutenberg trademark. Contact the Foundation as explained in Section 3.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and workers spend a lot of time researching, copying, and checking public domain works to create the Project Gutenberg collection. Even so, there may be "defects" in these electronic works, like missing or wrong data, errors in copying, copyright problems, damaged disks, computer viruses, or codes that don’t work with your device.

Except for the refund or replacement described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Foundation, trademark owner, and anyone sharing Project Gutenberg works are not responsible for any damages, costs, or legal fees you might have. You agree you have no other claims against them, even if you told them about possible problems.

If you find a defect in an electronic work within 90 days of getting it, you can get your money back by sending a written explanation to the person who gave you the work.
