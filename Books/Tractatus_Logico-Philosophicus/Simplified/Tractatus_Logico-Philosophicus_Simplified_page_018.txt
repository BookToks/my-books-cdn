If we can’t think about something, then we also can’t say it.

This idea is important for understanding Solipsism. Solipsism is basically saying that the world is only my world. But you can’t explain this with words, you can only show it. The limits of the language I understand show the limits of my world.

The “metaphysical subject” isn’t part of the world; it’s like the edge or border of the world.

Next, we need to talk about complex sentences, which at first don’t seem like they follow simple true or false rules. For example, sentences like “A believes p.” Wittgenstein says all complex sentences do follow true or false rules. He explains that in sentences like “A believes p,” it looks like the proposition p is connected to the person A. But actually, it’s not about connecting a fact and an object; it’s about connecting facts through their objects.

Wittgenstein’s point is a bit hard to understand if you don’t know the debates he’s answering. The argument he’s against is explained in some old articles about truth and falsehood. The main question is how to represent logically what happens when someone believes something.

This problem isn’t just about belief. It’s also about other mental states like doubting, thinking, wanting, and so on. We often say things like “A doubts p” or “A wants p,” which makes it seem like there’s a relationship between a person and a statement. But this can’t be the whole truth because people and statements are not real things by themselves—they are like ideas or facts. A proposition, for example, might be words someone says to themselves, or pictures or thoughts in their mind, or even small body movements. It could be many different things.
