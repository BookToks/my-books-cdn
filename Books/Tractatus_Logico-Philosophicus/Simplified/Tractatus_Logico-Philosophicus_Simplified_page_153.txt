6.1231 A logical sentence isn’t special just because it applies to everything. 

Being general just means it happens to be true for all things. A sentence that isn’t general can still be always true, just like a general one can be.

6.1232 Logical truth is important in a real way, unlike random truths like “all humans die.” Sentences like Russell’s “Axiom of reducibility” aren’t really logical sentences, and that’s why we feel that even if they are true, it’s just by chance.

6.1233 You can imagine a world where the Axiom of reducibility isn’t true. But logic doesn’t care if our world is like that or not.

6.124 Logical sentences show the basic structure of the world, or at least represent it. They don’t talk about anything directly. They assume names have meaning and basic sentences make sense—that’s how they connect to the world. It’s clear that it must mean something about the world that certain combinations of symbols, which have a special kind of character, are always true. This is the key point. We said some parts of the symbols we use are random, some are not. In logic, this just means: logic doesn’t let us say whatever we want with symbols, but the nature of the symbols themselves shows what is true. If we know the rules of any logical language, then all the logical sentences in that language are already known.

6.125 Even in the old way of thinking about logic, it’s possible to describe all the “true” logical sentences from the start.

6.1251 That’s why there can never be surprises in logic.

6.126 You can figure out if a sentence is logical by checking the logical properties of its symbols.

151 In this way, when we “prove” a logical sentence, we are doing exactly that.
