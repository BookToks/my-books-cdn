241 If I use two signs that mean the same thing, I show this by putting an “=” sign between them.

“a = b” means the sign “a” can be replaced by the sign “b.”

(If I create a new sign “b” to replace a sign “a” I already know, I write “a = b Def.” This is called a definition and it’s like a rule.)

4.242 Expressions like “a = b” are just shortcuts to help explain things. They don’t say anything about what “a” or “b” actually mean.

4.243 Can we understand two names without knowing if they mean the same thing or different things? Can we understand a sentence with two names without knowing if they mean the same or not?

If I know an English word and a German word that mean the same, I can’t help but know they mean the same, and I can translate between them.

Expressions like “a = a” or ones based on that don’t really say anything important. (This will be explained later.)

4.25 If a simple proposition is true, then the fact it talks about exists; if it’s false, that fact doesn’t exist.

4.26 Listing all the true simple propositions completely describes the world. The world is fully described by all simple propositions and which ones are true or false.

4.27 For n facts, there are K = n to the power of n possibilities.

It’s possible for any combination of facts to exist while others don’t.

4.28 Each combination matches the same number of possibilities for which simple propositions are true or false.

4.3 The truth or falsehood of simple propositions shows the possibilities of whether the facts exist or not.
