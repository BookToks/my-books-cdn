Listing all special forms would just be random.

We should be able to tell beforehand if, for example, I need to use a symbol that shows a relationship with 27 parts.

But can we even ask that? Can we create a symbol and not know if anything matches it?

The question is: what has to be true for something to happen?

We understand what a basic statement is, even without knowing its exact logical shape.

When we make symbols based on a system, the system itself is what's important, not the individual symbols.

How could I have to work with logical shapes that I can just make up? I must deal with what lets me create them in the first place.

There can’t be a ranking of the forms of basic statements. We can only predict what we create ourselves.

The real world is limited by all the objects in it. This limit also shows up in all the basic statements.

These rankings have to be separate from reality.

If we know, just by logic, that basic statements have to exist, then everyone who understands these statements in their simplest form must know this too.

All the sentences we use every day are actually, just as they are, perfectly logical.

The simplest thing we should give here is not a fake truth but the real, full truth.

Our problems aren’t abstract; they might be the most real problems there are.

Logic’s use decides what the basic statements are.

Logic itself can’t predict how it will be used.

It’s clear that logic should never clash with how it’s applied.
