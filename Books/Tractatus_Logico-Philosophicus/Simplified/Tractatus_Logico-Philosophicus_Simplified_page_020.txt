I don’t think there’s anything in Mr. Wittgenstein’s system that stops him from filling in this gap.

What’s more interesting than small details is Mr. Wittgenstein’s view on the mystical. His view comes from his idea about pure logic, where a logical statement is like a picture (true or false) of a fact, and it shares a certain structure with that fact. This shared structure lets the statement represent the fact, but this structure itself can’t be put into words because it’s the structure of words and facts together. So, everything that makes language meaningful can’t actually be expressed in language. This means it’s impossible to say exactly what logic and philosophy really are. According to Mr. Wittgenstein, all of logic and philosophy fall into this inexpressible area. He thinks the best way to teach philosophy is to stick to clear, exact scientific statements and show students that any philosophical claims they make are actually meaningless. He admits that someone trying this might end up like Socrates, who was punished for questioning things, but he thinks we shouldn’t be scared if this is the right way to teach.

What makes some people unsure about Mr. Wittgenstein’s ideas is that, even though he says some things can’t be said, he still manages to say quite a bit about those things. This makes people wonder if there’s some kind of loophole or way around his rules. For example, he puts ethics into the mystical, inexpressible category, but he still shares his ethical opinions. He would argue that the mystical can be shown or demonstrated, even if it can’t be explained in words. Maybe this works, but for me, it still feels a bit uncomfortable or confusing.

There’s one logical problem where these difficulties are especially clear. It’s the problem of generality. When talking about general ideas, you have to think about all statements like “fx,” where “fx” is some kind of statement about x. According to Mr. Wittgenstein, this part of logic can be expressed in language.

But the total set of all possible values for x, which seems involved in all statements like “fx,” is not something Mr. Wittgenstein thinks can be talked about. This total set is basically all the things in the world, which means trying to think about the whole world at once. Mr. Wittgenstein says that the feeling of the world as a whole is mystical. So, the total set of all x values is mystical too.
