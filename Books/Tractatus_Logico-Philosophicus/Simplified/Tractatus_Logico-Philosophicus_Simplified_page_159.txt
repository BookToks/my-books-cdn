The network is purely about shapes and connections, and all its features can be known ahead of time.

Rules like the basic law don’t talk about what the network represents, only about the network itself.

6.36 If there was a law about cause and effect, it might say: "There are natural laws."

But actually, we can’t just say that; it has to show itself.

6.361 Using Hertz’s way of speaking, you could say: Only regular patterns are possible.

6.3611 We can’t compare a process to "time moving"—because time doesn’t really move—but only to another process (like the ticking of a clock).

So, to describe how things change over time, we always have to compare it to something else.

The same idea works for space. For example, if it’s said that neither of two events (that can’t both happen) will happen because there’s no reason why one should happen before the other, that really means we can’t describe either event unless there’s some difference.

If there is a difference, we can see that as the reason why one event happens and the other doesn’t.

6.36111 The problem Kant talked about with right and left hands, which can’t be matched exactly, already exists in flat space, and even in one dimension.

Two matching shapes, a and b, can’t be made to fit perfectly without leaving that space.

Right and left hands are actually exactly the same, and the fact that they can’t be matched doesn’t change that.

You could put a right glove on a left hand if you could turn it inside out in four-dimensional space.
