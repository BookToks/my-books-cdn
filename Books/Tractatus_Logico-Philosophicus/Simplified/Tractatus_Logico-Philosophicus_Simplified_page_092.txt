There are things we just can’t explain in words. These things show themselves in a mysterious way.

The right way to do philosophy would be this: only say what can actually be said clearly, like facts from science. This isn’t really philosophy. Then, if someone tries to say something about stuff that can’t be proven, like metaphysics, you should show them that their words don’t really mean anything. This way might not satisfy the other person—they might not feel like they’re learning philosophy—but it’s the only truly correct way.

My statements are meant to help in this way: when someone understands me fully, they see that my statements don’t make sense by themselves. They have to get past them, like climbing a ladder and then throwing it away. Only by doing this can they see the world the right way.

If you can’t talk about something clearly, then you should stay silent about it.

This book might only be understood by someone who has already thought about the ideas inside it—or at least similar ideas—before.
