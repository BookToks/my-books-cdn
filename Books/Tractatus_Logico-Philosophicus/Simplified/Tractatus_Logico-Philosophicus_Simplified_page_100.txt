A picture has to share something with reality to show it in its own way—whether right or wrong—and that is its form of representation.

A picture can show any reality that has the same form as itself.

For example, a spatial picture shows all spatial things, a colored picture shows all colored things, and so on.

But the picture cannot show its own form of representation; it only points to it.

The picture shows its object from the outside (its viewpoint is its way of showing), so it can show the object right or wrong.

However, the picture cannot step outside its own way of showing.

Every picture, no matter what kind, must share the logical form with reality to be able to show it at all—right or wrong.

If the form of representation is the logical form, then the picture is called a logical picture.

Every picture is also a logical picture. (But not every picture is, for example, a spatial picture.)

The logical picture can show the world.

The picture shares the logical form of representation with what it shows.

A picture shows reality by presenting a possibility of things being true or not true.

It shows a possible situation in the logical space.

The picture contains the possibility of the situation it shows.

A picture either matches reality or it doesn’t; it is right or wrong, true or false.

The picture shows what it shows, no matter if it is true or false, through its form of representation.

What the picture shows is its meaning.
