It’s clear that identity is not a relationship between things. This becomes obvious when you look at a sentence like “(x): fx ⊃ x = a.” What this means is simply that only a fits the function f, not that only things related to a fit f.

You might say that only a has this special relationship to itself, but to say that, you’d have to use the equals sign.

Russell’s definition of “=” isn’t good enough because it can’t show that two things share all the same properties. Even if this idea is never true, it still makes sense to talk about.

In everyday talk, saying two things are identical doesn’t make sense, and saying one thing is identical to itself doesn’t really say anything.

So, instead of writing “f(a,b).a = b,” I write “f(a,a)” (or “f(b,b)”). And instead of “f(a,b).∼a = b,” I just write “f(a,b).”

Similarly, instead of “(∃x,y). f(x,y). x = y,” I write “(∃x). f(x,x).” And instead of “(∃x,y). f(x,y). ∼x = y,” I write “(∃x,y). f(x,y).”

So, instead of Russell’s “(∃x,y). f(x,y),” we write “(∃x,y). f(x,y) or (∃x). f(x,x).”

Instead of “(x): fx ⊃ x = a,” we write “(∃x). fx ⊃ fa : ∼(∃x,y). fx.fy.”

The sentence “only one x satisfies f()” is written as “(∃x). fx : ∼(∃x,y). fx.fy.”

This means the equals sign isn’t a necessary part of the logical language.

Now we see that sentences like “a = a,” “a = b. b = c ⊃ a = c,” “(x). x = x,” “(∃x). x = a,” and so on, can’t actually be written correctly in a proper logical language.

Because of this, all problems connected to these kinds of sentences disappear.

All the issues caused by Russell’s “Axiom of Infinity” are solved here.

What the Axiom of Infinity wants to say is that there are infinitely many names with different meanings in the language.
