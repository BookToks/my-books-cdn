1432 It’s not like saying, “The complex sign ‘aRb’ means that a is in relation R to b.” Instead, saying that “a” is in some relation to “b” means that aRb.

3.144 You can describe situations, but you can’t just name them.

(Names are like points, sentences are like arrows, and they have meaning.) 3.2 In a sentence, thoughts are shown by matching parts of the sentence to parts of the thought.

3.201 I call these parts “simple signs,” and when the sentence is fully broken down, it’s “completely analyzed.”

3.202 The simple signs used in a sentence are called names.

3.203 A name means the object. The object is its meaning. (“A” is the same sign as “A.”) 3.21 The way simple signs are arranged in a sentence matches how objects are arranged in the situation.

3.22 A name stands for an object in a sentence.

3.221 I can only name objects. Signs stand for them.

I can only talk about them; I can’t say them out loud. A sentence can only say how something is, not what it is.

3.23 The need for simple signs is the need for clear meaning.

3.24 A sentence about a complex thing is connected inside to the sentence about its parts.

You can only understand a complex thing by describing it, and that description can be true or false. If the complex thing doesn’t exist, the sentence about it isn’t nonsense, it’s just false.

You can tell a sentence part means a complex thing because there’s some uncertainty in the sentences it’s in. We know not everything is decided by this sentence yet. (The general name includes a kind of picture.) You can summarize the sign of a complex thing into a simple sign by using a definition.
