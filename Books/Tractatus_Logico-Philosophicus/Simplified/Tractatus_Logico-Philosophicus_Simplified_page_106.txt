A sign is random. You could use two different signs, so then what would be the common meaning?

In everyday language, it happens a lot that the same word is used in different ways—so it belongs to different symbols—or that two different words, which mean different things, are used in the same way in a sentence.

For example, the word "is" can act as a link, like an equals sign, or show that something exists; "exist" is a verb like "go"; "identical" is an adjective; we talk about things, but also about things happening.

In the sentence "Green is green"—where the first word is a name and the last word is an adjective—these words don’t just have different meanings, they are actually different symbols.

This causes basic confusions, and philosophy is full of them.

To avoid these mistakes, we need a sign language that stops them by not using the same sign for different symbols, and not using signs that mean different things in the same way. A sign language that follows logical grammar—logical syntax.

Frege’s and Russell’s concept script is such a language, but it still doesn’t stop all mistakes.

To understand a symbol, you have to pay attention to how it is used in a meaningful way.

A sign only creates a logical form when it’s used with its logical-syntactical rules.

If a sign is not used, it has no meaning.

This is the idea behind Occam’s rule.

(If everything acts like a sign has meaning, then it does have meaning.)
