Both the geometric place and the logical place agree that they both show something that can exist.

Even though a sentence only points to one spot in the logical space, it already includes the whole logical space.

Otherwise, using things like negation, logical sums, or logical products would always add new parts in coordination. The logical frame around the picture sets the logical space. The sentence covers the entire logical space.

The used, thought-of sentence sign is the thought.

A thought is a meaningful sentence.

All sentences together make up language.

Humans can create languages that let them express any meaning, even if they don’t really know how or what each word means—just like how people talk without knowing how each sound is made.

Everyday language is part of humans and is just as complicated as we are.

It’s impossible for people to understand the logic of language just by looking at it.

Language hides the thought. The outside form of language doesn’t show the shape of the thought inside because the outside is made for totally different reasons than to reveal the thought’s shape.

The unspoken rules needed to understand everyday language are very complicated.

Most sentences and questions about philosophy aren’t wrong, but they don’t make sense.

We can’t really answer these questions, only show that they don’t make sense. Most philosophical questions come from not understanding how language works.

They are like asking if “good” is more or less the same as “beautiful.”

It’s not surprising that the deepest problems aren’t really problems at all.
