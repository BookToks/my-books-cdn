That means, as you can easily see from the explanations above, they give each event a probability of 1.

What I show with the experiment is that the happening of the two events does not depend on any unknown conditions.

The idea of the probability rule is this: The conditions—which I don’t know in detail—give a certain chance that a specific event will happen.

So probability is a general idea.

It involves a general way to describe a statement.

We only use probability when we don’t have full certainty. If we don’t fully know a fact, but we do know something about its form.

(A statement might be an incomplete picture of a situation, but it is always a complete picture.) The probability rule is like a summary of other statements.

The structures of statements are connected inside themselves.

We can show these connections in how we talk by thinking of a statement as the result of an operation that creates it from other statements (the bases of the operation).

The operation shows the relationship between the structure of the result and the structures of its bases.

The operation is what you have to do to one statement to turn it into another.

And this depends on their formal features, on how similar their forms are inside.

The internal relation that orders a series is the same as the operation that makes one element come from another.

The operation can only happen where a statement logically comes from another in a meaningful way. So it starts where the logical building of the statement begins.
