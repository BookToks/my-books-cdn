Philosophy sets the limits for what science can argue about.

It should mark the boundaries of what can be thought and what cannot be thought.

It should show the inside edge of the unthinkable by using what is thinkable.

Philosophy shows what cannot be said by clearly explaining what can be said.

Anything that can be thought can be thought clearly. Anything that can be spoken can be spoken clearly.

A sentence can show the whole reality, but it cannot show what it shares with reality to be able to show it—the logical form.

To show the logical form, we would have to step outside the sentence and logic itself, which means outside the world.

A sentence cannot show the logical form; it only reflects it.

What is reflected in language cannot be shown by language.

What is expressed in language cannot be expressed by it.

A sentence points to the logical form of reality.

It shows it.

For example, a sentence like “fa” shows that the object a is in its meaning. Two sentences “fa” and “ga” show that both talk about the same object.

If two sentences contradict each other, their structure shows this; the same if one follows from the other, and so on.

What can be shown cannot be said.

Now we understand our feeling: that we have the right logical idea only when everything in our sign language fits together.

We can speak, in a certain way, about formal properties of objects and facts or about properties of the structure of facts, and in the same way about formal relations and relations of structures.
