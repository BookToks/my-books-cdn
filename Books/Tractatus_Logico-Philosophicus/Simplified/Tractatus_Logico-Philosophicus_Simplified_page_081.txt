If we replace “q” with “p” and look at how the outer parts (T and F) connect with the inner parts, we see that the whole statement is true only when all its parts are true, and it’s false if any part is false.

Logical propositions show the rules of logic by putting statements together in a way that doesn’t actually say anything new.

This way of working could be called a zero-method. In a logical statement, the parts balance each other out, and this balance shows how the statements must be built logically.

Because of this, we don’t really need logical statements to understand logic. We can just look at the symbols and see the logical rules by ourselves.

For example, if two statements “p” and “q” always make a true statement when connected as “p ⊃ q”, then we know that q follows from p.

Like when we see that “q” follows from “p ⊃ q . p”, we can tell just by looking at them, or by combining them into “p ⊃ q . p :⊃: q” and proving that it’s always true.

This helps explain why logical statements can’t be proven right or wrong by experience. A logical statement can’t be proven false by anything we see, but it also can’t be proven true by experience either.

Now it makes sense why we sometimes feel like “logical truths” have to be accepted by us, like rules we agree to.
