If you got the work on a physical thing like a CD or a paper, you have to send it back with a written note explaining the problem. The person or group who gave you the broken work can choose to give you a new copy instead of giving you your money back. 

If you got the work online, they might let you try to download it again instead of giving a refund. If the second copy is also broken, you can ask for a refund in writing and they can’t make you try again.

Except for the chance to get a replacement or refund, the work is given to you “AS-IS,” which means there are no promises that it’s perfect or fits your needs.

Some states don’t allow certain promises to be canceled or limits on damages, so the rules might change based on where you live. If any part of this agreement breaks the law in your state, it will be changed to fit the law as much as possible without getting rid of the rest of the agreement.

You agree to protect and not blame the Foundation, the trademark owner, their workers, anyone giving out Project Gutenberg works, and volunteers if any problems happen because of what you do. This includes sharing, changing, or causing defects in the work.

Project Gutenberg’s mission is to share free electronic books that can be read on almost any computer, whether old or new. It works because hundreds of volunteers help and people donate money.

Volunteers and donations are really important to keep Project Gutenberg going and make sure the books stay free for a long time. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was started to keep the project safe and help it last for future generations.
