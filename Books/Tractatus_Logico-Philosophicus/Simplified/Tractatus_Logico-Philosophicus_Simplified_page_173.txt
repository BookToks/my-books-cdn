Professor Michael S. Hart started Project Gutenberg, which is a free online library where anyone can read books.

For thirty years, he made and shared Project Gutenberg eBooks with the help of volunteers.

Project Gutenberg eBooks come from different printed versions that are free to use in the U.S., unless there is a copyright notice.

This means the eBooks might not match exactly with any paper version.

Most people begin by visiting our website, where you can search for books: http://www.gutenberg.org

The website also tells you about Project Gutenberg, how to donate, how to help create new eBooks, and how to sign up for our email newsletter to get updates about new books.
