1203 In order to recognize a tautology as such, we can, in cases in which no sign of generality occurs in the tautology, make use of the following intuitive method: I write instead of “p”, “q”, “r”, etc., “TpF”, “TqF”, “TrF”, etc. The truth-combinations I express by brackets, e.g.: and the co-ordination of the truth or falsity of the whole proposition with the truth-combinations of the truth-arguments by lines in the following way: This sign, for example, would therefore present the proposition p ⊃ q. Now I will proceed to inquire whether such a proposition as ∼(p.∼p) (The Law of Contradiction) is a tautology.
 
 The form “∼ξ” is written in our notation the form “ξ .η” thus:— 78 TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS Hence the proposition ∼(p.
