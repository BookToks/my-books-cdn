To understand if a statement is always true (a tautology), we can use a simple way when there are no general signs involved. Instead of using letters like “p,” “q,” or “r,” we write “TpF,” “TqF,” “TrF,” and so on.  

We show the different true or false options using brackets. For example, we connect the truth or falsity of the whole statement with the truth or falsity of its parts using lines.  

This symbol, for example, shows the statement “p implies q.” Now, I will check if a statement like “not (p and not p)” (which is called the Law of Contradiction) is always true.  

In our system, the form “not ξ” is written as “ξ . η.” So, the statement “not (p and not p)” looks like this:—
