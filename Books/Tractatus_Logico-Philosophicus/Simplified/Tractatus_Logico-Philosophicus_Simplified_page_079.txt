Logical statements don’t actually tell us anything new. They are just true by how they are made.

Sometimes people think logical statements are important facts, but this is wrong. For example, someone might think the words “true” and “false” are like special qualities that every statement has. But this idea doesn’t make sense, just like saying “All roses are either yellow or red” doesn’t sound right even if it’s true. When we think like this, we’re misunderstanding logic.

The right way to understand logical statements is to see that they are different from all other statements.

What makes logical statements special is that you can tell they are true just by looking at them. This is the main idea behind logic. But for other kinds of statements, you can’t know if they are true or false just by looking at the statement itself.

Logical statements are called tautologies, which means they are true in a special way because of how language and the world are connected.

When parts of a statement are put together in a certain way and always make a tautology, it shows that these parts have a special kind of structure.

For example, the statements “p” and “not p” when put together like “not (p and not p)” make a tautology, which shows they contradict each other.

Also, statements like “if p then q,” “p,” and “q” put together as “(if p then q) and p implies q” make a tautology, showing that q follows from the others. Another example is “for all x, fx implies fa,” which means if something is true for everything, it’s true for a specific thing too.

We could also use contradictions instead of tautologies for this purpose.
