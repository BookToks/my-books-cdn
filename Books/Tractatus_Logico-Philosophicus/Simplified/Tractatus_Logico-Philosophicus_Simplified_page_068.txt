Even if we think we have done it. Saying “Socrates is identical” doesn’t really say anything because we haven’t explained what “identical” means as an adjective. When “identical” is used to mean “equal,” it works in a totally different way—the way it points to something is different—so the two uses of the word are really not the same; they only look similar by chance.

5.474 The number of basic steps we need depends only on the system of symbols we use.

5.475 It’s just a matter of building a system of symbols with a limited number of parts—a certain kind of math setup.

5.476 Here, we are not talking about a bunch of simple ideas that need to be shown, but about showing a rule.

5.5 Every truth-function comes from applying the operation (––––T)(ξ,....) step by step to simple statements.

This operation means denying all the statements inside the brackets, and I call this denying “negation.”

5.501 When I write something in brackets that contains statements, and the order doesn’t matter, I use a sign like “(ξ).” “ξ” is a variable that stands for all the statements in the brackets, and the line over it means it stands for all these values.

(For example, if ξ has the values P, Q, and R, then (ξ) = (P, Q, R).) We have to decide what values the variables have.

Deciding the values means describing the statements the variable stands for.

How we describe the statements inside the brackets doesn’t really matter.

We can describe them in three ways: 1. Listing them all directly. In this case, we just put their fixed values instead of the variable. 2. Giving a function fx, where for every x, fx gives one of the statements. 3. Giving a formal rule that shows how those statements are made.
