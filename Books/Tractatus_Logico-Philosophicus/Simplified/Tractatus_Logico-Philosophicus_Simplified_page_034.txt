14 A propositional sign is when words are put together in a specific order.

A propositional sign is a real thing.

3.141 A proposition is not just a random mix of words, like a musical theme is not just a random mix of sounds.

A proposition is clear and organized.

3.142 Only real things (facts) can show meaning; just a group of names can’t.

3.143 The fact that a propositional sign is real isn’t obvious when it’s written or printed.

(For example, a printed proposition looks almost the same as a word.

That’s why Frege could call a proposition a combined name.) 3.1431 It’s easier to understand a propositional sign if you imagine it made from real objects like tables or chairs instead of words.

How these things are arranged in space shows what the proposition means.

3.1432 We shouldn’t say, “The sign ‘aRb’ means ‘a is related by R to b’”; instead, we should say, “That ‘a’ is in a certain relation to ‘b’ means aRb.”

3.144 We can describe situations but can’t name them.

(Names are like points; propositions are like arrows because they have meaning.) 3.2 In propositions, the thoughts match the objects they’re about through the parts of the propositional sign.

3.201 The parts I call “simple signs,” and the whole proposition is “fully analyzed.”

3.202 The simple signs used in propositions are called names.

3.203 A name means an object. The object is what the name stands for. (“A” is the same sign as “A.”) 3.21 How the simple signs are arranged in the propositional sign matches how the objects are arranged in the situation.
