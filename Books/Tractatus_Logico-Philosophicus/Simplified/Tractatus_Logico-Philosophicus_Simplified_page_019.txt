The actual words a person says to themselves don’t really matter for logic. What matters in logic is the part common to all these facts that lets the person mean what the proposition is about. For psychology, more things matter because a symbol doesn’t mean what it does just because of logic, but also because of how the mind connects or intends it. However, the psychological side of meaning is not what logic is about.

What logic cares about in belief is the logical pattern. When someone believes something, we don’t need to think about the person as a special kind of being to explain what’s going on. What needs to be explained is the link between the words used in the proposition and the real fact that makes the proposition true or false.

This comes down to understanding the meaning of propositions, which is the only part of the problem that isn’t about psychology. The problem is about the relationship between two facts: the words the believer uses and the fact that makes those words true or false. Both the words and the fact are real things. The connection between them can be analyzed because the meaning of a proposition comes from the meanings of the individual words.

So, to understand a proposition’s meaning, you don’t really need to look at the whole proposition at once. It might help to think of the proposition as just a fact, not as a proposition. But don’t take this too literally. The main idea is that in believing or wanting something, the key thing is the relationship between the proposition (as a fact) and the fact that makes it true or false, and this relationship comes down to the parts that make up these facts.

In this way, a proposition doesn’t appear the same way as it does in truth-functions.

There are some parts of Mr. Wittgenstein’s theory that need more work. This especially applies to his theory of numbers, which only works for normal, countable numbers. A good logic has to be able to handle much bigger, infinite numbers too.
