It's really hard for people to understand the logic of language right away.

Language hides the real thought; so just by looking at the outside form, like clothes, you can't tell what the thought underneath looks like. The outside is made for a different purpose than showing the true shape of the idea.

Figuring out how to understand everyday spoken language takes a lot of silent, careful work.

Most of the philosophical questions and statements written down aren’t wrong, but they don’t make sense. So, we can't really answer them; we can only say they don’t make sense. Many of these come from not understanding how our language works.

They are like asking if the Good is more or less the same as the Beautiful. So, it’s no surprise that the deepest problems aren’t really problems at all.

All philosophy is about checking how language works (though not exactly like Mauthner said). Russell’s important idea was showing that the way a sentence looks isn’t always how it really works.

A sentence is like a picture of reality.

It’s a model of reality as we think it is.

At first, a sentence printed on paper doesn’t look like a picture of the reality it talks about. But a music score doesn’t look like the music either, and letters don’t look like the sounds we say. Still, these symbols are pictures in their own way of what they stand for.

It’s clear that we see a sentence like “aRb” as a picture. The signs clearly resemble what they mean.

If we really understand this picture-like nature, we see that things like strange symbols in music scores don’t change this.
