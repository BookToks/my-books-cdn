The example you always look back to has to be part of the symbol itself.

You can describe the whole world using very general statements, without starting by linking any name to a specific thing.

To get to the usual way we talk, we just need to say after a statement, “there is exactly one x, which ...”: and this x is a.

A totally general statement is like any other statement made up of parts. (You can see this because in “(∃x,φ).φx” we have to mention “φ” and “x” separately. Both are important on their own, just like in less general statements.) A key thing about a statement made of parts is that it shares something with other statements.

Whether a statement is true or false changes something about how the world is set up. The limits of what the world’s structure can be, allowed by all basic statements, are exactly the limits set by the very general statements.

(If a basic statement is true, then at least one more basic statement is true.) 

I show that an object is the same by using the same sign, not by using a special sign that means “same.” Objects are different because their signs are different.

It’s clear that sameness is not a relationship between objects themselves. This is easy to see if you think about the statement “(x) : fx. ⊃ .x = a.” This statement just means that only a fits the function f, not that only things related to a fit the function f.

You could say that only a has this relationship to a, but to say that, you’d need to use the sign that means identity itself.
