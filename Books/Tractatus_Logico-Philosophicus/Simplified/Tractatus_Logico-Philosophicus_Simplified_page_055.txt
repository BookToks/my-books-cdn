4.46 There are two extreme types of truth conditions for groups of statements.

In one case, the statement is true no matter what happens with the basic parts. We call this a tautology.

In the other case, the statement is always false, no matter what. We call this a contradiction.

In the first case, the statement is a tautology, and in the second, it’s a contradiction.

4.461 A normal statement shows something about the world, but a tautology and a contradiction don’t really say anything.

A tautology has no conditions because it’s always true, and a contradiction is never true under any conditions.

So, tautologies and contradictions don’t have real meaning.

(It’s like a point where two arrows go in opposite directions.) (For example, knowing “it rains or it doesn’t rain” doesn’t tell me anything about the weather.) 4.4611 But tautologies and contradictions aren’t meaningless; they’re part of the system, like how “0” is important in math.

4.462 Tautologies and contradictions don’t show real situations. One allows every possible situation, and the other allows none.

In a tautology, the parts cancel each other out so it doesn’t connect to reality.

4.463 Truth conditions show which facts a statement allows to be true.

(A statement is like a solid object that limits where something else can move; it’s also like the space inside that object where something can be placed.) A tautology leaves all the logical space open for reality; a contradiction fills all the space and leaves no room for reality.
