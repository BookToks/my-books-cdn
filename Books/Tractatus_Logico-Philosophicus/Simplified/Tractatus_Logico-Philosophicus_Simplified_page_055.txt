4.46 Among the possible groups of truth-conditions there are two extreme cases.
 
 In the one case the proposition is true for all the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions. We say that the truthconditions are tautological.
 
 In the second case the proposition is false for all the truthpossibilities. The truth-conditions are self-contradictory.
 
 In the first case we call the proposition a tautology, in the second case a contradiction.
 
 4.461 The proposition shows what it says, the tautology and the contradiction that they say nothing.
 
 The tautology has no truth-conditions, for it is unconditionally true; and the contradiction is on no condition true.
 
 Tautology and contradiction are without sense.
 
 (Like the point from which two arrows go out in opposite directions.) (I know, e.g. nothing about the weather, when I know that it rains or does not rain.) 4.4611 Tautology and contradiction are, however, not senseless; they are part of the symbolism, in the same way that “0” is part of the symbolism of Arithmetic.
 
 4.462 Tautologyandcontradictionarenotpicturesofthereality. They present no possible state of affairs. For the one allows every possible state of affairs, the other none.
 
 In the tautology the conditions of agreement with the world —the presenting relations—cancel one another, so that it stands in no presenting relation to reality.
 
 4.463 The truth-conditions determine the range, which is left to the facts by the proposition.
 
 (The proposition, the picture, the model, are in a negative sense like a solid body, which restricts the free movement of another: in a positive sense, like the space limited by solid substance, in which a body may be placed.) 53 TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS Tautology leaves to reality the whole infinite logical space; contradiction fills the whole logical space and leaves no point to reality.
