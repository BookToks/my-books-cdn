2.181 If the way something is shown is logical, then the picture is called a logical picture.

2.182 Every picture is also a logical picture. (But not every picture shows space, for example.)  
2.19 A logical picture can show the world.

2.2 The picture and what it shows have the same logical form.

2.201 The picture shows reality by representing the chance that certain facts exist or do not exist.

2.202 The picture shows a possible situation in logical space.

2.203 The picture includes the possibility of the situation it shows.

2.21 The picture either matches reality or it doesn’t; it can be right or wrong, true or false.

2.22 The picture shows what it shows, no matter if it’s true or false, because of how it represents things.

2.221 What the picture shows is its meaning.

2.222 Whether the meaning agrees with reality decides if it’s true or false.

2.223 To know if the picture is true or false, we have to compare it with reality.

2.224 You can’t tell if the picture is true or false just by looking at the picture itself.

2.225 No picture is true just by itself, without checking.

3 The logical picture of facts is a thought.

3.001 Saying “An atomic fact is thinkable” means we can imagine it.

3.01 All the true thoughts together make a picture of the world.

3.02 A thought includes the possibility of the situation it thinks about.

What can be thought about can also happen.
