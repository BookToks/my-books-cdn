2.181 If the form of representation is the logical form, then the picture is called a logical picture.
 
 2.182 Every picture is also a logical picture. (On the other hand, for example, not every picture is spatial.) 2.19 The logical picture can depict the world.
 
 2.2 The picture has the logical form of representation in common with what it pictures.
 
 2.201 The picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.
 
 2.202 The picture represents a possible state of affairs in logical space.
 
 2.203 The picture contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it represents.
 
 2.21 The picture agrees with reality or not; it is right or wrong, true or false.
 
 2.22 The picture represents what it represents, independently of its truth or falsehood, through the form of representation.
 
 2.221 What the picture represents is its sense.
 
 2.222 In the agreement or disagreement of its sense with reality, its truth or falsity consists.
 
 2.223 In order to discover whether the picture is true or false we must compare it with reality.
 
 2.224 It cannot be discovered from the picture alone whether it is true or false.
 
 2.225 There is no picture which is a priori true.
 
 3 The logical picture of the facts is the thought.
 
 3.001 “An atomic fact is thinkable”—means: we can imagine it.
 
 3.01 The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.
 
 3.02 The thought contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it thinks.
 
 What is thinkable is also possible.
