4.1274 Asking if a formal concept really exists doesn’t make sense.

No statement can answer that kind of question.

For example, you can’t ask: “Are there subject-predicate statements that can’t be broken down?”

4.128 Logical forms don’t have numbers.

So, in logic, there aren’t special numbers that stand out, and that means there’s no one true way or two true ways to see things in philosophy.

4.2 The meaning of a statement comes from whether it matches or doesn’t match the possibilities of atomic facts existing or not.

4.21 The simplest kind of statement, called an elementary proposition, says that an atomic fact exists.

4.211 A key thing about elementary propositions is that none of them can be proven false by another elementary proposition.

4.22 An elementary proposition is made up of names. It’s a connection or joining of names.

4.221 It’s clear that when breaking down statements, we end up with elementary propositions, which are names joined directly together.

Then we have to ask: how do these connections between parts of a statement happen?

4.2211 Even if the world is super complex, where every fact is made of infinite smaller facts and every small fact is made of infinite objects, there still have to be objects and atomic facts.

4.23 Names only show up in statements as part of elementary propositions.

4.24 Names are simple symbols, and I show them with single letters like x, y, and z.

I write elementary propositions as functions of these names, like “fx” or “φ(x,y)”.

Or I use letters like p, q, and r to represent them.
