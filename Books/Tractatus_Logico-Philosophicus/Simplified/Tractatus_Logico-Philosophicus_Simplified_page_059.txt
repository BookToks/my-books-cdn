Every statement that goes against another one denies it.

We understand that one statement being true depends on other statements being true by looking at how the statements are built.

If one statement’s truth depends on others, this shows up in how their forms relate to each other. We don’t have to connect them first in a sentence because these connections are inside the statements themselves and exist as soon as the statements exist.

For example, when we say from "p or q" and "not p" we can conclude "q," the connection between these statements is hidden by the way we write them. But if we use different symbols, the link becomes clear.

The fact that we can get "fa" from "(x).fx" shows that general ideas are also part of the symbol "(x).fx".

If "p" follows from "q," then from "q" we can conclude "p."

How we get from "q" to "p" depends only on these two statements.

Only the statements themselves can explain why this is true.

Rules that say how to infer things, like those by Frege and Russell, don’t make sense and aren’t needed.

All reasoning happens before experience.

You can’t get a new statement from a basic statement.

You also can’t say one thing exists just because something totally different exists.

There’s no cause-and-effect reason to do this.

You can’t predict the future from what’s happening now.

Believing in cause-and-effect like this is superstition.

Free will means that future actions can’t be known right now.
