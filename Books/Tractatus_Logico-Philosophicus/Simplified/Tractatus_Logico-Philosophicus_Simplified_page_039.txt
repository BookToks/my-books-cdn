This becomes clear if, instead of writing “F(F(u)),” we write “(∃φ) : F(φu).φu = Fu.”

With this, Russell’s paradox disappears.

3.334 The rules of logical syntax must come naturally if we understand how each sign works.

3.34 A proposition has two kinds of features: essential and accidental.

Accidental features come from the way the proposition is made. Essential features are the ones that let the proposition express its meaning.

3.341 The essential part of a proposition is what all propositions that mean the same thing share.

Similarly, the essential part of a symbol is what all symbols that serve the same purpose have in common.

3.3411 So, the real name is what all symbols that represent the same object share. This means that no special way of combining parts is necessary for a name.

3.342 In our writing, some things seem random, but they’re not really random. If we choose something randomly, then something else must follow. (This comes from how the system works.) 

3.3421 A certain way of writing might not matter much, but it’s always important that this way is possible. In philosophy, one example might seem unimportant, but the fact that it’s possible tells us something about the world.

3.343 Definitions are like rules for changing one language into another. Every correct system of symbols can be changed into any other using these rules. This is what they all share.
