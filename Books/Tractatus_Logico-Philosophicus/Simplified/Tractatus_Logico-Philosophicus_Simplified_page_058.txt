101 The truth-functions of every number of elementary propositions can be written in a schema of the following kind: (TTTT)(p,q) Tautology (if p then p, and if q then q) [p⊃p.q ⊃q] (FTTT)(p,q) in words: Not both p and q. [∼(p.q)] (TFTT)(p,q) „ „ If q then p. [q ⊃p] (TTFT)(p,q) „ „ If p then q. [p⊃q] (TTTF)(p,q) „ „ p or q. [p∨q] (FFTT)(p,q) „ „ Not q. [∼q] (FTFT)(p,q) „ „ Not p. [∼p] (FTTF)(p,q) „ „ p or q, but not both. [p.∼q :∨:q.∼p] (TFFT)(p,q) „ „ If p, then q; and if q, then p. [p≡q] (TFTF)(p,q) „ „ p (TTFF)(p,q) „ „ q (FFFT)(p,q) „ „ Neither p nor q. [∼p.∼q or p|q] (FFTF)(p,q) „ „ p and not q. [p.∼q] (FTFF)(p,q) „ „ q and not p. [q.∼p] (TFFF)(p,q) „ „ p and q. [p.q] (FFFF)(p,q) Contradiction (p and not p; and q and not q.) [p.∼p.q.∼q] Those truth-possibilities of its truth-arguments, which verify the proposition, I shall call its truth-grounds.
 
 5.11 If the truth-grounds which are common to a number of propositions are all also truth-grounds of some one proposition, we say that the truth of this proposition follows from the truth of those propositions.
 
 5.12 In particular the truth of a proposition p follows from that of a proposition q, if all the truth-grounds of the second are truthgrounds of the first.
 
 5.121 The truth-grounds of q are contained in those of p; p follows from q.
 
 5.122 If p follows from q, the sense of “p” is contained in that of “q”.
 
 5.123 Ifagodcreatesaworldinwhichcertainpropositionsaretrue, he creates thereby also a world in which all propositions consequent on them are true. And similarly he could not create a world in which the proposition “p” is true without creating all its objects.
 
 5.124 A proposition asserts every proposition which follows from it.
 
 5.1241 “p.q” is one of the propositions which assert “p” and at the same time one of the propositions which assert “q”.
 
 56 TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS Two propositions are opposed to one another if there is no significant proposition which asserts them both.
