Every possible way to combine simple statements can be shown using a pattern like this: (TTTT)(p,q) means both p and q are true. This is called a tautology, like saying “if p then p” and “if q then q.”  

(FTTT)(p,q) means not both p and q are true. This is written as “not (p and q).”  

(TFTT)(p,q) means “if q then p.”  

(TTFT)(p,q) means “if p then q.”  

(TTTF)(p,q) means “p or q.”  

(FFTT)(p,q) means “not q.”  

(FTFT)(p,q) means “not p.”  

(FTTF)(p,q) means “p or q, but not both.”  

(TFFT)(p,q) means “if p then q, and if q then p.”  

(TFTF)(p,q) means “p.”  

(TTFF)(p,q) means “q.”  

(FFFT)(p,q) means “neither p nor q.”  

(FFTF)(p,q) means “p and not q.”  

(FTFF)(p,q) means “q and not p.”  

(TFFF)(p,q) means “p and q.”  

(FFFF)(p,q) means a contradiction, like “p and not p, and q and not q.”  

The ways that make a statement true are called its truth-grounds.  

If the truth-grounds shared by several statements are all also truth-grounds for another statement, we say the truth of that last statement follows from the truth of the others.  

Specifically, the truth of p follows from q if every truth-ground of q is also a truth-ground of p.  

This means the truth-grounds of q are included in those of p, so p follows from q.  

If p follows from q, then the meaning of p is included in the meaning of q.  

If a god made a world where certain statements are true, then all statements that follow from them are also true in that world. Also, the god couldn’t make a world where a statement p is true without also creating everything that p talks about.  

A statement claims every statement that follows from it.  

For example, “p and q” claims both “p” and “q.”  

Two statements go against each other if there is no meaningful statement that claims both of them at once.
