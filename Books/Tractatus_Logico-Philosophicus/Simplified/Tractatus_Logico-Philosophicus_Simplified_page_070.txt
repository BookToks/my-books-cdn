These rules are like symbols, and their meaning is reflected in them.

5.515 We need to understand that the things connected by “∨”, “.”, and so on have to be statements.

This is true because the symbols “p” and “q” assume “∨”, “∼”, and others. If “p” in “p ∨ q” doesn’t represent a complex sign, then “p” alone has no meaning. But then “p∨p”, “p.p”, and similar signs, which mean the same as “p”, would also have no meaning. If “p∨p” has no meaning, then “p∨q” can’t have meaning either.

5.5151 Should the symbol for a negative statement be made from the symbol for a positive one? Why can’t a negative statement be shown by a negative fact?

(For example, if “a” is not related to “b” in some way, that could mean aRb is not true.) But even here, the negative statement is actually built using the positive one.

The positive statement needs the negative one to exist, and the negative one needs the positive one too.

5.52 If the values of ξ are all the values of a function fx for every x, then N(ξ) means it’s not true that there is some x for which fx is true.

5.521 I separate the idea of “all” from the truth-function.

Frege and Russell connected generality with logical “and” or “or.” But then it’s hard to understand the statements “(∃x).fx” and “(x).fx,” which include both ideas.

5.522 What’s special about “generality” symbols is first, that they point to a logical model, and second, that they focus on constants.

5.523 The generality symbol can be used as an argument.

5.524 If you have the objects, then you have all objects.

If you have the basic statements, then you have all the basic statements.

5.525 It’s wrong to say the statement “(∃x).fx” means “fx is possible,” like Russell says.

Certainty, possibility, or impossibility of a situation aren’t shown by a statement but by the fact that an expression is always true (a tautology), makes sense, or is a contradiction.
