About Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg depends on donations from the public to keep going. These donations help increase the number of free books and works available in digital form, so lots of people can read them, even on old devices. Small donations from $1 to $5,000 are very important to keep the Foundation’s tax-free status.

The Foundation follows all charity laws in every state in the U.S. These laws are different in each state and require a lot of work and paperwork. The Foundation only asks for donations in states where it has official approval. To send donations or check if they can ask for donations in your state, visit http://pglaf.org. They don’t ask for donations in states where they don’t have permission but will accept donations if someone offers without being asked.

They also accept donations from other countries but can’t say how those donations affect taxes outside the U.S. Their small team focuses mostly on U.S. rules.
