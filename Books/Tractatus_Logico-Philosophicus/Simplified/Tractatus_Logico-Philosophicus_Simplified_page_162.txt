It’s clear that a reward should feel good, and a punishment should feel bad.

We can’t really talk about the will as something that holds moral value.

The will is just something that psychology studies.

If wanting something good or bad changes the world, it can only change the limits of the world, not the actual facts or what can be said about it.

In short, the world would have to become a different world as a whole. It would either grow or shrink.

The world of a happy person is different from the world of an unhappy person.

Just like with death, the world doesn’t change, it just ends.

Death isn’t something that happens during life. You don’t experience death.

If you think of eternity not as endless time but as timelessness, then the person who lives in the present lives forever.

Our life is as endless as our field of vision is without limits.

The idea that the soul lives forever after death is not proven in any way. Also, this idea doesn’t solve the mystery people hope it would. Does living forever really answer the big questions? Isn’t eternal life just as mysterious as life now? The answer to life’s mystery in space and time lies outside space and time.

Science can’t solve these problems.

How the world is doesn’t matter at all to something higher.

God doesn’t show himself in the world.
