We can’t think anything that doesn’t make sense, because if we tried, we’d have to think in a way that doesn’t make sense.

People used to say that God could create anything, except things that go against logic. The truth is, we wouldn’t even know how a world that breaks logic would look.

Trying to explain something that breaks logic using words is impossible. It’s like trying to draw a shape in geometry that breaks the rules of space or giving coordinates for a point that doesn’t exist.

We might be able to imagine something that breaks the laws of physics, but not something that breaks the rules of geometry.

A thought that is true without needing proof would be one that has to be true just because it’s possible.

We’d only know a thought is true without checking something else if its truth is clear just by looking at the thought itself.

In a sentence, the thought is shown in a way we can sense, like hearing or reading it.

We use sounds or written signs in a sentence to show a possible situation.

The way we think about the meaning of a sentence is like imagining that situation.

The sign we use to show a thought is called the propositional sign. A sentence is this sign connected to the world it's talking about.

Everything that belongs to the imagined situation belongs to the sentence, but not the situation itself.

So, a sentence shows what might be possible, but not the actual thing.

This means a sentence doesn’t hold its full meaning yet, only the chance to express it.

When we talk about “the content of the sentence,” we mean the meaning inside it. A sentence has the shape of its meaning, but not the full meaning itself.
