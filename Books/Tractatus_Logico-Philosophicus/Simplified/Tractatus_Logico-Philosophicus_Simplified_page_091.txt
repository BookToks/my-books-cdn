6.4312 The idea that our soul lives forever after we die isn’t guaranteed at all. Also, this idea doesn’t really help us like we want it to. Does living forever solve the mystery of life? Isn’t eternal life just as confusing as life now? The answer to life’s mystery is not found inside space and time.

It’s not scientific problems that need solving. 6.432 How the world is doesn’t really matter for something higher than us.

God doesn’t show himself in the world.

6.4321 The facts only matter for the task, not for how the task is done.

6.44 The mysterious thing is not how the world works, but that it exists at all.

6.45 Thinking about the world from the view of eternity means seeing it as a limited whole.

Feeling the world as a limited whole is the mystical feeling.

6.5 If a question can’t be explained, then the question itself can’t be explained either.

The mystery doesn’t exist.

If you can ask a question, then you can also find an answer.

6.51 Doubting doesn’t make sense if you doubt things that can’t even be asked about.

You can only doubt where there is a question; a question only exists where there is an answer, and this only happens where something can be said.

6.52 We know that even if all scientific questions are answered, the real problems of life aren’t touched at all. Of course, then no questions are left, and that is the answer.

6.521 The problem of life is solved when this problem disappears.

Maybe this is why people who finally understood the meaning of life after a long time of doubting couldn’t explain what that meaning was.
