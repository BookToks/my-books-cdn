1.1 The world is made up of facts, not just things.

1.11 The world is decided by the facts, and by having all the facts.

1.12 All the facts decide what is true and what is not true.

1.13 The facts in logical space make up the world.

1.2 The world is split into facts.

1.21 Anything can either be true or not true, while everything else stays the same.

2 What is true, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.

2.01 An atomic fact is a combination of objects (things).

2.011 It is important to a thing that it can be part of an atomic fact.

2.012 In logic, nothing happens by accident: if a thing can be in an atomic fact, the chance of that fact must already be in the thing.

2.0121 It might seem like an accident if a thing that can exist by itself later fits into a situation.

If things can be in atomic facts, this must already be possible for them.

The decimal numbers show how important each idea is in the explanation. The numbers like n.1, n.2, n.3 explain the main idea n. The numbers like n.m1, n.m2 explain the idea n.m, and so on.

A logical thing canâ€™t just be possible; it has to be real.
