∗ 1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
 
 1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the facts.
 
 1.12 For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.
 
 1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.
 
 1.2 The world divides into facts.

 2 What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.
 
 2.01 An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).
 
 2.011 It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent part of an atomic fact.
 
 2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in an atomic factthepossibilityofthatatomicfactmustalreadybeprejudged in the thing.
 
 2.0121 It would, so to speak, appear as an accident, when to a thing that could exist alone on its own account, subsequently a state of affairs could be made to fit.
 
 If things can occur in atomic facts, this possibility must already lie in them.
 
 ∗The decimal figures as numbers of the separate propositions indicate the logical importance of the propositions, the emphasis laid upon them in my exposition. The propositions n.1, n.2, n.3, etc., are comments on proposition No.n; the propositions n.m1, n.m2, etc., are comments on the proposition No.n.m; and so on.
