The name “x” is used to stand for the idea of an “object” in logic.

Whenever we talk about an “object” (like a thing or an entity) the right way, we use a variable name in logic.

For example, when we say “there are two objects which...”, we write it as “(∃x,y) ...” in logic.

If we use the word “object” in any other way, like as a real thing, it creates nonsense statements.

So, you can’t say “There are objects” like you say “There are books.” You also can’t say “There are 100 objects” or “There are ℵ objects.” It doesn’t make sense to talk about how many objects there are in total.

The same goes for words like “Complex,” “Fact,” “Function,” “Number,” and so on.

These words all mean formal ideas and are shown in logic by variables, not by functions or groups like some people thought.

Sentences like “1 is a number” or “there is only one number zero” don’t make sense.

(It’s as silly to say “there is only one 1” as it would be to say “2 + 2 equals 4 at 3 o’clock.”)  

A formal idea is already shown when you have an object that fits it. So, you can’t introduce both the objects that fit a formal idea and the formal idea itself as basic ideas. For example, you can’t introduce the idea of a function and also specific functions as basic ideas; or the idea of number and specific numbers.

If we want to say in logic that “b is a successor of a,” we need a way to talk about any term in this formal series: aRb, (∃x): aRx . xRb, (∃x,y): aRx . xRy . yRb, and so on. 

The general term of a formal series can only be shown by a variable because the idea of “term of this formal series” is a formal idea. Frege and Russell missed this, so the way they wrote general statements like these is wrong and has a problem.

We can figure out the general term of the formal series by giving the first term and the rule that creates the next term from the one before it.
