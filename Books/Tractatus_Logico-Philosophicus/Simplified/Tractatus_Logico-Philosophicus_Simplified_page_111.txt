And that rule is the law of projection, which turns a symphony into written music notes.

It’s the rule that changes music notes into the language of a record.

4.015 All our comparisons and pictures in how we express things come from the logic of showing images.

4.016 To understand a sentence, think about hieroglyphs, which show the facts they describe.

From hieroglyphs, we got letters, but they still keep the idea of showing something.

4.02 We know what a sentence means without someone having to explain it to us.

4.021 A sentence is like a picture of reality: I understand what it talks about when I get the sentence. And I get it without anyone explaining its meaning.

4.022 The sentence shows its meaning.

It shows how things are if it’s true. And it says that things are like that.

4.023 Reality has to be fixed as yes or no by the sentence.

To do that, the sentence must describe everything completely.

A sentence is a description of a situation.

Just like a description talks about the outside of an object, a sentence describes reality by its inside parts.

A sentence builds a world using logic, so you can see how all logic works if the sentence is true. You can also make conclusions from a false sentence.

4.024 To understand a sentence means to know what would be true if the sentence is true.

(So you can understand it without knowing if it’s actually true.) You understand it when you know its parts.
