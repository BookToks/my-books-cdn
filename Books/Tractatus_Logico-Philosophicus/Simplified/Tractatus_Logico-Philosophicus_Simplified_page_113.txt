A sentence must only be as detailed as the situation it describes.

Both need to have the same logical (mathematical) structure. (Look at Hertz’s Mechanics about Dynamic Models.) This mathematical structure can’t be copied again by itself. You can’t get outside of it when copying.

For example, if we try to show what “(x)fx” means by adding an index before “fx”—like “Alg. fx”—it wouldn’t work because we wouldn’t know what was being generalized. If we use an index “a” like “f(x)”, that also doesn’t work—we wouldn’t know what “a” stands for.

If we try to mark the argument places like “(A,A). F(A,A)”, it still doesn’t work because we can’t tell which variables are the same. And so on.

All these ways don’t work because they don’t have the needed mathematical structure.

For the same reason, the idea that seeing spatial relationships is explained by “space glasses” isn’t enough, because it can’t explain the complexity of these relationships.

Reality is compared to a sentence.

A sentence can only be true or false if it is a picture of reality.

If you don’t notice that a sentence has meaning independent of facts, you might wrongly think that truth and falsehood are equally valid connections between signs and what they stand for.

For example, you might say “p” shows the true way of referring to something, and “∼p” the false way, etc.

But can we understand each other using false sentences the same way we do with true ones? Only as long as we know they are meant to be false.
