A perfect language would have rules that stop nonsense and use symbols that always have one clear meaning. Mr. Wittgenstein talks about what makes a language perfect in this way—not that any language right now is perfect or that we can build one easily, but that language’s main job is to have meaning. It works best when it gets close to this perfect kind of language we imagine.

The main job of language is to say if something is true or false. Once you know what the words mean, the meaning of a sentence is clear. But for a sentence to say something about a fact, the sentence’s structure has to match the structure of that fact. This is one of Wittgenstein’s biggest ideas. The part that the sentence and fact share can’t be explained in language itself. Instead, it can only be shown, not said, because anything we say still needs the same kind of structure.

An ideal language would have one name for every simple thing and never use the same name for two different simple things. A name is a simple symbol that doesn’t have smaller symbols inside it. In a perfect language, only simple things get simple symbols. The symbol for a whole thing would be a “complex,” made up of symbols for its parts. Talking about “complex” breaks some grammar rules, but it’s okay at first.

Most philosophical questions and statements aren’t wrong; they just don’t make sense. We can’t answer these questions because we don’t understand how our language works. They’re like asking if “Good” is more or less the same as “Beautiful.” What’s complex in the world is a fact. Facts not made from other facts are called Sachverhalte by Wittgenstein. Facts made of two or more facts are called Tatsache. For example, “Socrates is wise” is both a Sachverhalt and a Tatsache, while “Socrates is wise and Plato is his pupil” is a Tatsache but not a Sachverhalt.

Wittgenstein compares how language works to how shapes are drawn in geometry.
