INTRODUCTION By BERTRAND RUSSELL

Mr. Wittgenstein’s book, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, might not give the final answers to its big questions, but because it covers so much and goes so deep, it’s definitely an important work in philosophy.

The book starts by looking at Symbolism and how words and things have to be connected in any language. Then it uses what it finds to explore different areas of traditional philosophy. It shows how many old philosophical ideas come from not understanding Symbolism and from using language the wrong way.

First, it talks about the logical structure of sentences and how we can make logical conclusions. After that, it moves on to topics like Knowledge, Physics, Ethics, and finally something called the Mystical.

To understand Wittgenstein’s book, you need to know what problem he’s trying to solve. When he talks about Symbolism, he’s interested in what would make a perfectly logical language.

There are different problems with language. One is about what happens in our minds when we try to express meaning — that’s a psychology problem. Another is about how thoughts, words, or sentences relate to what they mean or refer to — that’s an epistemology problem. Then there’s the problem of using sentences to tell the truth instead of lying — that belongs to the specific sciences that study what the sentences are about. Finally, there’s the question of what connection one thing (like a sentence) must have to another to be a symbol for it — this is a logical question, and it’s the one Wittgenstein focuses on.

He cares about the rules for accurate Symbolism, where a sentence clearly “means” something specific. In real life, language is often vague, so what we say is never totally exact. Logic has to deal with two problems about Symbolism: (1) what makes combinations of symbols make sense instead of nonsense, and (2) what makes the meaning or reference of symbols unique and clear.
