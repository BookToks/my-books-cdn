Sometimes, people want to use expressions like "a = a" or "p ⊃ p."

This usually happens when they talk about the original idea of a sentence, thing, or something like that. For example, Russell in his book "Principles of Mathematics" used the nonsense "p is a sentence" by writing it as "p ⊃ p" and used it as a rule before some sentences so that only sentences could be used as parts of those sentences.

But this is nonsense because using "p ⊃ p" as a rule before a sentence is supposed to make sure the parts are the right kind. The rule doesn't become false if something that is not a sentence is used; instead, it just becomes meaningless. Also, the sentence itself becomes meaningless if the wrong kind of parts are used, so it protects itself from wrong parts just as well as the useless rule does.

People also tried to say "There are no things" by writing "∼(∃x). x = x." But even if that was a sentence, would it still be true if things existed but they were not identical to themselves?

In general, a sentence appears inside another sentence only as the base for truth operations.

At first, it might seem like a sentence can appear inside another sentence in other ways.

Especially in some sentences from psychology, like "A believes that p is true," or "A thinks p," and so on.

Here, it looks like the sentence p is related to the person A in some way.

Modern philosophy (like Russell, Moore, etc.) also thought of those sentences this way.

But it is clear that "A believes that p," "A thinks p," and "A says p" are like "'p' says p."

This means it is not about linking a fact and a person, but about linking facts by linking their parts.
