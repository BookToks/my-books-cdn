Propositions have structures that are connected to each other inside their form.

We can show these connections by explaining a proposition as something made from other propositions through an operation.

This operation shows the relationship between the structure of the new proposition and the ones it came from.

An operation is what you do to a proposition to turn it into a different one.

What you do depends on their formal features, or how similar their forms are inside.

The order in a series of propositions is the same as the operation that creates one proposition from another.

The first place an operation happens is when one proposition comes from another in a way that matters logically; that’s where building the logical structure starts.

Truth-functions of simple propositions come from operations that use those simple propositions as a base. I call these truth-operations.

The meaning of a truth-function of p depends on the meaning of p.

Examples of operations are denial, logical addition, and logical multiplication.

(Denial changes the meaning of a proposition to its opposite.)

An operation shows itself in a variable; it shows how we can move from one kind of proposition to another.

It explains the difference between their forms.

(What is the same in the base propositions and the result is just the bases themselves.)

An operation doesn’t describe a form but only the difference between forms.

The same operation that makes “q” from “p” also makes “r” from “q,” and so on. This means “p,” “q,” “r,” and others are variables that show general formal connections.
