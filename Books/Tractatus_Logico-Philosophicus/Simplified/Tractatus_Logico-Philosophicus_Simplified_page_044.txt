One name stands for one thing, and another name stands for another thing, and they are connected. Together, they create a complete picture, like a living scene, showing the basic fact.

The possibility of making statements depends on using signs to represent objects.

My main idea is that "logical constants" don’t stand for anything. The logic behind facts can’t be shown by signs.

A statement is like a picture of how things are, but only if it is put together logically.

(Even the word "ambulo" is made of parts, because its root changes meaning with different endings, or the ending changes with different roots.)

In a statement, there must be exactly as many different parts as there are in the situation it shows.

They both need to have the same kind of logical or mathematical complexity (like in Hertz’s Mechanics, about dynamic models).

This mathematical complexity can’t be shown or represented itself. You can’t step outside it when trying to represent it.

For example, if we tried to write what "(x).fx" means by putting something before "fx," like "Gen. fx," it wouldn't work because we wouldn't know what was being talked about.

If we tried writing an index like "f(x)" it wouldn’t work either because we wouldn't know how far the generalization goes.

If we tried putting marks in the argument places, like "(G,G). F(G,G)," it wouldn’t work because we couldn’t tell which variables are the same.

All these ways of writing are not good enough because they don’t have the right kind of mathematical complexity.

For the same reason, the idea that we see spatial relations through "spatial glasses" doesn’t work, because it can’t explain the many different relations.

Reality is compared with the statement.
