4.0311 One name stands for one thing, and another for another thing, and they are connected together. And so the whole, like a living picture, presents the atomic fact.
 
 4.0312 The possibility of propositions is based upon the principle of the representation of objects by signs.
 
 My fundamental thought is that the “logical constants” do not represent. That the logic of the facts cannot be represented.
 
 4.032 The proposition is a picture of its state of affairs, only in so far as it is logically articulated.
 
 (Even the proposition “ambulo” is composite, for its stem gives a different sense with another termination, or its termination with another stem.) 4.04 In the proposition there must be exactly as many things distinguishable as there are in the state of affairs, which it represents.
 
 They must both possess the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity (cf. Hertz’s Mechanics, on Dynamic Models).
 
 4.041 This mathematical multiplicity naturally cannot in its turn be represented. One cannot get outside it in the representation.
 
 4.0411 Ifwetried, forexample, toexpresswhatisexpressedby“(x).fx” by putting an index before fx, like: “Gen. fx”, it would not do, we should not know what was generalized. If we tried to show it by an index g, like: “f(x )” it would not do—we should not g know the scope of the generalization.
 
 If we were to try it by introducing a mark in the argument places, like “(G,G) . F(G,G)”, it would not do—we could not determine the identity of the variables, etc.
 
 All these ways of symbolizing are inadequate because they have not the necessary mathematical multiplicity.
 
 4.0412 For the same reason the idealist explanation of the seeing of spatial relations through “spatial spectacles” does not do, because it cannot explain the multiplicity of these relations.
 
 4.05 Reality is compared with the proposition.
