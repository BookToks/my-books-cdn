This is because no part of our experience is known before we have it.

Everything we see could be different.

Everything we can describe could also be different.

There is no fixed order of things before we experience them.

Here, you can see that solipsism, if taken strictly, is the same as pure realism. The "I" in solipsism shrinks to a single point, and what remains is the reality connected to it.

So, there really is a way to talk about the "I" in philosophy that is not about the mind.

The "I" comes into philosophy because “the world is my world.”

The philosophical "I" is not a person, not a human body, or a human soul, which psychology studies, but the metaphysical subject, the boundary—not a part of the world.

The general form of the truth function is: [p, ξ, N(ξ)].

This is the general form of a sentence.

This means that every sentence is the result of applying the operation N(ξ) step by step to simple sentences.

If the general form shows how a sentence is built, then it also shows how one sentence can be changed into another by an operation.

The general form of the operation Ω(0)(η) is: [ξ, N(ξ)](0)(η) (= [η, ξ, N(ξ)]).

This is the most general way to move from one sentence to another.

And now we come to numbers: I define x = Ω₀ x by definition, and Ω(0) Ων x = Ω(ν+1) x by definition.

Following these rules, we write the sequence x, Ω x, Ω Ω x, Ω Ω Ω x, and so on.
