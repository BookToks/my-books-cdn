4.1122 The Darwinian theory is not really part of philosophy any more than other science ideas are.

4.113 Philosophy sets limits on what science can argue about.

4.114 It should also set limits on what can be thought and what can’t.

It should stop the unthinkable by using what can be thought.

4.115 It will show what can’t be said by clearly showing what can be said.

4.116 Anything that can be thought can be thought clearly.

Anything that can be said can be said clearly.

4.12 Propositions (statements) can show all of reality, but they can’t show the logical form they share with reality that lets them represent it.

To show the logical form, we’d have to step outside logic and the world itself.

4.121 Propositions can’t show the logical form; this is reflected in the propositions themselves.

What language reflects, language can’t explain.

What shows itself in language, we can’t explain with language.

Propositions display the logical form of reality.

They reveal it.

4.1211 For example, a proposition like “fa” shows that the object “a” is involved. Two propositions “fa” and “ga” show they’re both about the same object.

If two propositions contradict, you can see it from their structure; the same if one follows from another.

4.1212 What can be shown can’t be said.

4.1213 Now we understand why we feel sure about the right logical idea, as long as our symbols are correct.
