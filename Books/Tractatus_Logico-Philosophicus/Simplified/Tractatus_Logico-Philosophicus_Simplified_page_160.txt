If something can be described, then it can also happen. And if the law of cause and effect says something can’t happen, then it can’t be described either.

Induction means we pick the simplest rule that fits with what we’ve experienced.

But this choice isn’t based on logic, it’s more about how we think or feel.

There’s no real reason to believe the simplest rule will always be true.

For example, the idea that the sun will rise tomorrow is just a guess—we don’t actually know for sure if it will.

There’s no rule that says one thing has to happen just because something else did. Only logical necessity exists.

Many people today make the mistake of thinking that natural laws actually explain why things happen.

They treat natural laws like something perfect and unchangeable, like how people used to think about God or fate.

Both views are partly right and partly wrong. The old way was clearer because it admitted there are things we just can’t explain. The new way acts like everything is explained.

The world doesn’t depend on what I want.

Even if everything we wished for happened, it would just be like a lucky break, because there’s no logical link between what we want and how the world works. Also, we couldn’t just choose to change the physical laws ourselves.

Just like there’s only logical necessity, there’s also only logical impossibility.
