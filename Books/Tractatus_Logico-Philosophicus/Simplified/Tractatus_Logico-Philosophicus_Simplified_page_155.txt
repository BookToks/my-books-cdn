Frege might say that this basic rule doesn’t seem obvious right away. But it’s strange that someone as precise as Frege used how obvious something seems as a test for a logical statement.

Logic is not just a set of rules; it’s like a mirror of the world.

Logic is beyond just normal experience.

Math is a logical method.

Math sentences are equations, so they are kind of pretend statements.

Math sentences don’t express a thought.

In real life, we don’t need the math sentence itself. Instead, we use math sentences to go from one idea that isn’t math to another idea that also isn’t math.

In philosophy, asking “why do we actually use this word or sentence?” often leads to useful insights.

The logic of the world, which shows up in logical statements called tautologies, also shows math in equations.

When two expressions are connected by an equals sign, it means you can swap one for the other. But whether this works depends on the expressions themselves.

Logical form means that two expressions can replace each other.

Saying something is true is like saying it’s not not true.

“1+1+1+1” can also be seen as “(1+1)+(1+1).”

Frege says two expressions can have the same meaning but different ways of showing it.

The important thing about an equation is that it’s not needed to prove the two expressions connected by the equals sign have the same meaning, because you can see this just by looking at the expressions themselves.
