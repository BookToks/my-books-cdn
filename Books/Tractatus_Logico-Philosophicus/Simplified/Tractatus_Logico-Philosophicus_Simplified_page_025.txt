This book might only make sense to people who have already thought about the same or similar ideas. So, it’s not meant to be a textbook. Its goal is reached if even one person reads it, understands it, and enjoys it.

The book talks about problems in philosophy and shows that these problems come from misunderstanding how our language works. The main idea is: if you can say something, say it clearly; but if you can’t talk about it, then don’t say anything.

Because of this, the book sets a limit—not on thinking, but on how we express our thoughts. To set a limit on thinking, we would have to think about things that can’t be thought about, which is impossible.

So, the limit can only be set in language, and anything beyond that limit is just nonsense.

I won’t say how much my ideas match other philosophers. I don’t claim to be original about every detail, so I don’t give sources. It doesn’t matter to me if someone else thought the same things before me.

But I do want to say that the work of Frege and my friend Bertrand Russell inspired me a lot.

If this book has value, it’s for two reasons. First, because it expresses thoughts, and it’s more valuable the better those thoughts are expressed. Like hitting a nail right on the head. I know I didn’t do as well as I could because this task was really hard for me. I hope others will do it better.

On the other hand, I believe the truth of the ideas I share here can’t be challenged and is final.
