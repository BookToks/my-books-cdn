We can think about them as long as we have a good way to write them down.

6.1224 It also becomes clear why logic is called the theory of forms and reasoning.

6.123 It’s clear that the rules of logic don’t follow other logical rules.

(Russell was wrong to think that every “type” needs its own rule about contradictions; one rule is enough because it doesn’t apply to itself.) 6.1231 The special thing about logical statements isn’t that they apply to everything.

Being general just means they happen to be true for all things by chance.

A statement that isn’t general can be just as obviously true as a general one.

6.1232 We can call the kind of logic that’s always true “essential” general truth, as opposed to “accidental” general truth, like the statement “all men are mortal.” Statements like Russell’s “axiom of reducibility” aren’t really logical statements, which is why they feel like they could only be true by luck.

6.1233 We can imagine a world where the axiom of reducibility isn’t true. But logic doesn’t care if our world is like that or not.

6.124 Logical statements show the basic structure of the world, or rather, they represent it. They don’t talk about anything specific. They assume that names have meaning and that basic statements make sense. That’s how they connect to the world.

It’s clear that it means something about the world when certain symbol combinations—which have a fixed kind of meaning—are always true. This is the key point.

We said that in the symbols we use, some parts are chosen by us, and some are not. In logic, only this counts: that means logic isn’t about us using signs to say what we want; instead, the nature of the necessary signs speaks for itself. In other words, if we know the rules of any logical sign system, then all logical statements are already known.

6.125 Even in old logic, it’s possible to describe all the “true” logical statements from the start.
