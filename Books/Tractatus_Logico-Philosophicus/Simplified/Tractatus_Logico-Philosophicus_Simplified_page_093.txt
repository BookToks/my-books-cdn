—So, it’s not a textbook.—Its goal would be reached if someone who reads it carefully enjoys it.

The book talks about philosophical problems and shows—at least I think—that these problems come from misunderstanding how our language works. You could sum up the whole point of the book like this: What can be said at all can be said clearly; and what you can’t talk about, you have to keep quiet about.

So, the book wants to set a limit on thinking, or better— not on thinking itself, but on how we express our thoughts. Because to limit thinking, we’d have to think about both sides of the limit (which means thinking about what can’t be thought).

This limit can only be set in language, and what lies beyond the limit is just nonsense.

I don’t want to judge how much my ideas match those of other philosophers. Actually, what I wrote here doesn’t claim to be new at all; and that’s why I don’t give sources, because I don’t care if someone else thought the same things before me.

I just want to say that I owe a lot of inspiration to the great works of Frege and to the work of my friend Bertrand Russell.

If this work has any value, it’s for two reasons. First, because it expresses ideas, and this value will be bigger the better the ideas are expressed—how well the point is made. Here, I know I haven’t done as well as I could have, simply because I don’t have enough strength to handle the task.
