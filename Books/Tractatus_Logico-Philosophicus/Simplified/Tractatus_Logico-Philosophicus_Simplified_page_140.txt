Once a way of writing is fixed, there is a rule in it for making all sentences that say "not p," a rule for making all sentences that say "p," a rule for making all sentences that say "p or q," and so on. These rules match the symbols and show their meaning.

It must be clear from our symbols that what is connected by "∨," ".", etc., has to be sentences.

This is true because the symbols "p" and "q" already assume the use of "∨," "∼," and so on. If the symbol "p" in "p∨q" does not stand for a complex sign, then it can't have meaning by itself. Then signs like "p∨p," "p.p," and others that mean the same as "p" would also have no meaning.

If "p ∨ p" has no meaning, then "p ∨ q" can't have meaning either.

Does the sign for a negative sentence have to be made using the sign for a positive one? Why shouldn't a negative sentence be able to show a negative fact?

For example: If "a" is not in a certain relation to "b," that could mean that "aRb" is not true. But even here, the negative sentence is indirectly made from the positive one.

The positive sentence must assume that the negative sentence exists, and the negative sentence must assume the positive one exists.

If the values of ξ are all the values of a function fx for every x, then N(ξ) = ∼(∃x).fx.

I separate the idea of "all" from the truth function.

Frege and Russell introduced the idea of "all" connected with logical "and" or logical "or." Because of this, it became hard to understand the sentences "(∃x).fx" and "(x).fx," which include both ideas.

The special thing about the idea of "all" is first, that it points to a logical original, and second, that it highlights constants.

The idea of "all" appears as an argument.
