Where can we find a metaphysical topic to talk about?

You say this is like the eye and what it sees. But you don’t actually see the eye itself.

And from anything in the field of sight, you can’t say it is seen by an eye.

The field of sight doesn’t have a shape like this.

This is because nothing we experience is known for sure before we see it.

Everything we see could be different.

Everything we can describe could also be different.

There is no fixed order of things that we know for sure before experience.

Here, we see that if solipsism is taken all the way, it is the same as pure realism. The “I” in solipsism becomes just a single point, and all that’s left is the reality connected to it.

So, in philosophy, we can talk about an “I” that is not about the mind or feelings.

The “I” in philosophy comes from the idea that “the world is my world.”

This philosophical “I” is not a person, not the human body or soul that psychology studies, but a metaphysical subject, a limit—not a part of the world.

The general form of a truth-function is: [p, ξ, N(ξ)].

This is the general form of a proposition.

This just means that every proposition comes from applying the operation N(ξ) step by step to simple propositions.

If we know the general form of how a proposition is made, then we also know the general way to make a new proposition from an old one.
