A contradiction is like the outer limit of sentences, while a tautology is their empty center.

If W is the number of reasons why the sentence "r" is true, and W_rs is the number of reasons why the sentence "s" is true that are also reasons why "r" is true, then we call the ratio W_rs : W the measure of how likely sentence "r" makes sentence "s."

In a setup like the one mentioned earlier, W is the number of "W"s in sentence r; W_rs is the number of "W"s in sentence s that line up with the "W"s in sentence r. Then sentence r gives sentence s the probability W_rs : W.

There is no special thing that belongs only to probability sentences.

Sentences that don’t share any truth reasons are called independent.

Independent sentences (like any two simple sentences) give each other the probability 1.

If p follows from q, then sentence "q" gives sentence "p" the probability 1. The certainty of a logical conclusion is a special case of probability.

(Applied to tautology and contradiction.) A sentence itself is neither likely nor unlikely.

An event either happens or it doesn’t; there is no middle ground.

Imagine a bag with the same number of white and black balls (and no others). I draw one ball at a time and put it back each time. By doing this many times, I can see that the number of black and white balls drawn becomes closer and closer.

This is not a mathematical fact.

If I say it’s equally likely to draw a white ball or a black ball, it means that all the things I know (including assumed natural laws) give no more chance to one event happening than the other.
