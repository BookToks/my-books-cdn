Wittgenstein doesn’t say we can actually find or see the simplest parts of things, or have direct knowledge of them. Instead, he says that having these simple parts is something that logic requires, kind of like how scientists believe in electrons even if we can’t see them.

He thinks there must be simple parts because every complicated thing depends on some basic fact. It’s not necessary to think that there are only a limited number of facts. Even if every fact had an endless number of smaller facts inside it, and every small fact had an endless number of objects, there would still be objects and small facts.

Saying that a complex thing exists means saying its parts are connected in a certain way, which is a fact. So, if we give a name to a complex thing, that name only makes sense if a certain statement is true—specifically, the statement that says how the parts are connected. Naming complex things depends on statements, and statements depend on naming the simple parts. That’s why naming simple things comes first in logic.

The world is completely described if we know all the smallest facts and know that these are all there are. Just naming all the objects in the world isn’t enough; we also need to know the smallest facts that these objects make up. If we know all these small facts, then in theory, we can figure out every true statement, no matter how complicated.

A statement that says a small fact is true or false is called an atomic proposition. All atomic propositions don’t depend on each other—none of them prove or contradict another. So, logical reasoning deals with statements that aren’t atomic. These more complex statements are called molecular propositions.

Wittgenstein’s idea about molecular propositions is based on his theory about truth-functions.

A truth-function is a kind of statement that includes another statement (or several) and whose truth or falsehood depends only on the truth or falsehood of those statements. For example, a truth-function of one statement p depends only on whether p is true or false. If it involves several statements like p, q, r, then its truth depends only on whether p, q, and r are true or false.

At first, it might seem like there are other kinds of functions of statements besides truth-functions. For example, “A believes p” is not a truth-function because a person can believe some true statements and some false ones. So, just because a person believes something doesn’t mean it’s true, and if they don’t believe it, that doesn’t mean it’s false either.
