That the sun will rise tomorrow is just a guess; it means we don’t actually know if it will.

There’s no rule that one thing has to happen just because something else did. Only logical rules are necessary.

The whole modern way of seeing the world is based on the wrong idea that natural laws explain everything that happens.

People treat natural laws like they can’t be questioned, just like ancient people treated God and Fate.

Both ideas are partly right and partly wrong. But ancient people were clearer because they accepted one simple truth, while modern people act like everything is explained.

The world doesn’t depend on what I want.

Even if everything we wished for happened, it would be like a lucky chance, because there’s no real link between what we want and what actually happens. And we can’t control that link even if it existed.

Just like there are logical rules that must happen, there are also things that are logically impossible.

For example, two colors can’t be in the same exact place at the same time because the idea doesn’t make sense logically.

In physics, this appears as: a particle can’t have two speeds at once, or be in two places at once, and two particles in different places can’t be the same particle.

It’s clear that two statements combined can’t be both always true or always false. Saying a spot in your vision has two different colors at once is a contradiction.

All statements have the same importance.

The meaning of the world must be outside the world. Inside the world, everything just is and happens as it does. There are no values inside the world – and even if there were, they wouldn’t matter.

If there is something truly valuable, it has to be beyond everything that happens and exists.
