All the facts belong only to the problem, not to the solution.

The mystical thing is not how the world is, but that the world exists.

Seeing the world from the point of view of eternity means seeing it as a limited whole.

The feeling that the world is a limited whole is what makes it mystical.

If you can’t say an answer out loud, you also can’t say the question out loud.

There is no real mystery.

If a question can be asked at all, it can also be answered.

Skepticism is not impossible to prove wrong but actually makes no sense if it doubts things that can’t even be questioned.

Doubt only happens where there is a question; a question only exists where there is an answer; and an answer only exists where something can be said.

We feel that even if all scientific questions were answered, our life problems wouldn’t be touched at all. Of course, then there would be no more questions; and that itself is the answer.

You know the life problem is solved when it disappears.

(Maybe this is why people who finally understand the meaning of life after a long time of doubting can’t explain what that meaning actually is.)

There is definitely something that can’t be put into words. This shows itself and is what we call mystical.

The right way to do philosophy would be to say nothing except what can be said, like scientific statements—which actually has nothing to do with philosophy—and then, whenever someone tries to say something metaphysical, to show them that some parts of what they said don’t really mean anything.

This way wouldn’t satisfy the other person—they wouldn’t feel like they were being taught philosophy—but it would be the only truly correct way.
