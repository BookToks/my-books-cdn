We can show whether something matches the possible truths by giving it a mark like "W" for true.

If this mark is missing, it means it does not match.

The way something matches or doesn’t match the truth possibilities of simple sentences shows the truth conditions of the sentence.

A sentence shows its own truth conditions.

(Frege was right to explain his symbols this way. But his idea about truth is wrong: If "true" and "false" were really things, then according to Frege, the meaning of "~p" wouldn’t be clear.)

The symbol made by adding these "W" marks to possible truths is called a sentence symbol.

It’s clear that the combination of "F" and "W" symbols doesn’t stand for any object or group of objects, just like lines or brackets don’t. There are no "logical objects."

The same goes for all symbols that mean the same as the "W" and "F" marks.

For example: p q “ W W W F W W W F „ F F W is a sentence symbol.

(Frege’s "judgment stroke" “(cid:96)” has no logical meaning; it only shows that Frege and Russell thought the sentence was true. So “(cid:96)” is not really part of the sentence, like a sentence number isn’t. A sentence can’t say by itself that it is true.) 

If the order of truth possibilities in the scheme is fixed by a rule, then just the last column already shows the truth conditions.
