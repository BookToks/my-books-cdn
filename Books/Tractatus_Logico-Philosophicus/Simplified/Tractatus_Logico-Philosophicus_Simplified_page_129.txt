If p follows from q, then I can conclude p from q; this is called inferring p from q.

The way you make this conclusion comes only from the two sentences themselves.

Only these sentences can justify the conclusion.

“Rules of inference,” like those Frege and Russell talked about, that are supposed to justify conclusions, don’t make sense and aren’t needed.

All reasoning happens before experience.

You can’t infer one elementary sentence from another.

You can never conclude that one completely different situation exists just because another situation exists.

There is no cause-and-effect link that can justify such a conclusion.

We can’t figure out future events just from what’s happening now.

Believing in cause-and-effect like this is a superstition.

Free will means that future actions can’t be known right now. We could only know them if cause-and-effect was as necessary as logical conclusions are.

The connection between knowing and what is known is like logical necessity.

Saying “A knows that p is true” makes no sense if p is always true no matter what.

If something seems obvious to us but that doesn’t mean it’s true, then that obviousness doesn’t justify believing it.

If one sentence follows from another, the second sentence says more than the first, and the first says less than the second.

If p follows from q and q follows from p, then p and q are actually the same sentence.

A tautology follows from all sentences but says nothing.

A contradiction is what all sentences have in common that no sentence shares with another. The tautology is what all sentences share that nothing else shares.

The contradiction is kind of outside all sentences, while the tautology is inside all sentences.
