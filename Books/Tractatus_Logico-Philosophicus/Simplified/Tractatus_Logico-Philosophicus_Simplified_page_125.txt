Tautologies and contradictions are not pictures of reality.

They don’t show any possible situation. A tautology allows every possible situation, while a contradiction allows none.

In a tautology, the conditions that match the world cancel each other out, so it doesn’t actually represent reality.

The truth conditions set the limits for the facts allowed by a sentence.

(A sentence, picture, or model is like a solid object that limits how things can move. But it also creates space where something can exist.) A tautology leaves the whole infinite logical space open to reality; a contradiction fills the entire logical space and leaves no room for reality. So, neither one can really describe reality.

A tautology is always true, a sentence can be true or false, and a contradiction is always false.

(Always true, maybe true, and never true show the levels we use in probability.)

The logical result of a tautology and a sentence is the same as the sentence. This means that combining them doesn’t change the meaning of the sentence.

A certain logical connection between signs matches a certain connection between their meanings. Random connections only match disconnected signs.

This means sentences that are true in every situation can’t be made from connected signs, because connected signs must match specific objects.

(And no logical connection means no connection between objects.) Tautologies and contradictions are the extreme cases of sign connections — they are like the breakdown of connections.
