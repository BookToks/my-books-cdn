4.4661 Even in tautologies and contradictions, the signs are still connected to each other. That means they relate to each other, but these relationships don’t really matter for the meaning of the symbol.

4.5 Now, it seems possible to describe the most general sentence form. This means giving a way to describe sentences in any language of signs so that every possible meaning can be shown by a symbol that fits the description. Also, every symbol that fits the description can express a meaning if the names’ meanings are chosen properly.

It’s clear that this description of the most general sentence form must only describe what is essential. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be the most general.

We know there is a general sentence form because there can’t be a sentence whose form we couldn’t predict or build. The general form of a sentence is: “It is like this and that.”

4.51 Imagine I have all the basic sentences. Then I can easily ask: which sentences can I make from them?

Those are all the sentences, and that’s how they are limited.

4.52 Sentences are everything that follows from all the basic sentences together (including the fact that they are all of them). So, in a way, all sentences are generalizations of the basic sentences.

4.53 The general sentence form is a variable.

5 A sentence is a truth function of the basic sentences.

(The basic sentence is a truth function of itself.) 5.01 The basic sentences are the truth inputs of the sentence.

5.02 It’s easy to confuse the inputs of functions with the indexes of names. I recognize the meaning of a sign both from its input and its index.
