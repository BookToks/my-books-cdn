But logic has to connect with how we actually use it.

So, logic and its use can’t be exactly the same thing.

If I can’t explain basic ideas before experience, trying to do so just leads to nonsense.

The limits of my language are the limits of my world.

Logic fills the world, and the world’s limits are also logic’s limits.

Because of this, in logic we can’t say: “This is in the world, but that isn’t.”

That would mean we’re leaving out some possibilities, which we can’t do because logic can’t go beyond the world’s limits.

If we can’t think something, then we just can’t think it; so we can’t talk about what we can’t think.

This idea helps answer the question of how true solipsism is.

Solipsism (the idea that only my mind is sure to exist) is actually right, but it can’t be said in words—it only shows itself.

The fact that the world is my world is shown by the fact that my language’s limits (the language only I understand) are the limits of my world.

The world and my life are one.

I am my world. (Like a tiny universe.)

The thinking, presenting “I” doesn’t really exist.

If I wrote a book called “The world as I found it,” I’d have to talk about my body and which parts listen to me and which don’t.

This would show that there isn’t really a separate “I”; in fact, the “I” can’t even be mentioned alone in the book.

The “I” isn’t part of the world but is the limit of the world.
