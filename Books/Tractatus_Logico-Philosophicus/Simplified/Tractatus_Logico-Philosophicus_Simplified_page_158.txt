Different systems of describing the world match different kinds of networks. Mechanics gives one way to describe the world by saying: All the sentences that describe the world have to come from a certain set of basic sentences—called mechanical axioms—in a specific way. This gives us the building blocks to create scientific knowledge and says: No matter what you want to build, you must use these blocks and only these blocks.

Just like how you can write any number using the number system, you should be able to write any physics sentence using the system of mechanics.

Now, let's look at how logic and mechanics relate to each other. (You could imagine a network made of different shapes, like triangles and hexagons.) Saying that a picture can be described by a network of a certain kind doesn’t tell us anything special about the picture. (This is true for any picture like that.) What really defines the picture is that it can be fully described by a certain network with a certain level of detail.

In the same way, it doesn’t say much about the world just because it can be described by Newtonian mechanics. What matters is that the world can be described by that mechanics in the way that it actually happens. It also says something about the world that it can be described more easily by one kind of mechanics than by another.

Mechanics is an attempt to build all the true sentences we need to describe the world following one plan.

All through logic, the laws of physics talk about things in the world.

We must remember that describing the world with mechanics is always very general. For example, mechanics never talks about specific material points but only about some points in general.

Even though the spots in our picture are geometric shapes, geometry can’t really say anything about their actual shape or position.
