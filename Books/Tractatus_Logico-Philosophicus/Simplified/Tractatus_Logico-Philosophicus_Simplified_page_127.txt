B. The letter "c" is used as a marker to show that the whole symbol is the addition sign for cardinal numbers. But this label is based on an agreement we made, and instead of "+", we could just use a simple sign "c". In "~p", however, "p" is not a marker but an argument: you can’t understand the meaning of "~p" without first understanding what "p" means. (In the name Julius Caesar, "Julius" is a marker. A marker is always part of a description of the thing we are naming. For example, Caesar from the family of the Julians.) Mixing up arguments and markers is, I think, the basis of Frege’s theory about the meaning of sentences and functions. For Frege, sentences in logic were names, and their arguments were the markers of these names.

5.1 Truth functions can be arranged in series.

This is the basis of probability theory.

5.101 The truth functions of any number of basic sentences can be written in a pattern like this: (WWWW)(p,q) Tautology (If p, then p; and if q, then q.) (p⊃p.q ⊃q) (F WWW)(p,q) In words: Not both p and q. (~(p.q)) (W F WW)(p,q) “If q, then p.” (q ⊃p) (WW F W)(p,q) “If p, then q.” (p⊃q) (WWW F)(p,q) “p or q.” (p∨q) (F F WW)(p,q) “Not q.” (~q) (F W F W)(p,q) “Not p.” (~p) (F WW F)(p,q) “p or q, but not both.” (p.~q :∨:q.~p) (W F F W)(p,q) “If p, then q; and if q, then p.” (p≡q) (W F W F)(p,q) “p.” (WW F F)(p,q) “q.” (F F F W)(p,q) “Neither p nor q.” (~p.~q) or (p|q) (F F W F)(p,q) “p and not q.” (p.~q) (F W F F)(p,q) “q and not p.” (q.~p) (W F F F)(p,q) “q and p.” (q.p) (F F F F)(p,q) Contradiction (p and not p; and q and not q.) (p.~p.q.~q) The truth possibilities of its truth arguments that make the sentence true, I will call its truth reasons.

5.11 If the truth reasons that a number of sentences have in common are all also truth reasons of a certain sentence, then we say that the truth of this sentence follows from the truth of those sentences.
