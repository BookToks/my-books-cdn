TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

The original book was a side-by-side translation. After the introduction, the even pages showed the German text, and the odd pages showed the English translation.

This e-book has been changed so the English translation comes first, followed by the German original. In the PDF, the proposition numbers link back and forth between the two languages.

The original used a lowercase ‘v’ for the logical “or” symbol; it has now been changed to the correct ‘∨’ symbol.

In the German part of the original, variables were printed straight up; in this e-book, they are italicized.

We tried very hard to copy the original text exactly. Small typing mistakes were fixed, and all changes are explained in the LATEX source code.
