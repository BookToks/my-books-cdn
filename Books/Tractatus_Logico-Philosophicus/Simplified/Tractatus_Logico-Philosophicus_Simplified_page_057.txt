4.51 Imagine you have all the basic statements. Then you can ask: what other statements can I make using them? All these new statements come from the basic ones, so they have limits.

4.52 Statements are everything that comes from all the basic statements combined. You can think of all statements as bigger versions of the basic ones.

4.53 The general form of a statement is a variable.

5 Statements are truth-functions of basic statements.

(A basic statement is a truth-function of itself.) 5.01 Basic statements are the starting points for other statements.

5.02 People often mix up the parts of functions with the tags used in names. I understand what a sign means both from its parts and its tags.

For example, in Russell’s “+”, the “c” is a tag showing that the sign means adding numbers.

But this way of writing is based on agreement, and you could use a different sign instead of “+”. But in “∼p”, the “p” is not a tag but a part of the function; you can’t understand “∼p” unless you understand “p” first. (In the name Julius Caesar, Julius is a tag. A tag is always part of describing the object it names, like “The Caesar from the Julian family.”) Mixing up parts and tags is, I think, the main mistake in Frege’s ideas about meaning. Frege thought statements were like names and their parts were tags attached to those names.

5.1 Truth-functions can be arranged in order.

This idea is the base for probability theory.
