Only whole sentences (propositions) make sense; names only have meaning when they are part of a sentence.

Every part of a sentence that shows its meaning is called an expression or a symbol.

The sentence itself is also an expression. Expressions are what sentences share with each other to have meaning.

An expression shows both a shape (form) and what it’s about (content).

An expression assumes the forms of all sentences it can be in. It is a common feature of a group of sentences.

Because of this, it is shown by the general form of the sentences it describes.

In this form, the expression stays the same while everything else can change.

So, an expression is shown by a variable, and the different values of this variable are the sentences that include the expression.

If the variables become fixed, the expression becomes a full sentence. We call such a variable a “propositional variable.”

An expression only has meaning inside a sentence. Every variable can be thought of as a propositional variable, including the name of the variable.

If we change a part of a sentence into a variable, we get a group of sentences that are all the possible values of that variable sentence. This group usually depends on what we decide the parts of the sentence mean.

But if we change all parts whose meaning we chose by agreement into variables, there is still a group left. Now, this group doesn’t depend on any agreement but only on the nature of the sentence. It matches a logical form or a logical model.

What values the propositional variable can have is fixed.

The way we fix the possible values is the variable itself.
