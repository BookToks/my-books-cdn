Logic deals with every possibility, and all possibilities are its facts. Just like we can’t think about things in space without space, or things in time without time, we can’t think about any object without thinking about how it might connect to other things.

If I think about an object as part of a basic fact, I can’t think about it without thinking about that possibility.

A thing is independent because it can happen in any situation, but this kind of independence is still a kind of connection to the basic fact, so it also depends on it. (Words can’t appear in two different ways at the same time, alone and in a sentence.) If I know an object, I also know all the ways it can happen in basic facts.

All these possibilities are part of the object’s nature. You can’t find a new possibility later.

To understand an object, I have to know all its inner qualities, not just what’s on the outside.

If I know all objects, then I also know all possible basic facts.

Every thing exists in a space of possible basic facts. I can imagine this space as empty, but I can’t imagine the thing without this space.

A thing in space must exist in endless space. (A point in space is like a place for an argument.) A tiny spot in what you see doesn’t have to be red, but it must have some color; it’s like there’s a color space around it. A sound has a pitch, something you touch has hardness, and so on.

Objects have the possibility of all different situations.

The way an object can happen in basic facts is its form.

An object is simple.

Every statement about complex things can be broken down into statements about their parts, and into those sentences that fully describe the complex things.
