The sentence is like a picture of a possible situation.

The way we understand a sentence is by thinking about this picture.

3.12 The sign we use to show our thoughts is called the sentence sign. A sentence is the sentence sign connected to the world in a special way.

3.13 A sentence includes everything needed to make this picture, but not the actual thing pictured.

It shows the possibility of the picture, but not the picture itself.

So, a sentence doesn't have its meaning inside it yet, but it can show the chance to express that meaning.

("The content of the sentence" means the meaning of a meaningful sentence.) A sentence has the form of its meaning, but not the meaning itself.

3.14 A sentence sign is made because its parts, the words, are connected in a certain way.

A sentence sign is a fact.

3.141 A sentence is not just a mix of words â€” (like a musical theme is not just a mix of notes). A sentence is organized.

3.142 Only facts can have meaning, a group of names cannot.

3.143 That the sentence sign is a fact is hidden by how writing or printing looks.

Because in a printed sentence, the sentence sign doesn't look very different from a word.

(That's why Frege could call a sentence a compound name.)

3.1431 It becomes very clear what a sentence sign really is if we think of it not as letters, but as objects in space (like tables, chairs, books).

The way these things are arranged shows the meaning of the sentence.
