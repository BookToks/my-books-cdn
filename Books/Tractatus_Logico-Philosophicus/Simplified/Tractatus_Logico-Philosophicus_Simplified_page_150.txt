Yes, that sentence starts to sound like a science fact, and this clearly shows it has been misunderstood.

6.112 The right way to explain logical sentences is to give them a special place among all sentences.

6.113 The unique thing about logical sentences is that you can tell they are true just by looking at their symbols. This idea covers the whole philosophy of logic. One important fact is that you cannot tell if other sentences (not logical ones) are true or false just by looking at them.

6.12 Logical sentences are tautologies, which means their structure makes them always true. This comes from the formal, logical features of language and the world.

When parts of a sentence are connected in a certain way to make a tautology, it shows the logic of those parts.

For sentences to connect and form a tautology, they need to have certain structural properties. The fact that they do form a tautology shows they have these properties.

6.1201 For example, the sentences “p” and “not p” connected as “not (p and not p)” form a tautology, which shows they contradict each other.

Also, the sentences “if p then q”, “p”, and “q” connected as “(if p then q) and p implies q” form a tautology, showing that q follows from p and “if p then q.” Similarly, “for all x, fx implies fa” is a tautology, meaning fa follows from “for all x, fx,” and so on.

6.1202 It’s clear that instead of tautologies, we could also use contradictions for the same purpose.

6.1203 To recognize a tautology when there’s no general term in it, you can use a simple method: replace “p,” “q,” “r,” etc., with “WpF,” “WqF,” “WrF,” and so on. Then, use brackets to show all possible truth combinations. For example, you can mark which parts of the sentence and their combinations are true or false using lines.
