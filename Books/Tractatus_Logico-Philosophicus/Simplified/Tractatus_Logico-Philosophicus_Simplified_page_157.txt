Studying logic means looking at all the rules that always apply. Everything outside of logic is just random.

The so-called law of induction can’t be a logical law because it’s clearly a meaningful statement. That’s why it can’t be a law we know just by thinking about it.

The law of cause and effect isn’t really a law but more like a pattern that laws follow.

“Law of causality” is a general name. Just like in mechanics there are minimum laws, like the law of least action, in physics there are laws about how cause and effect work.

People guessed there had to be a “law of least action” before they knew exactly what it was. This shows that some things we know beforehand are just logical facts.

We don’t believe in a conservation law just by thinking, but we do know beforehand that logical forms are possible.

All these ideas, like the principle of reason, continuity in nature, or least effort in nature, are things we understand beforehand about how science statements can be shaped.

For example, Newton’s mechanics gives a way to describe the world in one clear form. Imagine a white surface with random black spots. No matter what picture this makes, I can describe it very closely by covering the surface with a fine grid of squares and saying each square is black or white. This way, the description of the surface has one clear form.

This form is flexible because I could have used a grid of triangles or hexagons instead. Maybe describing it with triangles would be easier, meaning I could describe the surface just as well with bigger triangles as with smaller squares, or the other way around.
