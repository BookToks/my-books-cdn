44 Truth-functions are not the same as material functions.

If, for example, saying something is true can come from denying it twice, does that mean the denial is part of the truth?

Does “∼∼p” mean it denies ∼p, or does it say p is true; or maybe both?

The statement “∼∼p” doesn’t talk about denial itself, but it already assumes denial is possible when it says something is true.

And if there was something called “∼”, then “∼∼p” would have to mean something different from just “p”. One statement would be about ∼, and the other would not.

5.441 This disappearing of obvious logical parts also happens if “∼(∃x).∼fx” means the same as “(x).fx”, or if “(∃x).fx.x = a” means the same as “fa”.

5.442 If we are given a statement, then all the truth-related results that come from it are included with it.

5.45 If there are basic logical symbols, a correct logic must clearly explain how they relate to each other and why they exist.

The way logic is built from these basic symbols must be clear.

5.451 If logic has basic ideas, these must be separate from each other. When a basic idea is introduced, it must be introduced in every situation where it appears. You cannot introduce it in one case and then again in another. For example, if denial is introduced, we must understand it in statements like “∼p”, as well as in statements like “∼(p∨q)” or “(∃x).∼fx”. We can’t introduce it differently in different cases because then we wouldn’t know if it means the same thing, and there would be no reason to use the same symbol in both.

(In short, what Frege said about introducing signs by definitions also applies, in a similar way, to introducing basic signs.)

5.452 Introducing a new symbol in logic must always be a big deal with important effects. No new symbol should be added casually or without careful thought.

(For example, in the “Principia Mathematica” by Russell and Whitehead, there are definitions and basic statements written in words.)
