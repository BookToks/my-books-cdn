222 A statement is true or false depending on whether it matches reality or not.  

2.223 To know if an idea is true or false, we have to compare it to what’s real.  

2.224 Just by looking at the idea itself, we can’t tell if it’s true or false.  

2.225 There is no idea that is true without checking it first.  

3 The logical picture of facts is called a thought.  

3.001 Saying “a situation is thinkable” means we can imagine it.  

3.01 All true thoughts together make a picture of the world.  

3.02 A thought includes the possibility of the situation it describes.  

If something can be imagined, it can also happen.  

3.03 We can’t think something that doesn’t follow logic because then we’d be thinking in a way that doesn’t make sense.  

3.031 People once said God can make anything except things that break the rules of logic—because we wouldn’t even know what an “illogical” world looked like.  

3.032 You can’t show something that breaks logic in language, just like you can’t draw a shape that breaks the rules of space or give coordinates for a point that doesn’t exist.  

3.0321 We can show a situation that breaks the laws of physics, but not one that breaks the laws of geometry.  

3.04 A thought that is right without checking is one where its possibility guarantees it’s true.  

3.05 We could only know a thought is true without checking if its truth comes from the thought itself.  

3.1 A sentence shows a thought in a way we can sense.  

3.11 We use sensory signs like sounds or writing to express thoughts.
