Instead of saying "property of the structure," I also say "internal property"; instead of "relation of the structures," I say "internal relation."

I use these words to explain why many philosophers often mix up internal relations with real (external) relations. The existence of these internal properties and relations can’t be stated directly by sentences. Instead, it shows up in the sentences that describe those facts and objects.

4.1221 We can also call an internal property of a fact a "feature" of that fact. (Like when we talk about facial features.) 4.123 A property is internal if it’s impossible to think of its object without that property.

(This blue color and that one are in the internal relation of lighter and darker by itself. It’s impossible to think that these two objects are not in this relation.) (Here, the changing use of the words "property" and "relation" matches the changing use of the word "object.") 4.124 The existence of an internal property of a possible situation isn’t expressed by a sentence itself, but it shows in the sentence that represents it, through an internal property of that sentence.

It would be just as silly to say a sentence has a formal property, as to say it doesn’t.

4.1241 You can’t tell forms apart by saying one has this property and the other has that one; because this assumes it makes sense to say both properties about both forms.

4.125 The existence of an internal relation between possible situations is shown in language by an internal relation between the sentences that represent them.
