1251 So, in logic, nothing ever comes as a surprise.

6.126 To tell if a statement is part of logic, we look at the logical features of the symbols used.

We do this when we prove a logical statement. Instead of worrying about the meaning, we build new logical statements from others by just following certain symbol rules.

We prove a logical statement by making it from other logical statements using certain steps, which always create statements that are true no matter what (called tautologies). (And only tautologies come from tautologies.) Showing that these statements are tautologies isn’t really needed for logic because the starting statements must already be obviously true.

6.1261 In logic, the process and the result are the same. (So, no surprises.) 6.1262 Proof in logic is just a way to help us recognize tautologies when it’s tricky.

6.1263 It would be too strange if you could prove an important statement logically from another important statement, and that important statement was also logical. From the start, it’s clear that proving an important statement and proving a logical statement are two very different things.

6.1264 An important statement says something and its proof shows it’s true; in logic, every statement is like its own proof.

Every logical statement is like a rule called modus ponens shown with symbols. (But modus ponens itself can’t be explained by a statement.) 6.1265 You can always think of logic so that every statement proves itself.

6.127 All logical statements are equal; none are more basic or come from the others.

Every tautology shows by itself that it’s a tautology.
