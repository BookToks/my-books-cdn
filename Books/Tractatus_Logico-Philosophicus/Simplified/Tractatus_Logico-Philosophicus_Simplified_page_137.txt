You could say: A logical constant is something that all sentences naturally have in common.

But this is the general form of a sentence.

5.471 The general form of a sentence is what makes a sentence what it is.

5.4711 To explain what a sentence really is means explaining what all descriptions are, which means explaining the nature of the world.

5.472 Describing the most general sentence form is the same as describing the one universal basic symbol of logic.

5.473 Logic has to work on its own.

A possible symbol must also be able to mean something. Everything that is possible in logic is allowed. ("Socrates is identical" doesn’t mean anything because there is no property called "identical." The sentence is nonsense because we didn’t decide what it means, not because the symbol itself is wrong.) In a way, we can’t make mistakes in logic.

5.4731 The clarity Russell talked about can only happen in logic if the language itself stops any logical mistakes. Logic is a priori, which means you can’t think illogically.

5.4732 We can’t give a symbol the wrong meaning.

5.47321 Occam’s rule isn’t random or just useful by chance: It says that unnecessary symbols don’t mean anything.

Symbols that serve a purpose are logically equal; symbols that don’t serve a purpose are meaningless.

5.4733 Frege says: Every properly made sentence has to have meaning; I say: Every possible sentence is properly made, and if it has no meaning, it’s only because we didn’t give some parts a meaning.

(Even if we think we did.) So "Socrates is identical" says nothing because we didn’t give the word "identical" a meaning as a property.
