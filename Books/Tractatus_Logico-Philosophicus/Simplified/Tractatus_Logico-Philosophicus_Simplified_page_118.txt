1251 Now we can settle the question of whether all relations are internal or external.

4.1252 Sequences that are ordered by internal relations, I call form sequences.

The number sequence is not ordered by an external relation, but by an internal one.

The same goes for the sequence of statements like "aRb," "(∃x): aRx . xRb," "(∃x,y): aRx . xRy . yRb," and so on.

(If a is part of one of these relations, I call the related element a successor of a.) 4.126 When we talk about formal properties, we can also talk about formal concepts.

(I introduce this term to explain why formal concepts are often confused with actual concepts, which has caused problems in old logic.) Something being part of a formal concept can’t be shown by a sentence.

Instead, it shows itself through the symbol of the thing.

(The name shows that it refers to an object, the number symbol shows it’s a number, etc.) Formal concepts can’t be shown by a function like real concepts can.

Their features, the formal properties, aren’t expressed by functions.

A formal property is shown by a pattern of certain symbols.

The sign of the features of a formal concept is a special pattern shared by all symbols whose meanings belong to that concept.

So, the expression of a formal concept is a sentence variable where only this special pattern stays the same.

4.127 The sentence variable shows the formal concept, and the things that fit under this concept are its values.

4.1271 Every variable is a sign of a formal concept.

Because every variable shows a constant form that all its values have, and this form can be seen as the formal property of those values.
