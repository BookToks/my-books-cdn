Mr. Wittgenstein says we can't make statements about how many things exist in the world, like saying there are more than three things.  

This problem makes me think that every language might have a kind of structure that you can't talk about using that same language. But maybe there is another language that talks about the first language’s structure, and that second language has its own structure too. This could keep going forever, with languages talking about the structures of other languages. Mr. Wittgenstein would say his theory still works for all these languages together.  

The only way to argue against this is to say that there isn’t a complete set of all these languages. Mr. Wittgenstein believes these complete sets, which we can’t logically talk about, do exist, and that they are part of his idea of mysticism. But if we think about this never-ending chain of languages as one whole set, it wouldn’t just be something we can’t express logically—it would be fake, just an illusion, and this would get rid of the idea of the mystical.  

This idea is very hard to understand, and I know there are problems with it that I can’t answer right now. Still, I don’t see how any simpler idea can avoid Mr. Wittgenstein’s conclusions. Even if this hard idea turns out to be true, it wouldn’t change most of Mr. Wittgenstein’s theory, though it might affect the part he cares about the most.  

As someone who has spent a long time studying logic and knows how tricky it is to trust ideas that seem impossible to disprove, I can’t be sure a theory is right just because I don’t see anything wrong with it. But creating a theory of logic that doesn’t have any clear mistakes is an amazing and important achievement. In my opinion, this is what Mr. Wittgenstein’s book does, and that’s why no serious philosopher should ignore it.
