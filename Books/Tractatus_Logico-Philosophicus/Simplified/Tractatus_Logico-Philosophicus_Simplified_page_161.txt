It’s impossible for two colors to be in the same spot in your field of vision at the same time. This is not just a fact but something that makes sense logically because the way color works doesn’t allow it.

Think about how this kind of problem shows up in physics: A particle can’t have two different speeds at once. That means it can’t be in two places at the same time. So, particles in different places at the same time can’t be the same particle.

It’s clear that a statement combining two opposite facts can’t be both true and false.

Saying that one point in your vision has two different colors at the same time is a contradiction.

All statements are equally important.

The meaning of the world must be outside the world. Everything in the world is just how it is and happens how it happens; there’s no real value in it—and if there were, that value wouldn’t mean anything.

If there is a real value, it has to exist outside everything that happens and everything that is. Because everything that happens is random.

What makes something not random can’t be part of the world, or else it would be random too.

So, it has to be outside the world.

That’s why there can’t be real ethical statements.

Statements can’t express anything higher than facts.

It’s clear that ethics can’t be fully put into words.

Ethics is beyond what we can say.

(Ethics and beauty are the same thing.)

When we think of an ethical rule like “you should...,” the first question is: What if I don’t follow it? But ethics isn’t about punishment or rewards in the usual way. So, asking about what happens if you don’t follow the rule doesn’t really matter—at least, the results can’t be regular events. Because there must be something right about this question. There has to be some kind of ethical reward or punishment, but it has to be part of the action itself.
