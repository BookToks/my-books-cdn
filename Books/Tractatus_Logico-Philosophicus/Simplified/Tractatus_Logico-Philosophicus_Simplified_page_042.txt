For these irregularities also picture what they are to express; only in another way.
 
 4.014 The gramophone record, the musical thought, the score, the wavesofsound, allstandtooneanotherinthatpictorialinternal relation, which holds between language and the world. To all of them the logical structure is common.
 
 (Like the two youths, their two horses and their lilies in the story. They are all in a certain sense one.) 4.0141 In the fact that there is a general rule by which the musician is able to read the symphony out of the score, and that there is a rule by which one could reconstruct the symphony from the line on a gramophone record and from this again—by means of the first rule—construct the score, herein lies the internal similarity between these things which at first sight seem to be entirely different. And the rule is the law of projection which projects the symphony into the language of the musical score.
 
 It is the rule of translation of this language into the language of the gramophone record.
 
 4.015 The possibility of all similes, of all the imagery of our language, rests on the logic of representation.
 
 4.016 In order to understand the essence of the proposition, consider hieroglyphic writing, which pictures the facts it describes.
 
 And from it came the alphabet without the essence of the representation being lost.
 
 4.02 This we see from the fact that we understand the sense of the propositional sign, without having had it explained to us.
 
 4.021 The proposition is a picture of reality, for I know the state of affairs presented by it, if I understand the proposition. And I understand the proposition, without its sense having been explained to me.
 
 4.022 The proposition shows its sense.
 
 The proposition shows how things stand, if it is true. And it says, that they do so stand.
