These odd things also show what they mean, just in a different way.

A record, a musical idea, sheet music, and sound waves are all connected in a special way, similar to how language connects to the world. They all share the same basic structure.

(Like in the story about two young people, their two horses, and their lilies—they are all connected in some way.)  
The musician can read the music from the sheet, and there’s a way to get the music back from the record. Then, using the first way, you can get the sheet music again. This shows how these different things are similar even though they look very different. The rule that makes this work is called the law of projection, which changes the music into notes on the sheet.  

It’s also the rule that changes the sheet music into the record’s language.

The chance to compare things or use images in our language depends on how we represent ideas.

To get what a statement really means, think about hieroglyphs, which show pictures of what they talk about.

From hieroglyphs, the alphabet was made, but the important part of showing meaning didn’t get lost.

We know this because we understand what a sentence means even if no one explains it to us.

A sentence is like a picture of reality because I understand the situation it shows if I get the sentence. And I get the sentence without anyone telling me its meaning.

The sentence shows its meaning.

It shows how things are if it’s true, and it says that things are that way.
