The so-called law of induction can’t be a logical law because it’s clearly an important statement. So, it can’t be a law known just by thinking either.

The law of causality isn’t a specific law but a type of law. “Law of Causality” is a general name. Just like in mechanics there are special laws like the law of least action, in physics there are causal laws, which follow the form of causality.

People once thought there had to be a “law of least action,” even before they knew exactly what it was. (Here, something known just by thinking turns out to be purely logical.) We don’t believe in a law of conservation just by thinking, but we do know that a logical form is possible.

All statements like the law of causation, the law of continuity in nature, the law of least effort in nature, and others, are all ideas we can understand by thinking about possible scientific laws.

Newtonian mechanics, for example, helps us describe the universe in one clear way. Imagine a white surface with random black spots. We can say: No matter what picture these spots make, I can describe it as closely as I want by covering the surface with a fine grid of squares and saying whether each square is white or black. This way, I turn the picture into one clear form. This form is chosen by us because we could have used a grid of triangles or hexagons instead. Sometimes, a triangular grid might describe the surface better than a square one, or the other way around. Different grids lead to different ways of describing the world.

Mechanics decides one way of describing by saying: All statements about the world must come from some basic given statements—the mechanical rules. It gives us the building blocks for science and says: Whatever you build, you must use only these blocks.
