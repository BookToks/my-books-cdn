Names are simple symbols, and I show them using single letters like "x", "y", or "z."

I write an atomic sentence as a function of the names, like "fx" or "φ(x,y)."

Or I represent it using the letters p, q, or r.

If I use two signs with the same meaning, I show this by putting the sign "=" between them.

So, "a = b" means the sign "a" can be replaced by the sign "b."

If I introduce a new sign "b" through an equation to replace an already known sign "a," I write the equation as "a = b Def." This is a definition and a rule for using signs.

Expressions like "a = b" are just ways to show things; they don’t tell us what the signs "a" and "b" actually mean.

Can we understand two names without knowing if they mean the same thing or two different things? Can we understand a sentence with two names without knowing if they mean the same or different?

For example, if I know the meaning of an English word and the matching German word, it’s impossible not to know that they mean the same thing; I can translate one into the other.

Expressions like "a = a," or ones like it, are neither atomic sentences nor meaningful signs. (This will be clear later.)

If the atomic sentence is true, the fact exists; if the atomic sentence is false, the fact does not exist.

Listing all true atomic sentences describes the world completely. The world is fully described by giving all atomic sentences and which ones are true or false.

About the existence or non-existence of n facts, there are K = 2^n possibilities.

All combinations of facts can exist while others do not.
