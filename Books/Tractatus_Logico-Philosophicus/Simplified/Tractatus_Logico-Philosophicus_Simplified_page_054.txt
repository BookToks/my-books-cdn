Frege was right to start by explaining the symbols he used in his logic system. But his idea about what “true” and “false” mean is wrong. If “true” and “false” were real things, then the meaning of something like “not p” wouldn’t be what Frege said it was.

A sign made by combining the mark “T” with all the possible truth values is called a propositional sign.

It’s clear that the signs “F” and “T” don’t stand for any real object or group of objects, just like horizontal and vertical lines or brackets don’t. There are no “logical objects.”

The same idea applies to other signs that mean the same as “T” and “F.”

For example, the sequence “p q T T T F T T T F F F T” is a propositional sign.

Frege’s sign for asserting something as true is actually meaningless in logic. For Frege and Russell, it just shows they think the propositions marked this way are true.

This sign doesn’t belong to the propositions any more than the number of a proposition does. A proposition can’t say it is true about itself.

If the sequence of truth possibilities in the pattern is fixed by a rule, then the last column alone shows the truth conditions. Writing that column as a row, the propositional sign looks like “(TT–T)(p, q)” or more simply “(TTFT)(p, q).”

The number of spaces inside the left bracket matches the number of terms inside the right bracket.

For n simple propositions, there are L possible groups of n truth conditions.

Groups of truth conditions for several simple propositions can be arranged in a series.
