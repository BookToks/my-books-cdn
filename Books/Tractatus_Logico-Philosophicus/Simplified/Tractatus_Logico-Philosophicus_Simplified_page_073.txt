It doesn't make sense to add the idea "if p then p" before a statement just to make its arguments correct. This is because if the argument isn't a proper statement, it doesn't become falseâ€”it becomes meaningless. Also, the statement itself becomes confusing when used with the wrong kind of arguments. So, adding this idea doesn't help; it just makes things as confusing as before.

Some people suggested saying "There are no things" as "There is no x such that x equals x." But even if this was a real statement, would it be true if things did exist but weren't the same as themselves?

In general, statements only appear inside other statements as parts that affect their truth.

At first, it looks like one statement could be inside another in a different way.

This happens especially in sentences about psychology, like "A thinks that p is true" or "A thinks p."

Here, it seems like the statement p is connected to the person A in some special way.

And modern thinkers like Russell and Moore have thought about these statements this way.

But actually, sentences like "A believes that p," "A thinks p," or "A says p" are more like "'p' says p." This means we are connecting facts by connecting their parts, not mixing facts with objects.

This shows that ideas like the soul or the subject, as understood in today's simple psychology, don't really exist.

If a soul had parts, it wouldn't be a soul anymore.

The right way to understand "A judges p" must prove that it's impossible to judge something that doesn't make sense. (Russell's theory doesn't do this.)

To understand something complex means to see how its parts fit together.

This might explain why a figure can look like a cube in two different ways, and other similar things.
