The variable name "x" is the real sign for the fake concept "object."

Whenever the word "object" ("thing," "stuff," etc.) is used correctly, it is shown in the concept script by the variable name.

For example, in the sentence "there are 2 objects that..." it is written as "(∃x,y) ...".

If it is used differently, as a real word, it creates nonsense statements.

For example, you can’t say "There are objects," like you say "There are books." You also can’t say "There are 100 objects," or "There are ℵ objects."

It makes no sense to talk about the number of all objects.

The same goes for words like "complex," "fact," "function," "number," etc.

They all name formal concepts and are shown in the concept script by variables, not by functions or classes (like Frege and Russell thought). Statements like "1 is a number," "there is only one zero," and similar ones are nonsense.

(It’s just as silly to say "there is only one 1" as it is to say "2+2 equals 4 at 3 o’clock.") 

The formal concept comes with an object that fits under it already. So, you can’t introduce objects of a formal concept and the formal concept itself as basic ideas. For example, you can’t make the idea of a function, or specific functions (like Russell did), basic ideas; or the idea of a number and certain numbers.

If we want to write the general sentence "b is a successor of a" in the concept script, we need an expression for the general member of the sequence of forms: aRb, (∃x): aRx.xRb, (∃x,y): aRx.xRy.yRb, and so on. The general member of a sequence of forms can only be shown by a variable because a member of this sequence is a formal concept.
