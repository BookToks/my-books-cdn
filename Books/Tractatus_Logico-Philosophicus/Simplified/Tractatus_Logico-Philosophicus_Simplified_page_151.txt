Let’s look at the sentence p ⊃ q as an example. Now, I want to check if the sentence ∼(p . ∼p) (which is called the law of contradiction) is always true.

In our notation, we write “∼ξ” to mean “not ξ” and “ξ . η” to mean “ξ and η.” So the sentence ∼(p . ∼q) looks like this.

If we replace “q” with “p” and study how the outer true (W) and false (F) values connect with the inner ones, we find that the whole sentence is true for every possible truth combination of its parts, and it is never false for any combination.
