Every truth-operation takes simple true-or-false statements and combines them to make new true-or-false statements, which are called propositions.

When you apply truth-operations again and again to these statements, the result is still a proposition made from the original simple statements.

Every proposition comes from using truth-operations on simple statements.

5.31 The examples in No. 4.31 are important, even if “p”, “q”, “r”, and others are not simple statements.

It’s easy to see that the symbol in No. 4.442 shows a truth-function of simple statements, even when “p” and “q” are themselves truth-functions of simple statements.

5.32 All truth-functions come from applying a limited number of truth-operations step by step to simple statements.

5.4 Here, we understand that there are no things called “logical objects” or “logical constants” like Frege and Russell thought.

5.41 All results from applying truth-operations to truth-functions are the same if they represent the same truth-function of simple statements.

5.42 The symbols like ∨ and ⊃ are not relations like left or right.

The fact that you can define Frege and Russell’s “primitive signs” in different ways shows that these signs are not really primitive and don’t represent relations.

Also, the “⊃” we define using “∼” and “∨” is the same as the one we get by defining “∨” using “∼,” and that “∨” is the same as the first one, and so on.

5.43 It seems unbelievable that from one fact p, you can get infinitely many others like ∼∼p, ∼∼∼∼p, and more.

It’s also amazing that all logical (and mathematical) propositions come from just a few “primitive propositions.”

But actually, all logical propositions say the same thing: nothing.
