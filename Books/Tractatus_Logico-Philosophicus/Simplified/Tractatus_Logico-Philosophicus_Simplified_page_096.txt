Logic is about all possibilities, and all possibilities are its facts. Just like we can’t imagine things that are outside of space or time, we can’t imagine something that isn’t possible to connect with other things.

If I can think about something as part of a bigger situation, then I can’t think about it without that possibility of being part of that situation.

A thing is independent because it can appear in many possible situations, but this kind of independence actually depends on its connection to those situations. (Words can’t appear alone and in sentences at the same time.) If I know the thing, I also know all the ways it can appear in situations.

Every possibility has to be part of the thing’s nature. We can’t suddenly find a new possibility later on.

To really know a thing, I don’t have to know everything outside of it, but I do have to know all its internal features.

If all things exist, then all possible situations with those things exist too.

Every thing exists in a kind of space made up of possible situations. I can imagine that space as empty, but I can’t imagine the thing without that space.

A physical object has to be in infinite space.

A point in space is like a place for something to be. A spot in your vision doesn’t have to be red, but it has to have some color—it’s like it has a space of colors around it.

A sound has a pitch, and something you touch has a hardness, and so on.
