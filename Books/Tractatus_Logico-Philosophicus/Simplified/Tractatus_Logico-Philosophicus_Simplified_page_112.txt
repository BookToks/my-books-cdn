4.025 When you translate from one language to another, you don’t just change whole sentences into other sentences. Instead, you translate the parts of the sentence.

(The dictionary doesn’t only translate nouns, but also words that show time, qualities, and connections; and it treats them all the same.) 4.026 We need to understand the meanings of simple signs (words) so we can get what they mean.

But with sentences, we actually communicate with each other.

4.027 The point of a sentence is that it can give us a new meaning.

4.03 A sentence must use old words to share a new meaning.

A sentence tells us about a situation, so it has to be connected to that situation.

And the connection is that the sentence is like a logical picture of the situation.

The sentence only means something because it is a picture.

4.031 In a sentence, a situation is kind of put together as a test.

You can almost say: this sentence has this meaning; this sentence shows this situation.

4.0311 One word stands for one thing, another word stands for another thing, and together they connect like a living picture of the situation.

4.0312 The ability of a sentence depends on the idea that signs stand for things.

My main idea is that “logical constants” don’t stand for anything. That the logic of facts can’t be represented.

4.032 A sentence is only a picture of a situation if it is logically organized.

(Even the sentence “ambulo” is made up of parts, because its root with a different ending and its ending with a different root can have a different meaning.)
