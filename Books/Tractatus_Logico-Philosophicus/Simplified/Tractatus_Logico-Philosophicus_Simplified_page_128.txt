5.12 A sentence "p" is true because another sentence "q" is true when all the reasons that make "q" true also make "p" true.

5.121 The reasons that make one sentence true are included in the reasons that make the other true; so, "p" follows from "q."

5.122 If "p" follows from "q," then the meaning of "p" is part of the meaning of "q."

5.123 If a god creates a world where some sentences are true, then he also creates a world where all the sentences that follow from those are true. Similarly, he couldn’t create a world where "p" is true without creating everything that "p" talks about.

5.124 A sentence agrees with every sentence that follows from it.

5.1241 The sentence "p.q" agrees with both "p" and "q."

Two sentences are opposite if there is no meaningful sentence that agrees with both of them.

Every sentence that contradicts another denies it.

5.13 We can see that the truth of a sentence comes from the truth of other sentences by looking at how the sentences are built.

5.131 When the truth of one sentence comes from others, this shows in the way their forms relate to each other. We don’t have to put them together in one sentence to see this; the relationship exists inside them just by them existing.

5.1311 For example, if we conclude "q" from "p or q" and "not p," the way these sentence forms relate is hidden by how we write them. But if we write "p or q" as "p|q.|.p|q" and "not p" as "p|p" (where "p|q" means neither p nor q), then the connection becomes clear.

If we can conclude "fa" from "(x).fx," it shows that the idea of "all" is already inside the symbol "(x).fx."
