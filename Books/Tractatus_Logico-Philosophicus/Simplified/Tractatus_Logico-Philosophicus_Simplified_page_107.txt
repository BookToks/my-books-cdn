In logic, the meaning of a sign should never matter when setting up the rules; we have to do it without thinking about what the sign means. We should only describe how expressions look.

Russell’s "Theory of Types" doesn’t follow this rule. He made a mistake because he talked about the meaning of signs when creating the rules.

No sentence can say something about itself because the sentence’s sign can’t be inside itself. This is the main idea of the "Theory of Types."

A function can’t be its own argument because the function’s sign already includes a picture of its argument, and it can’t include itself.

For example, if we think the function F(fx) could be its own argument, we get a sentence like "F(F(fx))." In this sentence, the outer F and the inner F must mean different things. The inner one looks like φ(fx), and the outer one looks like ψ(φ(fx)). The only thing they share is the letter "F," which by itself doesn’t mean anything.

This becomes clearer if we write "F(F(u))" as "(∃φ) : F(φu).φu = Fu."

This way, Russell’s Paradox is solved.

The rules of logical syntax should make sense on their own if you know what each sign means.

A sentence has important parts and random parts.

The random parts come from how the sentence’s signs were made. The important parts are what let the sentence express its meaning.

So, the important part of a sentence is what all sentences with the same meaning have in common.

And the important part of a symbol is what all symbols that serve the same purpose share.
