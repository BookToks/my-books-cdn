Objects arranged together make up an atomic fact.

In an atomic fact, objects connect to each other like links in a chain.

These objects join in a specific way to form the atomic fact.

The way the objects connect is called the structure of the atomic fact.

The form is the possibility of this structure.

The structure of a fact is made up of the structures of all its atomic facts.

All the atomic facts that exist together make up the world.

This total also shows which atomic facts do not exist.

Whether atomic facts exist or don’t exist is what we call reality.

(When atomic facts exist, we call that a positive fact; when they don’t, it’s a negative fact.)

Atomic facts don’t depend on each other.

We can’t guess if one atomic fact exists or not just by knowing about another.

All reality is the world.

We create pictures in our minds to represent facts.

These pictures show facts in logical space, meaning which atomic facts exist or not.

A picture is like a model of reality.

The objects in reality have matching parts in the picture.

These parts stand for the objects in the picture.

A picture is made by combining its parts in a specific way.

That makes the picture itself a fact.

When the parts of the picture connect in a certain way, it shows how things are connected in reality.

This connection between parts of the picture is called its structure, and the possibility of this structure is called the form of representation of the picture.
