We make pictures of facts.

A picture shows the situation in a logical space, showing what exists and what doesn’t.

The picture is a model of reality.

The things in the picture match the parts of the picture.

The parts of the picture stand for the things in the picture.

A picture is made when its parts relate to each other in a certain way.

A picture is a fact.

The way the parts of the picture relate to each other shows how the things relate to each other.

This connection of parts in the picture is called its structure, and the way it can be arranged is its form of representation.

The form of representation is the possibility that things relate to each other like the parts of the picture.

The picture is connected to reality; it reaches up to it.

It is like a ruler placed against reality.

Only the outer points of the parts touch the thing being measured.

So, the picture also includes the relationship that makes it a picture.

This relationship is made by matching the parts of the picture to the things.

These matches are like the feelers of the picture’s parts, touching reality.

For something to be a picture, it must share something with what it shows.

There must be something the same in both the picture and what it shows for one to be a picture of the other.
