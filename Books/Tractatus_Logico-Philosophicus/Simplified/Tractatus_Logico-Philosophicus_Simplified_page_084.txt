It’s clear that the number of basic logical statements can be chosen in many ways. For example, we could use just one basic statement and build the rest from it, like combining Frege’s basic statements. Frege might say that then it wouldn’t be obviously true right away. But it’s interesting that such a smart thinker like Frege used how obvious something feels as a way to judge if a logical statement is good.

Logic isn’t really a theory; it’s more like a reflection of how the world works.

Logic is something that goes beyond just normal thinking.

Mathematics is a way of using logic.

Math statements are like equations, so they aren’t really statements that say something true or false.

Math statements don’t actually express ideas.

In real life, we don’t need math statements themselves, but we use them to help figure out things that aren’t about math.

In philosophy, asking “Why do we use this word or statement?” often leads to useful insights.

Logic shows how the world works through tautologies (statements always true), and math shows it through equations.

If two things are connected by an equals sign, it means you can swap one for the other. But you can only know this by looking at the two things themselves.

What makes two expressions logical is that they can be swapped for each other.

Saying something is true can also be thought of as denying that it’s not true.

The expression "1+1+1+1" can also be thought of as "(1+1)+(1+1)".

Frege says these expressions mean the same thing but have different ways of showing it.

But the important thing about equations is that you don’t need to prove they mean the same thing, because you can see it from the expressions themselves.
