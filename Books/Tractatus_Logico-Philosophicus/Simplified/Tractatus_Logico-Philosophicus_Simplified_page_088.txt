6.361 Using Hertz’s words, we can say: only steady connections make sense.

6.3611 We can’t compare something to “time passing” itself—because time passing doesn’t really exist—but only to another process, like the ticking of a clock.

So, to talk about the order of events happening, we have to use another process as a reference.

It’s the same for space. For example, if we say two events can’t both happen because there’s no reason for one to happen instead of the other, it really means we can’t describe one event without some kind of difference or imbalance. And if there is a difference, we can see that as the reason why one event happens and the other doesn’t.

6.36111 The problem about right and left hands, which can’t be perfectly lined up, already exists in flat space and even in one-dimensional space. Two matching shapes, a and b, can’t be made to cover one another unless they’re moved out of that space. Right and left hands are actually exactly the same in shape, and the fact that they don’t match up isn’t because they’re different.

A right-hand glove could fit a left hand if we could turn it around in four-dimensional space.

6.362 If something can be described, it can happen, and if the law of cause and effect says it can’t happen, then it can’t be described.

6.363 Induction is the process of guessing the simplest rule that fits what we’ve experienced.

6.3631 But this guessing doesn’t have a logical reason behind it, only a psychological one.

It’s clear that there’s no real reason to believe the simplest outcome will always happen.
