6.361 In the terminology of Hertz we might say: Only uniform connexions are thinkable.
 
 6.3611 We cannot compare any process with the “passage of time”— there is no such thing—but only with another process (say, with the movement of the chronometer).
 
 Hence the description of the temporal sequence of events is only possible if we support ourselves on another process.
 
 It is exactly analogous for space. When, for example, we say that neither of two events (which mutually exclude one another) can occur, because there is no cause why the one should occur rather than the other, it is really a matter of our being unable to describe one of the two events unless there is some sort of asymmetry. And if there is such an asymmetry, we can regard this as the cause of the occurrence of the one and of the nonoccurrence of the other.
 
 6.36111 The Kantian problem of the right and left hand which cannot be made to cover one another already exists in the plane, and even in one-dimensional space; where the two congruent figures a and b cannot be made to cover one another without moving them out of this space. The right and left hand are in fact completely congruent. And the fact that they cannot be made to cover one another has nothing to do with it.
 
 A right-hand glove could be put on a left hand if it could be turned round in four-dimensional space.
 
 6.362 What can be described can happen too, and what is excluded by the law of causality cannot be described.
 
 6.363 The process of induction is the process of assuming the simplest law that can be made to harmonize with our experience.
 
 6.3631 This process, however, has no logical foundation but only a psychological one.
 
 It is clear that there are no grounds for believing that the simplest course of events will really happen.
