A proposition connects to reality because you can say "Yes" or "No" to it, and that answer matches what really happens.

So, the proposition has to fully describe what it’s about.

A proposition is like a description of a fact.

Just like describing an object by what you can see or touch, propositions describe reality by what’s inside it.

A proposition builds a picture of the world using logic. If the proposition is true, you can see all the logical parts of reality in it. You can also think through what happens if a proposition is false.

To understand a proposition means knowing what would be true if the proposition is true.

You can understand it even if you don’t know if it’s actually true or not. You get it by understanding its parts.

When you translate from one language to another, you don’t translate whole propositions directly. Instead, you translate the parts that make them up.

A dictionary doesn’t just translate nouns but also words like adverbs and conjunctions, treating them all the same.

To understand simple words, their meanings have to be explained to us.

We explain ourselves using propositions.

Propositions are important because they can give us new ideas or meanings.

A proposition has to give us new meaning but using words we already know.

It tells us about a situation, so it has to be linked to that situation.

This link is that the proposition is like a logical picture of the situation.

A proposition only says something because it is like a picture.

In a proposition, a situation is put together like an experiment.

You can say, instead of "This proposition has this meaning," you can say, "This proposition shows this situation."
