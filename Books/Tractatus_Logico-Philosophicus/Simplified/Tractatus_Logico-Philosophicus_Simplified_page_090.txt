Everything that happens or exists is by chance.

What makes something not by chance can’t be found in the world, because then that would also be by chance.

It has to come from outside the world.

Because of this, there can’t be any true ethical statements.

Statements can’t express anything beyond the world.

It’s clear that ethics can’t be fully explained.

Ethics go beyond the physical world.

Ethics and beauty are connected.

When we say “you should do this” in ethics, we think, “What if I don’t?” But ethics isn’t about punishment or rewards like we usually think.

What happens because of an action doesn’t really matter here. The consequences aren’t just normal events.

There’s something right about asking this question. There has to be some kind of ethical reward or punishment, but it comes from the action itself.

And it’s clear that the reward has to feel good, and the punishment has to feel bad.

We can’t talk about the will as the source of ethics.

The will, as something we experience, is only interesting for psychology.

If wanting to do good or bad changes anything, it only changes the limits of the world, not the facts or things we can talk about.

Basically, the whole world would become different. It would grow or shrink as a whole.

The world of a happy person is very different from the world of an unhappy person.

Like in death, the world doesn’t change, it just ends.

Death isn’t part of life. You don’t experience death.

If eternity means not endless time but no time at all, then someone lives forever by living in the present.

Our life is endless like how we can see in all directions without limits.
