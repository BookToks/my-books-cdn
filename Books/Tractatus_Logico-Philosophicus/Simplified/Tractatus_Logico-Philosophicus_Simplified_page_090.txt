For all happening and being-so is accidental.
 
 What makes it non-accidental cannot lie in the world, for otherwise this would again be accidental.
 
 It must lie outside the world.

 (Ethics and æsthetics are one.) 6.422 The first thought in setting up an ethical law of the form “thou shalt ...” is: And what if I do not do it.

Atleasttheseconsequenceswillnot beevents. Fortheremustbesomethingrightinthatformulation of the question. There must be some sort of ethical reward and ethical punishment, but this must lie in the action itself.
 
 (And this is clear also that the reward must be something acceptable, and the punishment something unacceptable.) 6.423 Of the will as the bearer of the ethical we cannot speak.
 
 And the will as a phenomenon is only of interest to psychology.
 
 6.43 If good or bad willing changes the world, it can only change the limits of the world, not the facts; not the things that can be expressed in language.
 
 In brief, the world must thereby become quite another. It must so to speak wax or wane as a whole.
 
 The world of the happy is quite another than that of the unhappy.
 
 6.431 As in death, too, the world does not change, but ceases.
 
 6.4311 Death is not an event of life. Death is not lived through.
 
 If by eternity is understood not endless temporal duration but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present.
