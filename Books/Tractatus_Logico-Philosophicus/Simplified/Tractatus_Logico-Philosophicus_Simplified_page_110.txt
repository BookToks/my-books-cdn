All philosophy is about understanding language better. But it’s not like what Mauthner thought. Russell showed that the way a sentence looks doesn’t always match how it really works.

A sentence is like a picture of reality.

It’s a model of the world as we imagine it.

At first, a sentence—like one you see printed on paper—doesn’t seem like a picture of the real world it talks about. But music notes don’t look like music either, and letters don’t look exactly like the sounds we say.

Still, these sign systems can be seen as pictures of what they represent.

We clearly see a sentence like “aRb” as a kind of picture. The sign is like a symbol of what it means.

If we look deeper, we see that small odd parts—like the special marks in music notes—don’t ruin this picture.

Those odd parts still show what they mean, just in a different way.

A record, a musical idea, music notes, and sound waves all have a special connection, like the one between language and the world.

They all share the same basic logical structure.

(Like in a fairy tale, two young men, their two horses, and their lilies are all connected. In some way, they are one.)

There’s a general rule that lets a musician read a symphony from music notes, and also get the music back from the record’s line. This shows the deep similarity between these very different things.
