All the languages that Adam and his descendants created were lost again at the Tower of Babel. God made everyone forget their old language because they disobeyed Him. Then, people had to spread out to different parts of the world. This is how many different languages slowly started to form. Over time, these languages grew and changed.

The main reason we use language is to turn our thoughts into words. We do this for two main reasons. First, to remember our ideas better, because if we don’t write or say them down, we might forget. So, words help us keep track of our thoughts. Second, when many people use the same words, they can share what they think or feel, like what they want, fear, or love. For this reason, words are like signs.

There are special ways we use language: one is to explain the causes and effects of things we think about, which helps us learn new skills. Another is to share what we know with others, so we can teach and advise each other. We also use words to tell others what we want or plan, so we can work together. And sometimes, we play with words just for fun or to make things sound nice.

But language can also be used in bad ways. First, people might misunderstand their own thoughts because they don’t use words clearly, which confuses them. Second, they might use words in a tricky way to fool others. Third, they might say they want something they don’t really mean. Fourth, people can hurt others with words, like animals use teeth or horns to hurt enemies. Using words to hurt others is wrong unless it’s to teach or correct someone we’re responsible for.
