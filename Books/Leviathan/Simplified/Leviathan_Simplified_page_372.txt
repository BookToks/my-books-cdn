To believe that Jesus is the Christ is enough to receive eternal life; no other belief is needed. 

In 1 John 4:2, it says, “Every spirit that says Jesus Christ came in the flesh is from God.” And in 1 John 5:1, “Anyone who believes Jesus is the Christ is born of God.” Verse 5 adds, “Who can overcome the world except the one who believes Jesus is the Son of God?”

In Acts 8:36-37, the eunuch asks, “Here is water, what stops me from being baptized?” Philip replies, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” The eunuch answers, “I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God.” So, believing Jesus is the Christ is enough for baptism and to enter God’s kingdom. Whenever Jesus says, “Your faith has saved you,” it means the person believes Jesus is the Christ.

The last reason is from places where this belief is the foundation of faith. Whoever holds onto this will be saved.

First, in Matthew 24:23, Jesus warns, “If someone says, ‘Here is Christ,’ or ‘There is Christ,’ don’t believe them, because false Christs and false prophets will appear and do great miracles.” So, believing Jesus is the Christ must be true, even if others perform miracles.

Second, Galatians 1:8 says, “Even if we or an angel from heaven preach a different gospel than what we gave you, let them be cursed.” The gospel Paul and the apostles preached was simply that Jesus is the Christ. So, if anyone teaches differently, even an angel, we must reject it.

Third, in 1 John 4:1, it says, “Don’t believe every spirit, but test them. Every spirit that says Jesus came in the flesh is from God.” This shows that believing Jesus is the Christ is the main test for all other beliefs.

Fourth, in Matthew 16:18, after Peter said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,” Jesus replied, “You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church.” This means that belief in Jesus as the Christ is the foundation of the Church’s teachings.

All these show that believing Jesus is the Christ is the most important part of Christian faith.
