Sometimes, people have sworn by their kings because they were scared or wanted to praise them. By doing this, they showed the king was honored like a god. But when people swear by God without a good reason, it’s disrespectful to His name. Swearing by other things, like people do in normal talk, isn’t really swearing but just a bad habit from talking too angrily.

Also, taking an oath doesn’t make a promise stronger. If a promise is good and fair, it’s just as binding to God without an oath as it is with one. But if the promise is bad or wrong, it doesn’t count at all, even if someone swears an oath.

There’s a rule of nature that says we should give up some rights if keeping them causes problems for everyone. From this rule comes another: people must keep their promises. Without promises, words mean nothing, and everyone would still be fighting over everything.

This rule about keeping promises is the root of what we call justice. If no promise is made, no rights are given up, and everyone can claim anything, so nothing is unfair. But once a promise is made, breaking it is unfair. Justice means keeping your promises, and anything that isn't unfair is fair.

But promises don’t count if people don’t trust each other to keep them. As long as people are afraid the other might break a promise, there’s no real injustice because trust isn’t there. This fear can’t end while people live like they’re at war. So, for words like “fair” and “unfair” to mean something, there must be a strong power to force people to keep their promises. This power punishes those who break promises more than the benefit they get from cheating. This power also protects what people own after they give up the right to everything. Such power doesn’t exist until a government, or Commonwealth, is formed.

This idea matches what schools teach about justice: it’s always giving people what is theirs. So, without ownership or government, no one owns anything, and nothing is unfair. When there’s no government, everyone can take anything, so nothing is unfair.
