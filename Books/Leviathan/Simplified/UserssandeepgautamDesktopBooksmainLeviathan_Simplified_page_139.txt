Sometimes, it’s hard or even impossible to explain all the limits of a representative’s power in writing. So, regular laws that apply to everyone have to decide what the representative is allowed to do when the official documents say nothing about it.  

If the representative is just one person, anything they do that is not allowed by their official papers or the law is their own action, not the action of the whole group or anyone else. This is because they only represent themselves beyond the limits set by their papers or the law. But if what they do follows those limits, then it counts as the action of everyone. This is because the representative acts for everyone, and as long as they follow the rules, their actions are the actions of the whole group.

If the representative is a group, like an assembly, whatever the group decides that is not allowed by their official papers or laws is the group’s action and the action of everyone who voted for it. But it is not the action of anyone who voted against it or who was not there unless they agreed by choosing someone to vote for them. The decision is the group’s action because most people voted for it. If the decision is illegal, the group can be punished by being broken up or losing their rights to act. If the group has common money that no individual fully owns, they might have to pay a fine. People who didn’t vote for the decision are innocent because the group can’t force people to accept things outside their authority.

If the whole group’s power is in one person, and that person borrows money from someone outside the group, the debt belongs to that person alone. This is because if they had the power to make the group pay back the loan, they would basically be the ruler of the group. That kind of power would either be invalid because it’s a mistake and doesn’t really show the group’s will, or if it’s accepted, then that person is the ruler, which is a different situation than what we’re talking about here.
