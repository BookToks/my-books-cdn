In short, he has the highest power in all matters, both church-related and civil, when it comes to actions and words, because only those can be known and accused. And for things that cannot be accused, only God, who knows what’s in our hearts, can judge.

These rights belong to all rulers, whether kings or groups of leaders. This is because those who represent Christian people also represent the Church. The Church and a Christian nation are basically the same thing.

Even though what I’ve said here and elsewhere in this book clearly supports giving Christian rulers the highest church power, the Pope of Rome has always claimed this power for himself. Cardinal Bellarmine has argued this strongly in his book De Summo Pontifice, so I think it’s important to quickly look at his reasons.

He wrote five books on this topic. The first book has three main questions: one, which type of government is best—monarchy, aristocracy, or democracy; the second, which is the best government for the Church; and the third, whether St. Peter was the monarch in this mixed government. About the first question, I already proved (in Chapter eighteen) that all governments people must obey are simple and absolute.

In a monarchy, there is one supreme leader. Everyone else with power only has it because the leader gives it to them, and they act in his name. In aristocracy and democracy, there is one top group with the same power as a monarch. This means they aren’t mixed governments but have complete control.

Which government is best isn’t a big debate if one is already in place. People should stick with the current system because changing it goes against natural and divine laws. Also, the type of government doesn’t affect a pastor’s power unless he also has civil authority, because pastors are meant to teach and persuade, not command people. It’s up to each person to decide whether to accept what they’re taught.
