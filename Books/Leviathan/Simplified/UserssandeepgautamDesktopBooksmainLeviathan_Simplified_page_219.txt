People in God’s kingdom aren’t just lifeless objects or animals that can’t think. That’s because they don’t understand God’s rules.

Also, atheists or people who don’t believe God cares about what people do aren’t part of God’s kingdom. They don’t believe in God’s words, don’t hope for His rewards, and don’t fear His punishments. So, the people who believe there is a God who rules the world, gives rules, and offers rewards and punishments are God’s followers. Everyone else should be seen as enemies.

To control people with rules, those rules have to be clearly known. If not, they aren’t really laws because laws need to be explained clearly so people can’t say they didn’t know about them. For human laws, this is done by announcing them out loud.

God shares His laws in three ways: through natural reason (thinking and understanding), through revelation (special messages from God), and through the voice of a person who proves they speak for God by performing miracles. This means God’s word is threefold: logical, obvious, and prophetic. People hear these three types through reason, special sense, and faith.

About the special sense, or revelation, God doesn’t give universal rules this way. He speaks like this only to certain people and gives different messages to different people.

Because of the difference between natural reason and prophetic words, God’s kingdom is twofold: natural and prophetic. In the natural kingdom, God rules all people who recognize His care through reason. In the prophetic kingdom, God chose the Jewish nation to follow not only natural reason but also special laws given through prophets. This chapter will talk about God’s natural kingdom.

God’s right to rule and punish people doesn’t come from just creating them, like expecting thanks. Instead, it comes from His unstoppable power. Earlier, I explained how rulers get power from agreements. Now, I want to show how this power comes from nature and when it is never lost. Since all people naturally had rights to everything, that means each person had the right to rule over everyone else.
