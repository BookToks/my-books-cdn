Paul talks about Christian faith in general, saying, “Faith comes by hearing,” (Romans 10:17), which means we believe by listening to our proper teachers. He also says, “How can they believe in someone they haven’t heard about? And how can they hear without a preacher? And how can a preacher preach unless they are sent?” (Romans 10:14-15). This shows that the usual way people come to believe the Scriptures are God’s word is by hearing from those who are legally chosen to teach us, like our parents at home and pastors at church. We also see this in real life. For example, in Christian countries, most people believe or at least say the Scriptures are God’s word because they learn that from a young age, while in other countries where they are taught differently, few believe it.

But if teaching causes faith, why doesn’t everyone believe? The truth is that faith is a gift from God, and He gives it to whoever He wants. Still, He gives this gift through teachers, so hearing is the immediate cause of faith. Like in a school where many students are taught, some learn well and others don’t. The teacher causes learning, but learning itself is still a gift from God. All good things come from God, but not everyone who has them can say they are inspired by God directly. Claiming that means saying you have a special gift from God, like a prophet, and you would be checked by the Church.

Whether people know, believe, or accept the Scriptures as God’s word, if I show what parts of faith are really necessary for salvation from clear parts of the Bible, then those people must know, believe, or accept those parts.

The one necessary article of faith that the Bible says is simply needed for salvation is this: that Jesus is the Christ. The name Christ means the King God promised long ago through the prophets in the Old Testament. This King would come into the world to rule forever over the Jews and others who believe in Him, under God’s authority, and give them eternal life that was lost because of Adam’s sin. After I prove this from the Bible, I will explain when and how some other parts of faith might also be called necessary.
