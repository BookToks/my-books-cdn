Sixth, when we pray, give thanks, offer gifts, or make sacrifices, it makes sense that we should give the best and most meaningful honor we can. For example, prayers and thanksgivings should be said with careful, beautiful words, not rushed or simple ones. Otherwise, we don’t show God as much respect as we could. That’s why, even though it was wrong for the old pagans to worship statues as gods, it made sense that they did it with poetry and music, using their voices and instruments. Also, when they offered animals or gifts, and acted with respect and remembered the good things they had received, that was reasonable because they wanted to honor God.

Seventh, reason tells us not only to worship God alone, but especially to do it in public, in front of other people. Without public worship, we lose the chance to help others honor God too.

Finally, the best way to worship God is by obeying His laws, which are the laws of nature. Obedience is more pleasing to God than sacrifices. Ignoring His commands is the worst insult. These are the basic rules of worship that natural reason teaches each person.

A country is like one person, so it should have one way of worshiping God. It does this when it tells all its people to worship publicly in the same way. Public worship means everyone does the same thing. If different people worship in different ways because of their own religions, then there is no real public worship or shared religion in that country.

Since words and the ideas about God depend on what people agree on, the way we show honor to God should be decided by what the community intends. Where there is no law except reason, what individuals want can be done by the whole community through civil laws. Because a country only makes laws through its leaders who have power, the signs and ways of honoring God that the leaders decide should be used by everyone in public worship.
