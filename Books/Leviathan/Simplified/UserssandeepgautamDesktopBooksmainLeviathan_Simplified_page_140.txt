No one has to pay back a debt except the person who actually borrowed the money. The lender doesn’t know anything about the group or its members, so they only hold the borrower responsible. Since only the borrower can agree to borrow, only they have to pay back the money. If the group has money saved up, the borrower can pay from that; if not, they must use their own money.

If the borrower gets into debt because of a contract or a fine, it’s the same situation.

But if the borrower is a whole group voting together, and the debt is owed to someone outside the group, only the people who voted to borrow the money or agreed to the contract or fine are responsible. Each person who voted agreed to pay, so if one person pays the whole debt, the others are no longer responsible.

If the debt is owed to someone inside the group, then the whole group has to pay from their shared money, if they have any. When someone votes to borrow money, they also agree it must be paid back. If they vote against borrowing or skip the vote but later lend money to the group, they go against their earlier vote. This means they become both borrower and lender, so they can only get their money back from the group’s shared fund. If the fund is empty, they have no one to blame but themselves for lending the money.

This shows that in smaller groups that answer to a higher power, it’s sometimes okay and smart for someone to openly disagree with the group’s decisions and make sure their disagreement is recorded. Otherwise, they might end up responsible for debts or crimes caused by others. But in a group that is the highest authority, this right to protest is taken away because disagreeing means denying their power. Also, when the highest authority makes a command, everyone must follow it, even if they don’t always agree with it personally.

There are many different types of groups because they are made for different reasons, and they vary depending on time, place, and number of people involved.
