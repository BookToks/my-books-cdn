Taking from a poor person is worse than taking from a rich person because it hurts the poor person more.

Doing a crime during a time or place meant for worship is worse than doing it at other times or places because it shows more disrespect for the law.

There are many other examples of when crimes can be more serious or less serious. But with these examples, it’s easy for anyone to understand how serious other crimes might be.

Also, almost all crimes hurt not just individuals but also the whole community. When the crime is charged by the community, it’s called a public crime. When a private person charges it, it’s a private crime. For example, if someone is accused of murder by a private person, it’s a private case; if the government accuses them, it’s a public case.

XXVIII: About Punishments and Rewards  
A punishment is something bad that the government gives to someone who breaks the law. The goal is to make people want to follow the rules better.

Before talking more about punishment, we need to ask an important question: where does the government get the right to punish people? Before, it was said that no one promises not to defend themselves against violence, so no one gives another person the right to hurt them.

When making a government, people give up the right to fight others for themselves, but not the right to defend themselves. They agree to help the government punish others, but not to punish people on their own. If someone agrees to help punish others, they must have the right to do it themselves to give that right to the government.

So, the government’s right to punish doesn’t come from people giving it to them. Before governments existed, everyone had the right to do whatever they thought was needed to keep themselves safe, even if that meant harming others.
