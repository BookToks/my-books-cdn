Agreements made because of fear, in a natural state, still have to be kept. For example, if I promise to pay money or do work to save my life from an enemy, I have to keep that promise. This is because it's a deal where one person gets to stay alive, and the other gets money or help. So, if no other law says I shouldn't do it, the promise is valid. That’s why prisoners of war who promise to pay their ransom must do so. Also, if a weaker ruler makes a bad peace deal with a stronger one because they’re scared, they have to stick to it—unless something new and fair happens that starts the war again.

Even in a country with laws, if I have to pay money to a thief to get myself back, I have to pay until the law says I don’t have to. What I can legally do without a promise, I can also promise to do out of fear. And what I promise legally, I can’t just break.

If I make a promise first, it cancels out any later promises about the same thing. If I gave my rights to one person today, I can’t give the same rights to someone else tomorrow. So, the later promise doesn’t count.

A promise not to defend myself from violence is always useless. No one can give up their right to protect themselves from death, injuries, or being captured. Protecting yourself is the main reason people give up some rights. So, promising not to fight back doesn’t actually give up that right or make the promise real. People naturally choose the smaller risk, like the danger of fighting back, instead of the sure and immediate danger of not fighting back. Everyone agrees with this because we see criminals taken to jail or execution by armed guards, even if those criminals agreed to the laws.

A promise to say bad things about yourself without being sure you won’t get punished is also not valid. In a natural state, every person judges for themselves, so accusing doesn’t really happen. In a country with laws, if you accuse yourself, you could get punished, which is a kind of force you don’t have to accept. The same goes for accusing people whose punishment would make you suffer, like your dad, wife, or someone who helped you. If someone’s testimony isn’t given freely, it’s believed to be dishonest, so it shouldn’t be trusted. And if you can’t trust their words, you don’t have to give that testimony.
