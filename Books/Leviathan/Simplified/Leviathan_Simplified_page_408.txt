You can’t say that someone causes others to sin just because they worship in a certain way. Even if a really smart or educated person worships like that, it doesn’t mean others agree with it. They might do it because they are afraid, and it’s not really their own choice but because of what their leader says.

Worshiping God in a special place, or facing an image or a certain direction, doesn’t mean you are worshiping the place or image itself. It means you recognize that place or image as special or holy. “Holy” means it is set apart for God, not that the place or image has any special power on its own. This isn’t idolatry. For example, it wasn’t idolatry when people worshiped God in front of the bronze snake, or when Jews prayed facing Jerusalem, or when Moses took off his shoes before the burning bush at Mount Sinai. Those places were holy because God chose them, not because they were special by themselves. Christians worship in churches dedicated by the king or church leaders for the same reason.

But worshiping God as if He lives inside an image or place is idolatry. That’s because God is infinite and can’t be trapped in a small thing. Such “gods” made by people are just fake and meaningless, often called lies in the Bible. Also, if someone uses an image or place to remind them of God, but it wasn’t made or approved by the proper church leaders, that’s also idolatry. The commandment says, “You shall not make any graven image.” God told Moses to make the bronze snake, so that was allowed. But Aaron and the people made the golden calf without God’s permission, so that was idolatry—not just because they worshiped it, but because they made it for religious use without God’s authority or Moses' approval.
