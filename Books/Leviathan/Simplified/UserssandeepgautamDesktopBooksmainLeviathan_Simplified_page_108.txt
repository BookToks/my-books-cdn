Second, because the right to represent all the people is given to the one they make sovereign by an agreement only among themselves, and not between the sovereign and the people, the sovereign can’t break the agreement. This means none of the people can claim they are free from the sovereign’s rule by saying the sovereign broke the deal.

It’s clear that the person made sovereign doesn’t make an agreement with each subject beforehand. Either they would have to make one agreement with everyone together, which is impossible since people are not one person, or make separate agreements with each person. But if they made many separate agreements, those agreements wouldn’t count after the person becomes sovereign. That’s because any action by one person would count as done by all, since the sovereign represents everyone.

Also, if some people say the sovereign broke the agreement and others say they didn’t, there’s no judge to settle the argument. This would lead to fighting again, and everyone would have to protect themselves by force, which goes against the whole idea of creating a sovereign.

So, it’s useless to think a sovereign gets power based on a previous agreement. The idea that a ruler gets power by a deal with conditions comes from not understanding a simple fact: agreements are just words and mean nothing unless backed by the power of the sovereign’s force, which is supported by everyone together.

But when a group of people is made sovereign, no one thinks an agreement was made to hold power under certain conditions. For example, no one would say the people of Rome made a deal with themselves to share power on conditions they could break later.

People don’t see the reason for this is the same in both monarchy and popular government because some want to support the idea of a group government where they might share power, rather than a monarchy where they have no chance to do so.
