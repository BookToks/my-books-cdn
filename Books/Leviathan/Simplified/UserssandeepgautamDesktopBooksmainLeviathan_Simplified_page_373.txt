No one can build a better foundation than the one already laid, which is Jesus as the Christ. If anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or stubble, everyone’s work will be shown for what it really is. This will happen because the day of judgment will reveal it, like fire testing what kind of work it is. If someone’s work lasts after being tested, they will get a reward. But if their work burns up, they will lose it, though they themselves will still be saved, but only as if going through fire.

Some parts of this are easy to understand, and some parts are more symbolic and harder. From the clear parts, we can understand that pastors who teach about Jesus as the Christ might sometimes make mistakes, but they can still be saved. Even more so, those who just listen to these pastors and believe what they teach can also be saved. So, believing in Jesus as the Christ is enough for salvation; no other beliefs are absolutely necessary.

Now, about the harder, symbolic parts like “the fire will test everyone’s work” and people being “saved as if through fire,” this doesn’t change what we learned from the easy parts.

However, some people have used this to argue for the idea of purgatory’s fire. So, I’ll share my thoughts on what this trial by fire means. The Apostle seems to refer to the prophet Zechariah, who said that when God restores His kingdom, two-thirds will be cut off and die, but one-third will be refined by fire like silver and gold. This group will call on God, and He will hear them.

The day of judgment is when God’s kingdom is restored. On that day, Peter says the world’s wicked will be destroyed by fire, but the people God saves will go through the fire safely, just like silver and gold are purified. They will be freed from false worship and will call on the true God.

Paul is referring to this idea when he says the day of judgment will test everyone’s teachings, like testing gold, silver, and stones compared to wood, hay, and straw. Those who built wrong ideas on the true foundation will see their teachings fail, but they themselves will still be saved. They will pass safely through this fire and live forever, calling on the one true God.
