The sacraments that welcome us into the church happen only once because you only need to join once. But since we need to remember often that we are saved and loyal to God, the sacraments that remind us are done many times. These are the main sacraments and like serious promises we make to show our loyalty. There are also other special ceremonies called sacraments, which means being dedicated to God’s service. But since sacraments involve a promise to God, in the Old Testament the only ones were circumcision and the Passover. In the New Testament, the only ones are baptism and the Lord’s Supper.

When we talk about the word of God or the word of man, it doesn’t mean just a single word like a noun or verb. It means a full sentence or speech where someone says something important like a promise, command, wish, or question.

In this way, the word means a full message or speech, not just one word.

Sometimes, when we say the word of God or man, we mean the person who spoke it. For example, when we say the Gospel of St. Matthew, we mean St. Matthew wrote it. Other times, it means the topic or subject. For example, when the Bible talks about “the words of the days of the kings of Israel or Judah,” it means the things that happened during those kings’ times.

In the Bible’s original language, sometimes “the word of God” doesn’t just mean what God said, but also about God and His rule. This means the teachings about religion. So saying “the word of God” is like saying “theology,” which is the study of God and religion. 

For example, in the Bible, when Paul and Barnabas spoke, the “word of God” meant the Christian teachings. Also, when an angel told the Apostles to “go stand and speak in the Temple, all the words of this life,” it meant to share the message about life through Jesus.
