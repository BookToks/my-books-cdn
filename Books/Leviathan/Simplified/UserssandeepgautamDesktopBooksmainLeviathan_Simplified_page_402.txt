So, what does this place really mean, if not that Jesus went by himself into the wilderness? The moving him from the wilderness to the city, and then to a mountain, was actually a vision. This matches what St. Luke says—that Jesus was led into the wilderness by the Spirit. But when it talks about him being taken up to the mountain and the temple’s highest point, it’s more like a vision, like St. Matthew describes.

Also, when St. Luke says that “Satan entered into Judas,” and then Judas talked with the chief priests about betraying Jesus, it means Judas had a bad, sneaky plan to sell out Jesus. Just like the Holy Spirit gives good feelings and guidance, “Satan entering” means evil thoughts and plans from the enemy of Jesus and his followers. It wouldn’t make sense to say the devil took over Judas before he even wanted to betray Jesus. So, the devil “entering” him and Judas’s bad plan happened at the same time.

Now, if there is no invisible spirit or people being taken over by spirits, why didn’t Jesus and his Apostles clearly say so? But questions like this are not really important for a Christian’s salvation. It’s like asking why Jesus gave faith and goodness to some people but not everyone, or why he didn’t explain natural science to us supernaturally. There are good reasons for these things.

Just like God didn’t get rid of all the enemies around the Israelites in the Promised Land but left some to keep them alert and working hard, Jesus didn’t solve every hard question for us. He wanted us to use our brains and effort. His main message was simple: believe that he is the Christ, the Son of God, who came to die for our sins and will come back to rule and save his people forever. Whether or not you believe in spirits or ghosts doesn’t stop you from following this truth, even if some people get confused and follow their own ideas.
