If someone is related to a leader, then it makes sense that there are many leaders, but they are all part of the same group.

XLII: About Church Power

To understand church power—what it is and who has it—we need to look at two different times after Jesus went up to heaven. The first time is before kings and rulers became Christians, and the second time is after they did. It took a long time after Jesus left for any king or ruler to accept and support Christianity.

During that time in between, it’s clear that the church power was with the Apostles. After them, it was given to people they chose to preach about Jesus, help others become Christians, and guide those new Christians. These leaders gave this power to others by laying their hands on them. This hand-laying showed that the Holy Spirit, or God’s Spirit, was given to those chosen to be ministers and help grow God’s kingdom. 

So, laying on of hands was a symbol of being appointed to teach about Jesus. This ceremony copied what Moses did when he laid his hands on Joshua, as we read in the Bible. After Jesus rose and before he went to heaven, he gave his spirit to the Apostles first by breathing on them and saying, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” Later, after he went to heaven, he sent a strong wind and tongues of fire on them, but he did not lay hands on them himself. Just like Moses passed the spirit to Joshua by laying on hands, the Apostles passed the spirit to others the same way. This shows that church power stayed with those who got it from the Apostles through this hand-laying tradition, especially before there were Christian governments.

Here, God is shown in three ways. First, Moses and the high priests were God’s representatives in the Old Testament. Second, Jesus himself represented God while he was on earth. Third, the Holy Spirit, which means the Apostles and their followers who preach and teach, have represented God ever since.
