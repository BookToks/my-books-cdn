This kind of thinking is actually wrong.

The question isn’t about promises where neither side has to keep them, like when there’s no government to enforce them. Those aren’t real agreements. The real question is when one person has already done their part, or when there’s a way to make someone keep their promise. Then we have to ask if breaking the promise makes sense or helps the other person. I say it doesn’t make sense.

First, if someone does something that should obviously hurt them, even if something unexpected happens later that helps them, that doesn’t mean what they did was smart. Second, in a war-like situation where everyone is against everyone else and there’s no authority to keep peace, no one can stay safe alone. Everyone needs friends to protect them, and everyone expects the same help from others. So, if someone says it’s okay to trick the people helping them, they can only rely on their own strength, which isn’t enough.

Someone who breaks their promise and thinks it’s okay can’t really be trusted in a group that wants peace and protection. If the group accepts that person, it’s a mistake that puts everyone in danger. This danger can’t be counted on as a way to stay safe. So, if the person gets kicked out of the group, they’re likely to die. If they stay, it’s only because others don’t realize the risk they’re taking, which isn’t smart. People who don’t try to hurt them just don’t know what’s best for themselves.

As for the idea that you can get to heaven by breaking promises, that’s silly. There’s only one real way, and that’s by keeping your promises.

And about getting power by rebelling: even if it works sometimes, it usually doesn’t, and trying to do it teaches others to do the same. This is not smart. Justice, or keeping promises, is a rule of reason that stops us from doing things that harm our lives. It’s a law of nature.
