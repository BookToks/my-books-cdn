To believe that Jesus is the Christ is enough to get eternal life, and no other belief is needed. In 1 John 4:2, it says, “Every spirit that says Jesus Christ came in the flesh is from God.” Also, 1 John 5:1 says, “Anyone who believes Jesus is the Christ is born of God.” Verse 5 asks, “Who can beat the world? Only the one who believes Jesus is the Son of God.” 

In Acts 8:36-37, a man asks, “Here is water, why can’t I be baptized?” Philip says, “If you truly believe, you can.” The man replies, “I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God.” So, believing that Jesus is the Christ is enough for baptism, meaning it’s all you need to join God’s kingdom. Whenever Jesus says, “Your faith has saved you,” it means the person believes Jesus is the Christ.

The last proof is about places in the Bible where this belief is the foundation of faith. The one who holds onto this belief will be saved.

First, Matthew 24:23 warns, “If someone says, ‘Here is the Christ’ or ‘There he is,’ don’t believe it, because false Christs and false prophets will come with signs and wonders.” This shows how important it is to believe Jesus is the Christ, even if someone does amazing miracles but says otherwise.

Second, Galatians 1:8 says, “If anyone, even an angel, preaches a different gospel than what we taught, let them be cursed.” The gospel Paul and the other apostles preached was simply that Jesus is the Christ. So, we must reject anyone who teaches differently, no matter who they are.

Third, 1 John 4:1 says, “Don’t believe every spirit. You’ll know the Spirit of God because every spirit that says Jesus came in the flesh is from God.” This means believing Jesus is the Christ helps us judge all other teachings and is the most important belief.

Fourth, in Matthew 16:18, after Peter says, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,” Jesus replies, “You are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my Church.” This shows that faith in Jesus as the Christ is the foundation for all other church teachings.

Fifth, in 1 Corinthians 3, the same idea is explained about building faith on this foundation.
