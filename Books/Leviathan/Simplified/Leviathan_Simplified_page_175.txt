7. Also, unwritten customs, which are like laws but not written down, become real laws if the emperor agrees with them and they don’t go against natural law.

Laws can be split into two types: natural and positive. Natural laws have always existed and are also called moral laws. They include things like fairness, justice, and habits that help people live peacefully and kindly, which I talked about before.

Positive laws are made by people in power and didn’t exist forever. They can be written down or explained in some other way by the lawmaker.

Among positive laws, some are human and some are from God. Human positive laws can be split into two kinds: distributive and penal. Distributive laws explain the rights people have, like owning land or property and what freedoms they have. These laws apply to everyone. Penal laws say what punishment people will get if they break the law. These laws are meant for the officials who enforce them, not the people who break them, because people who break the law won’t punish themselves. Usually, penal laws are written along with distributive laws and are sometimes called judgments. All laws are like general judgments by lawmakers, and every individual judgment is like a law for the person it’s about.

Divine positive laws are rules from God that were made at certain times for specific groups or people. These laws aren’t from all time or for everyone, but only for certain people, and they are announced by people God has chosen. But how do we know if someone really has God’s authority? God might tell someone supernaturally to share His laws.

Since laws need to come from someone who has clear authority, and we can’t just naturally know if someone’s message is from God, how can anyone trust that the laws they get from that person really come from God without some kind of supernatural proof?
