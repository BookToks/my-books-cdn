Over time, pastors started wanting to impress new Christians and liked the kind of respect they might get after they died, just like others before them. Because of this, people began to worship pictures and statues of Christ and his Apostles more and more, which became a kind of idol worship. After Constantine’s time, some emperors, bishops, and church meetings noticed this was wrong and tried to stop it, but they were too late or not strong enough.

Making saints official is another old habit from pagan times. It’s not a mistake about the Bible, and it’s not something the Roman Church just made up. It’s a tradition as old as ancient Rome itself. The first saint made official in Rome was Romulus. A man named Julius Proculus said in front of the Senate that he talked with Romulus after he died. Romulus told him he was in heaven, called Quirinus, and would watch over the city. So, the Senate agreed he was a saint.

Julius Caesar and other emperors were made saints too. Back then, making someone a saint meant you had proof like this story. This is the same idea as how the pagans honored their heroes.

The popes got the title and power called Pontifex Maximus from the old Roman pagans. That was the name for the person in ancient Rome who had the highest power under the Senate and people to control religious rules and ceremonies. When Augustus Caesar turned Rome into an empire, he kept only this job and the job of people’s protector, which gave him all the power in both government and religion. Later emperors had the same power.

When Emperor Constantine, the first ruler to support Christianity, was in charge, he made the bishop of Rome control religion under his authority. At first, the bishops didn’t call themselves Pontifex Maximus. Instead, later bishops took the title to show their power over other bishops in Rome. This power didn’t come from St. Peter but from the city of Rome itself, which the emperors always wanted to keep strong.

You can see this because when the emperor made Constantinople the capital, its bishop said he was equal to the bishop of Rome. After some fights, the Pope won and became Pontifex Maximus, but only because the emperor gave him that right. The Pope’s power didn’t go beyond the empire or last after the emperor lost control of Rome, even if the Pope got his power from the emperor.
