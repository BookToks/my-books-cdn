Mistakes in definitions keep growing as you go along, and they lead people to silly ideas. Eventually, they see these mistakes but can’t fix them without starting all over again. This is where their problems begin.

People who rely on books are like someone adding lots of little numbers into a bigger total without checking if the small numbers were right. When they finally notice the mistake but don’t question their first steps, they get confused and waste time flipping through their books. It’s like birds that fly into a room through a chimney and then flap around at a window, not realizing how they got in.

The right meaning of words is the first step to learning and gaining knowledge. Wrong or missing definitions cause problems and wrong ideas. People who just trust books without thinking for themselves are worse off than those who don’t know much at all, while people with true knowledge are much better.

True knowledge is between being wrong and being ignorant. Natural sense and imagination don’t make silly mistakes. Nature itself can’t be wrong. As people have more words to use, they can become either wiser or crazier than usual.

Without writing, no one can become very wise or very foolish (unless their brain is damaged). Words are like tools for smart people—they use them to count and think. But fools treat words as valuable just because famous people said them.

Anything that can be counted or added up can be named. The Romans called money accounts "rationes" and the act of counting "ratiocinatio." What we call items in bills, they called "nomina," meaning names. That’s why they used the word "ratio" for reasoning about all sorts of things.

The Greeks had one word, "logos," for both speech and reason. They didn’t think there was speech without reason, but you can’t reason without speech. They called reasoning "syllogism," which means adding up the results of one idea after another. Because the same things can be counted in different ways, their names get changed and used differently to show this.
