X: About Power, Worth, Honor, and Being Worthy  

The power a person has is their current ability to get something good in the future. This power can be natural or made through tools.  

Natural power means having strong body or mind skills, like great strength, good looks, smart thinking, skills, speaking well, being generous, or being noble.  

Instrumental power is about things gained by natural power or luck, like money, reputation, friends, or good luck, which some people think is from God.  

Power grows like fame does—the more you have, the faster it grows, like a big heavy object rolling faster the further it goes.  

The biggest human power is when many people join their powers together under one person or group, who can use all their powers as they want. This is the power of a country or government. Sometimes power depends on groups or factions with different people’s wills.
