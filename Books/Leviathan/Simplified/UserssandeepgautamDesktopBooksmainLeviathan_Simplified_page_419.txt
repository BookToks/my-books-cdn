But it is clear from the many times Jesus criticized them that they messed up the meaning of the law with their wrong explanations and useless traditions. They didn’t really understand the prophets, so they didn’t recognize Christ or the things he did, even though the prophets had predicted them. By teaching and arguing in their synagogues, they changed the meaning of their law into a strange kind of philosophy about the hard-to-understand nature of God and spirits. They mixed useless Greek ideas with their own ideas from confusing parts of the Scripture, which they could easily twist to fit what they wanted, and also used made-up stories from their ancestors.

What we now call a University started when many public schools in one town or city were joined together under one government. The main schools were for three careers: the Roman religion, Roman law, and medicine. Philosophy was only studied as a helper to the Roman religion. Since only Aristotle’s ideas were accepted there, it wasn’t real philosophy (which should not depend on any one author), but just Aristotelian thinking. Geometry wasn’t included for a long time because it only dealt with strict truth. If someone naturally became really good at it, people often thought they were a magician and that their skill was evil.

Now, looking at the specific ideas of useless philosophy that came to the Universities and then into the Church, partly from Aristotle and partly from not understanding things, I will first talk about their main ideas. There is a certain “first philosophy” that all other philosophy should depend on. It mainly focuses on clearly defining the most general names or words, to avoid confusion and mistakes when thinking and arguing. These clear definitions include words like body, time, place, matter, form, essence, subject, substance, accident, power, act, finite, infinite, quantity, quality, movement, action, feeling, and many others. These help explain how people understand the nature and creation of things. The explanation of these, and similar ideas, is usually called metaphysics in schools because it is a part of Aristotle’s philosophy that has that name.
