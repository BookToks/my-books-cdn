Mistakes in definitions keep growing as you go along, and they end up making people believe things that don’t make sense. Eventually, they realize the mistakes but can’t fix them without starting all over again. This is where their problems begin.

People who trust books are like someone adding up many small numbers into a big one without checking if the small numbers are correct. When they finally see a mistake, they don’t doubt their first steps and get confused. They waste time flipping through their books, like birds trapped in a room that came in through the chimney. The birds see light through a glass window and keep flying towards it, not knowing how to get out.

Getting the right meaning of words is the first step to learning. When definitions are wrong or missing, that’s the first mistake. This leads to false ideas. People who only learn from books and don’t think for themselves are worse off than those who don’t know anything, while people with true knowledge are way better. Real knowledge is between wrong ideas and ignorance. Our natural sense and imagination don’t make silly mistakes. Nature itself can’t be wrong. People have lots of words, and that can make them wiser or crazier than usual.

Without writing, no one can become very wise or very foolish, unless their memory is damaged. Words are like counters for smart people—they use them to count ideas. But for fools, words are like money, and they just trust famous people like Aristotle or Cicero without thinking for themselves.

Anything that can be counted or added up is called a “name.” The Romans called money accounts “rationes” and the process of accounting “ratiocinatio.” What we call items in bills, they called “nomina,” which means names. That’s why they used the word “ratio” for all kinds of counting. The Greeks had one word, “logos,” for both speech and reason. They didn’t think there could be speech without reason, but reason always needs speech. They called reasoning “syllogism,” which means putting together the results of one statement after another. Because the same things can be counted in different ways, their names are changed and made different to show this.
