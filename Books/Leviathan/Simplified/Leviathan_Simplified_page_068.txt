People don’t really understand how invisible forces cause things to happen. Most people guess based on what they have seen happen before, even if they don’t see any real connection between the events. So, they expect the same things to happen again and believe in good or bad luck coming from things that actually have nothing to do with causing those events. For example, the Athenians hoped for another great leader like Phormio for their war, and others have done similar things, hoping for a hero like Scipio. People also think their luck depends on lucky places, words said, especially if they include God’s name, like magic spells. Some even believe these powers can change anything into anything else.

When it comes to worshiping these invisible powers, people usually show respect like they would to other humans. They give gifts, ask for help, say thanks, show respect with their bodies, speak carefully, and make promises by swearing. They call on these powers for help. Beyond that, reason doesn’t offer more ideas, so people either stop there or follow more ceremonies if they trust others who seem smarter.

Finally, about how these invisible powers tell people what will happen in the future, especially about their luck or success, people don’t really know. They guess the future by looking at the past and often think that random events mean something important will happen again. They also trust predictions from people they already like or believe in, even if those predictions aren’t really sure.
