Salvation means more than just being safe or escaping danger. It shows us that our king will have a great and victorious rule after winning a battle. So, when we think about being saved, we should also think about victory and battles first. But these battles probably won’t happen in heaven.

Even if this idea seems right, I want to be sure by checking the Bible carefully. Isaiah chapter 33, verses 20 to 24, talks a lot about what salvation looks like.

It says to look at Zion, a special city, and Jerusalem, a calm and safe place that will never be destroyed or broken down.

There, the Lord will be like wide rivers and streams, but no big boats will sail on them.

The Lord will be our judge, lawgiver, and king, and He will save us.

The enemies won’t be strong because their ships can’t move well, and the weak will take their treasure.

People living there won’t be sick, and everyone will have their sins forgiven.

This passage shows where salvation will come from — Jerusalem, a peaceful home that lasts forever.

It tells us who saves us — the Lord, who judges, makes laws, and rules.

It describes the safety and protection we have, like strong rivers around us.

It shows the enemies will be weak and defeated, while the saved people will be healthy and forgiven.

All this means salvation will happen on earth when God rules again through Christ in Jerusalem.

From there, salvation will spread to other nations, bringing people into God’s kingdom.

The prophet also says that people from all over the world will bring others to Jerusalem as an offering to the Lord, just like the children of Israel did.
