When people see princes, their behavior often influences them more than the laws do. Even though we should do what princes say, not just what they do, people usually only follow this rule if God gives them special help to do so.

If we think about crimes by how much harm they cause, a crime that hurts many people is worse than one that hurts only a few. Also, if a crime causes harm now and sets a bad example for the future, it is worse than a crime that only causes harm right now. This is because the first kind of crime spreads and causes more problems, while the second does not.

It is a bigger crime for a preacher to teach ideas against the official religion than for a regular person to do so. It is also worse for someone who teaches the law to say or do things that weaken the ruler’s power. If a person is respected for their wisdom and many people listen to them, their crimes are worse because they influence others to do wrong too. In general, crimes are worse if they cause others to stumble or make weak people lose their way.

Crimes against the country or government are more serious than crimes against private people because they harm everyone. Examples include giving secrets to enemies or trying to hurt the ruler or government. Any actions or words that try to weaken the government’s power now or in the future are serious crimes. The Romans called these crimes "crimina laesae majestatis," which means acts against the basic laws of the country.
