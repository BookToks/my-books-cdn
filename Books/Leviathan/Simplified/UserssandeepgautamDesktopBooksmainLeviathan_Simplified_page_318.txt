If there is no community, there can be no excommunication, and if there is no power to judge, there can be no power to give a sentence.

Because of this, one Church cannot excommunicate another. Either they have the same power to excommunicate each other, which would not be true discipline but a breakup and loss of friendship, or one is under the other so they share the same voice, making them one Church. If part of it is excommunicated, it is no longer a Church but just a group of people without order.

Excommunication means people are told not to hang out or even eat with the person who is excommunicated. But if a king or ruling group is excommunicated, the sentence doesn’t work. All subjects must be with their ruler when asked, by natural law. They can’t kick their ruler out of their own land or leave without permission, and they can’t refuse to eat with him if he invites them. 

As for other kings and states, since they are not part of the same group, they don’t need excommunication to avoid hanging out with the excommunicated state. The way communities form keeps separate groups apart naturally. So excommunication doesn’t really affect kings and states except maybe to push them toward war.

Excommunication also has no effect on a Christian subject who follows their own ruler’s laws, whether the ruler is Christian or not.

If someone believes “Jesus is the Christ, he has the Spirit of God,” and “God lives in him, and he lives in God,” then the excommunication by people cannot hurt them. So, anyone who truly believes Jesus is the Christ is safe from the dangers of excommunication. Those who don’t believe it are not Christians. 

A true Christian cannot be excommunicated, nor can someone who only pretends to be Christian until their bad behavior shows. Bad behavior means going against the ruler’s law, which is the rule for how people should act, and which Jesus and his followers told us to obey. 

The Church can only judge behavior based on what people do openly, and those actions can only be wrong if they break the law of the country.
