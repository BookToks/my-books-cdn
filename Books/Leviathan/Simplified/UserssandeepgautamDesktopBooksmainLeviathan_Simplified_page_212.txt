If someone breaks the law against the whole country, they can be forgiven without it being unfair, because a person can forgive what’s done against themselves if they want to. But if someone hurts a private person, they can’t be forgiven without that person’s permission or getting something fair in return.

The differences between people come from the power of rulers, and these differences don’t matter in court, just like the difference between kings and their subjects doesn’t matter to the King of kings. Important people should be respected for helping those who are less powerful, or for not harming them at all. When powerful people do bad things, it’s worse because they don’t need to do those things. If powerful people get away with bad behavior, it leads to them becoming rude and arrogant; this causes hate, and people might try to bring down all the powerful people, even if it hurts the country.

Fair justice means taxes should be fair too. Fairness isn’t about how rich someone is but about the debt everyone owes to the country for protection. People don’t just work to live; they also need to be ready to fight to keep their life safe. Like the Jews who rebuilt their temple while protecting themselves, people must either protect themselves or pay others to do it. Taxes paid to the government are really the pay for those who protect everyone. Since life is equally important to both rich and poor, the debt a poor person owes for protection is the same as a rich person’s. Rich people might owe more because they have workers to protect too. So, fair taxes depend more on what people use than how rich they are. It wouldn’t make sense to charge someone who works hard and saves money more than someone who is lazy and spends everything, since both get the same protection.
