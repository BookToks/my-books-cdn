A law of nature is a basic rule found by using reason. It tells people not to do things that destroy their life or stop them from protecting it. It also says they should do things that help keep their life safe. Some people mix up the ideas of right and law, but they are different. Right means you are free to do or not do something, while law forces you to do one or the other. So, law and right are like being forced to do something versus being free to choose.

Because people naturally live in a state where everyone is against everyone else, each person uses their own reason to survive. In this situation, anyone can use anything, even other people’s bodies, to protect themselves. This means that as long as everyone has this right to everything, no one can feel safe, no matter how strong or smart they are. So, it’s a basic rule of reason that everyone should try to make peace if they think it’s possible. But if peace can’t be made, then it’s okay to use all the tools and advantages of war. The most important part of this rule is to always try to find and follow peace.

The second important rule is that everyone has the right to defend themselves by any means.

From the rule that says people should try for peace, comes another rule: a person should be willing to give up some of their rights, as much as is needed for peace and safety. They should accept the same freedom for others that they want for themselves. If everyone gives up some rights, there won’t be a state of war.

But if other people don’t give up their rights, then no one has to give up theirs either. Doing so would just make them easy targets, and no one has to risk that instead of choosing peace.
