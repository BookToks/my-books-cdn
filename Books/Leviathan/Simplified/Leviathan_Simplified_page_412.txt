Every day, we see that some people who only care about food and comfort are happy to believe anything silly without checking if it’s true. They just accept it like a rule that can’t be changed unless there’s a new, clear law.

Some people think it’s okay to paint pictures of angels and even God because of stories like God walking in the garden or Jacob seeing God at the top of a ladder. But visions and dreams, whether they happen naturally or supernaturally, are just images in the mind. When someone paints these, they’re not really making a picture of God, but of their own imagination, which is like making an idol. I’m not saying drawing from imagination is a sin, but thinking the picture really shows God goes against the second Commandment and only leads to worshiping the picture.

The same goes for pictures of angels or dead people, unless they’re used to remember friends or important people. Using images that way is not worshiping the picture, but honoring the person who was real. But if people pray to pictures of saints and think the saints can hear them or like the honor, that’s giving them more power than humans have, which is idolatry.

Since there’s no rule in the Law of Moses or the Gospel that allows worshiping images of God or creatures in heaven, earth, or below, and since Christian kings—God’s representatives on earth—shouldn’t be worshiped like gods, it’s hard to believe that the worship of images started because people misunderstood the Bible. It’s more likely that the images stayed in the Church because they weren’t destroyed when people who used to worship idols became Christians.

The reason is that these images were very valuable, so even after people stopped worshiping them as demons, they kept them in their homes. They said it was to honor Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the Apostles. It was easy to rename old pagan idols—like calling a statue of Venus and Cupid an image of Mary and Jesus, or a statue of Jupiter a picture of Barnabas, and Mercury became Paul, and so on.
