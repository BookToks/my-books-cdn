When it comes to understanding written laws, the person who writes explanations about them is not the real interpreter. These explanations often cause more arguments than the actual law, so people keep making new explanations, and it never ends. 

Because of this, unless there is an official interpreter chosen by the highest authority, the regular judges are the ones who interpret the law, just like they do with unwritten laws. Their decisions help in the cases they handle but don’t have to be followed by other judges in similar cases. Judges can make mistakes when interpreting written laws, but a mistake by a lower judge doesn’t change the actual law, which is the final decision of the highest authority.

People often talk about the “letter” and the “sentence” of the law. The “letter” means the exact words, which can be confusing or have many meanings. But the law really has only one true meaning. If by “letter” we mean the literal meaning, then the letter and the real meaning of the law are the same. The literal meaning is what the lawmaker wanted to say.

We assume the lawmaker always wants what is fair. So if the law’s words don’t clearly allow a fair decision, the judge should use natural law or wait until they get better instructions. For example, a law says that someone forced out of their home must be put back by force. If someone leaves their home empty by mistake and then is forced out, there’s no special law for that, but it should still be covered by the same law because otherwise, they would have no help, which the lawmaker would not want.

Another example: the law says to judge based on evidence. If a person is wrongly accused of something the judge saw someone else do, the judge should not follow the letter of the law to punish an innocent person. Instead, the judge should ask the highest authority to appoint a different judge and serve as a witness themselves.
