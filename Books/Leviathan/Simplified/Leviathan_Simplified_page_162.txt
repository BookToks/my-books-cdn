When many people see the same thing but from different points of view, they often focus on what benefits themselves. Even if they look carefully with both eyes, they usually aim with only one. Because of this, no big group of people living together as a country can stay united unless something unites them, like a common enemy, a famous leader, a secret group of advisers, or fear of other groups fighting each other. It usually doesn’t happen just by openly discussing things in public meetings. 

For small countries, whether they are ruled by the people or by a king, no smart plan can keep them safe for long if their powerful neighbors are jealous or threatening.

Civil laws are the rules that people have to follow because they belong to any country, not just a specific one. Learning the specific laws of one country is for experts who study those laws. But knowing about civil law in general is for everyone.

The old Roman law was called civil law because "civitas" means a country or community. Some countries that used to be part of the Roman Empire still keep parts of that law and call it civil law to separate it from their own laws. But here, I’m not talking about those specific laws. I want to talk about what law really means in general, like Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero did, without pretending to be legal experts.

First, it’s clear that law is not advice but a command. It’s not just anyone telling anyone else what to do, but only someone who has the right to command someone who must obey.

Civil law is just the name for commands given by the country itself.

So, I define civil law like this: it is the set of rules that the country tells each person to follow, through words, writing, or any clear sign, to show what is right and wrong—that is, what breaks the rules and what doesn’t.

This definition should be clear right away.
