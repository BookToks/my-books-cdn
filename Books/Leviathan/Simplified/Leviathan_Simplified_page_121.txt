The word "heir" doesn’t just mean a person’s children or closest family. It means anyone the person says should get their stuff after they die. So, if a king clearly says that a certain person will be his heir, either by speaking or writing, then right after the king dies, that person becomes the new king.

But if there is no will or clear words, other signs of the person’s wishes are followed. One of these is custom, or what usually happens. For example, if the custom is that the closest family member always inherits, then that family member has the right to the throne. This is because if the king wanted something different, he could have said so while he was alive. The same goes if the custom is that the closest male relative inherits, or if the custom is that a female relative inherits. If the king doesn’t say anything to change the custom, it’s assumed he wants the usual rule to continue.

If there’s no will and no custom, then it’s understood that the king wants the kingdom to stay a monarchy, because he had that system himself.

Next, it’s assumed that the king wants his own children, whether boys or girls, to inherit before anyone else. This is because people usually want their own children to get their things more than others’ children. Among his children, a son is usually preferred over a daughter because men are thought to be better suited for hard or dangerous work. If the king has no children, then a brother is next in line before any stranger. And in general, the closer the family member, the more likely they are to inherit, since close family usually care more about each other. Also, a person feels more honored if their closest relatives are important.

Some might worry that if a king can choose his heir by contract or will, he might sell or give his right to rule to a stranger. Since strangers don’t share the same government or language, this could lead to bad treatment of the people. But this problem doesn’t have to happen just because a stranger is in charge. It happens mainly because the rulers don’t know how to govern well. For example, the Romans, after conquering many nations, tried to avoid this problem by giving important rights and even Roman citizenship to leaders and groups from those nations. They also included them in the Senate and other important jobs in Rome.
