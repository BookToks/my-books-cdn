In II Thessalonians 3:14, it says, “If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, don’t hang out with them so they feel ashamed.” Some people think “obey” here means the letter is a law for the Thessalonians. Emperors’ letters were laws, so if Paul’s letter was also a law, people would have to obey two bosses. But the word “obey” in Greek means to listen to and follow advice, not just rules made by someone who can punish you.

Paul doesn’t tell people to hurt or punish those who don’t obey. Instead, he says to avoid them so they feel ashamed. This shows that Paul’s authority was about respect from other believers, not about having power like an emperor.

In Hebrews 13:17, it says, “Obey your leaders and do what they say because they watch out for your souls and will have to answer for them.” Here, obedience means listening to their advice because it helps us, not because leaders want power. If everything pastors teach was law, then every pastor would have the power to make laws, which isn’t true.

Also, people who obey their pastors don’t have to accept everything without question. For example, St. John says in 1 John 4:1, “Don’t believe every spirit, but test them to see if they are from God, because many false prophets have come.” This shows we can question what pastors teach, but laws can’t be argued with.

Civil rulers’ commands are laws, and only they can make laws. If others could make laws too, there would be no order or peace, which goes against all rules, both from God and humans.
