St. John the Baptist used this special ritual when people said they believed in Christ, who he said had already come into the world. Jesus also started this ritual as a special ceremony for all who believed in Him.

The Bible doesn’t clearly say why baptism began, but it might be based on an old rule from Moses about people with leprosy. Those people had to stay outside the camp for a while, and when a priest said they were clean, they had to wash before coming back in. Baptism might be like that washing, showing that people are cleaned from sin by faith and welcomed into the Church.

There’s another idea from the traditions of non-Jewish people. Sometimes if someone thought to be dead came back to life, others were afraid to be near them, like they were ghosts. They had to be washed to be accepted as living again, like newborn babies were washed to be clean. This Greek ceremony might have influenced Jewish practices when the Greeks ruled the area.

But since Jesus wouldn’t support a non-Jewish ritual, it’s more likely baptism came from the washing after leprosy rule. Also, the other important ceremony, eating the Paschal Lamb, is clearly copied in the Lord’s Supper. Breaking bread and pouring wine remind us of how Jesus saved us from sin, just like eating the Paschal Lamb reminded the Jews of their escape from Egypt.

Moses had authority from God, but it was limited. Jesus’ authority, as a human, was similar and also under God’s authority. This is shown when Jesus teaches us to pray, “Our Father, let your kingdom come,” and says that the kingdom, power, and glory belong to God. It’s also shown by what St. Paul wrote about Jesus giving the kingdom back to God the Father when everything is finished.

So, Jesus, both when teaching and ruling, shows us God. From then on, God is called the Father. God is one being but shown as one person by Moses, and another person by Jesus, God’s Son, the Christ.
