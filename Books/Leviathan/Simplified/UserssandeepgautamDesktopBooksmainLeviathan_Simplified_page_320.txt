The men he wanted to show that Jesus was the Christ and had risen from the dead were also Jews, and they already believed the Scriptures were the word of God. Because of this, some of them believed what he said, but some did not.

Why did they all believe the Scriptures but still have different opinions? Some agreed with St. Paul’s explanation, and some did not. This happened because St. Paul came to them without any official authority and tried to persuade them instead of commanding. He had to do this either by showing miracles like Moses did or by explaining the Scriptures to prove his point.

When someone explains something by using written rules, the person listening becomes the judge of what it means and how strong the argument is. If these Jews were not the judges of what St. Paul said from the Scriptures, then who else could be? If St. Paul was the judge, he wouldn’t need to quote the Scriptures to prove himself. He could just say he was sent by Christ to interpret the laws.

So, there was no official interpreter of the Scriptures that the Jews had to follow. Everyone could believe or not believe based on what they thought the Scriptures meant. Usually, when someone tries to prove something, the person listening decides if it makes sense.

For the Jews, they were supposed to listen to the priests and judges of Israel for tough questions (Deuteronomy 17), but this was before they became Christians.

For non-Jews (Gentiles), it didn’t make sense to use the Scriptures because they didn’t believe in them. The Apostles argued against their idol worship and then tried to convince them to believe in Christ by sharing stories about his life and resurrection. So, there wasn’t any argument about who had the right to explain the Scriptures because no one had to follow anyone’s explanation unless they already believed in the laws of their country.

Now, let’s think about the actual conversion and see what made people feel they had to accept it.
