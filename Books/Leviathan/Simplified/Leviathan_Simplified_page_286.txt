God said He will take care of the priests and Levites. This shows that the main center of God’s kingdom, where salvation for non-Jews will come from, is Jerusalem. Jesus also confirmed this when He talked to a woman from Samaria about where people should worship God. He said that the Samaritans worshipped without really knowing what, but the Jews worshipped with understanding, “because salvation comes from the Jews.” This means that God will save people through a Jewish person, not a Samaritan.

The woman replied that they knew the Messiah would come. So when Jesus said, “Salvation is from the Jews,” He meant the same thing Paul said: the gospel has the power to save anyone who believes, “to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.” This means salvation starts with the Jews and then goes to others.

The prophet Joel also talked about the day of judgment, saying God will show amazing signs in the sky and on earth before that day arrives. He said anyone who calls on the Lord will be saved, “for salvation will be in Mount Zion and Jerusalem.” Obadiah said the same thing, that deliverance will come on Mount Zion, and the people of Jacob will get back the lands taken by others. These lands include places like the land of the Philistines and Samaria. After the day of judgment, the kingdom will belong to the Lord.

I have not found any clear Bible verses that say saints will go up to heaven as a place where they live, except that it is called the kingdom of heaven. This might be because God, the King of the Jews, ruled them through commands given to Moses by angels from heaven. After they turned away, God sent His Son from heaven to bring them back to obedience. He will send Him again to rule all faithful people forever from the day of judgment. Also, God’s throne is in heaven, while the earth is like His footstool.
