From this, we can understand that after the resurrection, the chosen people will be restored to the perfect state Adam was in before he sinned. But those who are rejected will stay in the state Adam and his descendants were in after sinning. However, God promised a savior to Adam and to those who trust and repent, not to those who die in their sins like the rejected.

With this in mind, the words about “eternal fire,” “eternal torments,” or “the worm that never dies” don’t go against the idea of a second and final death, which is the real meaning of death. The fire or punishment for the wicked may last forever, and there will always be wicked people to suffer, but not every person will suffer forever.

The wicked, staying in the state they were in after Adam’s sin, may live as they did after the resurrection. They can marry and have children because they have bodies like ours now, which can decay. This means they can keep having children even after the resurrection, just like before. There is nothing in the Bible that says otherwise.

Paul talks about the resurrection as one to eternal life, not to punishment (1 Corinthians 15). He says the body is “sown in corruption, raised in incorruption; sown in dishonor, raised in honor; sown in weakness, raised in power; sown a natural body, raised a spiritual body.” This can’t be said about those who rise to punishment.

Jesus also talks about the kind of life people will have after the resurrection, meaning eternal life, not punishment. In Luke 20:34-36, He says that people in this world marry and are given in marriage, but those who are worthy of the next world and resurrection won’t marry or die anymore. They will be like angels and children of God.

People in this world, who live in the state Adam left them in, will marry and have children, which is a type of immortality but not personal immortality. They won’t be part of those who get the new life after the resurrection. They will only live for a short time in that world to receive the punishment they deserve.
