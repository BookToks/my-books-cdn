If someone wants to learn more, especially about where titles of honor come from, they can find it in Mr. Selden’s great book on the subject. Over time, these honor jobs, often because of problems and to keep peace, changed into just titles. They mostly showed who was more important or had a higher rank in the country. People became dukes, counts, marquises, and barons of places they didn’t actually own or control, and other titles were made for the same reason.

Being worthy is different from how valuable a person is or what they deserve. It means having a special skill or ability for the thing they are called worthy of, which is often called fitness or aptitude.

The person best suited to be a leader, a judge, or have any job is the one with the right qualities to do it well. The person best suited to have money is the one who can use it well. If someone doesn’t have these qualities, they can still be a worthy person and valuable in other ways.

Also, someone can be worthy of money, a job, or a role but still have no right to get it before someone else. That means they don’t necessarily deserve it. To deserve something, you have to have a right to it, like a promise, which I will explain more later when I talk about contracts.

XI: About Different Manners

Here, manners don’t mean small things like how to greet someone, wash your mouth, or pick your teeth around others. I mean the qualities people need to live together peacefully and happily. We should know that happiness in life isn’t just having a calm, satisfied mind. There isn’t one ultimate goal or greatest good like old philosophers said. A person can’t live if their desires completely stop, just like they can’t live if their senses and imagination stop.

Happiness is always moving from wanting one thing to wanting another. Getting one thing is just a step to the next. This happens because people don’t want to enjoy something just once for a moment, but want to keep having things they desire over and over into the future.
