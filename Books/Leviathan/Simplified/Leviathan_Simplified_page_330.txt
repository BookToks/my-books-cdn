A bishop is a word that comes from a Greek word meaning someone who watches over or takes care of something. It especially means a pastor or shepherd. The word was used not only by Jewish shepherds but also by other people to mean a king or leader who guides others, whether by rules or by teaching.

The first Christian bishops were the Apostles, chosen by Jesus himself. For example, Judas’s role as an Apostle was called “his bishoprick.” Later, when Christian churches had elders to help guide the people by teaching and advice, these elders were also called bishops. Timothy was an elder and a bishop at the same time. Back then, bishops were happy to be called elders. Even St. John, a beloved Apostle, started his Second Letter by calling himself “The elder to the chosen lady.” This shows that bishop, pastor, elder, and teacher were all just different names for the same job during the time of the Apostles. There was no force or strict control, only teaching and convincing. The kingdom of God was still coming, so there was no power to force people in the church until the whole country became Christian. That’s why there was no mix-up in authority, even if people had different jobs.

Besides these important church roles—Apostles, bishops, elders, pastors, and teachers—whose job was to share Christ’s message with Jews and others and to guide believers, the New Testament doesn’t mention any other official roles. The words evangelists and prophets don’t mean specific jobs but describe special gifts some people had that helped the Church. Evangelists wrote about Jesus’s life and work, like St. Matthew, St. John, St. Mark, and St. Luke, and maybe others like St. Thomas and St. Barnabas, though their writings aren’t accepted by the Church. Prophets had the gift to explain the Old Testament and sometimes shared special messages from God. But none of these gifts, like speaking different languages, casting out demons, or healing, made someone an official leader. Only being properly chosen for the teaching role made someone an officer in the Church.
