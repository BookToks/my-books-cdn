How can someone be forced to obey others? First, how can a person be sure that someone else really got a message from God if they didn’t get it themselves? It’s basically impossible. People might believe the message because they see miracles, or because the person’s life is very holy, or because they act very wisely or happily. These things show God’s special favor, but they don’t prove the message is true for sure. Miracles are amazing, but what seems amazing to one person might not to another.

People can pretend to be holy, and many good things in life happen naturally, not supernaturally. So, no one can know for sure just by thinking that someone else got a special message from God. They can only choose to believe it more or less, depending on the signs they see.

Now, how can someone be forced to obey these laws? It’s not that hard. If the law doesn’t go against natural law, which is God’s law, and the person agrees to follow it, then they are bound by their own choice to obey. But they aren’t forced to believe it. Belief and thoughts can’t be forced by commands, only by God’s power, whether ordinary or extraordinary. Faith in God’s laws isn’t something we do to prove something to God; it’s a gift God gives to whoever He wants. Not believing doesn’t break God’s laws, but it means rejecting all laws except natural ones.

This will be clearer with examples from the Bible. God made a special promise to Abraham, saying, “This is the agreement between me, you, and your descendants.” Abraham’s descendants didn’t get this message directly and didn’t even exist yet, but they were still part of the promise. They had to obey what Abraham told them because they had to obey their parents. If they don’t answer to any other rulers, parents have full power over their children and servants.

Also, God said to Abraham, “All the people of the earth will be blessed through you, because I know you will tell your children and household to follow God’s ways and be fair.” This shows Abraham’s family had to obey him, even without their own special message, because they were already supposed to obey their leader.
