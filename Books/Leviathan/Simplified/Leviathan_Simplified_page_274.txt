If a clever person learns the secrets that one man usually tells another about his past actions and adventures, it's easy for him to repeat those stories. Many people use this to get a reputation for doing magic tricks. But there are many kinds of these men, called Thaumaturgi by the Greeks, meaning workers of wonders, and they do everything by their own skill. 

However, when people work together to trick others, even the most impossible things can be believed. For example, if two people plan it out—one pretends to be lame and the other pretends to heal him with a magic charm—they can fool many. If more people join in as witnesses, even more will be fooled.

Because people often believe fake miracles too quickly, the best advice comes from God, first given by Moses. Moses said we shouldn’t trust anyone who teaches a different religion than the one he established or anyone whose predictions don’t come true. So, in every age, the leaders of God’s people, like Moses, Aaron, and the head of the Church, should be asked about what teachings are true before believing any so-called miracle or prophet.

After that, we must see the miracle happen and check carefully if it really happened. We also need to see if it’s something no one could do naturally and only God could do. In these cases, we should ask God’s leaders because we trust their judgment more than our own when we are unsure.

For example, if someone says that after saying certain words over a piece of bread, God turned it into a god or a man, but it still looks like bread, no one should believe it or be afraid until they ask God’s representative if it’s true. If the leader says it’s not true, then, as Moses said, that person is lying and should not be feared.
