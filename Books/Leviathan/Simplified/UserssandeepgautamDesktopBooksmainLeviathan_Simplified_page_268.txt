Before the time of the Captivity, most prophets were lying. God told Jeremiah that these prophets were not sent by Him and that they were making up fake visions from their own hearts.

Because of this, God told the people through Jeremiah not to listen to these prophets. He said they were giving false hopes and speaking their own ideas, not God’s words.

Back then, there were fights between different prophets. Some argued and even lied about their messages. We see this in both the Old and New Testaments. So, people had to use their own common sense to figure out which prophets were true and which were false.

In the Old Testament, true prophets taught what Moses had taught and could predict things God would make happen. In the New Testament, the main test was whether a prophet said that Jesus is the promised King, the Messiah.

If a prophet denied that Jesus was the Messiah, they were false, even if they did miracles. If they said Jesus is the Messiah, they were true prophets. Saint John said that anyone who says Jesus came in the flesh is from God.

This doesn’t mean the prophet is always a good person, just that they speak God’s message. Sometimes God talks through people He doesn’t accept, like Balaam or the Witch of Endor.

John also said that anyone who denies Jesus coming in the flesh is not from God and is following the spirit of Antichrist. So, the rule is clear: a true prophet says Jesus has already come, and a false one denies it and waits for a fake Messiah.
