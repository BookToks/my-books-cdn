But the rights and responsibilities of being in charge are the same in both cases.

A leader can’t give their power to someone else without agreeing to it. They can’t lose their power, be blamed by their people, or be punished by them. They decide what is needed for peace, what beliefs are allowed, make laws, and settle arguments. They also decide when to go to war or make peace. They pick important people like judges, advisors, and commanders. They decide rewards, punishments, honors, and ranks. These reasons are the same as those explained earlier for why leaders have these rights.

Being in charge happens in two ways: by birth or by force.

The right to be in charge by birth is like a parent’s power over their children, called paternal power. But this power doesn’t come just because the parent made the child. It comes from the child agreeing, either clearly or in some other way. Since there are always two parents, both should have equal power, but that’s impossible because no one can obey two bosses at once. Some say the father should have power because he is a man, but they are wrong.

Men and women aren’t always different enough in strength or wisdom to decide who should have power without fighting.

In countries with laws, this problem is solved by rules that usually favor the father, because most countries were started by fathers, not mothers. But in a natural state with no marriage or education laws, only nature decides. In this state, parents either agree on who has power over the child or they don’t. If they agree, the power goes according to their agreement.

History shows that the Amazons made deals with nearby men, where male children were sent away, but female children stayed with the mother. So, the mother had power over the daughters.
