They called their own clever ideas “Muses,” their own not knowing things “Fortune,” their own desires “Cupid,” their own anger “Furies,” and their private parts “Priapus.” They blamed bad dreams and dirty thoughts on creatures called incubi and succubae. Basically, anything a poet wanted to include in a story, they turned into a god or a devil.

The same people who made up the religion of the Gentiles noticed that people didn’t understand why things happened. So, they used people’s ignorance to create lots of gods for different reasons. They said Venus was the god of having babies, Apollo was the god of arts, Mercury was the god of cleverness and tricks, Aeolus was the god of storms, and there were many other gods for all kinds of stuff. There were almost as many gods as there were things happening in life.

To worship these gods, people naturally offered gifts, said prayers, and gave thanks. The creators of these religions also made pictures and statues of the gods. This was so that regular people, who didn’t know much, could see the gods and feel more afraid and respectful of them. They gave these gods land, houses, officials, and money that were only for them, making these things special and holy. They also put gods in places like caves, forests, mountains, and islands.

They gave these gods different shapes—some looked like people, some like animals, some like monsters. They gave them human and animal feelings, like being able to sense things, talk, have sex, and make babies. Some gods were even said to be part god and part human, like Bacchus and Hercules. They also gave gods emotions like anger and revenge, and behaviors like lying, stealing, cheating, and other bad things people do. These bad things were seen as showing power or bringing pleasure, even though they were against the rules and honor among humans.
