It’s clear that bigger responsibilities, like leading the Church, are meant to support smaller ones. That’s why Christian kings usually don’t baptize people, and why today, not many baptisms are done by bishops, and even fewer by the Pope.

Now, about laying on hands—whether it’s needed for a king to baptize and bless someone, we can think about it like this.

Laying on hands was a very old tradition among the Jews. It was a public ceremony used to show clearly who or what a prayer, blessing, or other important action was for. For example, Jacob placed his right hand on Ephraim, the younger child, and his left hand on Manasseh, the older one, to show who would get the bigger blessing (even though Joseph made him do it the other way around). Also, when Aaron made offerings, he was told to put his hands on the heads of the animals he was sacrificing. This is mentioned in several parts of the Bible.

Similarly, when Moses chose Joshua to lead the Israelites, he laid his hands on him and gave him his job, making it clear who was in charge during battles. When the Levites were chosen for service, all the Israelites had to put their hands on them. And when someone blasphemed God, everyone who heard it had to lay their hands on that person’s head before the crowd stoned them. This showed exactly who was guilty because it was clearer to point them out by touch than just by name.

This ceremony was so important that when Aaron blessed the whole group at once, and couldn’t lay hands on everyone, he just raised his hand toward them. We also hear about similar customs among non-Jewish people, where priests would lay hands on parts of a temple while blessing it.
