Josephus, a smart Jewish guy who lived when Emperor Domitian ruled, said there are twenty-two books, matching the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet. St. Jerome agreed but counted them differently. Josephus divided them into five books by Moses, thirteen books by prophets who wrote about their own times (we'll see later how this fits with the prophets in the Bible), and four books of songs and moral lessons. St. Jerome, on the other hand, counted five books by Moses, eight by prophets, and nine other holy writings he called Hagiographa. The Septuagint, which was made by seventy Jewish experts hired by King Ptolemy of Egypt to translate the Jewish law from Hebrew to Greek, only included the same books that the Church of England accepts as holy scripture in Greek.

The books of the New Testament are accepted as official by all Christian churches and groups that agree on any official books at all.

We don’t really know who exactly wrote the different books of the Bible because there isn’t enough proof from history, which is the only real way to confirm facts. Reasoning can only help us understand if something makes sense, not prove what actually happened. So, the best guide we have is what the books themselves tell us. Even if they don’t say who wrote every book, they do give clues about when they were written.

First, about the Pentateuch (the first five books), just because they are called the five Books of Moses doesn’t mean Moses wrote them. This is like how the Book of Joshua, the Book of Judges, the Book of Ruth, and the Books of the Kings are named after their subjects, not necessarily their authors. For example, the History of Livy is named after the writer, but the History of Scanderbeg is named after the person it’s about. In the last chapter of Deuteronomy, it talks about Moses’ grave and says, “no one knows where his grave is to this day” (Deuteronomy 34:6). That means this was written after Moses died. It wouldn’t make sense for Moses to talk about his own grave as if it wasn’t found yet while he was still alive.
