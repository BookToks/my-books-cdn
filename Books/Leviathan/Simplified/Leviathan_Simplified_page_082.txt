There are some rights that no one can give up or give away, no matter what words or signs they use.

First, a person can’t give up the right to defend themselves if someone tries to hurt or kill them, because doing that wouldn’t help them at all. The same goes for being hurt, put in chains, or locked up. There’s no good reason to just accept those things, and you can’t always know if someone is trying to seriously hurt you or not. Also, the whole point of giving up rights is to keep yourself safe and alive, so if someone seems to give up that right by words or actions, it usually means they don’t really understand what those words or actions mean.

When people agree to give up some rights to each other, that’s called a contract.

There’s a difference between giving up the right to something and actually giving the thing itself.

Sometimes the thing is given right away when the rights are transferred, like when you buy or trade something. Other times, the thing is given later.

Sometimes one person gives the thing first and the other person promises to do their part later. When this happens, the agreement is called a pact or covenant. Sometimes both people agree to do something later. If someone promises to do something in the future and is trusted to do it, keeping that promise is called faith, and breaking it on purpose is breaking faith.

If the right is given without expecting anything back—maybe to be friends, to be seen as kind, to feel better, or to get a reward in heaven—that’s not a contract. That’s called a gift, free gift, or grace. All these words mean the same thing.

Contracts can be shown clearly or can be understood from what people say or do. Clear signs are words spoken with meaning, like “I give,” “I have given,” or “I will give.” Words about the future, like “I will give,” are called promises.
