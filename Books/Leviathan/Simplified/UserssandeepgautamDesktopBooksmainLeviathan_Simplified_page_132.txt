A man can’t say that the people of Athens wanted the right to banish others, or that an Athenian had the freedom to joke or be fair whenever they wanted.

The freedom people talk about in old stories and writings about the Greeks and Romans isn’t the freedom of individuals, but the freedom of the whole country or state. It’s like the freedom everyone would have if there were no laws or government at all. And the results are the same. Among people with no leader, there is constant fighting, no land or things to pass down to children, no safety, and total freedom for each person. 

In the same way, countries that don’t depend on each other have total freedom to do whatever their leaders think is best. But they live like they’re always ready for war, with weapons and soldiers guarding their borders. The Athenians and Romans were free as countries, not as individuals. Their leaders had the freedom to fight or invade others, not the people to go against their leaders. For example, the city of Luca has the word “Libertas” (freedom) written on its walls, but that doesn’t mean any person there has more freedom or fewer duties than people in other cities.

Whether a country is ruled by one person or by the people, the kind of freedom is the same.

It’s easy for people to get tricked by the fancy word “liberty” and confuse what belongs to the whole public with what belongs to them as individuals. When famous writers support this wrong idea, it can cause rebellions and changes in government. In the West, we learn about how countries work from Aristotle, Cicero, and other Greeks and Romans who lived in popular states. They didn’t get their ideas from nature but from how their own governments worked, just like language rules come from the way people speak at the time or poetry rules come from famous poems.
