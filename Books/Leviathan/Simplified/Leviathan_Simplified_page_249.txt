(I Corinthians 6:3) And II Peter 2:4 says, “God did not spare the angels who sinned but sent them to hell.” Also, Jude 1:6 says, “The angels who left their proper place are kept in chains of darkness until the day of judgment.” This shows that angels are permanent beings and that they have a physical form. 

Jesus said in Matthew 22:30 that after people are raised from the dead, they won’t marry but will be like the angels in heaven. Since people will have a permanent body after resurrection, angels must also have permanent bodies.

There are many other Bible verses that support this idea. If you understand the words “substance” and “incorporeal” (which means “without a body”), you see a problem. Saying an angel is an “incorporeal substance” is like saying they don’t really exist at all. 

At first, I thought angels were just visions or dreams sent by God to show His presence and give messages to people. But the New Testament, especially the words of Jesus, made me believe angels are real, lasting beings with bodies. 

Believing that angels don’t exist anywhere, or that they are “nothing,” which some say when they call them incorporeal, can’t be proved by the Bible.

The meaning of the word “spirit” affects how we understand “inspiration.” If taken literally, inspiration would mean God blew some kind of air or breath into a person like filling a balloon. If spirits aren’t physical but only exist in imagination, inspiration would just be God putting fake images or ideas into people’s minds, which doesn’t make sense. 

So, the Bible uses the word “spirit” as a metaphor. For example, when Genesis 2:7 says God “breathed life” into Adam, it means God gave him life and the ability to breathe, not that God blew a real breath into him. We shouldn’t think God made a living breath first and then put it into Adam, but simply that He gave him life and breath.
