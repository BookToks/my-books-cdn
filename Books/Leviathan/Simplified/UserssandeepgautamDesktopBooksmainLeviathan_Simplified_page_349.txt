God is talking about Abraham himself, not someone hired by him, when He says, “I know that Abraham will tell his children and his family to follow God’s ways and to do what is fair and right” (Genesis 18:19). 

Another example is from Exodus 28:30, where it says, “You must put the Urim and Thummim in the breastplate of judgement.” The Septuagint (an old Greek translation) explains this as meaning “evidence and truth.” This shows that God gave the high priest something like perfect truth or guidance. Whether this means the truth itself or just a reminder for the priest to be fair and clear, it was given to the high priest. The high priest was like the leader under God in Israel’s government, so this supports the idea that civil leaders have authority over their own people, not the Pope. These are the main Bible verses used to say the Pope can never be wrong about faith.

For the Pope’s ability to never be wrong about morals, there is only one verse used, John 16:13, where Jesus says, “When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth.” This is said to mean all truth needed for salvation. But even with this meaning, it only means the Pope is no more perfect than any other Christian who will be saved. If someone makes a mistake about something needed for salvation, they can’t be saved, because those things are the only essentials. I will explain which things these are in the next chapter. Here, I only say that even if the Pope could never teach error, that doesn’t give him the right to control other rulers’ lands. It would be like saying a person must always hire the best worker, even if they promised the job to someone else.

Besides these Bible verses, the argument goes like this: If the Pope could make mistakes about important things, then Christ didn’t properly take care of the Church’s salvation, because He told the Church to listen to the Pope.
