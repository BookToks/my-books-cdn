Every person should think about who the main prophet is; in other words, who God’s representative on earth is, and who has the authority to lead Christians right after God. They should follow the teachings that this person says come from God and use those teachings as a standard to check if other so-called prophets are telling the truth or not. If these other prophets teach something that goes against this standard, people should do like those who came to Moses did when they doubted some prophets in the camp: leave it to the main leader, like Moses, to decide if those prophets are allowed or not. If the leader says no, then people shouldn’t listen to them. But if the leader says yes, they should obey them because God has given those prophets part of the leader’s spirit.

When Christians don’t accept their leader as God’s prophet, they either believe their own ideas and feelings are the true message from God, or they follow some outsider or other people who trick them into rebelling against the government, without any real proof except sometimes lucky success or escaping punishment. This destroys all laws, both God’s and human laws, and causes chaos, violence, and civil war.

Miracles are amazing works of God and are also called wonders. Most of the time, miracles happen as signs to show God’s command clearly, especially when people might doubt what God wants because they rely only on their own thinking. In the Bible, miracles are often called signs because they show or predict what God plans to do.

To understand what a miracle is, we first need to know what kind of things make people amazed. There are only two reasons people wonder at something: one is if it is very unusual or has hardly ever happened before; the other is if it happens in a way that can’t be explained by natural causes but only by God’s direct power.
