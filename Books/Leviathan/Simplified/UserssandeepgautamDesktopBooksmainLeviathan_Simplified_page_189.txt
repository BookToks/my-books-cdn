Crimes that mess up court decisions are worse than those that hurt just one or a few people. For example, taking money to give a false judgment or testimony is a bigger crime than just cheating someone out of money. This is because false judgments hurt not only the person involved but also make all court decisions useless, which can lead to more violence and personal revenge.

Stealing from the public, like robbing the government’s money, is a bigger crime than stealing from a private person because it affects many people at once. Also, pretending to be a public official or faking government stamps or money is worse than faking a private person’s identity or seal because it harms a lot of people.

When crimes happen against private people, the worse crime is the one that most people think causes the biggest damage.

Killing someone illegally is the worst crime, except for taking life away. Killing someone with torture is worse than just killing them. Cutting off a limb is worse than stealing a person’s belongings. Scaring someone with threats of death or injury to steal from them is worse than stealing quietly. Stealing through secret tricks is worse than stealing with someone’s false agreement. Forcing someone into sex is worse than tricking them into it. Forcing a married woman is worse than forcing an unmarried woman.

These things are generally valued this way, even though some people might feel differently. The law cares about what most people think, not just one person’s opinion.

Also, insults or rude gestures that only hurt someone’s feelings and don’t cause real harm are usually ignored by the laws of many old and modern societies. They believe that the pain from insults comes not from the insult itself, but from the weakness of the person who gets offended.

A crime against a private person becomes much worse depending on who, when, and where it happens. For example, killing your own parent is a bigger crime than killing someone else because a parent deserves respect like a ruler, even though they gave up their power to the law.
