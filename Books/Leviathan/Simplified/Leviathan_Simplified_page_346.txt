In the third book, he talks about whether the Pope is the Antichrist. For me, I don’t see any proof that shows he is, at least not in the way the Bible uses the word. I also won’t use the idea of Antichrist to argue against the power the Pope has had in other countries or states.

It’s clear that the Old Testament prophets said a Messiah, or Christ, would come to bring back God’s kingdom. The Jewish people expected this because long ago, when they asked for a king like other nations, they turned away from God’s rule. Because of this, many fakes tried to trick people by pretending to be the Messiah, using fake miracles, acting holy, or giving convincing speeches.

That’s why Jesus and his followers warned people about false prophets and false Christs. False Christs are people who say they are the Christ but really aren’t. They’re called Antichrists in this way, like when there were two Popes, and one called the other a false Pope or Antipope. So, the real meaning of Antichrist has two main parts: one, someone who denies Jesus is the Christ; and two, someone who says they themselves are the Christ.

The first part is explained by St. John in his letter, saying anyone who doesn’t agree that Jesus came in the flesh is not from God and is the spirit of Antichrist. The second part comes from Jesus’ words, warning that many will claim to be Christ, and people should not believe them.

So, an Antichrist is a false Christ—someone who claims to be Christ but isn’t. Because of these two parts—denying Jesus is Christ and saying they are Christ—it means an Antichrist is an enemy of the true Jesus. But among many Antichrists, there is one special one, called the Antichrist, a specific person.

Since the Pope of Rome neither says he is Christ nor denies Jesus as Christ, I don’t see how he can be called the Antichrist. The word doesn’t mean someone who falsely says they are the Pope’s helper or representative, but someone who claims to be Christ himself.

There are also signs about when this special Antichrist will come, like the terrible destroyer called Leviathan mentioned by Daniel in the Bible.
