This is the basic idea behind the power to punish that every government has. People don’t actually give the ruler this power; instead, when they give up some of their own rights, they make the ruler stronger to use his own power as he thinks is best to protect everyone. So, the power to punish isn’t given to him—it’s his alone, except for limits set by natural law. It’s as full as it was when people lived in a state of nature, where everyone was against everyone else.

From the meaning of punishment, I understand a few things. First, private revenge or harm caused by regular people isn’t really punishment, because it doesn’t come from the government.

Second, ignoring someone or not giving them special treatment isn’t punishment either, because it doesn’t add any new harm; it just leaves them as they were before.

Third, harm done by the government without first judging the person guilty isn’t punishment; it’s an attack. Punishment should only happen after the government decides the person broke the law.

Fourth, if someone without official power punishes another, that’s not punishment but an attack. This is because the punishment must come from someone with the right authority.

Fifth, if the harm done doesn’t aim to make the person or others follow the law, it’s not punishment but an attack. Punishment always has the goal of encouraging people to obey the rules.

Sixth, some harmful results happen naturally from certain actions, like someone getting hurt while attacking another or getting sick from doing something wrong. Even if God causes these as a kind of punishment, they aren’t called punishment by people because no human authority is involved.

Seventh, if the harm done is less than the good feeling the person gets from their crime, then it’s not really punishment. Instead, it’s like a price they pay to get away with it. Real punishment should make people want to follow the law, but if the crime feels better than the harm, the punishment doesn’t work and may even make things worse.
