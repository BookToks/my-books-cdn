Ministers of Christ are people whose job is to share God’s word. But deacons have a different job, called “serving tables,” which means they help the church by doing practical things. No one person or even the whole church can say a pastor is only their minister. But the whole church can call a deacon their minister because deacons take care of different tasks like serving food, giving help to Christians, looking after the church building, managing money, or handling other everyday church work.

Deacons serve the church, but sometimes they also preach God’s message and teach about Jesus, each using the talents they have. For example, St. Stephen preached, and Philip both preached and baptized people. Philip, who preached in Samaria and baptized the eunuch, was a deacon, not an apostle. When Philip was preaching, the apostles were in Jerusalem. When they heard Samaria accepted God’s word, Peter and John were sent there. They laid their hands on the new believers to give them the Holy Spirit, which Philip’s baptism alone did not do.

It was important that a minister who teaches God’s word, not just one who serves, was the one to give the Holy Spirit. That’s why Peter and John confirmed the baptism of those Philip had baptized. The Holy Spirit gave believers special signs, like the ability to speak in new languages, heal the sick, or even be protected from poison, as Mark said. Philip couldn’t give these powers, but the apostles could, and they did for all true believers who were baptized by a minister of Christ.

The first deacons weren’t chosen by the apostles themselves but by the whole group of disciples. In Acts 6, we read that when the number of followers grew, the apostles said it wasn’t right for them to stop preaching to serve tables. So they told the people to pick seven honest and wise men filled with the Holy Spirit to take care of this work.
