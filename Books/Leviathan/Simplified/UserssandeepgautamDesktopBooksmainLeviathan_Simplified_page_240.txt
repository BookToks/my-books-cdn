So, if God hasn’t clearly shown someone that certain rules come from Him, or that the people sharing those rules were sent by Him, then that person doesn’t have to follow those rules unless they come from a real law. This means they only have to obey the rules made by the government or ruler, who has the power to make laws.

If the rules aren’t made by the government, then maybe they come from God through someone else, either a private person or a public group. If it’s from a private person, then only the person who God revealed it to has to follow it. Otherwise, if everyone had to follow what random people say God told them, it would be impossible to know what God’s real laws are. Lots of people might just make up stuff, either because they are confused or want power.

If the rules come from a public group, it means the government or the Church. But if the Church is just one person, then it’s like a government with one ruler who leads all Christians. If the Church isn’t just one person, then it doesn’t have real power or authority because only people have the ability to make decisions or act.

If all Christians aren’t part of one government, then there isn’t one Church that has authority over everyone. That means the Bible isn’t made into law by a universal Church. But if there is one government for all Christians, then all Christian kings and states are just parts of it and can be judged or controlled by one ruler of all Christianity.

So, the main question is: are Christian kings and governments fully in charge in their own lands and only answer to God, or are they controlled by one leader of the whole Church, who can judge, remove, or punish them for the good of everyone?

This question can’t be answered without looking more closely at the kingdom of God, which helps us understand who has the right to interpret the Bible.
