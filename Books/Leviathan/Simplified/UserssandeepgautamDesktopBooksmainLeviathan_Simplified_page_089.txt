Justice means keeping promises that are fair and real, but promises only become real when there is a government strong enough to make sure people keep them. That’s also when the idea of owning things properly starts.

Some people, called fools here, say there’s no such thing as justice. They think everyone should just look out for themselves and do whatever they want if it helps them. So, they believe it’s okay to make or break promises if it benefits them. They don’t say promises don’t exist, or that breaking promises isn’t unfair. But they wonder if sometimes breaking promises might make sense if it helps someone avoid punishment or criticism from others.

The kingdom of God is taken by force. But what if it’s taken by unfair force? Is it wrong to get something if no one gets hurt? If it’s not wrong, then it’s not unfair. Otherwise, justice wouldn’t be good. Because of this way of thinking, some bad actions have been called good. Some people don’t like breaking promises except when it helps them take over a kingdom. Even ancient people who believed in gods thought it was okay for one god to take power from another, but still believed that god punished unfairness. This is kind of like a law that says if the rightful king is guilty of treason, the crown still belongs to him. So, some might say if the next king kills the current one, even his own father, it might be unfair, but it’s not against reason because people usually do what helps themselves the most, and those actions are the most reasonable.
