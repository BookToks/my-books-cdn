There is only one kind of government in this life, either of the state or religion, and it is always temporary. No one is allowed to teach any ideas that the leader of both the state and religion says are forbidden. This leader has to be one person; if not, there will be fighting and chaos between the Church and the State, between religious leaders and government leaders, between law and faith, and even inside every Christian person’s heart between their faith and their human side.

Church leaders are called pastors, and so are government rulers. But if pastors don’t follow one main leader, people will learn different and sometimes wrong teachings. The one main leader, according to natural law, is the government ruler. Later chapters will explain how the Bible gives this job to the ruler.

Abraham was the first in God’s kingdom and the father of all believers. God made a special agreement with him, asking Abraham and his family to follow God's commands. These commands were not just the usual moral rules everyone knows, but also special messages God gave Abraham in dreams and visions. The moral laws were already expected of everyone, so the agreement was about following these special commands and passing them on to his family.

In this agreement between God and Abraham, we see three important ideas about how God’s people should be led. First, God only spoke to Abraham when making this promise. Abraham made the deal not just for himself but for his family, and it was expected that he had the right to make his family follow what he promised.
