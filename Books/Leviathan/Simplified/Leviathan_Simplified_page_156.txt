The right of colonies, which keeps their honor and connection with their home country, depends completely on the permission or official letters their ruler gives them to settle there.

 

XXV: About Advice

 

It’s easy to get confused between advice and orders because both can sound like commands. When someone says “do this,” it could be a command, advice, or encouragement, but these are very different things. Most people can tell the difference when they know who is speaking, who they are talking to, and why. But when reading, some people mix up advice and commands because they don’t think about the situation or what the speaker means. To clear this up, I will explain what commands, advice, and encouragement really mean.

 

A command is when someone says “do this” or “don’t do this” and expects you to obey just because they told you to. The person giving the command wants something that benefits themselves, since commands come from their own will.

 

Advice is when someone says “do this” or “don’t do this” and gives reasons based on what will be good for the person receiving the advice. So, the advice-giver only wants what is good for you, even if they have other reasons.

 

The big difference is that commands focus on what benefits the command-giver, while advice focuses on what benefits the person getting the advice. Also, a person must follow commands if they have agreed to obey, but they don’t have to follow advice because it’s their own choice. If they promise to follow advice, then advice becomes like a command.
