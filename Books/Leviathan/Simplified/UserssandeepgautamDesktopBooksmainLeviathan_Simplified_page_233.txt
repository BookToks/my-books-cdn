A smart Jewish historian named Josephus, who lived during Emperor Domitian’s time, said there are twenty-two books in the Bible, matching the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet. St. Jerome agreed but counted them differently. Josephus divided them into five books of Moses, thirteen books by prophets who wrote about their own times, and four books of hymns and moral lessons. St. Jerome counted five books of Moses, eight prophets, and nine other holy writings called Hagiographa. The Septuagint, which was made by seventy Jewish scholars hired by King Ptolemy of Egypt to translate Jewish law from Hebrew to Greek, includes only the books accepted today by the Church of England.

The books of the New Testament are accepted as part of the Bible by all Christian churches and groups that consider any books as official scripture.

We don’t really know for sure who wrote each book of the Bible because there’s no strong proof from history or logical arguments. Logic can only help prove what follows from facts, not the facts themselves. So, the best clue comes from the books themselves. Even though the books don’t always say who wrote them, they do give us some idea about when they were written.

For example, just because the first five books are called the Books of Moses doesn’t mean Moses wrote them. It’s like how books named after Joshua, Judges, Ruth, or Kings don’t necessarily mean those people wrote them. Sometimes book titles show the subject, not the author. For example, “The History of Livy” means Livy wrote it, but “The History of Scanderberg” is named after the subject, not the writer. At the end of Deuteronomy, it talks about Moses’ burial place and says no one knows where it is “to this day” (Deuteronomy 34:6). That means this part was written after Moses died, because it wouldn’t make sense for Moses to talk about his own burial place while he was still alive.
