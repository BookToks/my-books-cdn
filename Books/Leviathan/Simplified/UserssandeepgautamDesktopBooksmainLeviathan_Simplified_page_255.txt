In short, the kingdom of God is like a government. It started with the people of Israel following the laws that Moses gave them on Mount Sinai. Later, the high priest would share those laws with them from a special place in the temple. 

After Israel chose Saul as king, they stopped following this kingdom fully. But the prophets said Christ would bring it back. We pray for this every day when we say, “Thy kingdom come” in the Lord’s Prayer. We also say, “For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever, Amen,” to show we believe in it. The Apostles told people about this kingdom, and teachers help prepare us to accept it. When we accept the Gospel, or promise to follow God’s rules, we join the kingdom of grace. God gives us the chance to be His children and part of His kingdom when Christ comes to judge the world and rule His people. This future kingdom is called the kingdom of glory.

If God’s kingdom wasn’t something He controlled on earth through His representatives, there wouldn’t be so many fights about who really speaks for God. Priests wouldn’t care about spiritual power, and kings wouldn’t try to stop them.

From this idea of God’s kingdom, we also understand what “holy” really means. In God’s kingdom, “holy” is like what people in regular kingdoms call “public” or “belonging to the king.”

The king of any country represents all the people in that country. God, as the king of Israel, was called the Holy One of Israel.

A nation that follows one ruler belongs to that ruler, just like the people of Israel belonged to God. So the Jews were called a holy nation (Exodus 19:6). “Holy” means either God Himself or something that belongs to God. “Public” means something that belongs to the whole community, not just one person.

That’s why the Sabbath (God’s day) is holy, the Temple (God’s house) is holy, and sacrifices, tithes, and offerings (God’s gifts) are holy duties. Priests, prophets, and anointed kings are holy men because they serve God. Angels, who serve God in heaven, are holy angels. Whenever we say something is holy in the right way, it means it belongs to God by agreement or permission.
