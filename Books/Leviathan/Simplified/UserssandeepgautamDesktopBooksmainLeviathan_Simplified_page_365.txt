Peter, or St. Peter, can give authority to the Popes. St. Peter and all other church leaders are told to treat Christians who disobey the Church, meaning those who disobey the Christian ruler, like non-believers or tax collectors. Since people don’t accept the Pope’s authority over non-Christian rulers, they shouldn’t accept his authority over those seen as non-believers.

But from the power to teach, some say the Pope also has power to control kings. They say a pastor must give his followers the right guidance, so the Pope can and should force kings to do their duty. This means the Pope, as the leader of Christians, is king of all kings, and all Christian kings should either admit this or take on the highest church leadership in their own kingdom.

His last argument is based on examples. I say first, examples don’t prove anything; second, the examples he gives don’t even show a good chance of being right. The story of Jehoiada killing Athaliah (2 Kings, 11) either happened with King Joash’s permission or it was a terrible crime by the high priest, who was just a subject after King Saul was chosen. The story of St. Ambrose punishing Emperor Theodosius, if true, was a serious crime. And for Popes Gregory I, Gregory II, Zachary, and Leo III, their decisions don’t count because they judged themselves, and their actions based on this idea are among the worst crimes people can do. Especially Pope Zachary’s actions, which show human weakness. I would have been shorter on church power if these arguments were just personal opinions, but they come from Bellarmine, the main defender of the Pope’s power against all Christian rulers and states.

XLIII: What a Person Needs to Enter Heaven The biggest cause of rebellion and civil war in Christian countries has long come from a problem: how to obey both God and human rulers when their orders conflict. It’s clear that if someone gets two opposite commands and knows one is from God, they should obey God’s command, not the other—even if the other comes from a lawful ruler or their own parent. The problem is that when people are told something is from God, they often don’t know if it really is, or if the person giving the order is just pretending to use God’s name for their own selfish reasons.
