The Second Part Of Commonwealth XVII: Of the Causes, Generation, and Definition of a Commonwealth

People naturally love freedom and power over others. But they also agree to limit themselves and live in groups called Commonwealths. They do this because they want to stay safe and live better lives. Without this, people would be stuck in a terrible state of constant fighting, which happens when there is no strong power to keep them in check or punish those who break the rules.

The laws of nature, like justice, fairness, modesty, mercy, and treating others how we want to be treated, don’t always match our natural feelings. Our feelings often push us to be biased, proud, or want revenge.

Promises or agreements without a strong power to enforce them are just empty words and don’t protect anyone. So, even though people want to follow the laws of nature when it’s safe, if there is no strong power to protect them, everyone will rely on their own strength to defend themselves.

In the past, when people lived in small families, stealing and fighting were common and even respected. The more you stole, the more honor you had. People only followed rules like not being too cruel and leaving others alive and able to farm.

Just like small families did back then, today cities and kingdoms (which are like big families) try to protect themselves by taking over others. They do this because they fear attacks or help for enemies. They use open force or secret plans to hurt their neighbors, which they see as fair and are remembered for with respect later on.
