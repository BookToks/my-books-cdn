The ideas about God’s kingdom are very important and affect how human kingdoms are ruled. Only those with God’s power can decide these things.

The Bible shows that God’s kingdom and eternal life happen on earth. It also talks about God’s enemies and their punishments after judgment, which are also on earth.

The place where people stay after death, before they come back to life, is usually described as being underground. In the Bible, words used for this place mean somewhere people can’t see, like a grave or a deep hole. Some old languages call this place "inferno" or "underworld."

But the exact place for the wicked after judgment is not clearly said in the Bible. It is only described by who is there, like bad men God punished in the past by making them disappear into the earth. For example, some people were swallowed alive by the ground.

The Bible writers don’t mean there is a bottomless hole inside the earth, because the earth is small compared to the sky and stars. The idea of a pit with no bottom comes from old myths, but the Bible wants us to believe that bad people are kept somewhere, without saying exactly where.

Also, before the flood in Noah’s time, there were very powerful people called giants or heroes. The Bible says they were destroyed because they were so wicked. Sometimes, the place of the damned is linked to these giants, as a way to show where bad people go.
