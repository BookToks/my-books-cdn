People’s choices and feelings all aim not just to get a good life, but also to make sure it stays good. The way they do this is different because people have different passions and different ideas about what causes good results.

First, I think everyone always wants more power, and this never stops until they die. This isn’t always because they want more fun or can’t be happy with some power, but because they can’t feel safe or sure about their life without having even more power. That’s why kings, who have the most power, try to protect it with laws at home or wars abroad. After that, some want to be famous for new victories, some want comfort and pleasure, and others want to be admired for their talents or skills.

When people compete for money, respect, control, or other kinds of power, it often leads to fights, hatred, and war because one person tries to beat or get rid of the other.

People compete for praise by respecting old traditions and the past.

Because people fight with others who are alive, not the dead, they often give the dead more credit than they deserve to make others’ fame seem less important.

Wanting comfort and pleasure makes people willing to follow a common ruler because they give up relying only on their own work and instead hope for protection. Fear of death and injury also makes people want the same protection. But poor or tough people, or those who want to be military leaders, like to keep causing wars and trouble because there is no honor in the military without war, and the only way to fix a bad situation is to start a new fight.

Wanting knowledge and peaceful skills makes people want to follow a common ruler, because this desire means they want free time and protection from someone stronger than themselves.

Wanting praise makes people do good things that please those whose opinions matter to them. If we don’t respect someone, we don’t care about their praise. Wanting fame after death makes people act well too. Even though after death we don’t feel praise because joys of heaven or pains of hell are much stronger, this kind of fame isn’t useless. People enjoy thinking about it now and imagine that their family will benefit from it later. Anything that gives pleasure in real life also gives pleasure when we just imagine it.
