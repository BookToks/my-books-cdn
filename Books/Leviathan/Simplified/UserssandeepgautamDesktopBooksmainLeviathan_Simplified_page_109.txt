Thirdly, because most people have agreed on a leader, anyone who disagreed before now has to agree with the rest. This means they have to accept everything the leader decides or else they can be punished by others. If someone joined the group willingly, they showed they agreed to follow what the majority decides. So, if they refuse to accept these decisions or complain about them, they are breaking their promise and acting unfairly. Whether someone is part of the group or not, and whether they were asked or not, they have to accept the leader’s decisions or stay in the state of conflict they were in before, where anyone could harm them without being wrong.

Fourthly, every person in the group is responsible for everything the leader does. This means the leader can’t hurt anyone in the group because the group chose the leader’s actions. If someone complains about being treated unfairly by the leader, they are actually blaming themselves since they agreed to give the leader power. It’s impossible to harm yourself, so even if the leader does something wrong, it’s not really an injustice in the usual sense.

Fifthly, because of this, no leader can be justly killed or punished by the people they lead. Since everyone agreed to the leader’s actions, punishing the leader would be like punishing yourself.

And because this system is meant to keep peace and protect everyone, the person or group in charge has the right to decide how to keep peace and stop problems. They can do whatever they think is necessary to prevent fights inside or attacks from outside, and if peace is lost, to bring it back. 

Sixthly, it’s also the leader’s job to decide which opinions and ideas cause problems and which help peace. They decide who can speak to large groups and who checks what books get published before people read them.
