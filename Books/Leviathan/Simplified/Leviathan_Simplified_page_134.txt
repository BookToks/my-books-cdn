I explained before, in Chapter 14, that agreements where someone promises not to protect their own body are not valid. So, if the ruler tells a person, even if they are rightly punished, to hurt or kill themselves, or not to fight back when attacked, or to avoid food, air, medicine, or anything they need to live, that person still has the right to say no.

If the ruler or their officials question someone about a crime they did, that person doesn’t have to confess unless they are sure they won’t be punished. As I said before, no one can be forced by an agreement to admit to a crime themselves.

Also, when someone agrees to be under the ruler’s power, they are basically saying, “I allow you to do everything.” But this doesn’t mean they give up their natural right to protect themselves. Letting the ruler have power doesn’t mean a person has to hurt or kill themselves when told to. Saying, “You can kill me or my friend if you want” is very different from saying, “I will kill myself or my friend.” So, no one is forced by just agreeing to obey to kill themselves or anyone else.

The real reason a person must follow dangerous or shameful orders depends on the purpose behind the ruler’s power. If refusing to obey stops the ruler from doing their job, then the person must follow the order. If it doesn’t stop the ruler, then the person can refuse.

For example, if a soldier is told to fight, even though the ruler can punish them with death for refusing, the soldier may still say no in some cases, like if they find someone else to take their place. Then the soldier is not abandoning their duty to the country. It’s also normal for people to be scared, not just women (who are not expected to do such dangerous things), but also men who are naturally timid. In battles, sometimes soldiers run away, but if they do it because of fear, not betrayal, they are seen as cowardly, not unfair. So avoiding battle isn’t wrong, just cowardly. But if someone signs up as a soldier or is forced to join, they lose the right to be scared and must fight and not run without permission from their leader. When the country needs everyone who can fight, all must join; otherwise, making the country was pointless because they don’t want or can’t protect it.
