When someone we see as our equal gives us more help than we can ever repay, it makes us pretend to like them, but deep down we secretly hate them. It feels like being a desperate debtor who doesn’t want to face the person they owe money to, wishing they would just disappear. Helping someone creates a kind of debt, and having a debt you can’t pay back feels like being trapped forever, which is really annoying when it’s with someone equal to you. 

But when the person who helps us is clearly better or more important, it makes us want to love them. That kind of debt doesn’t feel like a burden, and being thankful is actually a way to honor the person who helped us, which they usually appreciate.

Also, getting help from someone who is equal or less important than you, as long as you hope to return the favor, makes you want to love them too. You both see it as helping each other, and it creates a friendly competition to see who can do more good. This is a great kind of competition where the winner is happy, and the other person feels good admitting it.

If you hurt someone more than they can forgive or pay back, it makes you hate that person. That’s because you expect either revenge or forgiveness, and both feelings are hard to deal with.

Being scared of being treated unfairly makes people want to find friends or join groups because that’s the only way to keep themselves safe and free.

People who don’t trust their own cleverness often do better in fights or rebellions than those who think they are smart and tricky.

The smart ones like to plan and talk things over, but the others, afraid of being tricked, try to attack first. In fights or rebellions, since people are always ready to fight, sticking together and using all the power you have is a better plan than trying to outsmart others.

People who like to show off and think they are great, even if they aren’t, only want attention but don’t want to actually try anything hard. When real danger or problems come, they hope no one finds out they aren’t as good as they think.
