A good leader of soldiers is really important during war or when war is coming, but not as much during peace. A smart and honest judge is very valuable in peaceful times, but not as much during war. Just like with other things, the buyer, not the seller, decides how much someone is worth.

Most people think highly of themselves, but their real value depends on how others see them.

The way we show how much we value each other is called honoring or dishonoring. To honor someone is to think they’re important; to dishonor someone is to think less of them. Whether it’s high or low depends on how that person sees themselves.

The public value of a person, which society gives, is called dignity. This value is shown by the jobs they have, like being a leader or judge, or by special titles they get.

Asking someone for help shows honor because it means you believe they can help. The harder the help is to get, the more you honor them.

Obeying someone is honoring them because you believe they have power over you. Not obeying is dishonoring.

Giving someone big gifts is honoring because it’s like paying for their protection and recognizing their power. Small gifts are dishonoring because they’re like charity and show you don’t think they can help much.

Working hard to help someone, or even flattering them, is honoring because it means you want their support. Ignoring them is dishonoring.

Letting someone go first or have something before you is honoring because it shows you think they are more powerful. Acting arrogant is dishonoring.

Showing love or fear for someone is honoring because both feelings mean you value them. Ignoring or showing less love or fear than they expect is dishonoring because it means you don’t value them enough.

Praising or calling someone lucky honors them because it shows you think they are good and powerful. Insulting or mocking them dishonors them.

Talking respectfully to someone and acting politely around them honors them because it shows you don’t want to offend them. Speaking rudely or acting carelessly around them dishonors them.
