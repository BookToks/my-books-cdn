The word "prophesy" is explained as meaning dreams and visions. This is how God spoke to Solomon, promising him wisdom, riches, and honor. The Bible says, “And Solomon awoke, and behold it was a dream” (I Kings 3:15). So, in the Old Testament, prophets usually got God’s messages through dreams or visions. These were like special images they saw while sleeping or in a trance. True prophets had supernatural dreams, but false prophets had natural or fake ones.

These prophets were also said to speak by the Spirit. For example, a prophet said, “They made their hearts hard as adamant, so they wouldn’t listen to the law and the words the Lord sent through the Spirit by earlier prophets” (Zechariah 7:12). This shows that speaking by the Spirit wasn’t different from getting visions. Prophets who spoke by the Spirit were special and had to be given a new message or vision for each prophecy.

Some prophets in the Old Testament had a permanent role, and some were more important than others. The most important were Moses and then the high priests, as long as the priesthood was like a royal position. After the Jewish people stopped accepting God as their king, the kings who followed God became the main prophets. The high priests then served more as helpers. When people needed God’s advice, the priests wore special clothes and asked God for guidance as the king told them. They could lose their jobs if the king wanted. For example, King Saul told the priest to bring a burnt offering (I Samuel 13:9), ordered the Ark to come near him (I Samuel 14:18), and later told them to leave it alone because he saw a chance to win against his enemies (I Samuel 14:19). Saul also asked God for advice in the same chapter.

Similarly, King David, even before he became king, asked God if he should fight the Philistines in Keilah (I Samuel 23:2). He told the priest to bring the ephod, a special garment, to ask if he should stay in Keilah or not (I Samuel 23:9). King Solomon took the priesthood from Abiathar and gave it to Zadok (I Kings 2:27, 35). So, Moses, the high priests, and the faithful kings who always asked God for guidance during important times were all considered the top prophets.
