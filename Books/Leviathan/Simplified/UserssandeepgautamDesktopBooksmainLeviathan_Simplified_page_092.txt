Injustice in manners means having the tendency or willingness to do harm, even before actually doing anything, and without harming any specific person yet. But injustice in an action means actually hurting someone, especially the person who made an agreement. Sometimes, one person gets hurt even though the damage affects another. For example, if a master tells his servant to give money to a stranger and the servant doesn’t do it, the master is the one harmed because the servant broke their agreement, but the stranger doesn’t get hurt since the servant had no promise to help them. Similarly, in a country, people can forgive each other’s debts, but they can’t forgive crimes like robbery or violence, because losing a debt only hurts themselves, but robbery hurts the whole community.

If something is done to a person with their own permission clearly shown to the person doing it, it’s not an injury. If the person doing it hasn’t given up their right to act freely by any previous agreement, then there’s no breaking of a promise and no injury. And if the person has given up that right, but still agrees to what is done, then they’ve forgiven the promise, so again, no injury happens.

Writers divide justice in actions into two types: commutative and distributive. They say commutative justice is about exact fairness in numbers, and distributive justice is about fairness based on proportion. Commutative justice is about making sure things traded are equal in value, while distributive justice is about giving fair rewards to people based on what they deserve. For example, it’s unfair to sell something for more than you paid, or to give more to someone than they deserve. The value of things depends on what the buyers and sellers agree on, so fair value is what they both accept. Merit, or what someone deserves, is not something justice requires but is given as a kindness. So, the usual way of explaining this difference isn’t quite correct. To be clear, commutative justice is about keeping promises in deals like buying, selling, renting, lending, borrowing, exchanging, and trading.

Distributive justice is about the fairness decided by a judge or ruler, who decides what is right.
