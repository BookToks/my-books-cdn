In the Jewish Church, there were many false prophets who wanted to be popular by pretending to have dreams and visions. In the Church of Christ, there have always been false teachers who want to be famous by spreading strange and false ideas. They do this to control people and help themselves.

It's sometimes hard to obey both God and the government. But if you can tell what is really needed to enter God’s kingdom, this is not a big problem. If the government’s rules can be followed without losing eternal life, then not obeying is wrong. The Bible says servants should obey their masters, and children should obey their parents. Jesus also said people should listen to their teachers and do what they say. But if obeying the government means you will lose your soul forever, it is crazy to obey. Jesus said, “Don’t be afraid of those who can kill your body but not your soul.” So, people need to learn the difference between what is necessary for eternal life and what is not.

To be saved, you only need two things: faith in Christ and obeying laws. If we were perfect at obeying laws, that would be enough. But since everyone has sinned—not just because of Adam but by our own actions—we need forgiveness for past sins. This forgiveness comes from having faith in Christ. Nothing else is needed to be saved. The kingdom of heaven is closed only to sinners, which means those who disobey the law. But if they repent and believe in the important parts of Christian faith, they can enter.

God wants us to really try to obey Him, and He accepts our effort as if it were perfect. This serious effort to obey is very important and has many names that show how important it is.
