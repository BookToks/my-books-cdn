Ezekiel, Daniel, Haggai, and Zechariah lived during the time when the Jews were taken captive.

We don’t know exactly when Joel and Malachi shared their prophecies.

But from the titles of their books, it’s clear that the Old Testament was put together after the Jews returned from Babylon and before King Ptolemaeus Philadelphus had it translated into Greek by seventy men from Judea. 

If we trust the Apocrypha books, which the Church recommends for learning but not as official Scripture, the Old Testament was arranged by Esdras. In one of his books, he says that God’s law was lost, so no one knew what God had done or planned. He asked God to give him the Holy Spirit so he could write down everything from the beginning, helping people find God’s path and live well in the future. After 40 days, God told him to share the first part openly but keep the last part only for wise people.

This is what we know about when the Old Testament was written.

The New Testament writers lived less than 100 years after Jesus went to Heaven. Most of them saw Jesus or were his followers, except for Paul and Luke. So, their writings are as old as the time of the Apostles.

However, the Church didn’t accept the New Testament books as official right away. Like the Old Testament, which was restored by Esdras, the New Testament books had to be collected and approved by Church leaders before being shared widely. The first list of all these books, both Old and New Testament, is found in the Canons of the Apostles, thought to be put together by Clement the First.
