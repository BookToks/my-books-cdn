It’s not just a small group of people sticking together that keeps them safe. When there are only a few, even a small change in numbers can make one side much stronger and win, which encourages attacks.

The number of people needed to keep us safe isn’t fixed. It depends on how many the enemy has. We feel safe when the enemy isn’t strong enough to clearly win a war or try to attack.

Even if there are a lot of people, if everyone only thinks about what they want or believe is best, they won’t protect each other. When people disagree on how to use their strength, they actually make themselves weaker and can be easily beaten by a small group who agree. Without a common enemy, they might even fight each other for their own reasons. If everyone agreed to follow rules and be fair without a strong leader, then maybe there wouldn’t be a need for any government, because everyone would live in peace.

It’s also not enough for people to work together and agree for just a short time, like during one battle or war. Even if they win together against an enemy, once that enemy is gone or some see the enemy as a friend, they will split up and fight among themselves again.

Some animals, like bees and ants, live together without a leader and still get along, even though they don’t talk or plan like humans do. So, some people wonder why humans can’t do the same.
