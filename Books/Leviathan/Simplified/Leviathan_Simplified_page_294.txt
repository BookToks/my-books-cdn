In Exodus 19:12, God told Moses to warn the people not to come too close to Him or they might break through and see Him. From this, we can understand that whoever leads the Christian community like Moses did is the only true messenger of God and the one who explains His commands.

Because of this, no one should try to interpret the Bible beyond the limits set by their leaders. The Scriptures are like Mount Sinai, and the laws made by those who represent God on earth are the boundaries. It's okay to read and admire the Bible to learn about God and respect Him, but trying to interpret it in a way that challenges the leader God has chosen is crossing a line and being disrespectful.

When Moses was alive, there were no prophets or people claiming to have God’s spirit unless Moses approved them. Only seventy men were said to have the spirit of God, and they were chosen by Moses. God told Moses to pick seventy elders he knew well, and God gave them His spirit. But this spirit was not different from Moses’ spirit; it was the same kind of mind, shared with the elders to help them speak to the people as Moses’ helpers.

They were just helpers, or ministers, and when two of them started prophesying in the camp, it was seen as something new and wrong. Joshua even told Moses to stop them, not knowing that they were speaking with Moses’ spirit. This shows that no one should claim to be a prophet or have God’s spirit if it goes against the teachings of the leader God has chosen.

After Aaron and Moses died, the kingdom, which was a priestly kingdom, passed to Aaron’s son, Eleazar, who became the high priest. God made him the leader under Himself and also appointed Joshua as the army general.
