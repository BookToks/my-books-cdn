The Gentiles worshipped gods like Jupiter and others who were once humans that had done great and famous things. They also thought some men and women were children of God, somewhere between a god and a normal person. This was idolatry because they made these beliefs up themselves, without any permission from God, His laws, or His revealed will.

Even though we believe Jesus was a man and also God’s Son, this isn’t idolatry. That’s because our belief is based on God’s word in the Bible, not just our own ideas. When we worship the Eucharist, if Jesus really meant “This is my body” to mean that the bread becomes His actual body, then it’s not idolatry. This is because Jesus Himself said it. But if that’s not what He meant, then worshipping the bread is just a human-made practice and would be idolatry. Saying God can change the bread into His body isn’t enough proof, because the Gentiles also believed their idols could become gods by God’s power.

Some people say divine inspiration is when the Holy Spirit enters a person supernaturally, not just when someone learns and studies God’s teachings. I think this is risky. If they don’t worship the inspired people, they might be disrespecting God’s presence. But if they do worship those people, it’s idolatry because the Apostles never allowed themselves to be worshipped. The safest way to understand it is that the Holy Spirit coming down on the Apostles was a sign from God to help them study, teach, and live in a way that helps others, not to make them gods.
