There is no other government in life, either for the state or religion, except the one that deals with everyday, real-world matters. Also, no one can teach any ideas that the leader of both the state and religion says are not allowed. 

This leader has to be just one person. If there isn’t one leader, there will be fights and even civil war between the Church and the government, between religious people and everyday rulers, between justice and faith, and even inside each Christian between their beliefs and their actions.

Church teachers are called pastors, and rulers of the state are also like pastors. But if these pastors don’t follow one main leader, people will learn different, conflicting ideas, and some of those ideas must be wrong. The main leader, according to natural law, is the civil ruler. The Bible also shows that this leader has this job, and we will learn more about this in the next chapters.

Abraham was the first important person in God’s kingdom because God made a special promise with him. In this promise, Abraham and his family agreed to listen to and obey God’s commands. These commands were not just the basic moral rules that everyone could understand, but also special messages God gave to Abraham through dreams and visions. The promise didn’t add any new rules about obeying God because everyone already had to do that naturally. Instead, the promise meant Abraham had to accept and pass on God’s special commands to his family.

From this promise between God and Abraham, we learn three important things about how God’s people should be led. First, when God made this promise, He only spoke to Abraham. So, the promise didn’t directly involve Abraham’s family unless Abraham agreed for them. Abraham was expected to have the right power to make his family follow what he promised to God.
