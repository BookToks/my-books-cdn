In every Christian country, the main leader, called the civil sovereign, is like the top pastor in charge of all the people. This means that all other pastors get their power to teach and lead from this leader. These pastors are like helpers for the main leader, just like town officials, judges, and army commanders all work under the top ruler of the country.

This is because the people who listen to the pastors are the leader’s subjects. Even if a Christian king lets another king or the Pope choose pastors, that doesn’t mean the other king or Pope is in charge of him or his people. The king still has the main power because people obey him, not the teachers. Teachers can be ambitious or make mistakes, just like anyone else.

So, if someone from another place is allowed to pick teachers, it’s only because the main leader in that country allowed it. Christian teachers help people learn about Christianity, but kings are like parents who take care of their people. They can accept teachers recommended by others, but not because someone else orders them to. If a teacher is not good for the people, the leader can stop them from teaching to protect everyone.

If someone asks a pastor, “By what right do you do your job?” the pastor must say it’s because the country’s leader or government gave them that right. All pastors, except the top one, work with the permission of the civil leader, which is called civil authority.
