The first Apostle chosen after Jesus was no longer on earth was Matthias. About 120 Christians met together in Jerusalem. They picked two men, Joseph the Just and Matthias, and then used lots (like drawing straws) to decide. The lot fell on Matthias, so he became an Apostle. This shows that the group of Christians chose Matthias, not Peter or the other eleven Apostles.

After Matthias, no one else was made an Apostle except Paul and Barnabas. This happened in the church in Antioch. There were some prophets and teachers there, including Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, and Saul (Paul). While they were praying and fasting, the Holy Spirit told them to separate Barnabas and Saul for the work God had planned for them.

After more fasting and praying, the church laid hands on Barnabas and Saul and sent them out. This shows that even though the Holy Spirit called them, the church made their mission official. Paul and Barnabas are called Apostles, and Paul even calls himself an Apostle chosen for the gospel of God.

Since an Apostle’s job was to witness Jesus’ resurrection, some might wonder how Paul could do this since he never met Jesus before Jesus died. The answer is that Jesus appeared to Paul on the way to Damascus after He had risen and gone to heaven. Jesus chose Paul to be a messenger to the Gentiles, kings, and Israel. Since Paul saw Jesus after He rose, he could truly be a witness. Barnabas was a follower of Jesus before He died.

So, it’s clear that Paul and Barnabas were Apostles too, but they were chosen and sent by the church in Antioch, just like Matthias was chosen by the church in Jerusalem.
