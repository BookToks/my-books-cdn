If all the rules Paul gives Timothy are laws, then why isn’t this rule also a law: “Don’t just drink water, but have a little wine for your health”? And why aren’t all the advice from good doctors considered laws? It’s not the way they speak that makes their advice laws, but how much authority the person giving the advice has.

Similarly, in 1 Timothy 5:19, the rule “Don’t accept an accusation against an elder without two or three witnesses” is smart advice, but it’s not a law.

In Luke 10:16, it says, “Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me.” It’s clear that rejecting the advice of those sent by Christ is the same as rejecting Christ’s advice. But who are the ones sent by Christ now? They are pastors chosen by the right authority. And who chooses those pastors? The top pastor or ruler. So, in a Christian country, listening to the Christian leader is like listening to Christ. Ignoring what the Christian king says is like ignoring Christ’s teachings. But this doesn’t mean it’s a law. Also, just because a Christian king teaches something, it doesn’t make his teachings laws.

A king can’t make people believe something, even if he makes laws based on his beliefs. These laws can make people do certain things they might not want to do, and maybe shouldn’t be forced to do. But when they follow these laws, it’s the king’s actions, not truly their own, because God says they must obey the king.

The last example is where the Apostle uses words that sound like commands when giving advice, or calls following his advice “obedience.” For example, in 1 Corinthians 11:2, Paul says, “I praise you for following the teachings I gave you.” The original Greek means “following the things I gave you,” which just means good advice, not laws. In 1 Thessalonians 4:2, it says, “You know the commands we gave you,” but the Greek word here means “what we told you,” which again shows these are just teachings, not laws.

If someone ignores this advice, they aren’t rejecting humans, but God. Jesus didn’t come to be a king on earth or force people to follow him. Instead, he sacrificed himself for sinners and left teachers in the Church to guide people. These teachers are there to lead, not force people to believe, because true faith comes from the heart, not from laws or rules.
