If a king gives up his power for himself and his family, then his people go back to being free like in nature. Even though nature can show who his children or closest relatives are, it’s up to the king to decide who will be his heir. If he doesn’t want an heir, then there is no king or rule over the people. The same happens if he dies without any known family or without naming an heir. Then, no one can be the heir, so no one has to obey anyone.

If the king sends someone away from the kingdom, that person is not under his rule while they are banished. But if someone is sent on a mission or allowed to travel, they still have to follow the king’s rules. This is because of an agreement between kings, not because of their usual rule. Anyone who goes into another king’s land has to follow that land’s laws, unless they have a special permission.

If a king loses a war and agrees to be under the winner’s power, then his people stop following him and start obeying the winner. But if the king is a prisoner or can’t move freely, it doesn’t mean he gave up his power. In that case, his people still obey the leaders he chose before, who govern for him. Since the king still has the right to rule, the only question is about the leaders running things. If he can’t choose new leaders, it’s assumed he agrees with the ones he picked before.

Chapter 22: About Groups in Politics and Private Life

After talking about how a country is formed and its power, I will now talk about its parts. First, about groups that are like the muscles in a body. By groups, I mean any number of people joined for the same goal or task. Some groups are organized, and some are not. Organized groups have one person or a group chosen to represent everyone. All others are unorganized.

Among organized groups, some are fully independent and only answer to their own leader. These are only countries, which I have already talked about in the last five chapters. Others depend on a higher power, meaning they follow a bigger ruler, and so do their leaders.
