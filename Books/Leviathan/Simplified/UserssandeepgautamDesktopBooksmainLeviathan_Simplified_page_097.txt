Even though this idea about the laws of nature might seem too subtle for most people to notice, since many are busy just trying to get food and others don’t care enough to understand, it’s actually made very simple for everyone to get. It can be summed up like this: Don’t do to others what you wouldn’t want done to yourself. This means that when you think about how other people act, if their actions seem unfair or too harsh, imagine switching places with them and see if your own actions feel the same. This way, you can keep your feelings and selfishness from affecting your judgment, and then all the laws of nature will seem very fair.

The laws of nature mainly affect what we want inside our minds; they push us to wish things would happen a certain way. But they don’t always force us to act that way outside, because sometimes being too honest or kind when no one else is can just make you a target and cause you trouble. Also, if you know that others will follow these laws but you don’t, you’re not trying for peace—you’re starting a fight that could lead to your own harm.

These laws can be broken not just by doing something wrong, but also by doing something right if you don’t really mean it. For example, if your action follows the law but your heart is against it, you’re still breaking the law inside your mind.

The laws of nature never change and last forever. Things like being unfair, ungrateful, arrogant, proud, or biased are never okay. It just doesn’t make sense that war would save life but peace would destroy it.

Because these laws only ask us to want and try to follow them honestly and constantly, they’re actually pretty easy to follow.

If you try your best to follow these laws, then you are following them fully, and that makes you just and fair.

Understanding these laws is the real meaning of moral philosophy. Moral philosophy is just the study of what is good and bad in how people live and act together. What’s good or bad depends on what people like or dislike, which can change depending on their feelings, customs, or beliefs. People don’t just disagree about what feels nice or nasty to their senses, but also about what seems reasonable or not in everyday actions.
