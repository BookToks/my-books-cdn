Proud, show-off guys who think they’re enough just because others praise them or because they’ve done something good before, but don’t really understand themselves, tend to jump into things without thinking. When danger or trouble comes, they try to run away if they can. They don’t see a safe way out, so they’d rather risk their reputation, which can be fixed with an excuse, than their life, which can’t be saved.

People who think they’re really smart about running things want power. Without a job in government or leadership, their smartness doesn’t get noticed. That’s why good speakers often want power; talking well looks like being smart to them and others.

Being scared or weak-minded makes people unable to decide and miss the right chance to act. If after thinking for a long time, it’s still not clear what to do when it’s time to act, it means the choices aren’t very different. Not choosing then is just wasting time over small things, which shows weakness.

Saving money is good for poor people, but it makes it hard to do big actions needing many people’s help. That’s because rewards keep people motivated and strong.

Talking nicely with flattery makes people trust those who do it. Speaking well looks smart, and flattery seems friendly.

If someone also has a good military reputation, people follow and obey them. The smart talk warns against danger from that person, and the military fame warns against danger from others.

Not knowing science or causes makes people depend on others’ advice and authority. If you care about the truth but don’t trust yourself, you have to trust someone you think is smarter and believe they won’t lie.

Not understanding words means not understanding things. This makes people believe not only the truth they don’t know but also mistakes and even nonsense from those they trust. You can’t spot mistakes or nonsense without fully understanding words.

Because of this, people give different names to the same thing based on their feelings. For example, those who like a private opinion call it an opinion, but those who don’t like it call it heresy. Yet heresy just means a private opinion with more anger behind it.
