In the book of Exodus, God tells Moses to warn the people not to come too close to Him or they might look at Him in a way they shouldn’t. From this, we can understand that whoever takes Moses’ place in a Christian community is the only true messenger of God and the only one who can explain His rules.

Because of this, no one should try to explain the Bible beyond what their leader allows. The Bible is like Mount Sinai, and its limits are set by those who represent God on Earth. It’s okay to read the Bible, see God’s amazing works, and learn to respect Him. But trying to interpret it on your own and judge whether the leader is doing God’s will is crossing a line and being disrespectful.

When Moses was alive, there were no prophets or people claiming to have God’s spirit unless Moses approved them. Only seventy men were said to prophesy through God’s spirit, and all were chosen by Moses. God told Moses to pick seventy elders who were leaders among the people. God gave them His spirit, but it wasn’t a different spirit from Moses’ own. It’s said that God took some of Moses’ spirit and gave it to these elders.

Here, spirit means the mind. This means God gave these elders a mind that agreed with Moses’ so they could speak to the people on God’s behalf, supporting Moses’ teachings. They were only helpers, and when two of them prophesied in the camp, it was seen as strange and wrong. Joshua told Moses to stop them because he didn’t realize they were using Moses’ spirit. This shows that no one should claim to speak for God if it goes against the teachings of the person God has put in Moses’ place.

After Aaron and Moses died, the kingdom, which was a religious kingdom, passed to Aaron’s son, Eleazar, the high priest. God made Eleazar the leader under Himself and appointed Joshua as the army’s general.
