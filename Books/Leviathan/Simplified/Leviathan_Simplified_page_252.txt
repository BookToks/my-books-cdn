Even though God isn’t called King yet, and Abraham and his family aren’t called a kingdom yet, it’s still the same idea. God has a special relationship with Abraham’s family. When Moses made the same agreement with the people at Mount Sinai, God called the Jews His special kingdom. St. Paul says Abraham is the father of those who believe and stay loyal to God, first by circumcision, and later by baptism in the New Covenant.

At Mount Sinai, Moses told the people that if they obey God and keep His agreement, they will be a special people to Him because the whole earth belongs to God. God said they would be like a royal priesthood and a holy nation. Different translations call them a “special treasure” or “the most precious jewel” among all nations, but the best meaning is that they are an extraordinary people chosen by God.

St. Paul also said Jesus gave Himself to make us a special people for God. The word used means something extra special, not ordinary. God explained this by saying, “The whole earth belongs to me, but you belong to me in a special way.” This means God owns all nations because He is powerful, but the people He chose belong to Him because they agreed to be His.

God also said, “You will be a royal priesthood and a holy nation,” showing again that His people have a special, important role.
