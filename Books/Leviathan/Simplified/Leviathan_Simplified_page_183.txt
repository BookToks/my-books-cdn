Usually, proud people who aren’t too scared get angry easily because they often see normal talk as disrespect. Anger can cause almost any kind of crime.

Feelings like hate, desire, ambition, and greed often lead to crimes. Everyone knows this from experience. These feelings are part of human nature and all animals, so stopping them needs strong thinking or strict punishment.

When people hate something, they feel bothered all the time. So, either they have to be very patient forever, or they have to stop whatever is bothering them. Being patient is hard, and stopping the problem often means breaking the law. Ambition and greed are always there, but reason isn’t always strong enough to stop them. So, when people think they won’t get caught, they do bad things. Desire (lust) might not last long, but it’s very strong and can make people ignore the chance of punishment.

Out of all feelings, fear stops people the most from breaking rules. Except for some brave people, fear is usually the only reason people follow laws when breaking them seems fun or rewarding. Still, sometimes people commit crimes because they are afraid.

Not all fears make bad actions okay. Only fear of real physical harm, where someone thinks the only way to stay safe is by acting, can justify it. For example, if someone attacks you and you think you’ll die unless you hurt them first, then hurting them isn’t a crime. This is because no one gave up the right to protect themselves when society was made. But if you kill someone just because you think they might hurt you later, and you have time to ask for help from the law, that’s a crime. Also, if someone insults you or hurts you a little, and the law doesn’t punish that, but you get scared and break the law to get revenge so you won’t be disrespected again, that’s also breaking the law.
