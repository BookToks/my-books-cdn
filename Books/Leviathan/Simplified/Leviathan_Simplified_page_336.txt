The pastors of the Church are supposed to be supported by the people they serve. This idea comes from the Bible, where those who preach the gospel should live from it. But pastors don’t get to decide how much or what kind of support they get. Instead, it depends on the kindness and generosity of each person or the whole group.

Back then, the church didn’t have laws to decide this. So, pastors lived on what people gave them. They couldn’t demand more than what was offered because they had no courts or power to enforce it. Only when kings or rulers made laws about it could there be a set amount for pastors.

The old rules about tithes from Moses’ time don’t apply to Christian pastors because Moses and the priests were also rulers of the people. But Jesus’ kingdom is not a normal kingdom yet, so those old laws don’t fit.

So far, we’ve learned what pastors are supposed to do: preach, teach, baptize, lead their churches, and discipline members if needed. The church members chose the pastors. Pastors blessed and helped each other. They earned money only from their own work and gifts from thankful Christians. Now, we will think about what role kings or rulers who believe in Christianity have in the Church.
