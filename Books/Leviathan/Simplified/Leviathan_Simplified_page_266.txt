When the spirit came on them, they started to prophesy and didn’t stop. This shows two things. First, their prophesying was connected to Moses’ prophesying. God took some of Moses’ spirit and put it on them, so they prophesied like Moses wanted. If not, they wouldn’t have been allowed to prophesy at all. People even complained to Moses about them, and Joshua wanted Moses to stop them, but Moses said, “Don’t be jealous of me.”

Second, the Spirit of God here means having the right attitude and willingness to help Moses lead the people. It doesn’t mean they had God’s divine spirit like Jesus did. Instead, it means they had God’s gift and grace that helped them work with Moses. These men were chosen by Moses to be leaders and judges over the people because they respected God. Moses picked seventy such men, following advice from his father-in-law Jethro, to help him govern. When God’s spirit came on David, it meant God gave him the ability and desire to lead, while taking it away from Saul. So, the spirit means being ready and willing to serve God, not getting special supernatural messages.

God also spoke through casting lots, which were used by leaders He put in charge. For example, Saul used lots to find out that Jonathan broke a rule by eating honey, which went against the people’s oath. God also used lots to divide the land of Canaan among the Israelites when Joshua cast lots before the Lord at Shiloh. In the same way, it seems God revealed Achan’s crime through this method.
