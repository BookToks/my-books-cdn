So, when a king is chosen, he has total power.

Next, if a king’s power is limited, he isn’t above the people or groups that limit him. If he isn’t above them, then he isn’t the highest ruler, meaning he isn’t truly a king. So, the real power is with the group that can limit the king. This means the government isn’t a monarchy, but a democracy or aristocracy, like in ancient Sparta. There, kings could only lead the army, but the real power was with the Ephori.

Also, before, the Roman people ruled Judea through a president. But Judea wasn’t a democracy because its people couldn’t join the government. It wasn’t an aristocracy either because no one could be elected from Judea. They were ruled by one person. Even though Rome’s government was a democracy, Judea was ruled like a monarchy. This kind of monarchy isn’t one person ruling another person, but one group ruling another group.

Because governments and rulers don’t live forever, there needs to be a way to keep peace after they die. Just like an artificial person needs rules, so does the government to last forever. Without this, people would go back to fighting every time a ruler or group dies. This idea of lasting rule is what people call the right of succession.

No government is perfect if the current ruler doesn’t decide who comes next. If someone else decides, that person is below the ruler and the ruler can take the right back anytime. If no one decides and a new leader is chosen each time, the government breaks down. Then, whoever can take power wins, which goes against the goal of those who made the government to keep peace forever.
