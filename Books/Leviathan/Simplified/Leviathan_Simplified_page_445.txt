To finish, I don’t see anything in all that I have written, or in my earlier work on this topic in Latin, that goes against God’s word, good behavior, or public peace. So, I believe it can be printed and taught in universities if they agree. Since universities are the source of moral and civil teachings, and preachers and leaders learn from them and share their knowledge with others, it’s important to keep these teachings clean and free from harmful ideas or lies.

If this is done, most people will understand their responsibilities better and won’t be easily tricked by a few unhappy people trying to cause trouble. They will also be less upset about paying for what’s needed to keep peace and defense. The leaders will then have less reason to keep a bigger army than necessary to protect the country from foreign threats.

I have now finished my talk about government, both civil and church-related, which I wrote because of the problems happening now. I did this without bias or hidden motives, just to show how protection and obedience depend on each other. Human nature and both natural and divine laws require this to be strictly followed. Even though it’s hard for ideas like these to be accepted during times of change, I don’t think my work will be rejected by those who care about peace.

With this hope, I will go back to my other study about natural bodies. If I’m healthy enough to finish it, I hope people will like the new ideas as much as they were offended by the ideas in this work. Because the truth that doesn’t harm anyone’s benefit or happiness is welcome to all.

The End
