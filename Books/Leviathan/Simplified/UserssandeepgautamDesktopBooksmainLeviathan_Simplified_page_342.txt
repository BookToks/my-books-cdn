Before Christianity, every ruler already had the power to teach and choose teachers. So, Christianity didn’t give them any new rights; it just guided them on how to teach the truth. Because of this, they didn’t need a special ceremony (other than baptism) to allow them to do things like baptize or bless people.

In the Old Testament, only priests could bless things when the high priest was the ruler. But when the king was in charge, it was different. For example, King Solomon blessed the people, dedicated the Temple, and led public prayers (I Kings, 8). This is the way Christian churches still do these ceremonies today. This shows that Solomon had both the right to lead in church matters and to perform church duties.

Since Christian rulers combined both political and church power, it’s clear they have all the power they need to govern their people’s actions, both in government and religion. They can make any laws they think are best to rule their people as both the government and the church are made up of the same people.

If they want, Christian kings can let the Pope handle religious matters for their people. But in that case, the Pope works under the king’s authority, following the king’s civil laws, not God’s direct laws. So, the king can remove the Pope’s power if he thinks it’s best for his people. Kings can also give religious control to one main pastor or a group of pastors, deciding how much power each has and what titles they get, like bishops or priests. They can make laws to support these church leaders, like collecting tithes, as long as they do it honestly and God judges their conscience.

It’s the king who chooses the judges and interpreters of church laws because he makes those laws. The king also enforces punishments like excommunication, which help keep people from breaking church rules and bring them back to the church community.
