Some people are chosen to be in charge of running things. For example, a group of men might be in charge of a province, and they make decisions by voting. This group is called a body politic, and their power is limited by what they are allowed to do.

A province means a place or area that someone is responsible for. When a big country has different areas with their own laws or far away from the main city, different people are put in charge of those areas. These areas are called provinces because the main ruler doesn’t live there but controls them through others.

It’s rare for a province to be run by a group of people living there. The Romans controlled many provinces, but they always put one person, like a president or governor, in charge instead of a group. Similarly, when England sent people to start colonies in places like Virginia, the government was run by assemblies in England, not by local groups in the colonies. Instead, each colony had one governor.

Even though people like to be part of making decisions when they are nearby, when they are far away, they prefer to have one leader rather than a group. This is also true for rich people who don’t want to manage everything themselves, so they trust one helper instead of many friends or workers.

But let’s say a province is run by a group. In that case, any debt or illegal action is only the fault of the people who agreed to it, not those who disagreed or weren’t there. Also, a group that controls a colony from far away can’t force people in the colony to pay debts or obey rules outside the colony, because they have no power there. They have to follow the local laws.

And although the group can punish their own members who break the rules while in the colony, they can’t do this outside the colony.
