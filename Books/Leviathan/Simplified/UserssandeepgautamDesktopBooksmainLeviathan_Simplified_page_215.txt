When leaders and teachers cause trouble, punishing them helps everyone learn from their mistakes. Punishing poor people who were tricked doesn’t help the community. Being harsh on people is actually punishing their lack of knowledge, which is often the ruler’s fault because they didn’t teach them well.

Similarly, it’s the ruler’s job to give rewards in a way that benefits the whole community. Rewards should be given to those who serve the community well, using as little public money as possible. This way, others will be motivated to work hard and improve their skills to help even more. Giving money or favors to popular but ambitious people just to keep them quiet isn’t a real reward. It shows fear, not thanks, and harms the community instead of helping it. It’s like fighting a monster that grows more heads every time you cut one off. When one troublemaker is bought off, many more appear, hoping for the same reward. Bad behavior spreads when it’s rewarded. Sometimes this might delay a civil war, but it makes the danger worse in the long run. So, the ruler must not reward those who cause problems but stop them early, even if it’s a little risky, to avoid bigger problems later.

Another important job of the ruler is to pick good advisors—people who give advice about running the community. “Counsel” means groups of people who meet to decide what to do or judge past events and laws. Here, it means the first kind: giving advice about what to do next. In democracies or aristocracies, you don’t really choose advisors because the advisors are part of the group making decisions. But in a monarchy, the ruler must choose the best advisors. If the ruler doesn’t pick the most capable people, they are not doing their job properly.
