Second, if the decisions made by church councils were actually laws, then disobeying them would be a sin. But the Bible doesn’t say that people who didn’t accept Christ’s teachings sinned just because of that. It says they died in their sins, meaning their past sins weren’t forgiven. Those sins were against natural laws and the laws of the country, which every Christian agreed to follow. So, the rules the Apostles gave to new believers were not laws but conditions for those who wanted to be saved. People could choose to accept or reject them without committing a new sin, though they risked being separated from God because of their past sins. St. John says that God’s anger stays on unbelievers, not that it will come upon them later; they are already condemned because of their unbelief. The benefit of faith is that it removes sins, and the harm of not believing is that sins stay with you.

Some might ask, why did the Apostles and church leaders meet to decide what to teach if no one had to follow their decisions? The answer is that the Apostles and leaders who made these decisions promised to teach what they agreed on, as long as it didn’t go against existing laws they had to obey. But other Christians were not required to follow those teachings unless they were also laws made by civil authorities. The Apostles could decide what they would teach, but they couldn’t decide what everyone else had to do unless they had legal power, which only governments have. Even though God rules everything, we don’t have to accept every rule said to come from Him, especially if it goes against the laws of the country that we are told to obey.

Since the Apostles’ council decisions were advice, not laws, the decisions of any later church leaders or councils without government approval aren’t laws either. Therefore, even though the New Testament is the best guide for Christian beliefs, it can only become law if kings or governments make it so.
