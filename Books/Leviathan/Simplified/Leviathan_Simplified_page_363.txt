But to show that Christians should not accept kings who don’t believe or who have wrong beliefs, he uses a part of Deuteronomy where God tells the Jews not to pick a foreigner as their king. From this, he says it’s wrong for Christians to choose a king who is not a Christian. It’s true that a Christian—someone who has promised to follow Jesus as their king—would risk their faith by choosing a king who might force them to go against their beliefs.

He also says it’s just as risky to have a king who isn’t a Christian and not remove him from power. But I say the real question isn’t about the danger of not removing him, but whether it’s right to remove him. Sometimes choosing such a king might be wrong, but removing him after he’s chosen is never right. Doing so breaks a promise and goes against natural law, which is God’s eternal law. We don’t see this idea accepted as Christian back when the Apostles lived or during the Roman Emperors’ time—only after the popes gained political power in Rome. He answers that early Christians didn’t remove bad rulers like Nero or Diocletian because they didn’t have the power.

Maybe that’s true. But Jesus, who could have called on twelve legions of angels to help him, didn’t try to remove Caesar or Pilate, even though Pilate unfairly handed him over to be crucified. And if the Apostles didn’t have the power to remove Nero, they still told new Christians to obey their rulers, including Nero, not just to avoid punishment but because it was the right thing to do. Should we say they obeyed and taught this only because they were weak? No, it’s not about weakness but about conscience that Christians accept their rulers, even if those rulers don’t believe or teach wrong ideas. Also, about the Pope’s political power, he claims St. Paul made judges who weren’t chosen by those rulers. That’s not true. St. Paul just told Christians to settle their disputes by using other Christians as arbitrators instead of going to pagan judges, which is good advice full of kindness and still useful in Christian communities today.
