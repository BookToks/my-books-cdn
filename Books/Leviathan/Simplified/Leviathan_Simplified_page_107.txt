A commonwealth is created when a bunch of people agree and promise each other that whoever gets chosen by most of them will represent all of them. Everyone, whether they voted for that person or not, agrees to accept everything that person or group does and decides, as if it were their own choice. This is done so they can live peacefully together and be safe from others.

From this agreement, all the rights and powers of the leader or leaders come from the people’s permission.

First, when people make this promise, it means they don’t have to follow any old promises that go against this one. Also, once they have chosen a leader, they can’t make a new promise to obey someone else without the leader’s okay. So, people who are ruled by a king can’t just stop being ruled by him and go back to chaos. They also can’t switch to another leader without permission. Everyone is stuck with the leader they chose and must accept what the leader decides. If one person disagrees, it would break the promise everyone made, which is unfair.

If people try to get rid of their leader, they are taking away what belongs to him, which is also unfair. If someone tries to remove the leader and gets punished or even killed by the leader, they brought that on themselves because they agreed to follow the leader’s decisions. It’s wrong for someone to do something that will make them get punished by the leader.

Some people say they don’t have to obey the leader because they made a new promise with God, not humans. But this is wrong because promises with God must be made through someone who represents God, and that is the leader chosen by the people. Saying they made a promise with God instead of the leader is a lie, and even those people know it deep down. This lie shows they are not just wrong but also cowardly and dishonorable.
