They say that things like the shape, color, and taste of bread exist even where there is no bread. In the same way, they say that faith, wisdom, and other good qualities can be put into a person or blown into them from heaven. They think these qualities can be separated from the person who has them. This idea causes people to depend less on the laws and rulers of their country.

Who would try to obey the laws if they think obedience just magically happens inside them? Or who wouldn’t follow a priest who can supposedly make God, not the king, or even God Himself, more important? And if someone is scared of ghosts, they will definitely respect those who can make holy water to drive the ghosts away. This is just one example of wrong ideas that came into the Church from Aristotle’s teachings. Maybe Aristotle knew these ideas were false, but he wrote them to support religion and avoid a bad fate like Socrates.

Once people believe in these “separated essences,” they end up believing many other silly things.

Because they think these forms or essences are real, they have to say where they exist. But since they believe these forms have no body or size, and everyone knows that a place has size and can only hold physical things, they try to explain it by saying these forms are not “anywhere” but “everywhere” at once. These are just fancy words that don’t really make sense and are only used in Latin to hide how silly they are. For example, they say a person’s soul is all in their little finger and all in every part of their body, even though the soul in the whole body isn’t bigger than in just one part. Can anyone really believe God cares about such nonsense? But people have to believe this if they want to believe that souls exist separately from the body.

When they try to explain how a soul without a body can feel pain or suffer in hell or purgatory, they have no good answer. They just say we can’t understand how fire can burn souls.
