Sometimes, the exact words of a law might seem confusing or unfair, but they help us understand what the law really means. Still, no problem can make a decision go against the law. Judges are supposed to decide what is right or wrong, not what is good or bad for the country.

A good judge needs different skills than a lawyer. A judge should only pay attention to facts from witnesses and only to laws from official sources like the government or people allowed to explain the law. Judges don’t have to decide what to say before hearing the facts or laws because witnesses and lawyers will explain these during the case.

In England, members of Parliament acted as judges and made tough decisions, even though most of them didn’t study law deeply or work as lawyers. They did get advice from lawyers, but only they could make the final decision. Similarly, in regular trials, twelve regular people act as judges. They decide not just what happened, but also who is right or wrong. In criminal cases, they decide if a crime happened and what kind it was, like murder or assault. Since they don’t always know the law, someone helps explain it to them. But if the twelve people decide differently, they usually don’t get punished unless it’s clear they ignored their own sense of right and wrong or were bribed.

A good judge or law interpreter needs to understand something called “equity,” which is part of natural law. This isn’t about reading other people’s ideas but about using your own good sense and careful thinking. People who have more free time and are interested in thinking deeply are likely to understand this best.
