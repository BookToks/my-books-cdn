The religion of the Church of Rome was partly stopped in England and many other Christian areas because the leaders were losing their good behavior, which made people lose their faith. Also, they mixed Aristotle’s ideas with religion, which caused a lot of confusing and silly beliefs. This made the church leaders look both stupid and dishonest, so people wanted to turn away from them, sometimes even against their kings’ wishes, like in France and Holland, or with their kings’ permission, like in England.

Also, the Church of Rome said many things were needed to be saved that clearly helped the Pope. Many of the Pope’s followers lived in lands ruled by other Christian kings. If those kings weren’t competing with each other, they could have kicked out the Pope’s control easily, just like England did. Everyone can see it helps the Pope if people believe a king only gets power from Christ if a bishop crowns him. Or that a king who is a priest can’t marry. Or that Rome decides if a prince is born in a legal marriage or not. Or that people don’t have to obey their king if Rome says the king is a heretic. Or that the Pope can remove a king like Childeric of France and give his kingdom to someone else for no good reason. Or that church leaders don’t have to follow the king’s laws when they break the law. And who doesn't see how the Pope benefits from charging money for private Masses and things like purgatory, which can hurt true faith—if the government and customs didn’t support it more than respect for the church teachers. So, I think all the changes in religion happened because people didn’t like their priests—not just Catholics, but also in churches that say they have reformed.
