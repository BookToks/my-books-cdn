John says, “To those who win, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the middle of God’s Paradise.” This was the tree that gave Adam eternal life, but his life was meant to be lived on earth.

St. John also seems to agree when he says, “I, John, saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, ready like a bride dressed for her husband.” He says again in verse 10 something similar, as if to say the new Jerusalem, God’s Paradise, will come down to God’s people from heaven when Christ comes back, instead of people going up to it from earth.

This idea is like what the two angels said to the Apostles watching Jesus go up to heaven: “This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back the same way you saw him go up.” It sounds like Jesus will come down to rule with God’s people on earth forever, not take them up to rule in heaven. This fits with the idea of God’s kingdom being restored on earth, like the government Moses started for the Jews.

Also, Jesus said, “In the resurrection, people will not marry or be given in marriage, but will be like the angels in heaven.” This shows eternal life is like what Adam lost when it comes to marriage. Since Adam and Eve were supposed to live forever on earth without sin, they wouldn’t have kept having children forever. If immortal people kept having kids like we do now, the earth wouldn’t have enough room for everyone.

The Jews who asked Jesus whose wife a woman would be if she had married many brothers didn’t understand what eternal life would mean. So Jesus reminded them that with eternal life, there is no more marriage or having children, just like angels don’t marry or have kids.

The connection between the eternal life Adam lost and the life Jesus won back is also clear. Adam lost eternal life by sin, but he still lived for a while after. Likewise, faithful Christians get eternal life through Jesus’ suffering, even though they die naturally and stay dead for a time until the resurrection. Death started because of Adam’s sin, not just when people actually die. And life starts from being forgiven, not just from rising again, for those chosen in Christ.
