So, names by themselves can never be a good reason for proving something. The same goes for metaphors and figures of speech, but they’re less tricky because they admit they’re not always exact, which names don’t.

When people use reason, they’re basically adding things up or taking things away in their minds. If they do this with words, it means they’re thinking about how the parts connect to the whole, or how one part relates to another. Even though we have other math operations like multiplying and dividing, they’re just shortcuts for adding and subtracting.

These math ideas don’t only work with numbers but with anything you can add or take away. For example, geometry uses them with shapes and angles, logic uses them with words and ideas, politics adds agreements to figure out people’s duties, and law combines laws and facts to decide what’s right or wrong. Basically, wherever you can add or subtract, you can use reason. If you can’t, then reason doesn’t apply.

So, reason means doing this kind of adding and subtracting with ideas or words in your mind. It’s like keeping track of your thoughts and showing others how you got to your conclusions.

Just like in math, where people can make mistakes when calculating, even smart and careful people can make errors in reasoning and come to wrong conclusions. But the idea of reason itself is always correct, just like math is reliable. The problem is, no single person or group can guarantee that their reasoning is certain, just because many people agree on it.
