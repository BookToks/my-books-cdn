Sense and memory are just knowing facts, which are things that already happened and can't be changed. Science, on the other hand, is understanding how one fact leads to another. This helps us know how to do something now and also how to do it again later. When we understand how something happens, what causes it, and how it works, we can make the same things happen again when we want.

Kids don’t really have reason until they can talk. They’re called reasonable creatures because they might learn to use reason later. Most people can think a little, like with simple math, but that doesn’t help much in everyday life. How well they do depends on their experience, memory, what they want, and especially luck or bad choices. Many don’t really understand science. Some think geometry is like magic, and others who haven’t learned the basics think science is something mysterious, like kids who believe their brothers and sisters just appear from the garden.

Still, people without science but with good common sense are better off than those who believe wrong ideas or trust people who think wrong. Not knowing why things happen is less harmful than believing in false reasons that actually cause the opposite of what you want.

In short, clear and exact words help us understand things better. Reason helps us move forward, science shows us the way, and helping people is the goal. But confusing words and unclear ideas are like chasing fake lights—they only lead to arguments, fights, or people not trusting each other.

Having a lot of experience means being wise in practical ways, and having a lot of science means being wise in deeper ways. Even though we call both “wisdom,” the old Latin thinkers made a difference: they called experience “prudence” and science “sapience.”
