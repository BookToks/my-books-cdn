In the fifteenth chapter, some laws of nature were explained, and I want to add this: every person should try, as much as they can, to protect the authority that keeps them safe during peaceful times, even in war. If someone says they have the right to protect themselves, they can't also say they have the right to harm the person or power that protects them. That just doesn't make sense. This rule might already be understood from other laws, but because of current times, it needs to be clearly said and remembered.

I've noticed from some English books that people still don’t fully understand when a person has to obey a conqueror, what conquest really means, or why people have to follow the conqueror’s rules. So, to clear things up, I say that a person becomes subject to a conqueror when they freely agree to be, either by saying it openly or showing it in some clear way. When can someone choose to submit? I explained this before: if a person only owes loyalty as a regular subject to their old ruler, they can submit when their means to live are controlled by the enemy’s soldiers. This is because they are no longer protected by their old ruler, but instead protected by the enemy in exchange for their support. Since supporting the enemy is unavoidable, and usually considered okay, fully submitting to the enemy can't be called wrong. Also, those who submit only give part of what they have, while those who refuse give everything to the enemy. So, the submission is actually hurting the enemy, not helping.

But if a person is not just a subject but also a soldier, they can’t submit to a new ruler as long as their old leader is still fighting and providing for them, either in the army or in forts. In this case, the soldier still has protection and resources, so they can’t say they have no choice.

However, if the old power fails and no longer supports the soldier, then the soldier can lawfully choose to protect themselves by submitting to whoever gives them the best chance of safety. If they decide to do this, they must be loyal to their new master. A contract made properly cannot be broken without good reason.
