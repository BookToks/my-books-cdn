Every crime happens because someone doesn’t understand something, makes a mistake in thinking, or gets carried away by strong feelings. Not understanding is called ignorance, and wrong thinking is called a wrong opinion. 

Ignorance can be about three things: the law, the ruler, or the punishment. Not knowing the law of nature doesn’t excuse anyone because everyone who can think knows they shouldn’t do to others what they wouldn’t want done to themselves. So, wherever a person goes, if they break this rule, it’s a crime.

For example, if someone comes from far away and tries to convince people here to follow a new religion or break the laws, even if they truly believe it’s right, they are still committing a crime. This is because they are doing something they wouldn’t want others to do in their own home.

But if a person doesn’t know the civil law in a new place, it’s okay until someone tells them what the law is. That’s because, until then, the civil law doesn’t really apply to them.

Similarly, if a person’s own country’s civil law isn’t clear enough for them to understand, or if their action isn’t clearly against the law of nature, then not knowing the law is a good excuse. But in other cases, not knowing the civil law is not an excuse.

Not knowing who is in charge, or the ruler, where a person lives is not an excuse because they should know who protects them there.

Not knowing the punishment doesn’t excuse anyone either. Laws are only laws if there’s a punishment for breaking them. If someone breaks a law, even if they don’t know the punishment, they must accept it because punishment is a known result of breaking the law. If the punishment is clear in the law, they must accept that. If not, they can be punished in any way the ruler decides.

It makes sense that if someone does harm, they should be punished, and the punishment depends on the ruler’s will.

But if a certain punishment is written in the law or normally given for a crime, then the person shouldn’t get a harsher punishment than usual. If the punishment isn’t enough to stop people from doing wrong, it actually encourages them to do it. People will weigh the benefits of doing something bad against the punishment and choose what seems better for themselves. So if people are punished more than the law says, or more than others for the same crime, it’s like the law is tricking them.
