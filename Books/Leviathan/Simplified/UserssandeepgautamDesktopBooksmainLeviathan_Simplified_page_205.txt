Sometimes, people want to keep taking over more land, even though it often leads to serious injuries from enemies. Also, taking over places that don’t work well together can be a problem, and it’s sometimes easier to lose them than to keep them. On top of that, people can get lazy from having an easy life or waste money on unnecessary things.

When there’s a war, whether with other countries or inside the country, and the enemies finally win, the government can no longer protect its people. When this happens, the government breaks apart, and everyone has to look out for themselves however they can. The ruler or government is like the soul of the country, giving it life and movement. When the ruler dies or loses power, the people are no longer controlled by it, just like a body without a soul.

Even though a king or ruler’s rights can’t be taken away by others, the people’s loyalty can end if they don’t get protection. If someone isn’t protected, they can find protection anywhere else, and once they find it, they should support those who protect them as long as they can. But if the government’s power is completely destroyed, its rights end too because the government no longer exists, and there’s no way for it to come back.

The job of the ruler, whether a king or a group, is to keep the people safe because that’s why they were given power. They have to answer only to God for this duty. Safety doesn’t just mean staying alive but also having a good life where people can earn their living lawfully without hurting the country.

This should be done not by focusing on each person individually, except protecting them from harm when they complain, but by guiding everyone through public teaching, setting good examples, and making fair laws that people can use to solve their own problems.
