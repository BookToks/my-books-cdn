After the Athenians defeated the Persian armies, they took control of the sea and all the islands and coastal cities around it in both Asia and Europe. They became rich because of this. People who didn’t have jobs, either at home or abroad, mostly spent their time either “telling and hearing news,” as St. Luke said, or talking about philosophy in public to the young people of the city.

Each teacher had a special place to teach. Plato taught in public gardens called the Academia, named after a person called Academus. Aristotle taught near the temple of Pan, in a place called Lycaeum. Others taught in the Stoa, a covered walkway where merchants brought their goods, or in other spots where they could gather young people to listen. This is what Carneades did when he was in Rome as an ambassador. He talked so much that Cato told the Senate to send him away quickly, worried that he might influence the young people in the wrong way.

Because of this, the places where they taught were called "schola," which means leisure or free time in their language. Their discussions were called "diatribae," meaning passing time. The philosophers themselves got their names from these schools. Followers of Plato were called Academics; Aristotle’s followers were called Peripatetics, named after the place he taught; and those who followed Zeno were called Stoics, after the Stoa. It’s like calling groups by the places they hang out, like More-fields, Paul’s Church, or the Exchange.

This way of teaching became very popular and spread across Europe and parts of Africa. Almost every country had public schools for lectures and debates.

The Jews also had schools before and after the time of Jesus, but these were mostly for teaching their law. These schools were called synagogues, meaning gatherings of people. Every Sabbath day, their law was read, explained, and debated there. They were like public schools but with a different name. These synagogues were not only in Jerusalem but in many cities where Jews lived. For example, there was a school in Damascus where Paul once went to persecute, and others in Antioch, Iconium, and Thessalonica where he went to argue. There was also a synagogue for Jews from different places like the Libertines, Cyrenians, Alexandrians, Cilicians, and those from Asia. This was the group that debated with St. Paul.
