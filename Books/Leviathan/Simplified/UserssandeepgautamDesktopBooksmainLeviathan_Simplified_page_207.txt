They argue badly, like if people in America who never saw a strong house said there are no good reasons or rules to build a house that lasts as long as the materials. Time and hard work bring new knowledge every day. The skill of building well comes from reason, studied by hardworking people who learned about materials and shapes, long after humans first started building poorly.

Just like that, long after people started making governments, which were imperfect and could fall apart, reason and effort can discover rules to make them last forever, unless there is outside violence. These are the rules I have shared here. Whether the people in power see or use them, or ignore them, doesn’t matter much to me now. But even if my rules aren’t based on reason, I’m sure they come from the authority of the Bible, which I will explain later when I talk about God’s kingdom given to the Jews through Moses.

They also say that even if the rules are right, normal people aren’t smart enough to understand them. I wish the rich and powerful, or the most educated people, were just as unable to understand as they say the common people are.

But everyone knows the problem isn’t that the ideas are hard, but that people don’t want to learn them. Powerful people don’t like anything that limits their desires, and smart people don’t like anything that shows they are wrong and lose power. Meanwhile, regular people’s minds are like blank paper, ready to learn whatever is taught by public authority, as long as they aren’t influenced by the powerful or their teachers’ opinions.

If whole nations can believe in big Christian mysteries that don’t make sense, like one body being in many places at once, then people can definitely learn rules that make sense and protect their rights. So, I believe teaching people about their natural rights and laws is not hard, as long as the ruler has full power and doesn’t mess up or trust bad people. It is the ruler’s duty and benefit to make sure people are taught these things well, to keep peace and protect himself from rebellion.
