The first part of the Bible that was a law is the Ten Commandments. They were written on two stone tablets and given by God Himself to Moses, who then told the people about them. Before this, there was no written law from God. God hadn’t chosen a special group of people yet, so He only gave people the law of nature, which means the rules that make sense to everyone and are written in everyone’s heart.

The first tablet has rules about who is in charge:  
1. They should not worship or honor the gods of other nations. It says, “You shall not have other gods before me,” meaning they must only follow the one God who spoke to Moses.  
2. They should not make any pictures or statues to represent God. They had to follow Moses and Aaron, who God chose to lead them.  
3. They should not use God’s name carelessly or disrespect their King or the leaders Moses and Aaron.  
4. They should rest every seventh day and use that time to honor God.

The second tablet is about how people should treat each other. It says to respect parents, not to kill, not to cheat on your partner, not to steal, not to lie in court, and not even to think about hurting others.

Now, the question is who made these stone tablets official laws. It’s clear God made them laws. But since a law only works if people agree it comes from the ruler, how could the Israelites obey all the rules Moses told them when they weren’t even allowed to go near the mountain to hear God speak? Some rules, like the ones on the second tablet, are natural laws that everyone should follow. But the special rules just for the Israelites, on the first tablet, were only laws because the people promised to obey Moses. They said, “You speak to us, and we will listen. But don’t let God speak to us directly, or we might die.”
