The Third Part Of a Christian Commonwealth XXXII: Of the Principles of Christian Politics

So far, I have explained the rights of rulers and the duties of people based only on natural reasons—things we know from experience or agreed meanings of words. This means I used what we learn about human nature and clear definitions that everyone understands in politics.

But now, I will talk about the Christian government, which depends a lot on God’s special messages revealed through prophets. So, I will base my ideas not just on natural knowledge but also on these divine teachings.

Still, we shouldn’t ignore our senses, experience, or natural reason, which is God’s true word to us. These are the gifts God gave us to use wisely until Jesus comes back. We shouldn’t just accept everything without thinking but use our reason to seek justice, peace, and true faith.

Even though some things in God’s word are beyond our reason—meaning we can’t fully prove or disprove them—they never actually go against reason. If something seems wrong, it’s either because we don’t understand it well or we’re thinking about it incorrectly.

So, when something in the Bible is too hard to figure out, we should accept it as it is instead of trying to explain it with logic or science, since these mysteries don’t always follow natural rules.

Our religion’s mysteries are like medicine pills for sick people: swallowed whole, they heal us, but if we chew them too much, we might lose their power and they won’t work as well.
