Nothing made by humans can last forever. But if people really used their reason like they say they do, their governments could at least be protected from falling apart from problems inside. Governments are supposed to last as long as humans do, or as long as natural laws and justice exist, since these give them life. So when governments break down, not because of outside attacks but because of fights inside, the problem isn’t with people themselves, but with how they set up and run their governments.

People get tired of fighting and want to come together to create a strong, lasting government. But because they don’t know how to make good laws to guide their actions, and because they lack the patience and humility to fix the rough parts of their current power, they can’t build a stable system without a really skilled leader. Without that, their government ends up shaky and will probably collapse, causing problems for future generations.

One big problem in governments is that they are sometimes set up wrong, like a sick body that’s unhealthy from the start. For example, sometimes a person becomes king or leader by agreeing to have less power than what the safety and peace of the government really need. Later, when they try to take back this power to protect the public, it looks unfair to many people, and they might rebel. This is like how children born from unhealthy parents can get sick or have problems that show up later.

Sometimes kings don’t give themselves all the power they need because they don’t understand their job well. Other times, they hope they can get that power back later whenever they want. But this is a bad idea because other countries will support those who keep the king’s promises, and these foreign governments often try to weaken their neighbors to help their own people. For example, Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was supported by the Pope against King Henry II, because the church had been given special freedoms by William the Conqueror when he promised not to interfere with the church’s liberty.
