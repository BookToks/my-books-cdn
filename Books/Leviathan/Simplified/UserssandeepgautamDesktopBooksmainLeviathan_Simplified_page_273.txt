After Moses turned the waters of Egypt’s streams, rivers, ponds, and pools into blood, the magicians of Egypt did the same thing using their magic. When Moses brought frogs onto the land by God’s power, the magicians also made frogs appear with their magic. Because of this, people might think that miracles happen because of magic or the power of certain words. But the Bible never really explains what magic or enchantment is.

If magic isn’t really about strange powers from spells and words, but just tricks and lies done by normal means, then those Bible stories that seem to support magic must mean something else. Words only affect people who understand them, and their effect is to show what the speaker feels or wants, making the listener feel hope, fear, or other emotions. So, when a rod looks like a snake or water looks like blood, it’s not the objects that are magical but the people watching who are fooled.

All the miracle really means is that the person doing the magic trick has tricked someone else. This isn’t a real miracle, just something easy to do. Most people, especially those who don’t understand how nature works or how people behave, can be tricked by simple tricks.

Before people understood science, if someone told them the sun would go dark at a certain time, they might think it was a miracle. A juggler who performs tricks with cups and balls might be believed to have powers from the Devil if people didn’t know better. Someone who can speak in a strange way, making their voice seem to come from far away (called ventriloquism), can make many people believe it’s a voice from heaven, and say whatever they want.
