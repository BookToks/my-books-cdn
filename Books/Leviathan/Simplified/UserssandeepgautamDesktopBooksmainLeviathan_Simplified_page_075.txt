The religion of the Church of Rome was partly ended in England and many other Christian countries because the leaders were not good examples, which made people stop believing. Also, they mixed Aristotle’s ideas with religion, which caused lots of confusion and made the church leaders seem both ignorant and dishonest. This made people want to break away from the church, sometimes even against their rulers’ wishes, like in France and Holland, or with their rulers’ permission, like in England.

Finally, many rules the Church of Rome said were needed for salvation mostly helped the Pope, especially for people living under other Christian rulers. If it weren’t for the rivalry between kings, they could have easily kicked out all foreign church control, just like England did. Everyone can see who benefits from the idea that a king only has power if a bishop crowns him, or that a king who is also a priest can’t get married. Also, whether a prince is born in a legal marriage often depends on decisions from Rome. People can stop obeying their king if the Pope says the king is a heretic. A king, like Childeric of France, could be removed by a Pope for no good reason, and his kingdom given to someone else. Church leaders can avoid the king’s control in criminal cases, no matter the country. Plus, things like fees for private Masses and beliefs about purgatory mainly helped the church’s own interests, which hurt true faith—if the government and customs didn’t support the church more than the respect for its teachers.

So, I think all the changes in religion happened because of annoying priests, not just in the Catholic Church but even in churches that tried to reform.
