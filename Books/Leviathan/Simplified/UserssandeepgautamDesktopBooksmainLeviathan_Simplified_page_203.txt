Sometimes, even in a simple government, there can be more than one leader. For example, when one group controls the money, one person is in charge of leading, and a third group makes the laws, it causes problems. This can hurt the country because they might not agree on good laws or have enough resources to keep things running. Many people don’t realize this isn’t real government but more like three separate groups fighting for control, which is called a mixed monarchy. In reality, it’s not one country or one leader but three different leaders.

In God’s kingdom, there can be three independent persons without breaking unity. But when humans lead, with their different opinions, that can’t happen. So if the king represents the people, and the general assembly also represents the people, and another group represents part of the people, they are not one leader but three separate leaders.

I’m not sure what sickness in a human body is exactly like this problem in a government. But I once saw a man with another man growing out of his side, with his own head, arms, chest, and stomach. If he had a man growing out of his other side too, that would be a perfect example.

So far, I have talked about the biggest and most dangerous problems in a government. There are other problems too, which are not as serious but still important. One is how hard it is to get money for the country’s needs, especially during war. This happens because people think their land and stuff belong only to them, not the government. Because of this, the government, which knows what dangers are coming, finds it hard to collect money. The people hold on to their money too tightly, so the government tries to avoid asking for it. But when it can’t avoid it anymore, it uses laws to get small amounts, which aren’t enough. Then, sometimes it has to force people to give money, or the country will fail. After many times like this, the government either makes the people cooperate or the country falls apart.
