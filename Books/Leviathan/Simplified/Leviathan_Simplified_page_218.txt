The same rules that tell people without a government what they should do and avoid with each other also apply to countries. These rules speak to the consciences of kings and rulers because there is no real court of natural justice except in the conscience, where only God rules. The laws that apply to everyone come from God, who made nature, so these laws are natural. And because God is the King of all kings, these laws are also laws. I will talk more about God’s kingdom later.

Now, living without any rules or leaders, like people who are neither rulers nor followers, is chaos and like being at war. The rules that help people avoid this chaos are called the laws of nature. A country without a leader is just a name and can’t work. People must obey their rulers in everything, as long as what they’re asked to do does not go against God’s laws. I’ve already explained this before.

What’s still needed to fully understand our duties as citizens is knowing what God’s laws are. Without knowing this, a person can’t tell if a ruler’s command goes against God’s law or not. So, they might obey too much and offend God, or be scared to obey and break the country’s rules. To avoid these problems, it’s important to know God’s laws. Since knowing all laws depends on knowing who has the highest power, I will now say something about God’s kingdom.

The Bible says, “God is King, let the earth be happy,” and “God is King even if people are angry, and He is powerful even if the earth shakes.” Whether people like it or not, they must always obey God’s power. Even if people don’t believe in God, they still live under His rules. But calling God’s power a kingdom, since it covers not only people but animals, plants, and even things that don’t live, is just a way of speaking.

A true king is someone who rules his people by laws, rewarding those who obey and punishing those who don’t.
