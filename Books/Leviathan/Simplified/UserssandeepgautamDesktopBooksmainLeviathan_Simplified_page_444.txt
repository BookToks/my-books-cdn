In the part about a Christian government, there are some new ideas that, in a place where the opposite was already decided, might be wrong for someone to share without permission, because it’s like taking the role of a teacher. But right now, when people want not just peace but also truth, sharing ideas that I think are true and clearly help peace and loyalty is just offering new wine in new bottles so both stay fresh. I believe that when new ideas can’t cause trouble or problems, people don’t usually respect old things so much that they’d choose old mistakes over new, proven truth.

I don’t trust my way of speaking very much, but I’m sure (except for printing errors) that my writing is not confusing. I haven’t used quotes from old poets, speakers, or thinkers like many do nowadays, and whether that’s good or bad comes from my own thinking for many reasons. First, all true teaching depends on either reason or the Bible; both can convince many people but don’t need proof from any writer. Second, the questions here aren’t about facts but about what’s right, where witnesses don’t matter. Almost none of those old writers agree with themselves or each other all the time, which makes their words not very reliable. Fourth, opinions believed just because they’re old aren’t really the person’s own thoughts but just repeated words like gossip. Fifth, sometimes people trick others by attaching their bad ideas to smart people’s words. Sixth, I don’t see that old writers thought it was good to copy others like that. Seventh, it’s like bad digestion when old Greek and Latin sentences are repeated without change. Lastly, even though I respect old writers who wrote clearly or helped us find the truth better, I don’t think age alone deserves respect. If we respect age, then the present is the oldest. If we respect the writer’s age, I’m not sure those honored old writers were older when they wrote than I am now. But if you think about it, praising old authors comes not from respect for the dead but from jealousy and competition among living people.
