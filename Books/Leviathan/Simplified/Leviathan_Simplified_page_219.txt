People who belong to God’s kingdom are not things without life or animals that can’t think, because they don’t understand God’s rules. Neither are they people who don’t believe in God or think He cares about what people do, because they don’t believe in His words, hope for His rewards, or fear His punishments. So, those who believe that God controls the world, has given rules, and promises rewards and punishments to people are God’s followers; everyone else should be seen as enemies.

To be ruled by words, those words have to be clearly known; otherwise, they aren’t real laws. Laws have to be explained well enough so no one can say they didn’t know about them. For human laws, this happens when a person announces them out loud. But God shares His laws in three ways: through natural reason, through special messages called revelations, and through people chosen by God who perform miracles to prove their message. So, God’s words come in three kinds: logical, visible, and prophetic. We understand these through reason, supernatural sense, and faith. The supernatural sense, like revelation, isn’t given to everyone because God only speaks that way to certain people with different messages.

Because of the difference between God’s logical and prophetic words, we can say God has two kingdoms: the natural and the prophetic. The natural kingdom includes everyone who believes God watches over us and follows right reason. The prophetic kingdom is for the Jewish people, whom God chose to follow special laws given through prophets, not just natural reason. In this chapter, I’ll talk about God’s natural kingdom.

God’s rule over people and His punishment of lawbreakers doesn’t come from just creating them, like expecting thanks for making them, but from His unstoppable power. I’ve already explained how a ruler’s right comes from an agreement. To explain how this right comes from nature, I just need to show when it never ends. Since all people naturally had the right to everything, each person had the right to rule over everyone else.
