Thirdly, when you talk to someone one-on-one, you can check if their reasons and advice are true or make sense by asking questions and interrupting if needed. This is hard to do in a big group because there’s so much talking that you get confused instead of knowing what to do. Also, in big groups, some people just want to sound smart and impress others instead of giving helpful advice. They use fancy words and ideas from different authors to show off, which wastes time. But when you talk privately, you can avoid this problem.

Fourthly, sometimes you need to keep plans secret, especially in public matters. Having many people involved in these secret talks can be risky. That’s why big groups usually give these important jobs to smaller groups made up of trusted and experienced people.

To finish, who really wants advice from a big group when making important decisions like who their kids marry, what to do with their property, or how to run their home—especially if some people in the group don’t want them to succeed? The best way is to get advice from a few smart people separately, each in their own area of knowledge. This is like having good teammates in tennis, each playing their part well. The next best way is to trust your own judgment alone, like playing tennis without any teammates. The worst way is to rely on a group that has to agree together, because people who disagree or want you to fail can slow things down, like being carried around in a heavy wheelbarrow pushed by players who don’t work together. The more people involved, the worse it gets, especially if some want you to lose. It’s true that many eyes can see more than one, but this only works if one person makes the final decision.
