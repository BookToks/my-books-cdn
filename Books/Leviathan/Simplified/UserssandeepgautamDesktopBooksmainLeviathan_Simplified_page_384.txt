First, when the priest makes holy water, he says, “I command you, water, in the name of God the Father, and Jesus Christ His Son, and by the power of the Holy Spirit, to become holy water that can drive away all evil and replace the enemy,” and so on. He does the same kind of blessing for the salt mixed with the water, saying, “Become holy salt, so that all evil tricks and spirits will leave the place where you are sprinkled.” He also blesses the oil, saying, “Let this oil drive away all the power of the enemy and the Devil’s attacks.”

When a baby is baptized, the priest does many special things. First, at the church door, he blows three times on the baby’s face and says, “Go away, unclean spirit, and make room for the Holy Spirit.” It’s like saying all babies are possessed until the priest blows on them. Before the baby goes into the church, the priest says again, “I command you to leave this servant of God,” and he repeats this exorcism before the baptism. These prayers and commands are used instead of blessings during baptism and communion. Everything used in these holy ceremonies, except the priest’s spit, has some kind of exorcism.

Other ceremonies like marriage, last rites, visiting the sick, and blessing churches and graveyards also use these special prayers and blessed oil and water. They also use the cross and holy words from the Bible, like “asperges me Domine hyssopo,” to try and drive away evil spirits or imagined ghosts.

Another common mistake comes from misunderstanding words like eternal life, everlasting death, and the second death. The Bible says God made Adam to live forever, but only if he didn’t disobey God. This wasn’t a natural part of being human, but was because of the tree of life, which Adam could eat from only if he stayed sinless. After Adam sinned, he was kicked out of Paradise so he couldn’t eat from the tree and live forever. Christ’s suffering paid for sin for everyone who believes in Him, giving eternal life back to the faithful only. But many people now wrongly believe that every person naturally has eternal life because their soul never dies.
