A person, as I explained before in Chapter thirteen, is someone who is shown or represented by something else. So, God, who has been shown in three different ways, can be called three persons. But the Bible doesn’t actually use the words “Person” or “Trinity” for God. St. John says, “There are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.” This doesn’t conflict with the idea of three persons because “person” means someone who is represented by another.

For example, God the Father is one person when shown by Moses; another person when shown by His Son; and a third person when shown by the Apostles and teachers who followed them. Even though these are three persons, they are all the same one God. Someone might wonder what these three were testifying about.

St. John tells us they were saying, “God has given us eternal life through His Son.” If you ask how they showed this, it’s easy to answer. God proved it by miracles done through Moses, then through His Son, and then through the Apostles who had the Holy Spirit. These people represented God at their times and either predicted or taught about Jesus Christ. The Apostles’ main job, especially the first twelve, was to prove Jesus had risen from the dead. This is clear when St. Peter said that the new Apostle replacing Judas had to be someone who had been with them from the time John baptized Jesus until Jesus was taken up, to witness His resurrection. This explains the “bearing of witness” St. John talked about.

In the same place, there is another group of three witnesses on earth. It says, “There are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree as one.” This means that God’s Spirit and the two sacraments—baptism and the Lord’s Supper—work together to remind believers that eternal life is real. St. John says, “He who believes in the Son of Man has this witness inside him.”
