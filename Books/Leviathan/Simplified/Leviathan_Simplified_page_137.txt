If a king gives up his power for himself and his family, his people become completely free like in nature. Even though nature can show who his children or closest family are, it’s up to the king to decide who will be his heir. If he doesn’t want an heir, then there is no king or control over the people. The same happens if he dies without family or naming an heir. Then no one can be known as the next ruler, and no one has to obey anyone.

If the king sends someone away from the kingdom, that person is not under his control while gone. But if someone is sent on a message or allowed to travel, they are still under the king’s control. This is because of an agreement between kings, not because of the usual rules of obeying the king. Anyone who enters another king’s land must follow that land’s laws, unless they have special permission.

If a king loses a war and agrees to obey the winner, his people stop obeying him and must obey the winner instead. But if the king is just a prisoner and can’t move freely, he hasn’t given up his power. So, his people must still obey the leaders he chose before, who are ruling in his name. If the king can’t pick new leaders, it’s assumed he agrees with the ones he chose before.

Now, about groups within a country: I will talk about parts that are like muscles in a body. By groups, I mean any number of people joined together for one goal or task. Some groups are organized, and some are not. Organized groups have one person or a group chosen to represent all members. All others are unorganized.

Among organized groups, some are fully independent and only answer to their own representative. These are called Commonwealths, which I talked about in previous chapters. Others depend on a higher power, meaning they answer to a ruler who has authority over both the group and its representative.
