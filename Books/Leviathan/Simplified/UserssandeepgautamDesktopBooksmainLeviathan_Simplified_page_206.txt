If the most important rights of a country’s ruler (talked about before in Chapter 18) are taken away, the whole country breaks apart. Then, everyone ends up fighting each other, which is the worst thing that can happen in life. It’s the ruler’s job to protect these rights completely, and it’s wrong for the ruler to give them away or give them up. 

If the ruler gives up the power to make decisions, like following the laws, making peace or war, deciding what the country needs, collecting money and soldiers, choosing officers, or appointing teachers to guide the people, then they lose control of everything. Also, the ruler should never keep the people in the dark about why these rights are important. If people don’t understand, they might easily be tricked into fighting against their ruler when the country really needs them to help.

These rights need to be taught carefully and honestly because no law or fear of punishment can keep them safe. Laws against rebellion only work because of natural rules that say people should keep their promises. If people don’t understand these natural rules, they won’t respect any law the ruler makes. Also, if people only see punishment as a fight, they will try to fight back whenever they feel strong enough.

Some people say that justice is just a word with no real meaning, and that whatever someone can take by force is theirs, whether in war or peace. I have already shown this is not true. Others say there are no good reasons to support the ruler’s absolute rights. But if there were good reasons, we would have found them by now. Yet, in reality, no country has fully accepted or challenged these rights before.
