Only certain people can truly be called martyrs of Christ, and this is clear from what St. Peter said. He said that one of the men who had been with Jesus from the time of John’s baptism until Jesus was taken up to heaven had to be chosen to be a witness of Jesus’ resurrection. This means that a true witness must have actually spent time with Jesus, seen him before and after he rose from the dead, and been one of his original followers. People who weren’t there can only share what others told them, so they are like second-hand witnesses, not true martyrs.

If someone fights against the government just because they believe some idea from the story of Jesus or the teachings of the Apostles—especially if it’s based only on their personal opinion—they are not really a martyr of Christ or even of his followers. There is only one belief worth dying for: that Jesus is the Christ, the one who saved us and will come back to save us all forever. Dying for any other belief that helps church leaders gain power or money is not needed. Being a martyr means being a witness, whether or not you actually die for it.

Also, if someone starts teaching this important belief on their own, without being sent by Jesus or his chosen followers, they might be a witness or martyr in some way. But they are not expected to die for it because they were not officially sent to teach it. They shouldn’t be upset if they don’t get rewards from those who never gave them the job. So, no one can be a true martyr unless they have been officially sent to teach about Jesus coming to earth. This is because a witness is meant to tell people who don’t believe or haven’t heard about Jesus yet. Jesus sent his Apostles and seventy followers with authority to preach, but he didn’t send everyone who believed.
