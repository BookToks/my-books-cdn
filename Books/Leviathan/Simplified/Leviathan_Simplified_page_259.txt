Secondly, about the effect of God’s word; this means the thing itself that His word says, commands, threatens, or promises. For example, Joseph was kept in prison “till his word was come” (Psalms 105:19). This means he stayed there until what he had predicted to Pharaoh’s butler actually happened (Genesis 41:13). So, “his word was come” means the thing he said came true.

Also, Elijah says to God, “I have done all these thy words” (1 Kings 18:36), which means he did everything God commanded. When it says, “Where is the word of the Lord?” (Jeremiah 17:15), it really means “Where is the bad thing God threatened?” And “There shall none of my words be prolonged any more” (Ezekiel 12:28) means the promises God made won’t be delayed.

In the New Testament, it says, “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away” (Matthew 24:35). This means everything Jesus promised will definitely happen. This is why St. John calls Jesus “the Word of God” when He became human: “And the Word was made flesh” (John 1:14). This means that the promise that Jesus would come into the world was God’s plan from the start, but it only happened when Jesus was born. So, Jesus is called the Word not because He is the promise itself, but because He is what was promised.

Some people call Jesus the “Verb of God” from this, but that just confuses things. A verb is just a type of word, like a sound, that doesn’t actually do anything or exist as a real person. So Jesus can’t be just a verb or a noun because those are just parts of speech, not real beings. Jesus is both God and man.

The Word that St. John talks about in his Gospel is also called the “Word of life” (1 John 1:1) and “the Eternal Life, which was with the Father” (1 John 1:2). So, Jesus is called the Word because He is the Eternal Life who came to give us life by coming in the flesh. The Apostle also says that Christ’s name is “the Word of God” (Revelation 19:13). This means He came as God planned from the beginning, fulfilling all the promises made by the prophets.
