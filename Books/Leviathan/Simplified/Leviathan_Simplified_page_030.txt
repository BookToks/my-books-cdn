Sense and memory are just knowing facts, which are things that already happened and can’t be changed. But science is knowing how one fact depends on another and what happens because of it. This helps us understand how to do something now and how to do it again later. When we see how something happens, what causes it, and how it works, we can use the same causes to get the same results.

Kids don’t really have reason until they learn to talk. They are called reasonable because they might learn to use reason as they grow up. Most people can reason a little, like with numbers, but it doesn’t help them much in everyday life. How well they live depends on their experience, memory, goals, luck, and mistakes they make or learn from others. Most people don’t really know science or clear rules. Some think geometry is magic. If people aren’t taught the basics and how to learn more, they are like kids who don’t understand where babies come from and believe silly stories.

Still, people without science but with common sense are better off than those who use wrong ideas or trust bad advice. Not knowing the real causes of things doesn’t cause as much trouble as believing in false causes that lead to the opposite of what they want.

In short, clear words and exact definitions help our minds understand things better. Reason helps us move forward, learning more science shows us the path, and helping people is the goal. On the other hand, confusing words and unclear ideas are like fake lights that lead us into silly mistakes and arguments, causing fights or disrespect.

Experience brings good judgment, and science brings deep understanding. Even though both are called wisdom, the old Latins made a difference: they called good judgment “prudence” and deep understanding “science.”
