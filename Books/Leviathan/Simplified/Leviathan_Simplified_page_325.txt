When St. Paul and other followers of Jesus wrote letters to the people who had become Christians, those people accepted these writings as true Christian teachings. But back then, it wasn’t the teachers’ power that made people accept these writings—it was the faith of the listeners. So, it wasn’t the Apostles who made their writings official rules; each new Christian decided for themselves to accept them.

The real question isn’t about what any Christian chose to believe or reject on their own. It’s about what rules they had to follow without breaking them unfairly. The New Testament can’t be a law everywhere unless the government says so. A law is a rule made by someone with the power to make rules and punish people who don’t follow them.

If someone gives us advice or rules that the government didn’t make, those are just suggestions. We can choose to follow them or not without doing anything wrong. If these suggestions go against the law, we can’t follow them in our actions or what we say without doing something unfair. But we can still believe in them privately and wish we could follow them as official laws.

Faith is something inside us that no one can control. But our actions and words are public, and breaking the law is wrong. Jesus didn’t come to make a kingdom or new laws here on earth. He said he came to save people, not to judge them. He didn’t replace the old laws but came to complete them. So, Jews followed the law of Moses, and other nations followed their own rulers’ laws, plus the natural laws everyone shares.

Jesus and his followers taught new ideas to help us prepare for the next life, not to force new laws in this world. So, the books of the New Testament were good advice on how to live and be saved. Until the government made following them a law, people could choose to follow their advice or not without doing anything wrong.
