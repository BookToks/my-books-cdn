No one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid, which is Jesus as the Christ. If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw, everyone’s work will be shown for what it really is. The day of judgment will reveal it because fire will test each person’s work to see what kind it is. If someone’s work lasts, they will get a reward. If their work burns up, they will lose it, but they themselves will still be saved—though it will be like going through fire.

These words are partly easy to understand and partly symbolic. From the clear part, we can understand that pastors who teach this foundation—that Jesus is the Christ—even if they sometimes make mistakes, can still be saved. Even more so, those who are not pastors but listen and believe what their pastors teach them can be saved. So, believing this is enough, and no other belief is absolutely needed for salvation.

Now, about the symbolic part, like “the fire will test everyone’s work” and “they will be saved as if through fire,” this doesn’t change the meaning we got from the clear part.

Still, since some people have used this passage to argue for purgatory, I want to share my idea about what this fire means. The Apostle seems to refer to the Prophet Zechariah, who said that two-thirds will die, but one-third will be refined through fire like silver and gold, and they will call on the Lord, who will listen to them.

The day of judgment is when God’s kingdom is restored. On that day, St. Peter says the world will be destroyed by fire, and the wicked will perish. But those God saves will go through the fire without harm, like silver and gold being purified. They will be freed from false worship and will call on the true God. Referring to this, St. Paul says that the day of judgment will test everyone’s teachings, judging whether they are like gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw. Those who made wrong ideas from the true foundation will see their teachings rejected, but they themselves will still be saved and live forever, praising the one true God.
