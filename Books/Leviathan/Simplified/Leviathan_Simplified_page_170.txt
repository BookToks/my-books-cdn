What I have written here about moral virtues and how important they are for making and keeping peace is true. But just because it’s true doesn’t mean it’s automatically law. In every country, these ideas become law only because the government says so. Even though they make sense, laws come from those in power. It would be wrong to call natural laws “unwritten laws” because many books have been written about them, and they often disagree with each other.

The meaning of natural law is decided by a judge chosen by the government. This judge listens to cases and applies the law to them. When the judge makes a decision, they check if what the person wants fits with natural fairness and reason. The judge’s decision is the official explanation of natural law, not just their personal opinion. It’s official because the government gives them the power to decide, so their ruling is the law for that case.

But judges and rulers can make mistakes. If later on a similar case comes up and the judge thinks a different decision is fairer, they have to change it. No one’s mistake becomes a new law, and they don’t have to keep making the same mistake.

Also, a wrong decision by one judge doesn’t become law for other judges, even if those judges have promised to follow it. If the government knows about a wrong decision and still accepts it, that decision can become a new law in cases where everything is exactly the same. But natural laws don’t change, so wrong decisions don’t become law for future cases.

Leaders change, judges come and go, and even the world might end someday, but natural law will never change because it is God’s eternal law. This means that all the past judges’ decisions together can’t create a law that goes against natural fairness. No old decision can justify an unfair ruling, or stop a new judge from thinking carefully about what is fair using their own reason. For example, it’s against natural law to punish someone who is innocent. And someone is innocent if a judge says so after a fair trial.
