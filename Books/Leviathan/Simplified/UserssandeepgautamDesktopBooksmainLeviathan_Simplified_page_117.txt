People find it easier to blame someone than to forgive them, and judging someone guilty feels more like justice than letting them go free.

Sixth, one problem with a monarchy is that the ruler might be a baby or someone too young to understand right from wrong. This means someone else, or a group of people, has to use the ruler’s power for them. They govern in the ruler’s name and protect them.

But saying it’s a problem to give power to a person or group instead of the ruler is like saying any government is worse than chaos and fighting.

So, any trouble usually comes from people fighting to get a powerful and profitable job. To prove this problem isn’t because of monarchy itself, we have to look at who the previous ruler chose to take care of the young ruler. This choice might be written clearly in a will or accepted by tradition. If problems happen, it’s because of the selfishness and unfairness of the people, which can happen in any government where people don’t understand their duties or the ruler’s rights.

If the previous ruler didn’t choose anyone to take care of the young ruler, then nature has a rule: the person who cares most about keeping the young ruler’s power safe and gets nothing by harming them should be in charge. Since people naturally want what’s best for themselves, giving power over the child to someone who benefits from hurting them is a betrayal, not care.

So, if the right steps are taken to protect the government under a child ruler, any fights that break out are caused by people’s greed and not by monarchy itself. Also, no big government run by many people is really better off. When making decisions about peace, war, or laws, a big group is like a child because it has to follow the advice of the majority, whether it’s good or bad.
