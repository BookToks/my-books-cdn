One big problem that can break a country is when every person thinks they completely own their stuff and that the ruler has no say over it. It’s true that people own their things and can keep others from taking them. But this ownership only works because the ruler allows it. Without the ruler’s protection, anyone else could just take the same things. If the ruler can’t control people’s stuff, then they can’t do their job of keeping everyone safe from outsiders and from each other. Without that, there is no real country.

If people’s ownership doesn’t stop the ruler from controlling their things, it definitely can’t stop the ruler from running the courts or enforcing laws, since those are part of the ruler’s job.

Another dangerous idea is that the ruler’s power can be split up. But if power is divided, it just destroys itself. When power is shared too much, it weakens the country. Some people who study laws a lot try to say laws should depend on their own knowledge, not on the ruler’s power, and this causes problems.

Just like wrong ideas, seeing other countries with different governments often makes people want to change their own. For example, the Jewish people wanted a king like other nations, so they asked the prophet Samuel for one. In Greece, small cities kept fighting over whether to be ruled by the few rich or by the people, copying either Sparta or Athens. Many people in England also wanted to change their government because they saw the Low Countries become rich by doing it. People naturally want new things, and when they see neighbors doing better with change, it’s hard to stay happy with their own government. They get restless and unhappy, like someone who can’t stop scratching an itch until it hurts.
