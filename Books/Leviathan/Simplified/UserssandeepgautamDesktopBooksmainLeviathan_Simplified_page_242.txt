Sometimes, our brain tricks us into seeing things that aren’t really there, like in a mirror, a dream, or when we’re sick. These things are not real at all, even though they look real. Inside our brain, they’re just noise or confusion caused by what we see or by our senses acting weirdly.

People who don’t study why this happens don’t really know what to call these things. Some might say they are bodies made of air because they look real, while others say they are spirits since you can’t touch them. So, the word “spirit” can mean different things: sometimes it means a thin, invisible body, or a ghost, or just something made up in our imagination.

“Spirit” can also mean feelings or attitudes. For example, a “spirit of contradiction” means someone who likes to argue, an “unclean spirit” means a bad feeling, a “froward spirit” means someone who is stubborn, and the “Spirit of God” means a good feeling or God’s presence. It can also mean great talent or strong emotions, like “the spirit of wisdom” or when people say madmen are “possessed by a spirit.”

There aren’t many other meanings for “spirit.” When the Bible talks about God as a Spirit, it means something beyond what we can understand. We don’t really know what God is like, only that He exists. The names we use for God don’t explain Him exactly but show our respect and love.

For example, “The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters” (Genesis 1:2). If this means God Himself, then movement is something God does. But moving means changing place, which only bodies can do. Since God isn’t a body, this idea is beyond what we can fully understand.
