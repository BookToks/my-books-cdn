Someone might wonder, since there is no marriage in heaven, will people still eat and drink there? So, what kind of eating is talked about here? Jesus explains this by saying, “Don’t work for food that spoils, but for the food that lasts forever, which the Son of Man will give you.” (John 6:27) Eating at Jesus’ table means enjoying eternal life, like eating from the tree of life, in the kingdom of the Son of Man.

These ideas, and many others, show that Jesus will rule his kingdom in his human form.

Also, Jesus will be king as a helper or representative of God the Father, just like Moses was in the desert, the high priests were before King Saul, and the kings came after him.

One prophecy says Jesus would be like Moses in his role: “I will raise up a prophet like you from their own people and put my words in his mouth.” (Deuteronomy 18:18) Jesus showed this similarity during his time on earth. Moses picked twelve leaders from the tribes to help him govern, and Jesus chose twelve apostles who will sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.

Moses also chose seventy elders to receive God’s Spirit and speak to the people for God. Similarly, Jesus appointed seventy disciples to teach about his kingdom and salvation to all nations. When some people complained to Moses about the seventy elders, he defended them as working under his authority. In the same way, when John complained to Jesus about a man casting out demons in Jesus’ name, Jesus said, “Don’t stop him, because whoever is not against us is for us.” (Luke 9:50)

Jesus was also like Moses in setting up ceremonies that showed people were part of God’s kingdom and remembered how God saved them. The Israelites had the ritual of circumcision to welcome people into God’s kingdom before Moses. This was paused in the desert but started again when they reached the promised land. Before Jesus came, the Jews had a baptism ritual that involved washing with water for Gentiles who joined the God of Israel.
