When someone is trusted to be a judge or decision-maker, and they do their job well, they are said to give each person what is rightfully theirs. This is called fair treatment, and it’s also known as equity. Equity is a natural rule, which will be explained later.

Justice depends on an agreement made before, just like thankfulness depends on a gift given freely before. This is the fourth natural rule: if someone gets a favor or help from another person without having to pay for it, they should try not to make the giver regret being kind.

No one gives a gift without wanting some good for themselves because giving is a choice. If people think their kindness won’t be appreciated, no one will start being kind or trusting others. Without trust and kindness, people won’t help each other or make peace, and they will stay in conflict. This goes against the first natural rule that says people should try to live peacefully. Not being thankful is called ingratitude, and it’s as bad as breaking a promise.

The fifth natural rule is about getting along with others. Everyone should try to fit in with the people around them. People are different, just like stones used to build a wall are different shapes. If a stone is rough and doesn’t fit well, it’s thrown away because it causes problems. Similarly, a person who is stubborn and wants to keep things they don’t really need, but others do, and can’t change, should be left out of the group because they cause trouble.

Since everyone naturally tries to get what they need to survive, anyone who fights over extra things is causing problems and starting a conflict. This breaks the main natural rule to seek peace. People who follow this rule are friendly and helpful to others. Those who don’t are stubborn and hard to get along with.
