Sometimes a person looks for something they lost. Their mind goes back to the place and time where they last had it. They try to remember exactly when and where they had it so they can start looking there. Then, they think about what might have caused them to lose it. This process is called remembering. The Latin word for it is reminiscentia, which means thinking back over what you did before.

Sometimes a person knows a certain area where they should look. Then, their thoughts go over every part of that area, like searching a room to find a lost jewel. It’s like a dog sniffing around a field to find a scent or like someone going through the alphabet to start a rhyme.

Sometimes a person wants to know what will happen after an action. They think about similar actions from the past and what happened then, expecting the same things to happen again. For example, someone guessing what will happen to a criminal might think about crimes they’ve seen before and what followed: the crime, the police, jail, the judge, and punishment. This kind of thinking is called foresight, prudence, or wisdom, but it can be wrong because it’s hard to notice every detail.

The more experience someone has, the wiser they become, and their guesses about the future are less likely to be wrong. The present is the only time that really exists. The past exists only in memory, and the future doesn’t exist yet—it’s just something we imagine based on what happened before. The person with the most experience can guess the future best, but still not perfectly. When a guess matches what actually happens, we call it prudence, but it’s really just a guess.

True knowledge of the future, or prophecy, only comes from the one who controls what will happen. The best prophet is really just the best guesser. And the best guesser is the person who knows the most about what they are guessing, because they have the most clues to work with.

A sign is something that happens before something else and shows what will happen next. If the same signs have been seen many times before, they are more reliable.
