A person can change their mind over time. Sometimes they think something is good, and at other times they think the same thing is bad. This causes arguments, fights, and even wars.

When people live just by their natural feelings, which is like being in a constant state of war, they decide what is good or bad based on what they want. Everyone agrees that peace is good. So, things that help keep peace—like fairness, thankfulness, modesty, kindness, and mercy—are also good. These are called moral virtues, and the opposite of these are vices, which are bad.

The study of what is right and wrong is called moral philosophy. The true understanding of natural laws is the same as true moral philosophy.

Some writers talk about virtues and vices but don’t understand why they are good. They think bravery comes from how bold someone is, or generosity comes from how much someone gives, instead of understanding the real reasons behind these traits.

People used to call these ideas “laws,” but that’s not quite right. They are more like ideas or rules about how people protect and take care of themselves. True laws come from someone who has the right to make commands over others.

But if we think about these ideas as commands from God, who has the right to control everything, then they can be called true laws.

A person is someone whose words or actions are either their own or represent someone else’s words or actions. 

If the words or actions are their own, they are called a natural person. If they represent someone else, they are called a feigned or artificial person.

The word “person” comes from Latin and originally meant a mask used in plays. The Greeks had a similar word meaning “face.” Over time, the word “person” started to mean anyone who represents speech or actions, like actors in theaters or speakers in courts.
