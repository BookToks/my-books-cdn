If a man’s father, mother, or master is kicked out of the church, the children are still allowed to spend time with them and eat with them. This is because, most of the time, it would mean the children wouldn’t have any way to get food. Also, it would force them to disobey their parents and masters, which goes against what the Apostles taught.

In short, the power to kick someone out of the church only goes as far as what the Apostles and church leaders were given by Jesus. Their job is not to control people by force, but to teach and guide them to be saved in the afterlife. Just like a teacher can stop helping a student who refuses to follow the rules, but the student is not forced to obey, a Christian teacher can stop guiding people who live badly, but can’t say those people are doing wrong by not listening. If a teacher complains, God’s answer is like what He said to Samuel: “They have not rejected you, but me.”

Excommunication doesn’t work without help from the government. For example, if a Christian ruler is kicked out by a foreign church leader, it has no real power and shouldn’t scare anyone. The idea of excommunication being like a thunderbolt came from the Bishop of Rome, who thought he was the king of all kings, like the god Jupiter was in old stories. He imagined having a thunderbolt to punish those who disobeyed him. But this idea is wrong for two reasons: first, Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world,” so his kingdom isn’t about earthly power; second, there’s no proof in the Bible that this bishop is the boss of all Christians everywhere.

When St. Paul came to Thessalonica, there was a Jewish synagogue there. Like he usually did, he went in and spent three Sabbath days talking with them using the Scriptures. He explained and showed them that Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead, and that the Jesus he was telling them about was the Christ. The Scriptures he used were the Jewish Scriptures, which we now call the Old Testament.
