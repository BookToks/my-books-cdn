Secondly, about the effect of God’s word; this means the thing itself that God confirms, commands, threatens, or promises by speaking. For example, Joseph was kept in prison “till his word was come” (Psalms 105:19). This means until what he predicted to Pharaoh’s butler about being restored to his job actually happened (Genesis 40:13). So, “his word was come” means the thing he said came true.

Also, Elijah says to God, “I have done all these thy words” (1 Kings 18:36), which means “I have done all these things because you told me to.” When Jeremiah asks, “Where is the word of the Lord?” (Jeremiah 17:15), he means “Where is the bad thing God threatened?” And when Ezekiel says, “There shall none of my words be prolonged any more” (Ezekiel 12:28), the words mean the promises God made to His people.

In the New Testament, Jesus says, “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away” (Matthew 24:35). This means everything He promised or predicted will definitely happen. This is why St. John the Evangelist calls Jesus “the Word of God” in the flesh, saying, “And the Word was made flesh” (John 1:14). This means the promise that Christ would come to the world actually happened. God planned from the start to send His Son to show people the way to eternal life, but Jesus becoming human was when that plan was put into action. So, Jesus is called the Word not because He is the promise, but because He is the thing promised.

Some people call Jesus the “Verb of God” from this verse, but that just makes it more confusing. A verb, like a noun, is just a part of speech — a sound or word — that doesn’t mean anything by itself. It doesn’t command, promise, or do anything real, and it can’t be God or man. But Jesus is both God and man.

The Word that St. John talks about in his Gospel was with God and is called the “Word of life” (1 John 1:1) and “the Eternal Life, which was with the Father” (1 John 1:2). So, Jesus can only be called the Word in the same way He is called Eternal Life — because He came to give us eternal life by coming to earth. Also, the Apostle says that Christ, wearing a blood-stained robe, is called “the Word of God” (Revelation 19:13). This means He came to fulfill God’s plan from the beginning, and His name is the same as the promises made by the prophets.
