Salvation shows us that our king will have a great and powerful rule after winning a big battle; it’s not just about running away to be safe. So, when we think about salvation, we should also think about victory and winning a fight before that. This fight probably won’t happen in heaven.

Even if this idea makes sense, I won’t believe it fully unless the Bible clearly says so. The Bible talks a lot about what salvation looks like in Isaiah, chapter 33, verses 20 to 24: “Look at Zion, the special city; your eyes will see Jerusalem as a peaceful place, like a tent that will never be taken down or moved.

There, the Lord will be like wide rivers and streams that no big ships can sail through.

The Lord is our judge, lawmaker, and king, and he will save us.

Their ropes are loose, their masts are weak, and they can’t spread their sails. Then the weak will take the treasure.

People living there won’t say they are sick; everyone there will have their sins forgiven.”

This passage tells us many things: salvation will come from Jerusalem, which will be a peaceful and lasting place; the Lord will be their savior and king; salvation will protect them like strong rivers; their enemies will be weak and defeated; the people saved won’t be sick; and most importantly, everyone will have their sins forgiven.

This shows that salvation will happen on earth when God rules again after Christ comes back, in Jerusalem. From there, salvation will spread to other nations who will join God’s kingdom. The same prophet also says that people from all nations will bring their brothers as an offering to the Lord, riding on horses, chariots, and other animals, to God’s holy mountain, Jerusalem, just like the people of Israel bring offerings in clean containers to the Lord’s house.
