Before now, the power to decide which books were part of Scripture belonged to the civil ruler.

Besides the Book of the Law, there were no other books accepted by the Jews as God’s law from Moses’ time until after the Captivity. Most prophets lived during or just before the Captivity, and their messages were not widely accepted as law. In fact, many were persecuted by false prophets and kings who were tricked by them. The Book of the Law, confirmed by King Josiah, was lost during the Captivity and the destruction of Jerusalem. This is shown in II Esdras 14:21, which says, “Your law is burnt, so no one knows what you have done or will do.” Before the Captivity, between when the law was lost (likely when King Shishak of Egypt took treasures from the Temple) and when Josiah found it again, the people had no written word of God. They ruled based on their own ideas or by following people they thought were prophets.

From this, we can understand that the Old Testament Scriptures we have today were not considered law by the Jews until their covenant with God was renewed after they returned from Captivity and their community was restored under Esdras. After that, these writings were accepted as Jewish law, translated into Greek by seventy elders, put in the library of Ptolemy in Alexandria, and recognized as God’s word.

Since Esdras was the high priest, and the high priest was also the civil ruler, it’s clear that the Scriptures only became laws through the power of the civil leader.

Looking at the writings of early Christian leaders before Christianity was officially accepted by Emperor Constantine, we see that the Christian books we now call the New Testament were already respected by Christians. Except for a few, the majority of these writings were seen as inspired by the Holy Spirit and used as rules of faith. This shows how much respect followers had for their first teachers, similar to how students greatly respect their first teachers in any subject.
