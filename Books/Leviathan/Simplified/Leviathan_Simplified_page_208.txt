First, people should learn that they shouldn’t be jealous of the way other countries are ruled or want to change their own government just because other countries seem to be doing better. A country ruled by nobles or by the people does well not because of the system itself, but because the people follow the rules and get along. A kingdom doesn’t succeed just because one person is in charge, but because the people obey that ruler. If people stop obeying and working together, any kind of government will fail quickly. Those who try to fix the government by causing trouble might actually end up ruining it, like in a story where daughters tried to make their old father young again but only hurt him instead. Wanting to change like this is like breaking God’s first commandment, which says not to worship other gods, and kings are often called gods in the Bible.

Second, people should not be impressed by how good or important some of their fellow citizens are, no matter how popular they seem, or by any group except the main ruling group. They shouldn’t give respect or obedience to anyone who doesn’t represent the true ruler. The true ruler wouldn’t trust the people if he allowed them to be fooled by popular leaders who flatter them and turn them away from their loyalty. This has happened many times, even openly, with preachers and in public, which is like breaking the second of the Ten Commandments.
