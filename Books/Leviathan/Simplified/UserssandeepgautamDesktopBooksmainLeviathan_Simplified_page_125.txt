Winning a fight doesn’t automatically give someone the right to control the loser. Instead, control happens when the loser agrees to it. A person isn’t forced to obey just because they lost; they have to choose to accept the winner’s power. Also, the winner doesn’t have to promise to keep the loser safe just because they gave up. The winner can decide how to treat the loser.

When people ask for “quarter” (which means to surrender and be taken alive), they are trying to stop the winner from being angry and hurting them. They want to save their life by offering ransom or service. But asking for quarter doesn’t guarantee safety; it just delays harm for a while. The loser’s life is only truly safe when the winner trusts them enough to let them go free. If the loser is kept as a slave or prisoner, they work not because they want to, but because they want to avoid worse treatment.

A master owns everything the servant has, including their work, property, and even their family. The servant’s life belongs to the master because of an agreement to obey. This means the servant has to accept whatever the master does. If the master punishes the servant for not obeying, the master is responsible, and the servant can’t claim it’s unfair.

In short, the power a parent or absolute ruler has is the same as a king’s power, for the same reasons explained before. So, a king might rule one country because the people agreed to it, and another because he won by force. Treating one nation differently from another just because it was conquered shows a misunderstanding of what it means to have real power.
