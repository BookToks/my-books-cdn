Signs that show what someone means can come from words, silence, actions, or even choosing not to act. Usually, a sign in a contract is anything that clearly shows what the person wants.

Words by themselves, if they talk about the future and only promise something, aren’t enough to prove a free gift, so they don’t create an obligation. For example, if someone says, “Tomorrow I will give,” it means they haven’t given it yet, so their right to it stays with them until they do something else to give it. But if someone says, “I have given,” or “I give it to be delivered tomorrow,” then they have already given the right today, just by their words, even if nothing else shows their intent. 

There is a big difference between saying, “I want this to be yours tomorrow,” and, “I will give it to you tomorrow.” The first means the person’s present will is to give a right for the future. The second is just a promise to give in the future, so it doesn’t transfer any right now. But if there are other signs showing the person wants to give a right, then even future words can transfer it. For example, if someone offers a prize to whoever finishes a race first, the gift is free, but the right passes even though the words talk about the future, because if they didn’t want their words to count, they wouldn’t have said them.

In contracts, rights can pass not only with words about the present or past but also with words about the future. This is because a contract is a mutual exchange of rights. So, if someone promises something after already getting a benefit, it’s understood they meant to transfer their right. Otherwise, the other person wouldn’t have done their part first. That’s why in buying, selling, and other contracts, a promise is like a formal agreement and must be kept.

The person who acts first in a contract is said to deserve what they will get when the other person does their part, and it’s owed to them. Also, when a prize is offered to many people and only the winner gets it, or when money is thrown to a crowd and those who catch it get to keep it, even though it’s a free gift, winning or catching means you earned it and it’s yours.
