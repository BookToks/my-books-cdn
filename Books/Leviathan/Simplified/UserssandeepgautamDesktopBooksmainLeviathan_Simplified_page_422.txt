People say that things like the shape, color, and taste of bread exist somewhere, even where there is no bread. They also say that faith, wisdom, and other good qualities sometimes come into a person, like they are poured or blown in from heaven. This idea separates good people from their good qualities and causes many problems.

If people believe that obedience or good traits are just given to them magically, who would try to follow the laws? And who wouldn’t obey a priest who seems to have the power of God, or even more than God? Also, if someone is scared of ghosts, they will respect those who can make holy water to scare the ghosts away. This shows some of the wrong ideas the Church got from Aristotle’s philosophy. Aristotle might have known these ideas were wrong but wrote them to support religion and avoid punishment like Socrates.

Once people believe in these “separated essences,” they get stuck in many other silly ideas.

Because they believe these forms or souls are real but not physical, they have to say they exist somewhere. But since place means a physical space and these forms have no size or body, they try to fix this with confusing words that don’t really mean anything. For example, they say a person’s soul is fully in every tiny part of the body, like the little finger, but also in the whole body, without being bigger or smaller. Can anyone really think God wants us to believe such nonsense? But this is what people must believe if they think the soul is separate from the body.

When asked how a soul without a body can feel pain or suffer in hell or purgatory, they have no good answer except to say we just don’t understand how fire can burn souls.
