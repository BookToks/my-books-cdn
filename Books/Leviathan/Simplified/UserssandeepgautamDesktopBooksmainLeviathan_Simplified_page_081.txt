This is the law of the gospel: Do to others whatever you want them to do to you. And the law for all people is: Don’t do to others what you don’t want done to you.

When a person gives up their right to something, they are letting others have the chance to enjoy that same right without being stopped.

If someone gives up or loses their right, they aren’t giving a new right to someone else because everyone naturally has that right. Instead, they are just stepping aside so others can enjoy their own rights more easily.

A right can be given up in two ways: by simply giving it up without caring who benefits, or by giving it to a specific person or group. When someone does this, they must not stop others from using the right they gave up or transferred. It is their duty to respect this choice, and stopping others would be unfair and wrong because the right was already given up or passed on.

In the world, doing the opposite of what you promised is like an argument that doesn’t make sense. Just like it’s silly to say one thing and then deny it later, it’s unfair to undo something you agreed to before.

When a person gives up or transfers a right, they show it clearly by words or actions, or both. These signs are like promises that bind people. These promises are strong, not because words are hard to break, but because people fear bad consequences if they break them.

Whenever someone gives up or transfers a right, it’s because they expect to get something in return or some kind of benefit. It is a choice they make because they believe it will be good for them.
