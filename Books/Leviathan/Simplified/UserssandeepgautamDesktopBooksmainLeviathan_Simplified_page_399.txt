When light from clear objects hits our eyes, either straight on or after bouncing off other things, it makes us imagine the object that caused it. This imagination is called sight. It feels like the object is really there outside us, just like when you press your eye hard and see a light even though no one else can see it. That light isn’t really outside; it’s just your eye reacting. 

The feeling or image you see after the real thing is gone is what we call imagination or memory. When we sleep or when our body is sick, these images can turn into dreams. I already talked about this a bit in earlier chapters.

People long ago didn’t understand how sight worked. Because of this, they thought these images in our mind were actually real things outside us. Some believed these images were invisible spirits or forms without any real body, like colors or shapes without anything solid. Others thought they were living creatures made of air or some kind of light matter that could appear when they wanted. Both groups called these beings “demons.” 

They acted like the people we dream about aren’t just in our heads but live in the air, the sky, or underworld. They thought these were real ghosts, not just images in the brain. It’s like saying you saw your own ghost in a mirror or the ghosts of stars in a river, or calling the small sun image we see a “demon” of the real sun. Because of this, people were scared of these demons, thinking they had unlimited power to help or harm them.

Leaders in old pagan societies used this fear to keep peace and control people. They created rules about demons, making some good and some bad. Good demons encouraged people to follow the rules, while bad demons warned them not to break the laws.
