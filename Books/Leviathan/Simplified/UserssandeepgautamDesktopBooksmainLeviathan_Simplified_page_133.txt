The Athenians were taught that they were free people, and anyone living under a king was a slave. Because of this, Aristotle said in his book Politics, "In democracy, people are free; in any other government, no one is truly free."  

Just like Aristotle, Cicero and other writers based their ideas about government on what the Romans believed. The Romans were taught to hate kings, first by those who kicked out their king and shared power among themselves, and later by the people who followed them.  

By reading these Greek and Latin writers, people from a young age learned to think they were free but actually liked causing chaos and interfering with their rulers. Then they even tried to control those who controlled the rulers. This caused a lot of fighting and bloodshed, and honestly, the Western world paid a very high price to learn Greek and Latin ideas.  

Now, about what true freedom means for a citizen: it means knowing what things the ruler can command you to do and which things you can refuse without being unfair. We need to think about what rights we give up when we agree to live under a government or ruler. When we submit to a ruler’s power, that’s where both our duty and freedom come from.  

Everyone is naturally free, and no one has to obey unless they have agreed to it themselves. So, the rules about what we must do come from either the exact words of our agreement with the ruler or from the purpose of having a government in the first place — which is to keep peace among the people and protect them from enemies.  

First, since governments are made by everyone agreeing to it, or sometimes by the defeated agreeing to the winner, it’s clear that people keep their freedom in all things that can’t be given to the ruler by this kind of agreement.
