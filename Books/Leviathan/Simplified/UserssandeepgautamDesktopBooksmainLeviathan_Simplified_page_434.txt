I don’t blame Emperor Frederick for helping our countryman, Pope Adrian, because back then, his people were so tough that if he hadn’t helped, the Pope probably wouldn’t have become emperor. But I do blame those who, at the start when they had all the power, allowed ideas to be made in their universities that kept helping all the popes after that. These popes then climbed onto the thrones of Christian rulers and controlled both them and their people however they wanted.

Just like people create ideas, they can also undo them. The process is the same, but it happens in reverse. It starts with the first parts of true power, which are wisdom, humility, honesty, and other good qualities of the Apostles. People listened to the Apostles because they respected them, not because they had to. Their minds were free, and their words and actions were only controlled by the government.

As more Christians joined, the presbyters (church leaders) met to decide what to teach. They promised to teach only what their group agreed on, and they made people think they had to follow these teachings. If people refused, they were left out (which was called excommunication), not because they were unbelievers, but because they didn’t obey. This was the first restriction on Christian freedom. Then, as presbyters grew in number, those in big cities took power over local presbyters and called themselves bishops. This was the second restriction on Christian freedom. Finally, the bishop of Rome claimed authority over all other bishops because Rome was the Imperial City. He got this power partly from emperors, the title of Pontifex Maximus, and later from special rights linked to St. Peter. This was the third and last restriction and the full setup of papal power.

So, to undo this, you start with the last restriction first, just like what happened with the Church government in England. Queen Elizabeth completely ended the pope’s power, and bishops who used to act for the pope started acting for the Queen and her heirs. Though some said they had their power directly from God, this was the first restriction being undone.
