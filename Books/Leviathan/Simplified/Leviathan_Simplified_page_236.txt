The book of Job isn’t really a history. It’s more like a discussion about an old question: why do bad people often do well in life, while good people suffer? This makes sense because the first part of Job, up to chapter 3 verse 3, is written in normal speech, but then it switches to poetry until near the end, and then back to normal speech. The argument is all in poetry, with the regular speech acting like an introduction and a conclusion. People didn’t usually write poetry when they were in pain, like Job, or when they were trying to comfort someone, like his friends. Instead, poetry was often used for deep thinking, especially about morals.

Most of the Psalms were written by David for the choir to sing. Some were written by Moses and other holy men. A few were written after the Jews came back from being held captive, like Psalms 137 and 126. This shows that the Psalms were put together in the way we have them now after the Jews returned from Babylon.

The Proverbs are a collection of wise and godly sayings. Some come from Solomon, some from Agur, and some from the mother of King Lemuel. It’s unlikely Solomon collected all of them himself. Even though the sayings belong to these people, someone else probably gathered them into one book much later.

The books of Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs (Canticles) are mostly Solomon’s work, except maybe the titles. The titles like “The Words of the Preacher, the Son of David, King in Jerusalem” and “The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s” were probably added later to show who wrote them when the Scriptures were all put together. This way, both the teachings and the authors were remembered.

The oldest prophets include Zephaniah, Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, and Micaiah. They lived when Amaziah and Azariah (also called Ozias) were kings of Judah. The Book of Jonah isn’t really a record of his prophecies, except for the part where he says “Forty days and Nineveh will be destroyed.” Instead, it tells the story of Jonah’s struggle and arguments with God. It’s unlikely Jonah wrote this book because it’s about him. But the Book of Amos is actually his prophecy.

Jeremiah, Obadiah, Nahum, and Habakkuk were prophets during the time of King Josiah.
