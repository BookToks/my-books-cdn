“This is the second death.” (Revelation 20:13-14) This shows that everyone who is judged and condemned on Judgment Day will face a second death, and after that, they will never die again.

The happiness of eternal life is called salvation in the Bible, which means being saved. Being saved means being protected—either from certain bad things or from all bad things, including hunger, sickness, and even death. People were created to live forever and not to break down, but because Adam sinned, we lost that happiness. So, being saved from sin means being saved from all the bad things sin has caused.

In the Bible, forgiving sins and saving from death and misery mean the same thing. This is shown when Jesus healed a paralyzed man and said, “Son, be happy; your sins are forgiven.” (Matthew 9:2) The religious leaders thought only God could forgive sins and said Jesus was blaspheming. Jesus asked them if it was easier to say “Your sins are forgiven” or “Get up and walk” (Matthew 9:5). He meant that forgiving sins is just as powerful as healing a sick person, and he used those words to prove he had the power to forgive sins. It also makes sense that since death and suffering come from sin, being forgiven means being saved from death and suffering. This kind of complete salvation is what faithful people will have after Judgment Day, thanks to Jesus Christ, who is called our Savior.

There are also examples of specific kinds of salvation in the Bible, like when God saved Israel from their enemies. For example, “As the Lord lives who saves Israel” (1 Samuel 14:39), or “You are my Savior; you save me from violence” (2 Samuel 22:3), and when God saved the Israelites from the Assyrians (2 Kings 13:5). These are easy to understand because they talk about saving people from temporary dangers.

But when it comes to the big, final salvation, which will happen in heaven, it’s harder to say exactly where it will be. Some think that because a kingdom is a place made by people to keep them safe from enemies and want, this salvation might happen on earth.
