Introduction

Nature is the way God made and controls the world. People try to copy this by creating artificial animals. Since life is just movement of body parts starting from a main part inside, can’t we say that machines that move by themselves, like watches with springs and wheels, have a kind of artificial life? The heart is like a spring, the nerves are like strings, and the joints are like wheels that move the body, just like a skilled maker planned it. Humans have even copied something amazing in nature—people themselves.

By art (or skill), people create something called the Commonwealth or State, which is like a giant artificial person. It is bigger and stronger than a real person and exists to protect and defend people. The leader of the state is like the soul, giving life and movement to the whole body. Judges and officers are like joints, making the body move. Rewards and punishments are like nerves, making sure every part does its job. The wealth of the people is the body’s strength. The safety of the people is the state’s goal. Advisors who give important information are like memory. Laws and fairness are like reason and will. Peace is health, rebellion is sickness, and civil war is death. The agreements that create this body politic are like God saying “Let us make man” when he created the world.

To explain this artificial person, I will first talk about what it is made of and who makes it—both are people.

Second, I will explain how it is made through agreements, what rights and power the leader has, and what keeps it together or causes it to fall apart.

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
