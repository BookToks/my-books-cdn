Thoughts are like scouts and spies that go out to find what our desires want. All steady and quick movements of the mind come from these thoughts. Having no desire at all is like being dead. Having weak feelings is boring. Having feelings for everything without caring is confusing and distracting. Having really strong feelings more than usual is what people call madness.

There are almost as many kinds of madness as there are kinds of feelings. Sometimes, crazy strong feelings happen because the body isn’t working right or is hurt. Other times, the feelings themselves hurt the body if they last too long. But in both cases, it’s the same kind of madness.

The feelings that cause madness when they are too strong or last too long are usually pride or deep sadness.

Pride can make a person angry, and too much anger is called rage or fury. For example, wanting revenge too much can hurt the body and turn into rage. Too much love mixed with jealousy can also turn into rage. Thinking too highly of yourself, like believing you are inspired or very smart, can make you confused and dizzy. If that pride is mixed with envy, it turns into rage. Being very sure about something but having others disagree can also cause rage.

Sadness can cause fear for no real reason, which is a kind of madness called melancholy. This can show in many ways, like avoiding people, acting superstitious, or being scared of someone or something. In short, any feeling that makes someone act strange and unusual is called madness. There are many types of madness, and if someone tried, they could list a huge number of them. If madness is caused by too much of a feeling, then all feelings that lead to bad things are different levels of madness.

For example, some people might not show crazy actions even if they believe they are inspired, but when many of them come together, their anger is very clear. What could be crazier than a big group shouting, hitting, and throwing stones at our best friends?
