In Acts 6:3, it’s clear that even though the Apostles said who should be chosen, the whole group of people actually picked them. This is even clearer in Acts 6:5, where it says the idea pleased everyone, and they chose seven men.

In the Old Testament, only the tribe of Levi could be priests and do other church jobs. The land was split among the other tribes, but not Levi. When the tribe of Joseph was split into Ephraim and Manasseh, there were still twelve tribes. The Levites were given certain cities to live in and places for their animals, but instead of land, they got a tenth of the crops from the other tribes.

The priests got a tenth of that tenth, plus some offerings and sacrifices. God told Aaron, “You won’t get land or a share with the rest; I am your inheritance among the Israelites” (Numbers 18:20). Since God was King then and made the Levites His special helpers, He gave them this part of the public money, which was the tithes and offerings. That’s what God meant when He said, “I am your inheritance.” 

Because of this, the Levites could be called clergy, from the word meaning “inheritance” or “lot.” It doesn’t mean they were more special in God’s kingdom than others, but that God’s inheritance was their support. At that time, God was their King, and Moses, Aaron, and later priests acted for Him. So, the right to collect tithes and offerings was made by the government.

When the people asked for a human king instead of God, they still got the same money. The kings didn’t take this away from the priests because the public money belonged to whoever was in charge — which was the king until the Captivity. After the Captivity, people still paid tithes to the priests like before. So, church life depended on the government back then.
