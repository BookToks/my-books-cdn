Sometimes, people who couldn’t speak clearly were seen by non-Jewish groups as giving prophecies. This was because the prophets of those groups, who got a special kind of spirit or feeling from a place called the Pythian Oracle at Delphi, acted like they were crazy for a while and spoke like madmen. Even though their words didn’t always make sense, people could twist them to mean anything, kind of like how everything is made from basic stuff.

In the Bible, there’s a similar idea in these words: “And the evil spirit came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house.” (I Samuel 18:10) The word “prophet” can mean many things in the Bible, but most of the time, it means someone who hears directly from God and then tells His message to other people.

This makes us wonder: how exactly does God talk to a prophet? Some might ask, can we really say God has a voice or language if He doesn’t have a mouth or body like us? The prophet David said, “Shall He that made the eye not see? Or He that made the ear not hear?” (Psalms 94:9) This doesn’t mean God has eyes and ears like humans, but it’s a way to show respect and say God is powerful enough to know and hear everything.

If we took this too literally, we might think God has a body like ours, which wouldn’t make sense or be respectful. So, when the Bible says God spoke directly to people, it means God found some way—whatever it was—to help them understand His will. There are many ways God can do this, and we can find clues about them only in the Bible. Sometimes the Bible says God spoke without explaining how, but other times it tells signs that show His presence and commands, and from those we can guess how God spoke to them.

The Bible doesn’t say how God talked to Adam, Eve, Cain, or Noah. It also doesn’t explain how God spoke to Abraham until he left his country and came to a place called Sichem in the land of Canaan. Then, it says God appeared to him.
