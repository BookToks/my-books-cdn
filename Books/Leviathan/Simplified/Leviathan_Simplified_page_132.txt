A man cannot say that the people of Athens wanted the right to banish others, or that an Athenian had the freedom to joke or be fair whenever they wanted.

The freedom often talked about in stories and philosophy from the ancient Greeks and Romans, and in the writings of those who learned from them, is not the freedom of individual people. It is the freedom of the whole country or state. This freedom means the same thing as if there were no laws or government at all. The results are also the same. 

When people have no leader, they are always fighting each other. There is no way to pass things down to children, no real ownership of land or goods, no safety, but complete and total freedom for each person. Similarly, countries that don’t depend on others have complete freedom to do what they want, decided by their leaders or representatives, to help their own people.

But these countries live like they are always at war, with their borders ready for battle and weapons set up against neighbors. The Athenians and Romans were free, meaning their countries were free. It didn’t mean individuals could go against their leaders, but that their leaders had the freedom to fight or invade others. For example, the city of Luca has the word “Libertas” (freedom) on its walls, but that doesn’t mean any one person there has more freedom or fewer duties than someone in Constantinople.

Whether a country is ruled by a king or by the people, the freedom is the same.

It’s easy for people to be tricked by the fancy word “freedom.” Without good thinking, they might confuse the rights of the whole country with their own personal rights. When popular writers say the same wrong thing, it’s no surprise that people rebel or governments change. 

In the Western world, we learn about how countries should work from Aristotle, Cicero, and other Greeks and Romans who lived in popular states. They didn’t get these ideas from nature, but copied what they saw in their own governments, just like grammar books describe language based on how people spoke, or poetry rules come from Homer and Virgil’s poems.
