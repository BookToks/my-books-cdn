Until then, the power to decide which books were part of Scripture belonged to the civil rulers.

Besides the Book of the Law, there were no other books accepted by the Jews as God's law from Moses' time until after the Captivity. Most of the prophets lived around the time of the Captivity or just before it, and their prophecies were not widely accepted as laws. In fact, some of these prophets were even persecuted by false prophets and kings who were tricked by them. The Book of the Law, confirmed by Josiah as God's law, along with the history of God's works, was lost during the Captivity and when Jerusalem was attacked. This is shown in II Esdras 14:21, which says, "Your law is burned; so no one knows what you have done or what will happen." Before the Captivity, between the time the law was lost (probably when King Shishak of Egypt took treasures from the Temple) and when Josiah found it again, the people had no written word from God and instead followed their own ideas or those of people they thought were prophets.

From this, we can understand that the Old Testament Scriptures we have today were not considered official or law for the Jews until they renewed their agreement with God after returning from the Captivity and rebuilding their community under Esdras. From that time on, these writings were accepted as Jewish law, translated into Greek by seventy elders, and placed in the library of Ptolemy in Alexandria, where they were recognized as God's word.

Since Esdras was the high priest, and the high priest was also the civil leader, it is clear that Scriptures were only made laws by the ruling civil power.

Looking at the writings of early Christian leaders before Christianity was officially accepted by Emperor Constantine, we see that most Christians already believed the books of the New Testament were inspired by the Holy Spirit. Because of this, they accepted these books as the official rule of faith. They respected their teachers a lot, just like students respect their first teachers when learning any important lessons.
