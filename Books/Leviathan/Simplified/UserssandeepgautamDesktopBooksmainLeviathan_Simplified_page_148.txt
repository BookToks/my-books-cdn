When a baby king is too young to rule, the person before him can choose someone to take care of the whole kingdom. This person is called a protector or regent. Everyone has to listen to what this protector says, but only if they speak in the king’s name and don’t go against the king’s power.

Sometimes, a king or ruling group gives control of just one part of the kingdom to a governor, lieutenant, prefect, or viceroy. People living in that part must follow what this leader says, as long as it is in the king’s name and doesn’t go against the king’s rights. These protectors and governors only have the power the king gives them. No one can say they have the king’s power unless the king clearly says so. These leaders are like the nerves and muscles that help a body move.

Other people have special jobs. Some work with the country’s money, like collecting taxes, rents, or fines, keeping track of it, and using it properly. These people are called public ministers because they work for the leader and must follow orders.

Others take care of the army and weapons. They guard forts and ports, hire and pay soldiers, and make sure everything needed for war is ready. But a soldier without a leader doesn’t represent the country because only those with command represent the leader to the people they lead.

There are also people who teach others about their duties to the ruler and what is right and wrong. This helps people live peacefully and resist enemies. These teachers are public ministers too because they teach by the ruler’s authority, not their own. Only the king or ruling group has the power from God to teach the people directly. Everyone else gets their power from God through the king.
