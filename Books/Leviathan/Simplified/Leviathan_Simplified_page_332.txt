It would have been very strange if, in a town where people had only ever chosen leaders by voting together, the new Christians had thought of picking their teachers and leaders, called presbyters or bishops, in any other way. St. Paul even suggested choosing them by many votes, as we see in the Bible (Acts 14:23).

Before the emperors stepped in to keep peace, bishops were always chosen by the Christian gatherings in each town.

This is still true today when picking the bishops of Rome. If a bishop could choose his own replacement when he moved to another city, then he should have been able to pick his successor where he lived and died. But we never see any bishop of Rome picking his own successor. Instead, the people chose them, like when there was a big fight between Damasus and Ursinus. The fight was so bad that the city official had to leave, and over a hundred people died in the church during that time.

Later on, bishops were chosen by the church leaders in Rome, called the clergy and then the cardinals, but never appointed by the previous bishop. So, if the bishops didn’t have the right to pick their own successors, it’s fair to say they didn’t have the right to pick other bishops’ successors either, unless they got special permission from someone with real authority, like the government.

The original word for minister, Diakonos, means someone who helps another person by choice, not because they have to like a servant does. Ministers are only responsible for what they agree to do. Both the people who teach God’s word and those who handle the church’s everyday work are ministers, but they serve different groups of people. The church leaders who teach are called “ministers of the word” (Acts 6).
