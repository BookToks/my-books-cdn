The pastors of the Church are supposed to be supported by the people they serve, just like the priests who shared in what was given at the altar. But pastors can’t decide how much or what kind of support they get on their own. Their support should come from the kindness and generosity of each person in their group or from the whole group together.

However, the whole group couldn’t make official rules about this because their decisions weren’t laws back then. So, before kings or rulers made laws about it, pastors depended on the goodwill of their followers. Just like those who worked at the altar lived off the offerings, pastors could only take what was freely given to them, not demand what wasn’t offered.

They couldn’t go to court to ask for money because there were no courts for them. Even if they had judges among themselves, they didn’t have the power to enforce their decisions. So, the only way pastors could have a steady support was if the whole group agreed, and if rulers made laws about it. 

The rule about tithes from Moses’ Law didn’t apply to ministers of the Gospel because Moses and the priests were also the leaders of the people under God, and their kingdom was already here. But Christ’s kingdom is still coming.

So far, we’ve learned who pastors are and what they are supposed to do: preach, teach, baptize, and lead their groups. We also learned about church discipline, like excommunication, which means cutting someone off from the church. Where Christianity was illegal, this meant leaving the group of excommunicated people. Where it was legal, it meant kicking out the excommunicated from the church.

The pastors were chosen by the people in the church, and they were blessed by other pastors. They didn’t get paid a salary but lived off their own belongings, work, and the gifts from thankful Christians. Now, we will think about what role rulers who believe in Christianity have in the Church.
