Obedience is sometimes called charity and love because they both mean wanting to obey. Jesus says that loving God and loving others is like following all the rules. Obedience is also called righteousness because that means wanting to do what is right and follow the laws. Sometimes it is called repentance because repenting means turning away from doing wrong and choosing to obey instead. So, anyone who truly wants to follow God's commands, feels sorry for their mistakes, and loves God and others has all the obedience needed to enter God's kingdom. If God asked for perfect innocence, no one could be saved.

But what are the commands God has given us? Are all the laws given to the Jews by Moses from God? If they are, why don’t Christians have to follow them? If not, what other laws do we have besides the law of nature?

Jesus didn’t give us new laws but told us to follow the laws we already have, like natural laws and the laws from our rulers. In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus didn’t make new laws for the Jews but explained the laws Moses gave them. So, the laws of God are just the natural laws, and the most important one is to keep our promises and obey our leaders, who were chosen by agreement among people. This law to obey rulers also means we should follow the Bible’s rules only if our leaders have made them official laws. Otherwise, the Bible’s rules are advice, and a person can choose not to follow them but risks consequences.

Now that we know what obedience is needed for salvation and who we must obey, we should think about faith: who do we believe and why? To believe someone, we must first know what they say. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and the prophets believed in God because He spoke to them directly in a supernatural way. The Apostles and Disciples who spent time with Jesus believed in Him personally.
