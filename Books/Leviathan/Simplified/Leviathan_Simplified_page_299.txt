We will talk about this more in the next chapter.

There are three main jobs that the Messiah has, according to the Bible. First, he is a redeemer or savior. Second, he is a pastor, counselor, or teacher, like a prophet sent by God to help people who are chosen for salvation. Third, he is a king—an eternal king—but still under God the Father, like Moses and the high priests were in their time.

These three jobs match three important times. Jesus did the first job when he came the first time by dying on the cross to save us from our sins. He started the second job then too, teaching and guiding people, and now his followers continue that work until he comes back. When he comes again, he will begin his eternal kingdom and rule forever over those who belong to him.

As a redeemer, Jesus paid the price for our sins, which is death. He was sacrificed and took on our wrongdoings as God required. It’s not that one person’s death could fully pay for everyone’s sins by strict justice, but God showed mercy and accepted this sacrifice. In the old law, every year an atonement was made for the sins of all Israel. The high priest Aaron would sacrifice a bull for himself and the priests, and two goats for the people. One goat was sacrificed, and the other, called the scapegoat, had the people’s sins placed on it and was sent away into the wilderness to take those sins away.

Just like the one sacrificed goat was enough to pay for all of Israel’s sins, the death of Jesus is enough to pay for the sins of all people because nothing more was needed.
