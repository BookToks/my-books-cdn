Paul says, "Kids, obey your parents in everything because this makes the Lord happy." He also says, "Servants, obey your masters in everything, not just when they are watching, but sincerely, as if you are serving the Lord." This is said even when the masters don’t believe in God, yet servants are still told to obey them in all things.

Paul also talks about obeying rulers, telling people to "submit to the higher powers," because all power comes from God. We should obey them not just because we are afraid of punishment, but because it’s the right thing to do. Peter says, "Submit to every human authority for the Lord’s sake, whether it’s the king or governors, who punish wrongdoers and praise those who do good, because this is God’s will."

Paul also reminds people to obey leaders and authorities. These rulers Peter and Paul talked about did not believe in God, so it makes even more sense that we should obey Christian leaders who have been given power by God. So, how can we be forced to obey a minister of Christ if they tell us to go against the king or government that protects us? It’s clear that Christ’s ministers don’t have the right to command others unless they also have civil authority.

But someone might ask, what if the king or government stops us from believing in Christ? I say that doesn’t work because no one can make you believe or not believe by ordering you. Faith is a gift from God that no one can give or take away by rewards or threats. If we’re told to say out loud that we don’t believe, should we obey? Saying something with our mouth is just an outward action, like a sign of obedience. A Christian who truly believes in their heart has the same freedom as Naaman the Syrian, a man who believed in God but had to bow down in the house of Rimmon because of his master. Naaman asked God to forgive him for this because his heart was true, even though his actions showed otherwise.
