Wanting a lot of money and wanting a lot of respect are seen as honorable because they show someone has power. But wanting just a little money or a small job is not honorable.

It doesn't matter if a big and difficult action is fair or unfair; what matters for honor is that it shows power. That’s why ancient people didn’t think they were disrespecting their gods when they told stories about them doing bad things like stealing or cheating. In fact, they often praised gods like Jupiter for his affairs and Mercury for his tricks and thefts. For example, Homer wrote a poem saying Mercury invented music by noon and stole Apollo’s cattle before night.

Before big countries were formed, being a pirate or a robber wasn’t seen as shameful but was a normal job for many people, including the Greeks and others. Even today, in some places, private duels are seen as honorable, even if they are illegal. Duels show courage, and courage comes from strength or skill, which means power. But often duels happen because people say things without thinking or are afraid of losing respect, so they fight to avoid embarrassment.

Family shields and coats of arms are honorable only if they come with special privileges or wealth, which show power. This kind of honor, called "gentry," comes from the ancient Germans. It never existed where German customs didn’t exist. Ancient Greek soldiers painted their shields to show their identity, but they didn’t pass those designs to their children. The Romans kept family marks, but those were just images, not special symbols passed down. People in Asia, Africa, and America never had this tradition. Only the Germans had it, and it spread to England, France, Spain, and Italy when the Germans helped or conquered those lands.
