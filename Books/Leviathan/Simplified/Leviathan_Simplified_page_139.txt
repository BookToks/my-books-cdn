Sometimes, it’s hard or even impossible to explain limits clearly in writing. So, regular laws that apply to everyone decide what a representative can legally do when the official papers don’t say anything about it.

If the representative is just one person, anything they do that isn’t allowed by their official papers or the laws is their own action, not the action of the group they represent or anyone else. This is because beyond what their papers or the laws say, they only represent themselves. But when they act within those limits, everyone in the group is responsible for it, since the representative speaks for them all.

If the representative is a group, anything the group decides that isn’t allowed by their official papers or laws is the group’s action and the action of everyone who voted for it. But it’s not the action of anyone who voted against it or wasn’t there, unless they agreed beforehand. The group’s decision counts because most members agreed. If the decision is illegal, the group can be punished, like being shut down or losing their official status. But those who didn’t vote for the bad decision are not guilty because the group can’t force people to do things outside their authority.

If the whole group is represented by one person and that person borrows money from someone outside the group, the debt belongs to the representative. This is because if the representative had the power to make others pay back the loan, they would basically control the whole group. So, that kind of power is either invalid because it’s a mistake or, if accepted, it means the representative is the boss, which isn’t the case we’re talking about here.
