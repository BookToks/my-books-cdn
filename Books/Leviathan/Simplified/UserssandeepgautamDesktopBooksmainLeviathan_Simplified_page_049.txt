The Scriptures say that the “spirit of God in man” means a person’s spirit that is drawn to being good and godly. When it says, “Whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom to make garments for Aaron,” it doesn’t mean God put a special spirit inside them to make clothes, but that they used their own wisdom for that work.

In the same way, when a person’s spirit causes bad actions, it’s often called an unclean spirit. Other spirits are sometimes called good or bad depending on how powerful or special they are. The prophets in the Old Testament didn’t claim to be taken over by God; instead, God spoke to them through voices, visions, or dreams. When they talked about the “burden of the Lord,” it was a command, not a possession.

So, how did the Jews start thinking people were possessed? I think it’s because people don’t usually try to find natural reasons for strange things. They like enjoying simple pleasures and don’t look deeper. When they see someone acting very differently, they don’t think it’s normal or natural. So, they believe it must be supernatural—either God or the Devil is inside that person. That’s why when Jesus was surrounded by crowds, some thought he was crazy, and others said he had a demon. Some even said the opposite, that he was a prophet.

In the Old Testament, when a man came to anoint Jehu as king, some people called him a madman. People often thought anyone acting very differently was possessed by a good or bad spirit. The Sadducees didn’t believe in spirits at all, which was almost like not believing in God, so others called those men “demoniacs” instead of just crazy.

But why did Jesus heal possessed people as if they were possessed and not just crazy? I don’t have a better answer than what people say when Scripture talks about the Earth moving—they just accept it without full explanation.
