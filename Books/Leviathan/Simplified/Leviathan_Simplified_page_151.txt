XXIV: About the Food and Growth of a Country

The food and growth of a country depend on having enough stuff that helps people live. This means getting the materials, preparing them, and then sharing them with everyone in a way that works well.

The amount of stuff is limited by nature to what comes from the land and the sea—things that God either gives freely or sells to people through work.

These things, like animals, plants, and minerals, are all given to us by God and are found on or near the earth’s surface. So, all we really need to do is work hard to gather them. Because of this, having plenty mostly depends on how hard people work, after God’s help.

These materials, often called goods, are sometimes from inside the country and sometimes from other places. Native goods come from the country itself, and foreign goods are brought in from outside.

No country, unless it is very big, can make everything it needs. Most countries produce some things more than they need. The extra goods aren’t wasted; they help get what the country lacks by trading with others, through fair deals, war, or work. A person’s work is also a kind of good that can be traded for something useful.

Some countries have very little land, only enough for people to live on, but they have still grown strong. They did this by trading goods between places and by selling things they made, even though the raw materials came from somewhere else.
