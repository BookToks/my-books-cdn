Now it is clear that the civil government and the power of the country are actually the same thing. Since having the highest authority and the power to make rules means having a government, it follows that if one group is in charge and another group also has supreme power, both making laws and rules, there must be two governments over the same people. This is like a kingdom divided against itself, which cannot last.

Even though some people say one power is about worldly matters and the other about spiritual matters, they are still two governments. Every person would have to obey two bosses. Since the spiritual leaders say they have the right to decide what is a sin, that means they also claim to decide what is against the law, because sin is breaking the law. But the civil leaders also say they have the right to make the law. So people would have to obey two rulers, each demanding their rules be followed, which is impossible.

If there is only one kingdom, then either the civil power must be under the spiritual power, meaning the spiritual leaders are really in charge, or the spiritual power must be under the civil power, meaning the government is in charge. When these two powers fight each other, the country is in big danger of civil war and falling apart.

The civil government is easier to see and understand, so many people will support it. The spiritual power, though harder to understand because of confusing ideas and words, still scares people enough to have followers who can cause trouble or even destroy the country.

This problem is like epilepsy, which the Jews once thought was caused by evil spirits. In epilepsy, a strange spirit or wind in the head stops the nerves from working right, causing violent and uncontrolled movements. A person might fall into water or fire because they lose control of their senses.

Similarly, when the spiritual power controls the people by fear of punishment and hope of reward—things that normally keep a country working—without the guidance of the civil government, which is like the soul of the country, and uses confusing words that block people’s understanding, it causes chaos. This confuses and divides the people, either crushing the country through oppression or burning it with civil war.
