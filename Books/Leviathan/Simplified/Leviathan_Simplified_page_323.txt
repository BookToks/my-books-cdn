Only Moses at first, and later the high priest, had the power from God to make the Ten Commandments law for the people of Israel. Moses, Aaron, and the later high priests were the civil rulers. So, making the Scriptures into law was the job of the civil rulers.

The judicial law, which are the rules God gave to judges to help them make fair decisions between people, and the Levitical law, which are the rules about the priests’ ceremonies, were all given by Moses. These laws became official because God told the people to obey Moses. It’s not clear if these laws were written down or just spoken by Moses after he spent forty days with God, but they were all real laws and treated like Holy Scripture.

When the Israelites reached the plains of Moab near Jericho and were about to enter the Promised Land, Moses added more laws. These are called Deuteronomy, meaning “Second Laws.” They were part of a new agreement God made with the Israelites besides the one made at Horeb. Moses explained the old laws at the start of Deuteronomy, then added new ones from chapter twelve to twenty-six. The people were told to write these laws on big stones as they crossed the Jordan River. Moses also wrote them in a book and gave it to the priests and elders. They were told to keep this book next to the Ark of the Covenant, which only held the Ten Commandments. Moses said the kings of Israel should keep a copy of these laws. This book was lost for a while but was found again in the Temple during King Josiah’s time, and he made it the law of God again. Both Moses and Josiah had the civil authority to do this.
