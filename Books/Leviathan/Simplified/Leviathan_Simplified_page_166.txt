In all courts, the highest power (which is the government) is the one who makes the final decisions. Judges below the highest power should think about the reasons why the government made a law, so their decisions match the government's. If not, their decision is just their own and unfair.

A law is basically a command. A command shows what the person in charge wants, through speaking, writing, or other clear ways. But the law only counts for people who can actually learn about it. People like very young kids, people who can't understand, or animals don’t have laws because they can’t understand or agree to them. Also, anyone who, by no fault of their own, can’t know about a law is excused if they don’t follow it. So, it’s important to know what counts as a clear sign or proof that a law exists, meaning what the government wants, whether it’s a monarchy or another type of government.

If a law applies to everyone without exception, but it’s not written down or announced where people can hear about it, then it’s a law of nature. Laws that everyone can know by using their own reason don’t need to be announced by others. The law of nature is simple and agreed on by everyone: don’t do to others what you wouldn’t want done to you.
