In the Bible, it says that people who don’t understand the right way will stay with giants. Job also says that giants are groaning underwater, and those who live with them too. So, the place for the punished might be under water.

Also, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by God with fire and burning sulfur because they were very evil. The land around them became a dirty, smelly lake. That’s why sometimes the place for the punished is described as fire or a burning lake. For example, in Revelation, it says that scared and wicked people will be part of a lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is called the second death. This fire doesn’t mean a real place of torture but means destruction. Later, it says that death and hell will be thrown into the lake of fire, meaning they will be destroyed. After that, no one will die or go to hell anymore.

Another example is the plague of darkness in Egypt, where people couldn’t see or move for three days, but the Israelites had light in their homes. So, after judgment, the place for the wicked is called complete darkness, or “darkness outside.” This is shown when a king orders a man without a wedding garment to be tied up and thrown into “external darkness.” This doesn’t mean how dark it is but that the darkness is outside where God’s chosen people aren’t.
