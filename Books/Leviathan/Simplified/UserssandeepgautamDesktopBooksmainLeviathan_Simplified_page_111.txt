Ninthly, being the ruler means having the power to decide when to go to war or make peace with other countries or groups. This means deciding what’s best for everyone, how big the army should be, how it should be armed, and how to pay for it by collecting money from the people. The strength of the army depends on everyone working together under one leader, and that leader is the ruler. So, whoever is in charge of the army has the highest power.

Tenthly, the ruler also gets to choose all the helpers like advisers, ministers, judges, and officers during peace and war. Since the ruler’s job is to keep peace and protect everyone, they can pick whoever they think will do the best job.

Eleventhly, the ruler has the power to give rewards like money or honors, and to punish people by fines, physical punishment, or shame. This is done according to the laws the ruler made before, or if there are no laws, the ruler decides what will encourage people to help the country or stop them from causing trouble.

Lastly, because people naturally care a lot about themselves, want respect from others, and don’t always value other people, fights and wars can happen, which weakens everyone. That’s why there need to be rules about honor and a system to recognize those who have done good for the country. Someone also needs to make sure these rules are followed. It has already been said that the ruler controls not only the army but also the courts that settle arguments. So, the ruler also decides who gets titles, what rank people hold, and how they should show respect to each other in public or private.
