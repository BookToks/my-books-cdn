When people are unhappy with those running a democracy or aristocracy, they shouldn’t just use mean names to show their anger. Instead, they call one anarchy, and the other oligarchy, or the rule of a few. What really bothers people is that they aren’t ruled the way each person wants, but the way the leader or group in charge thinks is best. This is called arbitrary government. People give bad names to their leaders because they don’t realize—until maybe after a civil war—that without this kind of government, fighting would never stop. It’s not words or promises that keep laws strong, but people and weapons.

Another mistake is the idea that in a good country, laws should rule, not people. But anyone who can think, even if they can’t read or write, knows they are ruled by laws they fear because breaking them can hurt or kill them. Laws are not just words on paper—they have power because of the people who enforce them. This wrong idea makes people dislike their leaders and listen to those who call them tyrants, thinking it’s okay to start wars against them. Sometimes, even church leaders support this idea.

There is one more wrong idea they have, which didn’t come from Aristotle, Cicero, or other ancient thinkers. They want laws to control not just what people do, but what they think and believe, by forcing people to explain their beliefs. This can make people punished for telling the truth or forced to lie to avoid punishment. It’s okay for leaders to ask a preacher if they agree to teach certain ideas and to fire them if they refuse. But forcing someone to confess their beliefs when their actions aren’t illegal goes against natural law. This is especially bad when people teach that if someone believes the wrong thing about faith, they will be punished forever. Who wouldn’t want to protect their soul by trusting their own judgment instead of someone else’s when the stakes are so high?
