In every Christian country, the civil ruler is like the top pastor in charge of all the people. This means that the ruler is the one who gives power to other pastors to teach and do their church jobs. So, all pastors get their right to teach and preach from the ruler and they work for him, just like town leaders, judges, and army commanders work for the main ruler of the country.

This is not because the teachers are in charge, but because the people who listen to them are the ruler’s subjects. For example, if a Christian king lets another king (like the Pope) pick pastors in his land, that doesn’t mean the other king is in charge of him or his people. If that happened, the king would lose his power. The king’s power depends on how much people respect him and fear punishment after death. It can’t depend on teachers who might be ambitious or ignorant like anyone else.

If someone from another country is allowed to pick teachers, it’s only because the main ruler gave them permission. Christian teachers are like schoolmasters for Christianity, but kings are like dads of families. They can accept teachers recommended by others, but not because those others tell them to. Especially if bad teaching benefits the one who suggested the teachers. Kings don’t have to keep those teachers longer than it’s good for the people they rule over.

So, if someone asks a pastor, like the religious leaders asked Jesus, “By what authority do you do these things?” the pastor can only say that he does it because the government, through the king or its representatives, gave him that power. All pastors, except the top one, do their work by the ruler’s authority.
