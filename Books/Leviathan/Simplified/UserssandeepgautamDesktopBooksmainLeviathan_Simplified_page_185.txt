If someone breaks the law, and they are supposed to follow that law, then what they did is a crime.

If a person has no way to know the law, they are excused because a law you can’t know isn’t something you have to follow. But if someone just doesn’t try to learn the law, that’s not an excuse. Anyone who can think for themselves should be able to understand natural laws, except for kids and people who are mentally ill.

If a person is a prisoner or under the control of an enemy, and it’s not their fault, they don’t have to follow the law. They have to obey the enemy to stay alive, and obeying under those conditions isn’t a crime. When the law can’t protect you, you have to protect yourself however you can.

If someone is forced to break the law because they are afraid of dying right now, they are excused. No law can make someone give up trying to stay alive. Even if there was such a law, the person would think, “If I don’t do it, I die now; if I do it, I die later, so I’ll do it to live longer.” Nature forces them to act this way.

If someone has no food or things they need to live, and the only way to survive is to break the law—like stealing food during a famine or taking someone’s sword to protect themselves—they are excused for the same reason as before.

If someone does something against the law because another person in power told them to, they aren’t blamed for that by the person who gave the orders, because they were just following orders. But the person who gets hurt is still a victim, and both the one giving orders and the one following them are breaking the law. So, if the ruler or government tells someone to do something that breaks an older law, the person doing it is excused because the ruler made the new command. The ruler can’t punish someone for obeying their orders. Also, when the ruler changes a law by ordering something different, it means the old law no longer counts for that situation.
