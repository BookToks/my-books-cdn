The name "prophet" can also be given to people in Christian churches who are called to say public prayers for everyone. In the same way, the prophets who came down from the hill of God with musical instruments, like Saul, are said to prophesy because they praised God publicly (I Samuel, 10:5-6, 10). Miriam is also called a prophetess for this reason (Exodus, 15:20). 

This is also what St. Paul meant when he said, “Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered,” and “every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered” (I Corinthians, 11:4-5). Here, prophecy means praising God with psalms and holy songs, which women were allowed to do in church even if they couldn’t speak to the group. 

In this way, poets of other religions who wrote hymns and poems to honor their gods were also called prophets. This is clear when St. Paul talks about Cretans and says a prophet among them said they were liars (Titus, 1:12). St. Paul didn’t mean their poets were true prophets, but he recognized that the word "prophet" was often used for people who praised gods in verse.

When prophecy means predicting the future, prophets were those who spoke for God and told others what God had revealed to them. But also, there were many fake prophets who claimed to predict events by using spirits or superstitions, often guessing from past events. These fake prophets sometimes got more attention for one lucky guess than they lost for many wrong ones.

Prophecy is not a skill or a steady job. When it means predicting the future, it is a special and temporary gift from God, usually given to good people but sometimes also to bad ones. For example, the woman of Endor, who used a spirit to raise an image of Samuel and told Saul he would die, was not really a prophetess. She didn’t have any true power to do this, and God didn’t tell her to do it. Instead, God allowed that trick to scare Saul and cause him to lose the battle.
