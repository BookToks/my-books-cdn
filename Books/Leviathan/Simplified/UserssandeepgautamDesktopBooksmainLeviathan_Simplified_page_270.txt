But when we see something that might have a natural cause, no matter how rare it is; or if it happens a lot but we can’t figure out how it happens naturally, we don’t get amazed or call it a miracle.

So, if a horse or a cow started talking, that would be a miracle because it’s really strange and hard to explain naturally. The same goes if we saw a weird new kind of animal. But when a man or any animal has babies like themselves, even though we don’t really know how it works, it’s normal, so it’s not a miracle. If a man turned into a stone or a pillar, that would be a miracle because it’s strange. But if a piece of wood changed like that, it’s not a miracle because it happens often. Still, we don’t understand how God might do either one.

The very first rainbow ever seen was a miracle because it was new and strange. It was a sign from God put in the sky to promise people He wouldn’t flood the whole world again. But now, rainbows happen a lot, so they aren’t miracles anymore, whether people understand why they happen or not. Also, people make many amazing things using art or skill, but when we know how they’re made, we don’t call them miracles because they’re made by humans, not directly by God.

Since people have different levels of knowledge and experience, what seems like a miracle to one person might not seem like one to another. That’s why some people who don’t understand things well get amazed by stuff others know happens naturally (which is God’s usual work). For example, some people think solar and lunar eclipses are supernatural, but others can even predict exactly when they will happen. Or, if someone secretly knows what another person did before and tells them, the person might think it’s a miracle, but smart people know that’s not really a miracle.
