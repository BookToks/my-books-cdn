Not all actions are signs by nature. Some actions naturally show honor, while others show disrespect. People feel ashamed to do disrespectful things in front of those they respect, so these actions can’t be part of religious worship by human rules. But good behavior like being decent, humble, and modest is always part of worship.

There are many actions that don’t have a clear meaning. The government can decide which actions should be used publicly as signs of honor and part of worship, and people should follow this. The Bible says, “It is better to obey God than man,” and this applies in God’s kingdom by agreement, not by nature.

Now, about God’s natural kingdom and laws, I will briefly explain His natural punishments. Every action a person takes starts a long chain of consequences that no one can fully see the end of. These consequences include both good and bad results. So, if someone does something for pleasure, they must accept the pain that comes with it. These pains are the natural punishments for actions that cause more harm than good.

Because of this, things like drinking too much lead to sickness; being careless leads to accidents; being unfair brings enemies’ attacks; pride leads to downfall; being scared causes oppression; bad rulers face rebellion; and rebellion ends in death. Punishments happen when laws are broken, so natural punishments happen when natural laws are broken, as natural results, not random ones.

This covers the rights of rulers and the duties of people, based on natural reason. But since most people in the world, especially in the West, learn morals from Rome and Athens, this idea is very different from their practice. Being a good ruler requires deep moral knowledge. I almost think my work is useless like Plato’s idea that governments won’t stop having problems until rulers become philosophers.

However, natural justice is the only important knowledge rulers and their main helpers need. They don’t need to study math like Plato said, except to encourage others to learn it. Also, no philosopher has clearly organized or fully proven all the rules about how to govern and obey. So, I hope someday a ruler will read my book carefully, without bias, and use full power to protect and teach these ideas, turning them from theory into real practice.
