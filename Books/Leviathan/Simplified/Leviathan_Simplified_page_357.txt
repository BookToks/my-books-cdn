Leviathan/357 The third point is about the See of St. Peter, which St. Cyprian calls the head, the source, the root, and the sun, meaning it’s where the power of bishops comes from. But by natural law, which is a better guide for right and wrong than what any human teacher says, the civil ruler in every country is the head, the source, the root, and the sun, where all power comes from. So, the power of bishops actually comes from the civil ruler.

The fourth point is about how their powers are not equal. It says, if God had given their power directly, then all bishops would have the same amount of power. But we see some bishops only have power over one town, others over many towns, and some over whole provinces. These differences were not decided by God. So, their power comes from people, not God. Some have more power, some less, depending on what the Prince of the Church wants. This idea would work if it was proven that the Pope has power over all Christians, but that hasn’t been proven. We know the Pope’s big power was given to him by the Roman emperors. The Patriarch of Constantinople also claimed equal power because he was bishop of the empire’s capital. So, all bishops get their power from the rulers where they work. Because of this, neither the Pope nor other bishops have power directly from God, except where the Pope is also the civil ruler.

The fifth point says: If bishops got their power straight from God, the Pope couldn’t take it away from them because he can’t go against God’s rules. This is true and well explained. But the Pope can take power away and has done so, but only in his own lands or in lands where rulers have given him that power. He can’t do this everywhere just because he’s Pope. That power belongs to each Christian ruler within their own country and can’t be separated from their rule. Before Israel had kings, the high priest was also the ruler and could make or remove lower priests. But after God told Samuel to set a king over Israel, the king had that power. If priests had power directly from God, the king couldn’t take it from them because he couldn’t go against God’s law.
