He said, “There will be fake Christs and false prophets who will do amazing miracles, even trying to trick God’s chosen people if that were possible.” This shows that false prophets might be able to perform miracles, but we should not believe their teachings as God’s truth.

St. Paul also told the Galatians that if anyone, even himself or an angel from heaven, preaches a different Gospel than the one he taught, they should be rejected. That Gospel said Christ is King, so any teaching against Jesus being King is wrong, according to St. Paul. His message was for those who already accepted Jesus as the King of the Jews.

Miracles alone don’t prove someone is telling God’s truth if their teaching is wrong. Also, teaching the right message without miracles isn’t enough to prove someone is really a prophet. For example, in Deuteronomy it says if a prophet predicts something and it doesn’t happen, then that prophet is lying out of pride and should not be feared.

But someone might ask, how can we know if a prophecy will come true if it’s about something far in the future? Because of that, miracles that make us believe a prophet should be backed up by something happening soon. So, the true signs of a real prophet are teaching God’s true religion and showing a miracle that happens right away.

Since miracles don’t happen anymore, we have no way to trust private people claiming to have special revelations or inspirations. We should only listen to teachings that agree with the Holy Scriptures. Since the time of Jesus, the Bible has replaced all other prophecies. By studying it carefully and wisely, we can understand what God and people expect from us without needing any crazy or supernatural messages.
