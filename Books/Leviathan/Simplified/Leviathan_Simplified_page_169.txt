If you’re supposed to listen to a public officer, just seeing their official paper with the government stamp and hearing it read, or having a way to find out about it if you want, is enough to prove they have the right power. Everyone has to try their best to learn about all the written laws that might affect what they do in the future.

The lawmaker is known, and the laws are shared either by writing or by common sense. But there’s one more really important thing that makes laws binding. It’s not just the exact words, but what they really mean—the true meaning the lawmaker intended. So, the meaning of all laws depends on the highest authority, and only the people that this authority chooses can explain the laws.

If not, an interpreter could twist the law to mean the opposite of what the ruler wanted, and then the interpreter would be like a lawmaker themselves.

All laws, whether written down or not, need someone to explain them. The natural law, which is easy to understand if you think fairly and without strong feelings, leaves no excuse for people who break it. But since almost everyone is sometimes selfish or emotional, natural law is actually the hardest to understand and needs good interpreters the most. Written laws can be misunderstood too. If they’re short, a word or two can have different meanings; if they’re long, many words can confuse people. So, no written law can be fully understood without knowing why it was made in the first place—that reason is known only by the lawmaker. The lawmaker can solve any problem with the law, either by finding a way to cancel it or by changing it however they want, just like Alexander cut the Gordian knot with his sword. No other interpreter can do that.

Understanding natural laws in a country doesn’t depend on books about moral philosophy. Writers don’t make their ideas into laws unless the country’s authority agrees, no matter how true those ideas are.
