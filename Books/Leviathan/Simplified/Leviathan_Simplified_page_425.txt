Sometimes, people explain natural events by saying they just happened by chance or fortune because they don’t understand the real reasons. They also blame mysterious qualities they don’t know about, like “occult qualities,” or use fancy words like sympathy and antipathy that don’t really explain what causes things to happen.

If this kind of thinking isn’t useless, then there has never been any useful philosophy. That’s why St. Paul warned us to stay away from it.

When it comes to ideas about right and wrong, or laws, they make even less sense. People say God is the cause of the law and everything that happens, but somehow not the cause of injustice, which breaks the law. That’s like saying the same person makes both a straight line and a crooked line, and also makes the difference between them. This kind of thinking is silly. It happens when people decide their answers before they understand the facts, trying to explain things that can’t really be explained. They use fancy ideas to support the idea of free will, meaning humans can choose freely without God’s control.

Old philosophers like Aristotle said good and evil depend on what people want or desire. That’s okay if everyone only follows their own wishes. But in a country or society, this doesn’t work. The law, which is what the whole society agrees on, decides what is good or bad, not just what one person wants. Still, many people judge what’s right or wrong based on their own feelings, ignoring the laws of the country. Only monks and friars, who promise to obey their leaders, really follow this idea. Judging right and wrong just by personal feelings is not only wrong but also harmful for society.

It’s also wrong to say marriage goes against being pure or chaste, or to say marriage is a moral mistake. Some people use this idea to stop priests from getting married, but that’s not true.
