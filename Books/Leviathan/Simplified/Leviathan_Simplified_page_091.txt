Some people think that the law of nature isn’t just about rules to keep people safe on Earth, but about getting eternal happiness after death. They believe breaking promises or rules might be okay if it helps with that. These people might think it’s good to kill, overthrow, or rebel against the government they agreed to follow. But since no one really knows what happens after death—only what others say they know—breaking promises can’t really be called reasonable or natural.

Others agree that keeping promises is part of natural law but say it doesn’t apply to certain people, like heretics or those who don’t keep their own promises. This, too, doesn’t make sense.

If someone’s fault is enough to cancel a promise, then it should have stopped the promise from being made in the first place.

When we call people just or unjust, it means something different than when we call actions just or unjust. Calling a person just means their behavior usually matches reason and fairness. Calling an action just means that specific thing was fair or reasonable. A just person tries hard to make all their actions fair, while an unjust person doesn’t care. We often use the words righteous and unrighteous for people, which mean about the same as just and unjust.

A righteous person doesn’t lose that title just because they make a few unfair actions by accident or in a moment of anger. Similarly, an unrighteous person doesn’t stop being unrighteous just because they avoid doing bad things out of fear. Their choice is based on what benefits them, not on fairness.

What makes human actions feel truly just is a kind of bravery and pride. This means a person won’t cheat or break promises just to make life easier. This kind of fairness in behavior is what people mean when they say justice is a virtue, and injustice is a bad habit.

But when justice is about specific actions, it doesn’t call people just or unjust, but innocent or guilty. A guilty person is someone who does wrong or causes harm.
