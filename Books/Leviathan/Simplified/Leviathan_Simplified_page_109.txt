Third, since most people have agreed on one leader, anyone who disagrees now has to go along with the group. They have to accept all decisions made by the leader or else they can be punished by the others. If someone joined the group on their own, that means they agreed to follow what the majority decides. So if they refuse to obey or complain about the decisions, they are breaking their promise and acting unfairly. Whether they are part of the group or not, and whether they were asked or not, they must either accept the decisions or stay in a state of conflict where anyone can fight them without being wrong.

Fourth, because every person in the group is responsible for what the leader does, none of the leader’s actions can hurt the people. No one should say the leader is being unfair. When someone acts with someone else’s permission, they are not hurting the one who gave permission. In this system, everyone is responsible for what the leader does, so if someone complains about being hurt by the leader, they are actually complaining about something they helped cause. They shouldn’t blame others or even themselves because you can’t really hurt yourself. It’s true that leaders can do wrong things, but not in a way that is unfair or harmful in the real sense.

Fifth, because of this, no leader can be punished or killed by the people for what they do. Since everyone is part of what the leader does, punishing the leader would be like punishing yourself.

Because the whole point of having a leader is to keep peace and protect everyone, the leader or group in charge has the right to decide the best ways to keep peace and stop problems. They can do anything they think is needed to prevent fights inside the group or attacks from outside. If peace is lost, they can do whatever it takes to bring it back.

Sixth, the leader also has the right to decide which ideas and beliefs are harmful or helpful to peace. They decide when and how people can speak to large groups and who can check books before they are shared with others.
