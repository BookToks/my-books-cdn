Fancy, or imagination, doesn’t belong in serious writing, but it can make the style look better.

When people praise or insult others, imagination is used a lot because the goal isn’t just to tell the truth, but to make someone look good or bad. This is done by using strong comparisons. Judgment helps decide what makes an action good or bad.

When giving advice or asking for something, whether you use truth or imagination depends on what works best. Sometimes you need more judgment, sometimes more imagination.

In serious talks, like proving something or making plans, truth is the most important thing. Sometimes you use imagination to explain ideas better, like with comparisons, but you shouldn’t use metaphors because they are like tricks and don’t belong in serious reasoning.

In any conversation, if you don’t use good judgment, no matter how creative you are, people will think you’re not smart. But if your judgment is clear, even simple ideas can seem smart.

People’s private thoughts can include all kinds of things, good or bad, without shame. But when speaking or writing, you have to think about the time, place, and audience. For example, a doctor can talk about gross stuff because it helps people, but someone else talking about the same things in a fun way would be rude. The difference is using good judgment.

Also, when you’re relaxed with friends, you can play with words and be funny. But in serious settings like a speech or in front of strangers, silly word games just look foolish. Again, it’s all about good judgment.

So, if someone seems dumb, it’s not because they lack imagination, but because they lack good judgment. Being smart means having judgment even without imagination, but imagination without judgment is not smart.

When someone has a goal and thinks about many things to reach it, noticing unusual or clever ideas is called prudence. This depends on experience and remembering similar situations before.
