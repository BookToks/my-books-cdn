Thomas Hobbes talks about the benefits a ruler gives to people because they are afraid the ruler could harm the community. These benefits aren’t really rewards or salaries because there’s no contract, and everyone is already supposed to behave well. They also aren’t gifts, because they come from fear, which shouldn’t be part of the ruler’s power. Instead, these benefits are like sacrifices the ruler makes to calm someone they think is stronger, but this doesn’t make people obey more. In fact, it can make people want to take even more.

Some salaries are fixed and come from public money, while others depend on how well someone does their job. The second kind can sometimes hurt the community, like with judges. When judges get paid more for handling more cases, two problems happen: people start making more complaints on purpose, and courts fight over which cases they get. But for jobs that don’t increase with effort, these problems don’t happen. This explains how punishment and reward work—they help keep a community running smoothly.

So far, I’ve explained human nature, where pride and feelings make people accept government. I compared the ruler’s power to Leviathan, a huge sea monster from the Bible, described as the king of the proud who fears nothing and rules over pride. But because the ruler is mortal and can die like all living things, and because there is something in heaven he should fear and obey, I will next talk about the ruler’s weaknesses and the natural laws he must follow.
