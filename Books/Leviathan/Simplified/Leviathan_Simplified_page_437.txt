Fairies don’t get married, but there are some evil spirits called incubi who do have sexual relations with real people. Priests also don’t get married.

Church leaders take the best parts of the land because people who don’t know better give it to them, and they also collect tithes (a kind of tax). This is like the fairy story where fairies sneak into farms and take the cream from the milk.

The story doesn’t say what kind of money fairies use. But church leaders accept the same money we do. When they pay for things, it’s usually with special religious acts like canonizations, indulgences, and masses.

There are some similarities between the pope’s power and the kingdom of fairies. Just like fairies only exist in the imagination of people who believe old stories, the pope’s spiritual power outside his own country depends mainly on people being afraid of his punishments, based on false miracles, old stories, and wrong interpretations of the Bible.

So, it wasn’t hard for King Henry the Eighth or Queen Elizabeth to get rid of this power. But who knows if this spirit of Rome, now spread by missions in places like China, Japan, and the Indies where it hasn’t grown much, might come back? Or maybe even worse spirits could take over and make things worse than before. It’s not just the Roman church that claims the kingdom of God is part of this world and has power separate from the government.

This is all I wanted to say about politics. After I finish reviewing it, I’ll gladly let my country judge it.

When you look at how different parts of the mind often don’t work well together, and how our feelings can clash, some people argue that it’s impossible for one person to be good at all kinds of civil duties. They say being too strict makes people judge others harshly and not forgive mistakes. On the other hand, being too quick to think means people don’t stay focused long enough to clearly know what’s right or wrong.
