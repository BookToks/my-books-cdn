XXIV: About How a Country Grows and Keeps Going

A country’s growth depends on having enough stuff that people need to live. This includes gathering, preparing, and sharing these things in a way that everyone can use.

The amount of stuff we get is limited by nature and comes from two main places: the land and the sea. God gives these freely or sells them through people’s work.

This stuff includes animals, plants, and minerals, which God has placed on or near the earth’s surface. We just need to work hard to collect and use them. So, having plenty mostly depends on people’s effort, after God’s blessing.

These things, called commodities, can either be from inside the country or brought in from other places. No country, unless it’s really huge, can produce everything it needs by itself. Usually, countries make more of some things than they need. They use the extra to get what they don’t have by trading, by war, or by working hard. People’s work is also something valuable that can be traded.

Some countries, even small ones, have grown strong by trading things from place to place and by making products from materials they brought in from other places.
