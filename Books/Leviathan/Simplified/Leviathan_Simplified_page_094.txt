Thomas Hobbes says there is a sixth law of nature: if someone has done wrong but is sorry and promises to change, we should forgive them.

Forgiving means making peace. If we forgive people who keep being enemies, it’s not really peace but just fear. But if we don’t forgive those who promise to change, it shows we don’t want peace, which goes against the law of nature.

The seventh law is about revenge. When people get back at someone, they shouldn’t focus on how bad the past wrong was, but on the good things that can come from forgiving or fixing the problem. We should only punish to help the person learn or to warn others. Revenge just for showing off or hurting someone is useless and stupid. Hurting someone without a good reason can lead to war, which is cruel and against nature.

Because showing hate or disrespect usually leads to fights, the eighth law says no one should show hate or disrespect through actions, words, or expressions. Breaking this law is often called “contumely,” or rude behavior.

The question of who is better doesn’t matter in nature because all people are equal. The differences we see now come from laws made by people. Aristotle thought some people are naturally better to lead because they are wiser, and others should serve because they are stronger but not as smart. But this idea goes against reason and experience. Most people want to be in charge of themselves, and smart people don’t always win when they fight with those who don’t trust them.

So, if nature made people equal, we should accept that. And even if nature made people unequal, those who think they are equal won’t make peace unless they are treated equally. So equality has to be accepted.
