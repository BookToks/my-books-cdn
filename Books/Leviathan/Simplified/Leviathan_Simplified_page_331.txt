The Apostles Matthias, Paul, and Barnabas were not chosen by Jesus himself, but were picked by the Church, which means by the group of Christians. Matthias was chosen by the church in Jerusalem, and Paul and Barnabas were chosen by the church in Antioch. In the same way, the elders and pastors in other cities were chosen by the churches in those cities.

To prove this, let’s look at how St. Paul chose elders in the cities where he brought people to Christianity, right after he and Barnabas became apostles. The Bible says, “they appointed elders in every church” (Acts 14:23). At first, this might sound like Paul and Barnabas picked the elders themselves, but if we check the original words, it shows the elders were actually chosen by the Christian community in each city. The phrase means “when they appointed elders by the laying on of hands in every church.” 

Back then, in all these cities, people picked their leaders by voting. Usually, they showed their vote by raising their hands. So, appointing an elder was just gathering the people to vote for them, using raised hands, voices, or sometimes by dropping small objects like stones or beans into marked containers. Different cities had different ways of voting. It was the group of Christians who picked their elders. The Apostles just led the meeting, called the people together to vote, announced who was chosen, and gave a blessing, which we now call consecration.

Because of this, the leaders of these meetings, like elders when apostles were not around, were called proestetes (in Latin, antistites). These words mean the main person in charge of the meeting. Their job was to count the votes and say who was elected. If there was a tie, they would break it by adding their own vote, just like a president does.

Since all churches chose their elders this way, when the Bible says, “For this cause I left you in Crete, that you should appoint elders in every city” (Titus 1:5), it means the same thing. It means the leader should call the Christians together and have them choose their elders by voting.
