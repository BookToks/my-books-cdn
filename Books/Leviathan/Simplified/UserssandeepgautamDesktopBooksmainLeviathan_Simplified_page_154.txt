It’s useless to give a part of the land or resources to the government if they can just sell or give it away, which they actually do when their representatives decide to.

Just like how land is divided at home, the ruler also decides where and what goods people can trade with other countries. If private people were allowed to decide for themselves, some might help enemies or bring in things that look good but are bad or useless for the country. So, only the ruler should approve or reject what and where people trade abroad.

Also, it’s not enough for everyone to just own some land or know a skill. Since everyone needs almost every skill or product to live well, people have to share and trade what they can spare with each other. That’s why the ruler must set the rules for how people make deals—like buying, selling, borrowing, or renting—and what words or signs make those deals official.

By “concoction,” I mean turning all saved goods (stuff not eaten right away) into something equal in value and easy to carry so people can have food or supplies wherever they go. This basically means gold, silver, and money. Since gold and silver are valued almost everywhere, they’re a good way to measure how much things are worth between countries. Money made by the ruler is also a good way to measure value between people inside the country.
