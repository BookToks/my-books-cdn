Finally, about the mistakes that come from false or uncertain history, what about all the made-up stories of miracles in the lives of saints? And all the tales of ghosts and visions that the leaders of the Roman Church use to support their ideas about hell, purgatory, exorcisms, and other beliefs that don’t have proof in reason or the Bible? They also have traditions they call the “unwritten word of God,” but these are really just old wives’ tales. 

Even though some of these stories show up in old writings by the early church leaders, those leaders were people who could easily believe false reports. Using their opinions to prove the truth of these stories doesn’t mean much, especially since St. John advises us to “test the spirits.” These leaders didn’t suspect the church was abusing its power, or maybe they benefited from it. Honest men without much knowledge of natural causes—like those early leaders—are often the most likely to believe wrong stories because good people don’t usually expect others to lie or cheat.

Pope Gregory, St. Bernard, and Bede wrote about ghosts saying they were in purgatory, but they only heard these stories from others. If they or anyone else tells such stories as if they really saw them, it doesn’t prove the stories are true; it just shows their own weakness or dishonesty.

Along with false ideas, there’s also the problem of stopping true knowledge by people who aren’t qualified to judge what’s true. Our own travels and the study of science now clearly show that there are people living on the opposite side of the Earth (antipodes), and that years and days happen because of Earth’s movement. Still, some writers who even just suggested these ideas—explaining reasons for or against them—were punished by church authorities. 

But why? Is it because these ideas go against true religion? That can’t be, if the ideas are actually true.

So, let the truth be checked by people who really know what they’re talking about, or be proven wrong by those who say the opposite. If the problem is that these ideas go against the established religion, then those who teach them should be stopped by civil laws, the laws of the land. People can be punished by these laws if they teach even true science in a way that breaks the rules.
