We can notice that the Pope is only more important than other bishops in the areas where he is also the civil ruler. This happens when the emperor, who has civil power, chooses the Pope to be the main religious leader for his Christian people.

Carrying pictures or statues in parades comes from the old religions of the Greeks and Romans. They carried their idols from place to place on special carts called thensa or vehiculum Deorum. The statue was put in a frame or shrine called a ferculum.

What they called pompa is what we now call a procession. For example, Julius Caesar was honored by being carried in a sacred cart and shrine during a parade at the Circaean games. This was like being carried around as a god, similar to how popes today are carried by Swiss guards under a canopy.

In these processions, people also carried burning torches and candles in front of the godsâ€™ images, both in Greek and Roman times. Later, Roman emperors got the same honors. For example, Caligula was carried from Misenum to Rome with many people around, altars, animals for sacrifice, and burning torches. Caracalla was welcomed in Alexandria with incense, flower throwing, and torches. Over time, ordinary but faithful people began to honor their bishops with similar candle processions, and the images of Jesus and the saints were also carried like this inside churches. This use of wax candles was made official by some old church councils.

The heathens also had their holy water, called aqua lustralis.
