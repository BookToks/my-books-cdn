Thomas Hobbes says the Bible was written to help people understand God’s kingdom and to get them ready to obey Him. It’s not meant to explain science or the world, which people can argue about using their own reason. It doesn’t matter if day and night happen because the Earth or the Sun moves, or if bad things people do come from strong feelings or the Devil. What matters is that we worship God and obey Him, and that’s what the Bible is for.

When Jesus talks to diseases like they are people, that’s just a way of speaking common to healers who use words, like Jesus did. They might pretend to talk to spirits, but it doesn’t mean the disease is really a spirit. For example, Jesus is said to have stopped a storm and healed a fever by speaking, but that doesn’t mean the fever was a devil. When the Bible says “unclean spirits” leave a person and come back with more, it’s actually a story to show how someone who tries to stop bad habits but fails can become worse than before. So, Hobbes thinks the Bible doesn’t really mean that people with mental illnesses were possessed by demons.

Hobbes also talks about a mistake some people make, which is using words that don’t really mean anything. This happens when people don’t understand the words they use and just repeat them, or when they try to confuse others on purpose. This usually happens with complicated subjects, like the ideas studied by medieval scholars or deep philosophy. Regular people don’t usually talk nonsense, so these confusing people often think ordinary folks are dumb. If you want proof, Hobbes says try reading a chapter by one of these scholars about hard topics like the Trinity or free will, and see if you can understand it in any modern language or even in Latin that was once common.
