One of the biggest reasons a country can fall apart is when the people who take control not only want everyone to obey them from then on but also want people to agree with everything they did in the past. Almost no country started off with completely good reasons or actions.

The word “tyranny” basically means having total power, whether by one person or many. People who use the word “tyrant” are usually just mad at those in power. So, if someone openly hates tyranny, it’s like they’re also hating on any government or ruling system. This kind of hate can cause problems, just like the first issue I mentioned. Usually, when one side wants to prove they are right, they have to make the other side look bad. But neither side’s opinion forces the people to obey. That’s what I wanted to explain about the first two parts of this talk.

In Chapter 35, I explained from the Bible that in the Jewish nation, God was the ruler because the people agreed to it. They were called God’s “special people” to show they were different from everyone else, who were ruled by God’s power without agreeing to it. Moses was God’s helper on Earth and told them what laws God wanted them to follow. However, I didn’t say who was responsible for punishing people, especially for serious crimes, which I now think is important.

Usually, in any country, soldiers or guards carry out punishments. Sometimes, people who don’t have much respect or kindness take these jobs. But among the Israelites, God’s law said that if someone was found guilty of a serious crime, the people should stone them to death. The witnesses had to throw the first stones, and after that, the rest of the people could join in. This law decided who could punish the criminal, but no one was allowed to start throwing stones before the person was judged and sentenced by the group. Witnesses had to speak before the punishment unless the crime happened right in front of the group or the judges, who could then act as witnesses themselves.
