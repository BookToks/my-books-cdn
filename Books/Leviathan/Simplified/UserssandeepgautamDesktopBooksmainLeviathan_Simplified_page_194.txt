Imprisonment is when a person is locked up by the government and can happen for two reasons. One is to keep someone safe while they are being accused of a crime. The other is to punish someone who has been found guilty. The first is not punishment because no one should be punished before a fair trial. So, any pain or harm caused before the trial, more than what is needed to keep the person safe, is against natural law. The second reason is punishment because it is done by the government to someone who broke the law.

When I say imprisonment, I mean any kind of stopping someone from moving freely. This could be locking them in a prison, putting them on an island, making them work in tough places like old quarries or on ships called galleys, or even chaining them up.

Exile, or banishment, is when someone is told to leave their country or a part of it for a set time or forever because of a crime. By itself, exile is not really a punishment but more like a way to avoid punishment by running away. Cicero, an ancient thinker, said Rome never used exile as a punishment but as a safe place for people in danger.

If a banished person is still allowed to keep their property and money, just living somewhere else is not a punishment. It doesnâ€™t help the country because punishments are meant to make people follow the law. Sometimes, exile can even hurt the country because the banished person is no longer part of it and might act against it. But if the person also loses their property or money, then the real punishment is losing those things, not just the exile.

Punishing innocent people, no matter how big or small the punishment, goes against natural law. Punishment should only happen when someone breaks the law. Punishing the innocent never helps the country and is wrong.
