There are some signs of honor, both in qualities and actions, that are natural. For example, qualities like being good, fair, and generous, and actions like praying, giving thanks, and obeying. Other signs of honor come from rules or customs made by people. Sometimes they are seen as honorable, sometimes dishonorable, and sometimes neutral. For example, gestures used for greeting, praying, or thanking can mean different things in different places and times. The first kind is natural, but the second kind depends on what people agree on.

There are two kinds of this made-up worship: sometimes it is required, and sometimes people do it freely. It is required when the one being honored demands it. It is free when the person honoring chooses how to do it. When it is required, the important part is following the rules, not the exact words or movements. But when it is free, what really matters is how others see it. If the words or actions look silly or disrespectful to others, then it’s not really worship or honor, because signs only mean something to the people who see them.

Also, worship can be public or private. Public worship is what a whole community does together, like one group. Private worship is what a single person does alone. Public worship is free for the whole community but not always for each person. Private worship is free when done alone, but when done in front of others, it’s often controlled by laws or what people think, which limits freedom.

The reason people worship others is for power. When someone sees another person being honored, they think that person is powerful and are more ready to obey them. This makes that person’s power even bigger. But God doesn’t have any goals like that. The worship we give God comes from our duty and is based on what reason tells us: we honor those more powerful than us because we hope to get something good, fear harm, or are thankful for what we already received.

To understand how we should worship God by natural reason, let’s start with His qualities. First, it’s clear we should believe God exists, because no one wants to honor something they don’t believe is real.

Second, some philosophers said the world or its soul was God, but that’s wrong and disrespectful. God is the cause of the world, and saying the world itself is God means there is no cause at all, which means no God.
