But this is actually less than what a big group of people will do. They will shout, fight against, and even destroy the people who have protected them all their lives from harm. If this is crazy behavior in a crowd, it’s the same for each person. Like in the middle of the sea, even if you don’t hear noise from the water near you, you know that part helps make the whole sea roar. In the same way, even if one or two people don’t seem upset, their strong feelings add to the loud chaos of a troubled country. If nothing else shows their madness, just thinking they have special inspiration is proof enough. If someone in a mental hospital talked to you calmly and then said they were God the Father, you wouldn’t expect them to act normally—that would show they’re crazy.

This idea of special inspiration, often called a “private spirit,” usually starts when someone finds a mistake that most others believe. But because they don’t know or remember how they figured out their “special truth,” and sometimes it’s even wrong, they quickly think they have a special blessing from God who revealed it to them in a supernatural way.

Also, madness is really just having too much strong emotion. You can see this when people drink too much alcohol. Their behavior is like that of mad people: some get angry, some get loving, some laugh a lot, all acting wildly but based on their strongest feelings. Alcohol just removes their ability to hide their true feelings and makes them unaware of how strange their behavior looks. I think most sober people, when they’re alone and not busy, wouldn’t want others to see how silly and wild their thoughts are at that time. This shows that uncontrolled feelings are mostly just madness.

People through history have had two main ideas about what causes madness. Some say it comes from strong feelings; others believe it’s caused by spirits or demons—either good or bad—that enter a person, take control, and make their body move strangely like madmen do.
