First, people need to learn that they shouldn’t be jealous of the government styles they see in other countries or want to change their own just because other places seem better. A country does well not because it’s ruled by a few rich people or by everyone, but because the people obey the rules and get along. A kingdom doesn’t work just because one person rules, but because people listen to that ruler. If people stop obeying and stop working together, the country won’t just stop doing well—it could fall apart quickly. People who try to fix things by causing disobedience might actually ruin their country, like the story where daughters tried to make their old dad young again by cutting him up and boiling him, but only destroyed him. Wanting to change things just because others have different gods or rulers is like breaking God’s first commandment: “You shall not have the gods of other nations.” Also, kings are called gods in another part of the Bible.

Second, people should not be amazed or overly impressed by how good or important any person or group in their country seems, except for the main ruling group, called the sovereign assembly. They shouldn’t give these others any respect or power that belongs only to the sovereign, who they officially represent. The sovereign must care deeply about their people and not let them be tricked or pulled away by popular but dishonest leaders. These leaders have even gone so far as to openly claim they are married to the people, which is like breaking the second of the Ten Commandments.
