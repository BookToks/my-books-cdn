Before, the control over both government and religion was linked together.

After the judges, kings took over. Before, the high priest had all the power in both religion and government, but now the king had all the power. The people gave up their special agreement with God and the high priest, and with God’s approval, they chose to be ruled by a king instead.

When they asked Samuel, “Make us a king to judge us, like all the nations,” (I Samuel, 8:5) they meant they didn’t want to be ruled by the priest’s commands from God anymore. They wanted a king to lead them like other countries. By doing this, they stopped God’s special way of ruling. But God agreed, telling Samuel, “Listen to what the people say... they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, so I won’t rule over them” (I Samuel, 8:7). Since they rejected God’s rule, priests only had power if the king allowed it, depending on whether the king was good or bad. The king controlled all government matters.

In the same chapter, the people said they wanted to be like other nations, with a king as their judge who leads and fights their battles (I Samuel, 8:20). This means the king had full power in both peace and war. The king also controlled religion because the Law of Moses, which regulated religion, was part of their civil law. For example, Solomon removed Abiathar as high priest (I Kings, 2:27), showing he had power over religious leaders. Solomon also dedicated the Temple, blessed the people, and prayed personally during church ceremonies (I Kings, 8), showing his religious authority. Later, when a question came up about the Book of the Law found in the Temple, the king Josiah didn’t let the high priest decide. Instead, he sent others to ask Huldah, a prophetess, showing the king’s power over religious matters (II Kings, 22).
