The ideas about God’s kingdom have a big effect on how we understand human kingdoms, and only those with God’s power can decide about them.

The Bible shows that God’s kingdom and eternal life, as well as God’s enemies and their punishments after judgment, happen on earth. The place where everyone stays until the resurrection—those who have died or been buried—is often described as underground in the Bible. The Latin words “infernus” and “inferi” and the Greek word “Hades” mean a place where people can’t see, like a grave or a deep pit.

But the exact place where the wicked will be after the resurrection isn’t clearly described in the Bible by its location, only by who is there. It says it will be where very bad people who were miraculously destroyed by God used to be. For example, some were swallowed by the earth, like Corah, Dathan, and Abiram. The Bible doesn’t mean a real bottomless hole in the earth because earth is small compared to the sky and stars. The Greeks and Romans talked about Tartarus, a deep pit for demons, but that’s just a way to show that the punishment is endless, not a real place.

Also, before the flood in Noah’s time, there were giants called heroes by the Greeks and giants by the Bible. These giants were born from the children of God and humans. Because they were so wicked, they were destroyed by the flood. So, sometimes the place of the punished is linked to these giants, as mentioned in Proverbs 21.
