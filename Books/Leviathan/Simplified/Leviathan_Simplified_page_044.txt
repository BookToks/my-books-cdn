Fancy doesn’t have a place except to make style look better.

When people give speeches to praise or insult someone, fancy is used a lot because the goal isn’t to tell the truth but to make someone look good or bad. This is done by using impressive or terrible comparisons. Judgment only helps decide what makes an action good or bad.

When encouraging or asking for something, whether truth or trickery works better depends on the situation, so sometimes judgment or fancy is needed more.

In showing proof, giving advice, or searching for the truth carefully, sometimes only facts matter. But sometimes you need a good example or comparison to help explain, and that’s when fancy is useful. However, metaphors don’t belong here because they are openly misleading, so using them in serious talks or reasoning is a bad idea.

In any kind of talk, if someone shows poor judgment, no matter how wild their fancy is, people will think they aren’t smart. But if they show clear judgment, even simple fancy won’t make them look foolish.

People’s private thoughts can jump over all kinds of topics—serious or silly, good or bad—without feeling shame or blame. But when talking out loud, what you say must fit the time, place, and audience. A doctor or scientist can talk about gross things because it’s to help people, not to entertain. But if a regular person tells wild, funny stories about the same, it’s like someone who fell in the dirt showing up in front of polite company. The difference is whether someone knows when to be careful.

Also, when people are relaxed and with close friends, they can play with words and meanings in fun and strange ways. But in a sermon, in public, or with people you should respect, joking with words will just seem silly. The difference is always about knowing when to be careful.

So, if someone isn’t smart, it’s not because they lack fancy ideas, but because they lack good judgment. Smartness is judgment without fancy, but fancy without judgment isn’t smart.

When a person working on a goal thinks about many things and how they help with that goal, and if their ideas are not simple or common, this kind of smartness is called prudence. It depends on lots of experience and remembering what happened before.
