First, we learn that Adam was made to live in a perfect life. If he hadn’t disobeyed God, he would have lived forever in the Garden of Eden. There was a tree called the tree of life that Adam could eat from as long as he didn’t eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which God told him not to touch. But as soon as Adam ate from that tree, God kicked him out of the garden so he wouldn’t eat from the tree of life and live forever.  

It seems to me (though I respect the official Bible interpretations) that if Adam hadn’t sinned, he would have lived forever on earth. Death and dying came because of his first sin. This doesn’t mean Adam died right away—he lived a long time and had many children before he died. When the Bible says, “In the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die,” it really means that death became certain for him and his future family.  

Since Adam lost eternal life by sinning, someone had to fix that and bring eternal life back. Jesus Christ did this by taking away the sins of everyone who believes in him. Because of Jesus, believers get back the eternal life that Adam lost. This is what St. Paul means when he says, “Because of one man’s sin, judgment came to all people, but because of one man’s right living, a free gift of life came to all people who accept it.”  

Paul explains it more clearly: “Just as death came through Adam, the resurrection of the dead comes through Christ. Everyone dies because of Adam, but everyone will be made alive because of Christ.”  

About where people will live this eternal life that Christ won for them, the Bible seems to say it will be on earth. Since Adam’s sin caused everyone to lose eternal life and die on earth, and Christ brings life back to everyone, this suggests eternal life will be on earth too. This agrees with the Psalm that says, “God has promised a blessing, even life forever, on Zion,” which is a place on earth in Jerusalem.
