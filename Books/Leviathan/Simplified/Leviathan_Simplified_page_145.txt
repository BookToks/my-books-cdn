When people live under their family’s rules, they have to obey their fathers or masters like they are the boss. Before governments were made, fathers and masters had all the power in their families, and later they only lose as much power as the government takes away.

Some groups are illegal because they join together without any permission from the government. Examples are gangs of beggars, thieves, or travelers who work together to make begging or stealing easier. Also, groups that follow orders from foreign leaders to spread ideas or fight against their own government are illegal.

Sometimes, people form groups just because they like the same things, not because they have any real rules or promises to each other. These groups can be legal or illegal depending on what each person wants to do, and you can tell by what happens.

People in a country usually don’t need to make secret groups to protect themselves because the whole country is already like one big group. These secret groups are often illegal and called factions or conspiracies. A group is only strong if someone can make sure everyone keeps their promises. Groups between different countries can be good and legal while they last. But secret groups inside one country where people can get help from the government are not needed and often illegal, especially if their plans are bad or secret. When private people join forces for bad reasons or hide their plans, it’s unfair and dangerous.

If the government is run by a large group, but some people in that group secretly plan to control the others without permission, that is an illegal conspiracy. It’s like tricking the group to work for their own benefit.
