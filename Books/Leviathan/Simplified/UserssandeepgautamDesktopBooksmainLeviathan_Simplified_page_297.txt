Finally, we read that David made Hashabiah and his brothers, the Hebronites, officers of Israel in the west. They were in charge of “all business of the Lord, and in the service of the king.” He also made other Hebronites leaders over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half of the tribe of Manasseh. These were the rest of Israel living beyond the Jordan River. They were responsible for “every matter about God, and affairs of the king.” This shows they had full power, both in religious and government matters.

To sum up, from the start of God’s kingdom until the Captivity, religion and civil power were held by the same people. After Saul was chosen, the priest’s job was to serve, not to rule like a judge.

Even though the government and religion were joined in the high priests at first, and later in the kings, the people didn’t fully understand this. Many of them only believed when they saw big miracles, or when their leaders were very successful. Whenever they didn’t like their leaders, they would blame either the government or the religion to try to change the government or stop obeying. This caused many civil problems, fights, and troubles in the nation.

For example, after Eleazar and Joshua died, the next generation hadn’t seen God’s wonders. They used their own weak judgment and forgot they had promised to follow a priest-led kingdom. They stopped listening to the priests and the laws of Moses. Instead, they did whatever seemed right to them and followed leaders who could protect them from other nations. They didn’t ask God for help but trusted people who said they could predict the future. Even though they had idols in their worship places, if they had a Levite as their priest, they thought they were worshipping the true God of Israel.

Later, when they asked for a king like other nations, it wasn’t because they wanted to stop worshipping God as their King. They just didn’t trust the sons of Samuel to be fair judges anymore. They wanted a king to judge civil matters but didn’t want the king to change their religion, which they believed Moses had set up.
