Imagination is what happens in our minds when we think about things using words or other signs. This kind of understanding is something both humans and animals share. For example, a dog learns to recognize its owner’s call or commands. Many animals can do this too.

But humans have a special kind of understanding. We don’t just understand words or commands; we can also think about ideas and connect them in sentences that say things are true or false. I will talk more about this kind of understanding later.

When I say "train of thoughts," I mean how one thought leads to another in our minds. This is different from talking out loud; it’s how our thoughts move in our heads.

When you think about something, your next thought isn’t random. Thoughts don’t just follow each other in any order. We can only imagine things we have experienced before, at least in some way. This is because our thoughts are like movements inside us, leftover from what we felt or saw before.

The way these movements happen together in our senses also happens when we imagine. It’s like when you touch water and move it with your finger – the water follows where you guide it. But since in real life, different things happen one after another, when we imagine, we can’t be sure what thought will come next. The only sure thing is that the next thought will be something we have experienced before.

There are two kinds of trains of thought. The first kind is random and doesn’t have a clear goal. There’s no strong feeling or desire leading these thoughts. In this case, your thoughts just wander around and don’t seem connected, like a dream.
