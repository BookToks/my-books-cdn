You have heard, he says, the Law of Moses says, “You shall not kill,” and that “Whoever kills will be judged by the courts,” or by the group called the Seventy. But I tell you, being angry with your brother without a good reason, or calling him names like Raca or Fool, is like murder and will be punished on the day of judgment by Christ and his Apostles, with hell fire.

So, these words were not meant to separate different crimes, courts, and punishments. Instead, they show the difference between sins. The Jews thought the difference came from their courts, but Jesus shows that even having the will to hurt your brother, even if you only insult him or don’t act on it, will bring punishment by the same judges on judgment day. Thinking about this, I can’t see how this text proves purgatory.

The sixth place is Luke 16:9: “Make friends with unrighteous money so that when you fail, they may welcome you into eternal homes.” He says this proves praying to saints who have died. But it clearly means we should use our money to help poor people and get their prayers while they are alive. “He who gives to the poor lends to the Lord.”

The seventh is Luke 23:42: “Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” He says this means sins can be forgiven after death. But this is wrong. Jesus forgave the man then, and at his return in glory, he will raise him to eternal life.

The eighth is Acts 2:24, where Peter says Christ “was raised by God and freed from the pains of death, because it was impossible for death to hold him.” He thinks this means Christ went down to purgatory to free souls there. But it clearly means Christ himself was freed. Death could not hold him, not the souls in purgatory.

If you look at Beza’s notes on this, you’ll see it should say “bands” not “pains.” Then there is no reason to use this text to prove purgatory.
