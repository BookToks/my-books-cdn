Things that can’t be shared or split should belong to the first person who got them, and sometimes to the oldest child if it’s decided by chance.

It’s also a natural rule that people who help make peace should be allowed to go safely. The goal is peace, so helping others make peace is important, and those helpers should be protected.

Even if people want to follow these rules, problems can still happen. First, people might argue about whether something really happened. Second, if it did happen, they might argue if it was right or wrong. The first is called a question of fact, the second a question of right. Unless both sides agree to accept someone else’s decision, there will be no peace. That person who decides is called an arbitrator. So, it’s a natural rule that people in a fight should agree to let an arbitrator judge.

Since everyone is expected to act in their own interest, no one should judge their own case. Even if they could be fair, if one person is the judge, the other should be too. If not, the fight stays, which goes against natural law.

Also, no one should be an arbitrator if they will gain more money, honor, or pleasure from one side winning. That would be like taking a bribe, and no one should trust them. This also keeps the fight going, against natural law.

When the problem is about facts, the judge should believe both sides equally. If there’s no clear answer, they should ask others to help decide. Otherwise, the problem is left to fighting, which breaks natural law.

These natural laws help keep peace so many people can live together. There are other things that harm people, like getting drunk or being out of control, which are also against natural law but don’t need to be talked about here.
