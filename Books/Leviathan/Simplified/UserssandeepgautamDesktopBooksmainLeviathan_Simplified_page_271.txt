A miracle is something amazing that happens to show that God’s messengers, ministers, and prophets are real and chosen by God. This helps people believe and follow them.

Even though creating the world and the big flood were amazing, they aren’t called miracles because they didn’t happen to prove that a prophet or minister was sent by God. People already believe God can do anything, but what makes a miracle special is when God does something amazing because a person asks Him.

The miracles God did in Egypt through Moses were true miracles because they were meant to make the Israelites believe Moses was sent by God, not just acting on his own. When God told Moses to free the Israelites, Moses worried people wouldn’t believe him. So God let Moses turn his stick into a snake and back again, and make his hand sick and then healthy. These signs helped the Israelites see that God had really sent Moses. God also let Moses turn water into blood.

After Moses showed these miracles, the Israelites believed him, but they were still scared of Pharaoh and didn’t obey yet. Then God sent plagues on Pharaoh and Egypt to help the Israelites believe Moses was from God. All the miracles done by Moses, other prophets, Jesus, and the apostles were meant to help people believe they were sent by God.

The Bible shows that miracles were meant to make certain people believe, not everyone. For example, the plagues in Egypt were not meant to change Pharaoh’s mind because God had already decided Pharaoh’s heart would stay hard. Pharaoh only let the people go because he was forced by the plagues, not because he believed in the miracles.
