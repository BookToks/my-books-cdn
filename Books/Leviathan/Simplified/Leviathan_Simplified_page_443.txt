St. Stephen was stoned to death because of these laws, not because of someone’s personal anger. Before he was killed, he explained his side to the high priest. Nowhere in the Bible does it say that people should carry out executions out of personal feelings. Such actions often come from being ignorant and emotional, and they go against justice and peace in a country.

In Chapter 36, I said we don’t know exactly how God spoke to Moses in a supernatural way. But God did sometimes talk to Moses through dreams, visions, and a special voice, just like He did with other prophets. It says that when Moses went into the Tabernacle to speak with God, he heard a voice coming from above the mercy seat, between the cherubim. However, the Bible doesn’t explain why God’s way of speaking to Moses was better than how He spoke to other prophets like Samuel and Abraham. Maybe the difference was how clearly Moses saw or heard God. The phrases “face to face” and “mouth to mouth” can’t be taken literally because God is infinite and beyond our understanding.

About the whole idea, I think the main points are true and make sense. I base the rights of rulers and the duties and freedoms of people on what we know about human nature and natural laws. Anyone who can manage their own family should understand these basics. When it comes to the church power that rulers have, I rely on clear Bible verses that fit with the whole message of Scripture. So, I believe anyone who reads this just to learn will understand it. But those who already support opposite ideas through their words or actions won’t be convinced easily. It’s natural for people to read and at the same time ignore parts that challenge what they already believe. Especially now, when many ideas that help start a new government go against what helped end the old one, there are bound to be lots of objections.
