Sometimes a person looks for something they have lost. Their mind goes back to the time and place where they last had it, trying to figure out when and where they had it. This helps them start looking in a certain time and place. Then, they think about what might have caused them to lose it. This is called remembering or calling something to mind.

Sometimes a person knows the exact place where they should look. Their thoughts go over every part of that place, like someone searching a room for a jewel, or a dog sniffing around a field to find a scent, or someone going through the alphabet to come up with a rhyme.

Sometimes a person wants to know what will happen after an action. They think about similar actions from the past and what happened then, hoping the same will happen again. For example, if someone thinks about a crime, they might imagine the police, the prison, the judge, and the punishment that followed before. This kind of thinking is called foresight or wisdom, but it can be wrong because it’s hard to know all the details.

The more experience someone has, the better they are at guessing what will happen, but it’s never completely sure. The present is real, the past only exists in memory, and the future is just a guess based on what happened before. Even when we call this “prudence” or being careful, it’s really just guessing. Only someone who controls what will happen can truly know the future. That’s what prophecy is.

The best guessers are those who know the most about what they’re guessing. They use signs, which are events that happened before and usually lead to certain results. The more often these signs have been seen, the more reliable they are.
