If there is no agreement, the mother has control over the child. In nature, without marriage laws, you can’t know who the father is unless the mother says so. So, the mother has the right to control the child.

Also, the baby is first under the mother’s care. She can choose to feed or abandon it. If she feeds the baby, the baby owes its life to her and must obey her more than anyone else. So, she has control. But if she abandons the baby and someone else feeds it, the person who feeds the baby has control. The baby should obey whoever keeps it alive because staying alive is why people have to obey others.

If the mother is under the father’s control, then the child is under the father’s control. And if the father is under the mother’s control (like if a queen marries a man who is her subject), then the child belongs to the mother because the father answers to her.

If a king and queen from different kingdoms have a child and make an agreement about who controls the child, control goes to the one they agree on. If they don’t agree, control goes to whoever rules the place where the child lives because the ruler has power over everyone there.

Whoever controls the child also controls the child’s children and their children after that. Having control over a person means having control over everything that belongs to them; otherwise, control would just be a title with no real power.

The right to inherit control from a father works the same way as inheriting a kingdom, which I already explained in the last chapter.

Control gained through winning a war is called despotic control, which means the master has power over the servant. This happens when the loser agrees, either by words or actions, that as long as they live and keep their freedom, the winner can use them however they want. After this agreement, the loser becomes a servant, not before. A servant is someone who is free but promises not to run away or fight back and is trusted by the master.

A captive kept in prison or tied up isn’t a servant because they have no obligation and could break free or fight back. But someone who is free and has promised to obey is a true servant.
