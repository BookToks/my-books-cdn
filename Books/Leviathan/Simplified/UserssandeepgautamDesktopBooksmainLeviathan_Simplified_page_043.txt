People think faster or slower because they care about different things. Some love one thing, some dislike another. So, people’s thoughts go in different directions, and they notice different stuff in their minds.

When people think about how things are similar, and they notice rare or unusual similarities, they are said to have a good imagination or “fancy.” But when people focus on the differences between things and can tell them apart easily, they are said to have good judgement. In social situations and business, this kind of skill is called discretion.

Having a good imagination alone isn’t always seen as a good thing without good judgement. But good judgement and discretion are admired even without fancy imagination. Besides knowing when and where to use these skills, a person also needs to think about how their ideas can be useful.

Someone with this skill can easily come up with ideas that make their talk more interesting, using new and fitting comparisons. But if a person’s imagination is not steady or focused, it can seem like they are crazy. They might start talking about everything that pops into their head and lose track of their main point. This often happens because they lack experience or are too nervous, making small things seem very important. New or exciting ideas can pull them away from what they meant to say.

In a good poem or play, both imagination and judgement are needed, but imagination should be stronger because people like creative and wild ideas as long as they don’t seem careless or confusing.

In a good history, judgement is more important because it’s about choosing the right way to tell the story, being truthful, and picking the most useful events to share.
