Kings and rulers have the right to control the army and the courts. This means they have as much power as one person can give to another. King Solomon prayed to God for wisdom to judge people and tell right from wrong. So, it was the king’s job to decide what is good and bad, and these decisions are the laws he makes.

Saul wanted to kill David, but when David had the chance to kill Saul, he stopped his men because Saul was God’s chosen leader. Saint Paul tells servants to obey their masters and children to obey their parents. This shows that people under authority should simply obey.

The teachers and leaders of the law, like the scribes and Pharisees, tell people what to follow, and people should listen to them. Saint Paul also says people should obey rulers and those in power. Jesus himself said people should pay taxes to kings and even paid taxes himself.

Jesus also showed that a king’s word is enough to take things from people if needed. When he needed a donkey, he told his disciples to take it, saying it was needed, and no one questioned him. People accepted his word without asking for proof.

In the Bible, it says humans were meant to know good and evil like gods. But when Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, which was a test of their obedience, the devil tricked Eve by saying eating it would make them like gods, knowing right and wrong.
