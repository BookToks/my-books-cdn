Thirdly, saying the world was never created but has always existed, because something eternal has no cause, is like saying God doesn’t exist.

Fourthly, when people think God can do things easily and so don’t believe He cares about us, they are taking away His honor. This makes people stop loving and respecting Him, which is the main way to honor God.

Fifthly, saying God is limited or not powerful isn’t respecting Him. To honor God, we shouldn’t say He is less than everything we can imagine. Being limited means you can add more to it, so God can’t be limited.

So, we shouldn’t say God has a shape because all shapes are limited. We also shouldn’t say we can imagine or understand Him fully because everything we imagine is limited. We shouldn’t say God has parts or is in a certain place because those are things that only limited things have. God doesn’t move or rest because those things happen in places, and God is not limited by place. There can only be one God because only one can be unlimited. We also shouldn’t say God feels things like sadness, anger, or desire like people do because those feelings mean power is limited by something else.

When we say God has a will, it’s not like a human will that wants things, but the power He uses to make everything happen.

When we say God sees or knows things, it’s not like how people do, with senses and a brain, because that depends on natural causes, and God is beyond that.

If someone wants to describe God only by what reason can understand, they should use words like infinite, eternal, or very great. These words don’t try to explain exactly what God is, but show how much we admire Him and want to obey Him. This shows humility and respect. There is only one name that shows who God is: “I Am.” And there is only one name for His role with us: God, meaning father, king, and lord.
