Thinking about this made me feel that people are too harsh on themselves and others when they say that the first feelings or thoughts of the mind, even if stopped by fear of God, are sins. But I admit it’s safer to be careful in that way than to be too relaxed.

A crime is a sin that happens when someone does or says something that the law says is wrong, or when they don’t do something the law says they must do.

So, every crime is a sin, but not every sin is a crime. Wanting to steal or kill is a sin, even if you never say or do it. God sees what’s in your mind and can blame you for it. But until you actually do or say something that shows your intention, it’s not called a crime. The Greeks had two words for this: one for sin, which means any breaking of the law, and another for crime, which means a sin that one person can accuse another for. Intentions that don’t show in actions can’t be accused by people. The Romans had similar words: peccatum for sin, meaning any law-breaking, and crimen for crime, meaning sins that can be proven in court, not just intentions.

From this, we can learn a few things. First, where there is no law, there is no sin. But because natural law is forever, things like breaking promises, being ungrateful, being proud, and other bad moral actions will always be sins. Second, when civil law ends, crimes end too, because then only natural law remains. In that case, no one can accuse you but your own conscience, and if your intention is good, what you do is not a sin; if it’s bad, your action is a sin, but not a crime. Third, when the highest power or government stops existing, crimes stop too, because without that power, there’s no law protection. So, everyone must protect themselves by their own strength. No one gives up the right to protect their own body when the government is made, because that’s why governments exist. But this only applies to people who didn’t help remove the power protecting them, because that was a crime from the start.
