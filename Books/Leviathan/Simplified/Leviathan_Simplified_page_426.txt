They admit that it is just a rule made by the Church that says priests who serve at the altar and handle the Eucharist must always stay away from women. This rule is called continual chastity, continence, and purity. Because of this, they say that having a wife is not chaste or pure, and so marriage is seen as a sin or something so dirty that it makes a man unfit to be a priest. If the rule is because using wives is against chastity, then all marriage is bad. If it's because marriage is too dirty for a man dedicated to God, then many other natural and daily things people do should also make men unfit to be priests, since those things are even dirtier.

But the real reason for banning priests from marrying wasn’t just about wrong ideas about right and wrong, or the belief that single life is better than marriage. That idea came from St. Paul, who saw that when Christians were being persecuted and had to run away a lot, it was hard to take care of a wife and kids. The true reason came later, from popes and priests who wanted to be the only heirs of God’s kingdom on earth. To do this, they had to stop priests from marrying because Jesus said that when God's kingdom comes, God's children “will neither marry nor be given in marriage, but will be like angels in heaven,” meaning spiritual beings. Since they called themselves spiritual, it would have been strange for them to have wives when it wasn’t necessary.

From Aristotle’s ideas about government, they learned to call all governments except popular ones (like Athens at that time) tyranny. They called all kings tyrants, and the group of thirty rulers set up by the Lacedaemonians in Athens the “thirty tyrants.” They also called the state of the people under democracy “liberty.” Originally, a tyrant just meant a ruler, but when most parts of Greece got rid of that kind of government, the word started to mean not only a ruler but also the hatred popular states had for that ruler. Also, after kings were removed in Rome, the word king became hated because people tend to think any bad thing is connected to a powerful enemy.
