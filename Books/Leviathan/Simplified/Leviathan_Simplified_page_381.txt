Heresies are all the beliefs that the Roman Church has said people are not allowed to hold. Because of this, whenever the Pope’s political plans don’t match those of other Christian leaders—which happens a lot—it creates confusion among the people. They can’t tell the difference between a stranger trying to take the throne and the ruler they chose. In this confusion, people end up fighting each other without knowing who their real enemies are, all because of someone else’s ambition.

Because the Church is seen as God’s kingdom today, pastors, deacons, and other Church leaders call themselves the clergy. They call everyone else the laity, which just means regular people. The word “clergy” comes from the time of the Israelites, when God gave the tribe of Levi no land but made them His special ministers, supported by God’s own gifts.

The Pope claims that today’s Church is like God’s kingdom back then, so he and his ministers say they have the right to get money like the Levites did. That’s why Church leaders have been collecting tithes—one-tenth of people’s income—as if it’s God’s law. This means people have to pay taxes twice: once to the government and once to the Church. The tithe to the Church is even more than what the king of Athens, who was seen as a tyrant, asked for to run everything. Back in Jewish times, tithes and offerings were the main public money.

Because people wrongly think the current Church is God’s kingdom, there’s a split between civil law and canon law. Civil law is made by rulers in their countries, and canon law is made by the Pope in those same places. At first, these Church rules were just suggestions that Christian leaders could choose to follow. But after the Empire moved to Charlemagne, and as the Pope’s power grew, these rules became commands. Even emperors had to accept them to avoid bigger problems, so people could be controlled without knowing it.
