Nothing made by humans can last forever. But if people used their reason properly, their governments could at least avoid breaking down from problems inside. Governments are meant to last as long as humans do, or as long as natural laws and justice last, since those give them life. So, when a government falls apart not because of outside attacks but because of problems inside, the blame isn’t on people themselves, but on how they set up and run the government.

People want to stop fighting and work together to build a strong and lasting government. But because they don’t know how to make good laws or don’t have the patience to fix the rough parts of their current system, they end up creating a weak government. Without a smart leader or “architect” to guide them, their government will be unstable and likely fall apart, causing trouble for future generations.

One major problem in governments is when they are set up wrong, like a body born with a sickness. Sometimes, a person who wants to be king accepts less power than is really needed to keep the country safe and peaceful. Later, when it’s time to use that power for the public good, it looks unfair to many people. This makes them want to rebel when they get the chance, just like sickly children often have health problems.

When kings limit their own power, it’s not always because they don’t understand what their job needs. Sometimes they do it hoping to take back that power later. But this is a bad idea because others who want to keep kings to their promises might support those who oppose the king. Foreign countries often try to weaken their neighbors to help their own people. For example, Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was backed by the Pope against King Henry the Second. This happened because the church’s independence was agreed upon a long time ago, when William the Conqueror promised not to interfere with the Church’s freedom.
