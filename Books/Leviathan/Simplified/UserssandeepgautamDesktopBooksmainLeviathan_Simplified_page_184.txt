This is a crime: the harm isn’t physical but imaginary. And even though some young, proud men recently started believing in it here, a brave man who trusts his courage wouldn’t care about it. Also, a person might be scared of spirits because of their own fears or because they believe stories from others about strange dreams and visions. This fear might make them think spirits will hurt them if they do or don’t do certain things. But doing or not doing those things, when they break the law, is still a crime and can’t be excused by fear. As I said before, dreams are just leftover thoughts from what we saw or heard while awake. Sometimes, when people aren’t sure if they really slept, dreams seem like real visions. So, anyone who breaks the law based on their own or someone else’s dream, vision, or idea about spirits is ignoring natural law, which is wrong. They follow only their own or someone else’s imagination, which they can never truly understand or trust. If everyone did this, no law would work, and society would fall apart.

From these different kinds of crimes, it’s clear that not all crimes are the same, even though some old philosophers called the Stoics thought they were.

There’s room not only for excuses, which can prove something isn’t really a crime, but also for making a crime seem less serious. Even though all crimes are unfair, like how all crooked lines are bent, it doesn’t mean all crimes are equally bad. Just like some crooked lines are more bent than others, some crimes are worse. The Stoics didn’t see this and thought killing a hen was as bad as killing your father.

The only thing that can fully excuse an action and make it not a crime is something that removes the law’s demand at the same time.
