We can compare this sickness to a fever with chills. In this illness, the body parts get cold or blocked by harmful stuff, so the veins that should carry blood back to the heart don’t get enough blood from the arteries. At first, this causes shaking and coldness in the limbs. Then, the heart tries really hard to push the blood through. Before it succeeds, the body tries to cool down with things that help for a little while. If the body is strong enough, it finally breaks through the blockage and gets rid of the harmful stuff by sweating. But if the body is too weak, the person dies.

Sometimes, a country can have a problem like a sickness called pleurisy. This happens when the country’s money, which should be shared fairly, ends up all in the hands of just a few people. This is like blood collecting in the chest and causing pain and fever.

Also, when a powerful person becomes popular, it can be a problem if the country doesn't check if they are loyal. People should listen to the ruler’s laws, but sometimes they follow a popular person just because of their charm, even if they don’t really know if that person is good or honest. This is usually more dangerous in a government where people have power than in a kingdom. That’s how Julius Caesar took control by winning the army’s support and then taking over the government. This kind of behavior is like rebellion and can be compared to witchcraft.

Another problem for a country is when a city gets too big and can support a large army by itself. Also, having too many smaller groups inside the country, like many little governments inside one big one, causes trouble. People who argue too much against strong rulers, claiming to be smart about politics but actually spreading bad ideas, also cause problems. These people are like tiny worms inside the body that bother the country and make it weaker.
