Schools say that heavy things fall down because they want to rest and stay in the place that suits them best. They even say these things have a desire or know what’s good for them, which is silly because objects don’t have feelings or knowledge like people do.

When something starts moving, it keeps moving forever unless something stops it. But anything stopping it doesn’t happen instantly—it takes time and happens little by little. Like when the wind stops blowing, the waves on the water don’t stop right away; they keep rolling for a while. The same happens with movement inside a person, like when they see or dream. Even after we close our eyes or stop looking at something, we still remember its image, though it’s not as clear as when we actually saw it. This is what the Latins call imagination, which comes from the image made when seeing. They use this word for all the senses, but that’s not quite right. The Greeks call it fancy, meaning appearance, which fits all senses equally. So, imagination is just a fading sense and happens in both awake and sleeping people and other living beings.

When people are awake, losing clear sense doesn’t mean the sense’s movement stops, but that it gets hidden, like how the sun’s light hides the stars’ light during the day. The stars still shine as much as at night, but because the sun is so bright, we don’t notice them. Our eyes and ears get many signals from outside, but only the strongest one stands out. So when the sun’s light is strongest, we can’t see the stars. When something moves away from our eyes, even if its image stays in our mind, other new things we see or hear make the old image weaker, like how a man's voice is hard to hear in a noisy place. That’s why the longer the time after seeing or sensing something, the weaker the memory or imagination of it becomes.

Our body keeps changing, so over time, the parts that sensed things get destroyed. This means that time and distance have the same effect on us. Just like things look blurry and unclear when far away, and voices become faint and hard to understand, our memories of past things grow weak too. For example, after a long time, we might forget many streets in a city we once saw or many details about things that happened.
