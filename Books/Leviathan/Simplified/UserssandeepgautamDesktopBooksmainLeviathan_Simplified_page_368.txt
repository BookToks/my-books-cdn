But for those people who never heard God the Father or Jesus Christ directly, it can’t be said that the person they believed in was really God. They trusted the Apostles first, and then the pastors and teachers of the Church, who told them about the stories in the Old and New Testament. So, since Jesus’ time, Christians have based their faith first on the reputation of their pastors, and then on the authority of the people who made the Old and New Testament the rule for their faith. Only Christian rulers could do that, so they are the top pastors, and the only people Christians listen to as speaking for God—unless God speaks directly to someone today in a special way.

But because many false teachers have appeared, other people need to check if these teachers really come from God, just like St. John told us to do. Since checking what is true belongs to the top pastor, the person everyone should believe if they don’t have a special message from God is, in every country, the top pastor—that means the civil ruler.

There are many reasons why people believe Christian teachings. Faith is a gift from God, and He gives it to each person in different ways. The most common reason we believe anything about Christian faith is that we believe the Bible is God’s word. But why we believe the Bible is God’s word is often argued about, because people don’t ask why they believe it—they ask how they know it. They act like believing and knowing are the same thing. One side says they know it because the Church is always right, and the other side says they know it because of their own personal feelings. But neither side really proves what they say. How can someone know the Church is always right if they don’t first know the Bible is right? Or how can someone know their own feelings are true and not just based on what their teachers told them or what they assume about themselves? Also, the Bible never says the Church is always right, much less any one Church or person.

So it’s clear that Christians don’t actually know the Bible is God’s word—they only believe it. And the way God usually helps people believe is natural: they trust their teachers. This is the main idea of St. Leviathan’s teaching.
