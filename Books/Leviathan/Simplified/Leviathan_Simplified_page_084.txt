When a prize is offered and money is put down, no one knows who will get it until the contest is over. There are two types of earning something here. In a contract, I earn because of my own effort and because the other person needs what I offer. But when it’s a free gift, I only earn it because the giver is kind enough to give it. In a contract, I earn the right for the other person to give it up. In a gift, I earn the right to have it once the giver lets it go, instead of someone else getting it.

This is what some thinkers call the difference between “meritum congrui” and “meritum condigni.” They say God promised heaven to people who live by His rules. These people “merit” heaven because they follow His rules (meritum congrui). But no one can claim heaven as a right just because they are good; it only comes by God’s free grace (meritum condigni).

This is how I understand that idea, but since people argue about what these terms really mean, I won’t say more about that. The main point is, if a prize is given openly for anyone to compete for, whoever wins truly earns it and can claim it.

If two people make a deal but neither does their part right away, just trusting each other, the deal is useless in a natural state where everyone is against everyone else. If there is a strong authority that can force both to keep the deal, then it’s valid. The person who does their part first can’t be sure the other will do theirs because promises alone aren’t enough to control greed, anger, or other feelings without fear of punishment. In a natural state where everyone is equal and judges for themselves, this trust is impossible.

So, the person who acts first is just putting themselves at risk against an enemy and goes against their right to protect themselves and what they need to live.

But in a society with a government that can punish those who break promises, this fear isn’t fair. That’s why the person who is supposed to act first in the deal must do so.
