They called their own clever ideas “Muses,” their own ignorance “Fortune,” their own desires “Cupid,” their own anger “Furies,” and their private parts “Priapus.” They also blamed their bad habits on creatures called incubi and succubae. Basically, anything a poet wanted to include in a story, they turned into either a god or a devil.

The same people who made up the religion of the Gentiles noticed that people didn’t understand what really caused things to happen. So, they explained their luck by blaming it on different gods instead of real causes. For example, they said Venus was responsible for having babies, Apollo for arts, Mercury for cleverness and tricks, Aeolus for storms, and many other gods for other things. There were almost as many gods as there were different jobs or activities.

For worship, people naturally wanted to give gifts, say prayers, and give thanks to their gods. The leaders of the Gentiles added statues and pictures of these gods so that regular people, who didn’t understand much, would think the gods really lived inside these images and be more afraid of them. They also gave these gods lands, houses, and money, setting them apart from normal human use, making those places holy. These gods were shown in different shapes—some looked like people, some like animals, some like monsters. They were said to have feelings and powers like humans and animals, such as senses, speech, sex, desire, and the ability to have children. Some gods were even said to be part human, like Bacchus and Hercules. Besides that, these gods were thought to have human emotions like anger and revenge, and to do things like cheating, stealing, lying, and other bad behaviors that people thought were wrong by law, not just by honor.
