Finally, St. Stephen was stoned because of these laws, not because of personal anger or passion. Before he was taken away to be killed, he explained his case to the high priest. Nowhere in the Bible does it support people taking the law into their own hands to punish others out of personal feelings. Doing that often comes from being ignorant and emotional, which goes against fairness and peace in a community.

In chapter 36, I said it’s not clear exactly how God spoke to Moses in a supernatural way. That doesn’t mean God didn’t speak to him through dreams, visions, or a special voice like He did with other prophets. The Bible says that when Moses went into the Tabernacle to talk with God, he heard a voice from above the mercy seat, which is over the Ark of the testimony, between the cherubim (Numbers 7:89). But it doesn’t explain what made God’s way of speaking to Moses better than how He spoke to other prophets like Samuel and Abraham, who also heard God’s voice or saw visions. The difference might be how clearly Moses saw or heard God. The phrases “face to face” and “mouth to mouth” shouldn’t be taken literally because God’s nature is beyond what we can fully understand.

About the whole idea, I still believe the main points are true and make sense. I base the civil rights of rulers, and the responsibilities and freedoms of people, on what we know about human nature and natural laws. Anyone who can manage their own family should understand this basic idea. For the religious power of rulers, I base it on clear Bible verses that fit well with the overall message of Scripture. So, I’m sure that anyone who reads it just to learn will understand. But people who already believe in the opposite ideas, through their writing, speeches, or actions, won’t be easily convinced. When people read things that challenge their beliefs, they often get distracted and look for problems with what they’re reading. This happens especially now, when the interests of people are changing. Much of the new ideas needed to build a new government will be different from those that helped break down the old one, so there will be many objections.
