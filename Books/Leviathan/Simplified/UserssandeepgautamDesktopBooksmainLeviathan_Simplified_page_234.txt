Some people might say that only the last chapter, not the whole Pentateuch, was written by someone else, and the rest was not. So, let's look at what we find in the Book of Genesis: "And Abraham passed through the land to the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh, and the Canaanite was then in the land" (Genesis 12:6). These words must come from someone who wrote when the Canaanites were not in the land, which means it wasn’t Moses, because he died before entering it. Also, in Numbers 21:14, the writer refers to an older book called The Book of the Wars of the Lord, which recorded Moses’ actions at the Red Sea and the brook of Arnon.

Because of this, it’s clear that the five Books of Moses were written after his time, though we don’t know exactly how long after.

Even though Moses didn’t write all those books exactly as we have them now, he did write what he is said to have written. For example, the book of the law, which seems to be in Deuteronomy chapters 11 to 27, was commanded to be written on stones when they entered Canaan. Moses himself wrote this and gave it to the priests and elders to read every seven years during the feast of tabernacles (Deuteronomy 31:9-10). This law is the one God told kings to copy from the priests and Levites when they had kings (Deuteronomy 17:18). Moses also told the priests and Levites to put this law beside the Ark (Deuteronomy 31:26). Later, this book was lost but found again by Hilkiah (II Kings 22:8) and given to King Josiah, who read it to the people and made a new promise with God (II Kings 23:1-3).

The Book of Joshua was also written much later than Joshua’s time. For example, Joshua set up twelve stones in the Jordan River as a monument, and the book says, "They are there unto this day" (Joshua 4:9). The phrase "unto this day" means a long time after, beyond people’s memory. Also, when the Lord said He had taken away Egypt’s shame, the writer says, "The place is called Gilgal unto this day" (Joshua 5:9), which would not make sense if said during Joshua’s time. Similarly, the name Leviathan for the valley of Achor, because of the trouble Achan caused, is said to "remain unto this day" (Joshua 7:24), showing the story was written later.
