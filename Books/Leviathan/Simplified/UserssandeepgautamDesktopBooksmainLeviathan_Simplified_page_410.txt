Besides worshipping images like idols, there is also a kind of fake worship that is still wrong but not exactly idolatry. Idolatry is when you truly honor something inside, but fake worship just looks like worship. Sometimes people do this fake worship because they are scared of dying or getting punished. This is still a sin if those people are important examples for others because when people follow their actions, they might get confused about what is right in religion. But if someone unimportant does the same, it doesn’t affect others as much since people don’t follow their example.

If a pastor or someone smart in religion shows respect to an idol just because they are scared, and doesn’t make it clear that they actually don’t agree with it, they confuse others. Their followers might think it’s okay to worship idols. This is a sin because it misleads people. But if someone who isn’t a leader or respected in religion does this, and others follow them, it’s not really their fault. They shouldn’t be followed anyway. For example, if a regular person is forced by an evil king to worship an idol or face death, it’s good they hate the idol inside. It would be better if they were brave enough to die instead. But if a pastor does this, it’s not only a sin but also betrays their responsibility to teach the truth.

To sum up, if someone worships an image or any created thing or believes it hears prayers or sees devotions, they are committing idolatry. If someone pretends to worship out of fear and is an important example for others, they are sinning. But if someone worships the Creator in front of an image or place chosen by God’s command, like the Jews worshipped before certain symbols or temples for a time, that is not idolatry.
