But it means something else too. There, it means “books written after his natural philosophy.” But the Schools think these books are about supernatural philosophy. The word metaphysics can mean both things. And actually, most of what’s written there is so hard to understand and goes against common sense that anyone who thinks they get it must believe it’s about supernatural stuff.

These metaphysics ideas, mixed with the Bible to make School divinity, say there are certain essences separated from bodies. They call these abstract essences and substantial forms. Explaining this weird language needs more attention here. Also, sorry to those not used to this kind of talk—I’m mainly talking to people who are.

The world (not just Earth, which some call “worldly men,” but the whole universe, meaning everything) is made of bodies. Bodies have size—length, width, and depth. Every part of a body is also a body and has size. So every part of the universe is a body. Anything that’s not a body isn’t part of the universe. And since the universe is everything, anything not in it is nothing and nowhere.

But that doesn’t mean spirits are nothing. Spirits have size and are real bodies too, even if we usually call bodies only things we can see or touch. Spirits are called incorporeal, which sounds fancier and is used to honor God. When we think about God, we don’t focus on what words describe Him best—because He can’t be fully understood—but on words that show our respect for Him.

To understand why they say there are abstract essences or substantial forms, we have to look at what those words really mean. Words help us remember and show others what we’re thinking. Some words name real things we can sense, like objects we see or touch. Other words name the images or ideas in our minds, like mental pictures of things we see or remember. And some words name other words or types of speech, like universal, plural, singular, or words about how we talk, like definition, truth, falsehood, question, promise, or agreement.
