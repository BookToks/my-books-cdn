So, the decisions made by this council weren’t actually laws, just advice.

The sixth point comes from Romans 13: “Let everyone obey the higher powers, because all power comes from God.” This means not only government leaders but also church leaders. But I say that true church leaders are only those who also have civil power. Their authority doesn’t go beyond their government power. If not, they might be teachers, but not real rulers. If the Apostle meant we should obey both our rulers and the Pope, that would be like trying to serve two bosses, which Jesus said is impossible. Also, when the Apostle said he might have to be strict when present, he didn’t mean punishing people by jail or fines. He only meant excommunication, which without government backing is just cutting someone off, like treating them as an outsider. Sometimes this hurts the person doing the excommunicating more than the one being cut off.

The seventh point is from 1 Corinthians 4:21: “Should I come to you with a stick, or with love and kindness?” Here, the “stick” isn’t a real punishment from the government, but the power to excommunicate. Excommunication itself isn’t punishment, but a warning of punishment that Jesus will give on Judgment Day. Even then, it’s not really a punishment like breaking a law, but more like getting back at an enemy who denies Jesus’ right to rule. So, this doesn’t prove that any bishop has law-making power unless they also have civil power.

The eighth point is from Timothy 3:2, which says a bishop should have only one wife and be careful and serious. This is called a law. But I thought only the leader of the Church, St. Peter, could make laws. Even if St. Peter made this rule, I don’t see why it’s a law instead of just advice. Timothy wasn’t a ruler but a student of St. Paul, and the people he looked after weren’t citizens but learners in Jesus’ school.
