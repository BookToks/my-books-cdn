If all the advice Paul gives to Timothy were laws, then why isn’t this also a law: “Don’t just drink water, but use a little wine for your health”? And why aren’t the instructions from doctors laws too? It’s not the advice itself that makes something a law, but whether the person giving it has the power to make it one.

Similarly, in 1 Timothy 5:19, it says, “Don’t accept an accusation against an elder without two or three witnesses.” This is good advice, but it’s not a law.

Next, in Luke 10:16, it says, “Anyone who listens to you listens to me, and anyone who rejects you rejects me.” It means that if you reject the message from those sent by Christ, you are rejecting Christ himself. But who are the ones sent by Christ now? They are pastors who are officially chosen by the proper authority. And those pastors are appointed by the leaders of the Christian community.

So, this means that if a Christian listens to their leader, they are listening to Christ. And if they reject the teachings their Christian king supports, they are rejecting Christ’s teachings. But this doesn’t prove what Bellarmine says here; it actually shows the opposite. Still, this doesn’t make it a law. A Christian king who teaches his people doesn’t make his teachings into laws just because he says so.

He can’t force people to believe, even though as a ruler, he can make laws based on his beliefs that force people to act in certain ways. Sometimes these laws make people do things they wouldn’t choose on their own, and maybe shouldn’t be forced to do. But when people obey these laws, their actions are really the actions of the ruler, not their own, because they are just following orders since God says to obey rulers.

Finally, whenever the Apostle gives advice and uses words that sound like commands, it doesn’t mean they are laws. For example, in 1 Corinthians 11:2, Paul says, “I praise you for keeping the instructions I gave you.” The original Greek means good advice, not laws.

And in 1 Thessalonians 4:2, it says, “You know the commands we gave you,” but the Greek actually means “the things we told you,” which again means advice, not laws. Even though it says that anyone who ignores this advice ignores God, Jesus himself didn’t come to be a king who forces people. He came to save sinners and leave teachers in the Church to guide people, not force them.

God wants people to change their hearts from the inside, not just follow laws. This inward change comes from advice and teaching, not from rules and laws.
