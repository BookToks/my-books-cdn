What is said here about the rights of a group that governs a province or a colony also applies to groups that govern a town, a university, a college, a church, or any other group that has control over people.

Usually, in any organized group, if a member feels they have been treated unfairly by the group, their issue should be handled by the highest authority, or the people the highest authority chooses to judge such cases—not by the group itself. This is different in a group where the highest authority is part of the group, because if the highest authority is not the judge, then there is no one to judge at all.

In a group that manages trade with other countries, the best way is to have a meeting where all members can join and be part of decisions if they want. Merchants, who buy and sell goods and trade with other countries, still join together in one group even though they can trade on their own. This is because most merchants don’t have enough goods to fill a whole ship by themselves, so they work together in a society where everyone can share the profits based on how much they invest, or sell their own goods at prices they choose. But this group is not a real government because it doesn’t have a leader who can make rules that everyone must follow.

The goal of joining together is to make more money. They do this by being the only buyers and only sellers in both their own country and other countries.

So, when a group of merchants is made into a corporation or governing body, it means they get two monopolies: one to be the only buyers and one to be the only sellers. When a company is in charge of trading with a certain foreign country, they are the only ones who export goods that sell well there. This means they buy goods at home only from themselves and sell goods abroad only through themselves. Because of this, they can buy goods at lower prices at home and sell them at higher prices abroad. In the foreign country, there is only one buyer of goods and only one seller at home, which helps the merchants make more profit.
