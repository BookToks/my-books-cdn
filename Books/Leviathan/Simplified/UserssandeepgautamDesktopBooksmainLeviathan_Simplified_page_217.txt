Leviathan/217 The best advice about things that only affect a country’s own people should come from what the people in each area say. They know what they need the most. So, as long as their requests don’t go against the important rights of the government, their opinions should be carefully listened to. Without those important rights, the country can’t survive.

A top army leader who isn’t liked won’t be respected or feared the way he should be by his soldiers. Because of that, he won’t do his job well. He needs to work hard, be brave, friendly, generous, and lucky so the soldiers think he is capable and cares about them. When soldiers like their leader, they want to do well and be brave to earn his approval. It also makes it easier for the leader to punish soldiers who don’t follow orders. But if the leader’s loyalty isn’t trusted, soldiers’ love for him can be dangerous for the government. That’s why it’s important for the people in charge to choose leaders who are both good and loyal.

When the ruler is popular—meaning the people respect and love him—there’s no problem if one leader is liked by the soldiers. Soldiers usually won’t support their captain against the ruler if they respect both the ruler and his cause. People who have taken power by force have always struggled to prove they have the right to rule because it’s embarrassing for people to accept leaders without a real claim. Having a clear right to rule is such a strong reason for people to support a leader that he doesn’t have to do anything else. The people just need to see that he can control his own family. Enemies will lose their armies because most people have never been happy with the way things are.

About how one ruler should treat another, which is called the law of nations, I don’t need to explain here because the law of nations is the same as natural law. Every ruler has the same right to protect his people as a person has to protect themselves.
