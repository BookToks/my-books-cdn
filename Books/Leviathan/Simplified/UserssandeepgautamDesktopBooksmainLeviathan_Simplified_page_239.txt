To sum up, the stories and predictions in the Old Testament, and the gospels and letters in the New Testament, all have the same goal: to help people obey God. This happened in three main ways: through Moses and the priests, through Jesus Christ, and through the Apostles and those who came after them.

These three groups showed God’s presence at different times. In the Old Testament, it was Moses, the high priests, and the kings of Judah. When Jesus lived on earth, He represented God. After Him, the Apostles and their followers have carried on that role, starting from the day the Holy Spirit came to them at Pentecost until now.

People who follow different Christian beliefs often argue about where the Bible gets its authority. Sometimes, the question is asked in other ways, like how we know the Bible is God’s word or why we believe that. The problem with these questions is that they are not asked clearly. Everyone agrees that God is the original source of the Bible. The real question is not about who wrote it first.

Also, no one can really know for sure that the Bible is God’s word unless God has shown them this directly in a special way. So, the question about how we know this is not really the right one to ask. Finally, when people talk about why they believe the Bible, different people believe for different reasons, so there isn’t one simple answer for everyone. The real question is: by what authority is the Bible treated as law?

If the Bible agrees with the laws of nature, then it is definitely God’s law, and everyone who can think clearly can understand this. But this kind of authority is just like the authority of any moral advice that makes sense; these rules are not made by people but have always been true.

If God Himself made these laws, then they are written laws. These laws apply only to those who have been clearly told by God that they are His laws, so no one can say they didn’t know.
