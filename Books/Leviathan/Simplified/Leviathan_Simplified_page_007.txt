Nature is like an art that God used to make and control the world. People copy this art in many ways, including making artificial animals. Since life is basically movement of body parts starting from a main part inside, we can say that machines that move by themselves, like watches with springs and wheels, have an artificial kind of life. The heart is like a spring, nerves are like strings, and joints are like wheels that move the body as the Creator planned. Art goes even further by copying the smartest and best part of Nature: humans.

Art creates a big Leviathan, which means a Commonwealth or State. This is like an artificial human, but bigger and stronger, made to protect and defend people. The government is like the soul giving life to the whole body. Judges and officers are like joints that help it move. Rewards and punishments are like nerves that make everyone do their jobs. The wealth of the people is the body's strength. Keeping people safe is the main job. Counselors who give advice are like memory. Fair laws and rules are the mind and will. Peace is health, arguing and fighting are sickness, and civil war is death. The agreements that put this body together are like God’s words when He said, “Let us make man,” at Creation.

To explain this artificial man, I will first talk about what it is made of and who made it — both are human.

Next, I will explain how it is made through agreements, what rights and power the leader has, and what keeps it together or causes it to fall apart.
