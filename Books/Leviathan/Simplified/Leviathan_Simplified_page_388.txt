John said, “If I want him to stay until I come, what does that matter to you?” (John 21:22). Because of this, some people believed that the person wouldn’t die. But this idea wasn’t clearly proven or disproven; it was just a confusing statement.

The same problem happens with a part in the Gospel of Mark. If we guess what it means by looking at what comes right after, both here and in Luke where it’s mentioned again, it seems likely it’s about the Transfiguration. This is when Jesus took Peter, James, and John up a high mountain, away from the others, and was changed in front of them. His clothes became super bright, whiter than anything on earth. Then Elijah and Moses appeared and talked with Jesus. They saw Jesus in all his glory and power, like he will be one day, and it scared them.

So, Jesus’ promise was shown to them as a vision.

It was probably a vision, because Luke says Peter and the others were very sleepy (Luke 9:28), and Matthew 17:9 says Jesus told them not to tell anyone about the vision until after he rose from the dead. But no matter what, you can’t use this story to prove that God’s kingdom starts only at the day of judgment.

Some people also use other Bible verses to claim the Pope has power over kings and rulers, like the story of two swords, one spiritual and one earthly, that Peter supposedly got from Jesus. They also say the bigger light means the Pope and the smaller one means the king. But you could just as easily say from the first verse of the Bible that “heaven” means the Pope and “earth” means the king. That’s not a real argument from the Bible. It’s more like the popes, after becoming very powerful, mocking kings and emperors, acting like they were above everyone.

About church ceremonies, even if church leaders mostly decide how to do them and not the Bible, they still have to make sure the ceremonies, words, and actions fit the meaning and purpose of what they’re doing.
