Paul talks about Christian faith and says, "Faith comes by hearing," (Romans 10:17) which means we believe by listening to our true pastors. He also asks, "How can people believe in someone they haven’t heard about? And how can they hear without a preacher? And how can a preacher preach unless they are sent?" (Romans 10:14-15). This shows that the main way people come to believe the Scriptures are God’s word is by listening to those who are legally allowed to teach us, like our parents at home and pastors at church. This idea is also clear from experience. In Christian countries, most people believe or at least say the Scriptures are God’s word because they have been taught that since they were kids. In other countries, people are taught differently, so they don’t believe as much.

But if teaching causes faith, why doesn’t everyone believe? It’s clear that faith is a gift from God, and He gives it to whoever He wants. Still, God gives this gift through teachers, so hearing is the direct cause of faith. It’s like in a school where many students are taught; some learn well, others don’t. The teacher causes learning, but that doesn’t mean learning isn’t a gift from God. All good things come from God, but not everyone who has them can say they were directly inspired by Him. To say that would mean claiming to be a prophet, which the Church checks carefully.

Whether people know, believe, or accept the Scriptures as God’s word, if I show from clear parts of the Bible what beliefs are really necessary for salvation, everyone should know and believe those.

The one and only belief the Bible says is absolutely necessary for salvation is that Jesus is the Christ. The name “Christ” means the King God promised long ago through the Old Testament prophets. This King was sent to the world to rule forever (over the Jews and others who believe in Him) under God’s authority and to give eternal life, which was lost because of Adam’s sin. Once I prove this from the Bible, I will also explain when and how some other beliefs can be called necessary.
