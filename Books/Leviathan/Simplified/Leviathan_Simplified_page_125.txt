Winning a fight doesn’t automatically give someone the right to control the loser. Instead, control comes from an agreement between them. A person isn’t forced to obey just because they lost or were captured, but because they accept the winner’s power. The winner doesn’t have to promise to spare a person who surrenders without asking for life to be guaranteed; the winner can decide what to do with them.

When people ask for “quarter” (which means to be taken alive), they are trying to stop the victor’s anger by giving up and hoping to trade their life for money or service. Having quarter doesn’t mean their life is safe forever; it only lasts as long as the victor decides. Their life is truly safe only when the victor trusts them enough to keep them free. Prisoners or slaves work not because they want to, but to avoid harsh treatment.

A master has control over everything his servant owns or does, including the servant’s labor, belongings, family, and children. This is because the servant agrees to obey the master and accept whatever the master decides. If the master punishes the servant for not obeying, the master is responsible for the punishment and the servant can’t complain about being treated unfairly.

In short, the powers of a father over his family and a ruler over his subjects are the same as those of a king chosen by the people or one who took power by force. For someone who rules many nations, in some places their power comes from the people agreeing, and in others from conquering. Trying to treat a conquered nation worse than one who agreed to be ruled shows a misunderstanding of how sovereignty works.
