Some people used to call these men crazy, while others called them possessed by spirits. In Italy today, they might be called "pazzi," which means madmen, or "spiritati," meaning men who are possessed.

Once, in the Greek city of Abdera, a lot of people gathered to watch a play called Andromeda on a very hot day. Many of the viewers got fevers from the heat and the play. Because of this, they kept repeating certain words with the names Perseus and Andromeda. Their madness went away when winter came. People thought their strange behavior was caused by the strong feelings from the play.

In another Greek city, there was a madness that affected only young girls, causing many to hang themselves. Most people thought this was the work of the devil. But one person thought it might come from strong feelings in their minds. He suggested that the officials should leave the girls who hanged themselves naked while hanging. This strange idea supposedly cured the madness.

The Greeks often believed that madness was caused by spirits like the Eumenides or Furies, or gods like Ceres and Phoebus. They thought spirits were real, invisible beings in the air. The Romans and Jews had similar ideas. The Jews sometimes called madmen prophets or demoniacs, meaning people controlled by spirits. Some even called the same person both a madman and a demoniac.

For non-Jewish people, this was normal because they often worshipped diseases, health, good and bad behavior, and other things as demons. So "demon" could mean a sickness or an evil spirit. But it was strange for the Jews to think this way. Moses and Abraham didn’t believe prophets were controlled by spirits but that they spoke because of God’s voice, visions, or dreams. Also, in Jewish law, there was no mention of being possessed or controlled by spirits. When God took the spirit from Moses and gave it to seventy elders, it didn’t mean God was divided but that His power was shared.
