It doesn’t make sense to think that when a group asks people to send representatives to share their thoughts or wishes, those representatives are the only true voice of the people instead of the whole group. The same idea applies to a monarchy. 

It’s strange that people don’t notice this obvious truth: in a monarchy, the king who has ruled for hundreds of years is called the sovereign and is respected by everyone, but he is never seen as just a representative of the people. That title is usually given to the people sent by the king to bring petitions and advice, if the king allows it. This shows that those who truly represent the people should understand their role well and be careful about allowing anyone else to speak for everyone, if they want to do their job right.

The difference between the three types of government isn’t about power but about how well they keep peace and security for the people, which is why they exist. When we compare monarchy to other types, we see that anyone representing the people also has their own personal interests. Even if they want to help everyone, they often care more about themselves, their family, and friends. People’s feelings usually control them more than their thinking. 

So, when public and private interests are closely linked, the public benefits the most. In a monarchy, the king’s private interests are the same as the public’s because the king’s wealth, power, and honor come from the people’s wealth, strength, and reputation. No king can be rich, respected, or safe if the people are poor, weak, or divided. But in democracies or aristocracies, one selfish or dishonest person’s actions can harm the whole public more easily.
