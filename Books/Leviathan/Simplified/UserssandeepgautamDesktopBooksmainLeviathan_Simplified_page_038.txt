Every time we think carefully about something, we stop when what we’re thinking about is either done or seems impossible. Until then, we can still choose to do it or not, based on what we want or don’t want.

When we decide, the last feeling that pushes us to act or not act is called the will. It’s the action of wanting something, not just the ability to want. Animals that can think things over also have will. Some people say will is just a “rational appetite,” but that’s not quite right. If will were only about reason, then people could never do something against reason on purpose. Instead, will is the last desire that comes after thinking things through. Even if someone once wanted to do something but didn’t, that was just a feeling, not a true act of will. This is because the final desire controls what we actually do. If earlier feelings could make us act, then earlier feelings against acting would also have to stop us, which would be confusing.

So, it’s clear that actions started by wanting something like money, power, or pleasure, as well as those started by not wanting something because of fear or dislike, are all actions we choose to do.

The way we talk about emotions is sometimes the same and sometimes different from how we talk about thoughts. For example, emotions can be stated simply: I love, I fear, I’m happy, I’m deciding, I want, I order. But some emotions have special ways of being expressed, which aren’t really statements unless they lead to other ideas. When we think about choices, we usually talk in “if” sentences, like, “If this happens, then that will happen.” This is like reasoning, but reasoning is more general, and thinking over choices is often about specific things. When we want or don’t want something, we speak in commands: “Do this,” or “Don’t do that.” If someone has to follow these commands, it’s an order; if not, it’s a request or advice. Feelings like pride, anger, pity, or revenge are expressed as wishes. And when we want to know something, we ask questions like, “What is it? When will it happen? How does it work? Why is it like this?”
