Here’s proof that believing “Jesus is the Christ” is all the faith you need to be saved. My first point comes from what the gospel writers focused on. They told the story of Jesus to show one main thing: Jesus is the Christ.

St. Matthew’s Gospel sums it up like this: Jesus came from King David’s family and was born from a virgin, which shows he is the true Christ. The Magi came to worship him as the King of the Jews. King Herod wanted to kill him for this reason. John the Baptist told everyone about him. Jesus and his followers said he was the King. He taught with authority, not like other teachers. He healed people just by speaking and did many other miracles that were predicted for the Christ. People welcomed him as King when he entered Jerusalem. He warned them to be careful of anyone else claiming to be the Christ. He was arrested, accused, and put to death because he said he was King. The sign on his cross said, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." All of this was meant to make people believe that Jesus is the Christ. That was the main goal of St. Matthew’s Gospel. The other gospel writers did the same. St. John even said it clearly: “These things are written so that you may believe Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.”

My second point comes from what the Apostles preached, both when Jesus was alive and after he went to heaven. When Jesus sent them out, their job was to preach about God’s kingdom. They were told to say, “The kingdom of heaven is near,” meaning Jesus is the Messiah, the Christ, the King who was coming. After Jesus returned to heaven, they kept preaching the same thing. In the book of Acts, people got upset because the Apostles said there was another king—Jesus. St. Paul also spent time explaining from the Scriptures that the Christ had to suffer, die, and rise again. This shows their whole message was about Jesus being the Christ.
