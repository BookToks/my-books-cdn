Just like a child needs a teacher or protector to keep them safe and in control, big countries also need special leaders during really hard times. These leaders are called dictators or protectors of freedom. They act like temporary kings who get all the power for a while. But once their time is up, they often lose that power, even more than child kings lose power to their guardians or tutors.

There are three main kinds of government: monarchy, where one person rules; democracy, where everyone in the country shares power; and aristocracy, where a small group of chosen people have power. But if you look at all the countries in the world, you might see that many don’t fit perfectly into these three types. Sometimes, governments mix these types. For example, in elective kingdoms, kings get power for only a limited time, or in some kingdoms, the king’s power is limited. Most people still call these monarchies. Also, if a democracy or aristocracy takes over another land and rules it with a leader like a president or governor, it might seem like democracy or aristocracy, but it’s actually monarchy. This is because elective or limited kings are not the real rulers; they just work for those who hold the true power. And lands controlled by another country’s democracy or aristocracy are actually ruled like monarchies.

First, think about an elective king, who has power for his whole life, like in many Christian countries today, or for a few years like the Roman dictator. If the king can pick who comes after him, then it’s not really elective but hereditary (passed down in the family). But if he cannot choose his successor, then someone else or a group must pick a new king after he dies. If no one can pick a new king, the country will fall apart and go back to fighting. If it’s clear who can choose the next king, it means they had the power before. No one can give away power they don’t have. But if there’s no one to choose the next king after the first one dies, the king must make sure to set up a successor to stop the country from falling into chaos and war.
