To make the difference clearer, imagine one guy who is naturally good and quick at using his weapons. Now imagine another guy who not only has that natural skill but also has learned exactly where he can hit or be hit by his opponent in every position or move. The first guy’s skill is like being careful, while the second guy’s skill is like being truly smart and wise. Both are helpful, but the second is definitely better. 

People who only trust what books say and follow them without thinking are like someone who blindly trusts bad advice from a fencing teacher and then rushes into a fight where they might get hurt or embarrassed.

Some signs of real knowledge are certain and can’t be wrong, while others are uncertain. You know knowledge is certain when someone who claims to know something can clearly teach it to someone else and prove it’s true. It’s uncertain when only some examples match what they say, but many don’t. Signs of being careful and wise are always uncertain because it’s impossible to remember and notice every single detail that might change how things turn out. 

In any situation where you don’t have perfect knowledge, ignoring your own good sense and just following general advice from books (which often have exceptions) is foolish. People who do this are usually called show-offs. Even those who like to show off how much they know about politics and history often don’t act the same way when it comes to their own personal lives. They have enough sense to handle their own problems but care more about looking smart in public than actually helping others.

There are two kinds of movements in animals. One is called vital, which starts when they’re born and keeps going without stopping their whole life, like the flow of blood, breathing, and digestion. These don’t need imagination to happen. The other kind is called voluntary motion, like walking, talking, or moving any part of the body in a way first thought about in the mind. Sensing things, like seeing or hearing, causes movement inside the body and its organs.
