The builders are like pastors; the foundation is that Jesus is the Christ. The stubble and hay are wrong ideas people get because they don’t understand or make mistakes. The gold, silver, and precious stones are their true teachings. Getting rid of their mistakes is like refining or cleaning. None of this means that souls, which aren’t physical and can’t suffer, are burned.

A third example is from I Corinthians 15:29, about baptism for the dead. Some people say this means praying for the dead helps them and that there is a purgatory fire. But both ideas are not right. The word baptism here is thought to mean a "baptism of penance," which is like fasting, praying, and giving to others. So, baptism for the dead and praying for the dead would be the same. But this is just a metaphor that doesn’t really fit with the Bible or how words are used. Baptism usually means being dipped in water or blood, like Jesus on the cross or the apostles who died for their faith. It doesn’t make sense to compare praying, fasting, and giving money to being dipped.

The same word baptism is also used in Matthew 3:11 about being purified by fire. But this fire is like the one the prophet Zechariah talks about when he says God will refine people with fire. St. Peter and St. Paul also talk about a fire that tests faith, but this fire is for the time when Jesus returns or on the day of judgment. So, the fire in Matthew might mean that fire, and there’s no need to think about a purgatory fire.

Another way to understand baptism for the dead is what I said before. It supports the idea that praying for the dead is useful. If after the resurrection, people who didn’t know or believe in Christ can still enter his kingdom, then it makes sense for their friends to pray for them until they rise again.
