The Athenians were taught that they were free people, and that anyone living under a king or queen was a slave. Because of this, Aristotle said in his book Politics, “In a democracy, people have freedom; in other governments, people are not really free.” Cicero and other writers also believed this, based on the Romans, who were taught to hate kings. At first, the Romans who kicked out their king shared power among themselves, and later, their leaders continued this idea. 

By reading these old Greek and Latin writers, people grew up thinking that freedom means causing chaos and controlling their rulers, and then fighting over who controls the controllers. This has caused a lot of bloodshed, and I think no other place has paid so much for learning these old languages.

Now, let’s talk about what true freedom for a subject really means. It means understanding what things, even if the ruler orders them, a person can still say no to without being unfair. We need to think about what rights we give up when we make a government or accept a ruler. Our freedom and duty come from the agreement we make with the ruler. Everyone is naturally free, and no one is forced to do anything unless they agree to it.

This agreement can be understood from words like “I allow all their actions” or from why the person agrees to be ruled, which is usually to have peace and protection from enemies.

First, since power comes from an agreement between people or from the winner to the loser, it’s clear that everyone keeps freedom in areas that the agreement does not give away.
