I don't find any other way to show feelings like anger or hate. Swearing and insulting don’t really count as real speech; they’re more like habits of the tongue.

These kinds of words are ways we choose to show our feelings, but they aren’t reliable signs because people can use them even if they don’t really feel that way. The best signs of how someone feels are in their face, body movements, actions, and goals, which we usually understand about the person.

When we think carefully about what to do, our wants and dislikes come from imagining the good or bad results that might happen. The result depends on seeing a long chain of consequences, which most people can’t fully understand. But if the good things seem to be more than the bad, that’s what people call an “apparent good.” If the bad things seem to be more, it’s an “apparent evil.” So, the person who can best predict the results through experience or reason makes the best decisions and can give the best advice.

People call being successful in getting what they want over time “happiness,” meaning happy in this life. No one can have perfect peace of mind all the time while living, because life is always changing and full of desires and fears, just like feelings. The kind of happiness God gives to those who truly honor Him is something we won’t understand or enjoy until after this life. Right now, it’s as hard to understand as some confusing religious words.

When people want to show that something is good, they use praise. When they want to show something is powerful or great, they use magnifying words. And when they want to show their opinion about someone’s happiness, the Greeks had a special word for it, called macarism, which we don’t have in English. That’s enough for now about feelings.
