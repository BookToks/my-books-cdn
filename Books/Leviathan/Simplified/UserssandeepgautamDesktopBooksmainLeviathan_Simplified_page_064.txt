People often can't tell the difference between one action done by many people and many actions done by one group without studying a lot. For example, they might mix up all the senators acting together to kill Catiline with many senators acting separately to kill Caesar. Because of this, people sometimes think a whole group did something when really many individuals acted, maybe influenced by just one person.

When people don’t understand the reasons behind what’s right or fair, they rely on habits and examples to decide what to do. They might think something is wrong just because it’s usually punished, or right because it’s been allowed before. This is like kids who only know good and bad based on how their parents or teachers treat them. But unlike kids, adults change their ideas depending on what benefits them. They switch between following rules and ignoring them to suit their needs. That’s why ideas about right and wrong are always debated with words or even violence. But things like math aren’t argued over because they don’t affect anyone’s power or money.

I’m sure that if it went against someone’s power or interests to say the three angles of a triangle equal two angles of a square, people would have tried to stop that idea, maybe by destroying books about it.

People don’t understand the real, deep causes of things, so they blame what they see right away. That’s why when people are upset about taxes, they get mad at the tax collectors and support anyone who complains about the government. But when things get really serious, they end up blaming the top leaders too, either because they’re afraid of punishment or embarrassed to ask for forgiveness.
