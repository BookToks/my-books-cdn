God said clearly about Joshua: “He will stand before Eleazar the priest, who will ask God for advice for him; at his word they will go out, and at his word they will come in, both Joshua and all the people of Israel with him.” (Numbers 27:21) 

This means the priest had the highest power to decide about war and peace. The high priest also had the highest power to judge people, because the Book of the Law was kept by them. The priests and Levites were only lower judges for civil matters, as shown in Deuteronomy 17:8-10. When it came to worshipping God, everyone agreed the high priest was the boss until King Saul’s time. So, the high priest had both the civil and religious power, and this should be the case for anyone who rules by God’s direct authority.

After Joshua died and until Saul became king, the Book of Judges often says, “There was no king in Israel,” and sometimes adds that “everyone did what was right in their own eyes.” This means there was no real leader or ruler in Israel at that time. After Joshua and Eleazar died, a new generation appeared that didn’t know God or what He had done for Israel, and they did evil and worshiped other gods like Baalim (Judges 2:10). The people wanted signs from God not only before they agreed to follow Moses but even after they had promised to obey. Signs and miracles were meant to help people believe, not to stop them from breaking their promise once they believed, because people should obey by natural law.

If we look at who had the right to rule, the high priest still had the highest power. The judges were chosen by God only for special times to save the people from enemies, so obeying them doesn’t change the high priest’s right to rule in all political and religious matters. Neither the judges nor Samuel had a regular job as rulers but were chosen for special reasons and were obeyed because the people respected their connection to God shown in their wisdom, bravery, or success.
