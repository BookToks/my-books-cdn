Thirdly, priests, monks, and friars don’t have to follow civil laws like regular people do. This means a big part of the population enjoys the protection of the law but doesn’t have to help pay for public costs or face punishments for their crimes. Because of this, they only answer to the Pope and support his control over everyone.

Fourthly, priests are called “sacred sacrificers,” a title that used to belong to the leaders of the Jewish people when God was their king. Also, turning the Lord’s Supper into a sacrifice makes people believe the Pope has the same power over Christians that Moses and Aaron had over the Jews, meaning he has complete control in both religious and civil matters.

Fifthly, teaching that marriage is a sacrament gives priests the power to decide if a marriage is valid. This means they control which children are considered legitimate and who can inherit kingdoms.

Sixthly, priests are not allowed to marry, which helps the Pope keep power over kings. If a king becomes a priest, he can’t have kids to pass on his kingdom. If he’s not a priest, the Pope still claims authority over him and his people.

Seventhly, through confession, priests learn private information about important leaders better than the leaders know about the church’s plans, which helps keep the Pope’s power strong.

Eighthly, by making certain people saints or martyrs, the church encourages people to stubbornly follow the Pope’s rules, even if it means going against their own country’s laws or dying. If someone is declared a heretic or enemy of the Church, they are seen as enemies of the Pope.

Ninthly, priests are believed to have the power to act like Christ, and they control penance and the forgiveness or holding back of sins, which also helps keep their power secure.
