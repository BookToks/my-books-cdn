Thinking about this made me believe that some people are too hard on themselves and others when they say that the first feelings or thoughts of the mind, even if stopped by fear of God, are sins. But I admit it’s safer to be careful that way than to be too easy.

A crime is a sin that happens when someone does or says something the law forbids, or when they don’t do something the law requires.

So every crime is a sin, but not every sin is a crime. Wanting to steal or kill is a sin, even if you never say or do anything about it, because God sees what people think. But until it shows in words or actions that a human judge can see, it’s not called a crime. The Greeks noticed this difference with two words: one meaning sin (any breaking of the law), and the others meaning crime (a sin that one person can accuse another of). People can’t accuse someone just for their secret thoughts.

The same idea was in Latin: peccatum means sin, which is any breaking of the law, but crimen means a sin that can be proven in court, not just secret thoughts.

From this, we can learn three things. First, where there is no law, there is no sin. But since natural law is forever, things like breaking promises, being ungrateful, or acting arrogantly will always be sins. Second, when civil law ends, crimes end too. Without civil law, only natural law remains, so no one can accuse another person; each person judges themselves with their conscience. If their intention is good, their actions aren’t sins; if not, their actions are sins but not crimes. Third, when the government stops, crimes stop too. Without government, the law can’t protect people, so everyone must protect themselves. But this only applies to people who didn’t help take the government down, because doing that was a crime from the start.
