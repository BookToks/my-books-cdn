Every man should think about who the main prophet is—that means, who is God’s representative on earth and has the authority to lead Christian people under God. They should accept the teachings that this person, speaking in God’s name, says to teach. Then, they should check any other prophets who claim to speak from God, whether or not they perform miracles. If these teachings go against the main prophet’s rules, they should do like the people who came to Moses and worried about others prophesying without clear permission. They left it to Moses, the main leader, to decide if those prophets were allowed or not. If Moses said no, they didn’t listen to those prophets anymore. If he said yes, then they obeyed those prophets because God had given them part of the main prophet’s spirit.

If Christian people don’t accept their main Christian leader as God’s prophet, they either believe their own ideas as if they were prophecy, or they let themselves be led by some foreign ruler or by others in their own group who trick them into rebelling against the government. These rebels don’t have any real signs or miracles proving they are right, just sometimes good luck and escaping punishment. This way, they destroy all laws, both God’s and human laws, and bring chaos, violence, and civil war.

Miracles are amazing works of God, so they are also called wonders. Most of the time, miracles happen to show God’s command clearly, especially when people might doubt what God has told them because of their own thinking. In the Bible, miracles are often called signs because they show or predict what God will do next.

To understand what a miracle is, we first need to know what things make people amazed and call them wonderful. There are only two reasons: one is if something is strange, meaning it rarely or never happens before; the other is if something happens that we can’t explain by natural causes, but only by God’s direct action.
