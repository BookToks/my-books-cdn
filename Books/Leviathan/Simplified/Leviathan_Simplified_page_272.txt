Our Saviour didn’t do many miracles in His own country because people there didn’t believe in Him. In one place, it even says He couldn’t do any miracles. It wasn’t because He didn’t have the power or didn’t want to use it. The real reason miracles happen is to help bring people who are meant to be saved into the Church.

Since Jesus was sent by God the Father, He couldn’t use His power to convert people God had already rejected. Some people try to say “He could not” means “He would not,” but that’s not how the original language works. This idea can confuse people into thinking Jesus only did miracles for those who already believed.

From what I’ve explained about miracles, we can say this: a miracle is a special work done by God, beyond normal nature, to show His chosen people that a special messenger has come to save them.

From this, we can understand two things: first, miracles don’t happen because of any special power in the person doing them, but because God does the work directly. The person is just the messenger.

Second, no devil, angel, or other spirit can do a true miracle.

If anyone does something that looks like a miracle, it’s either by natural tricks or by magic words. If someone does it by their own power, that would mean there’s a power outside of God, which no one believes. And if they do it by power given to them, then it’s just natural, not a true miracle from God.

Some parts of the Bible talk about magic that looks like miracles, like when the magicians in Egypt made snakes appear, similar to what Moses did with his rod.
