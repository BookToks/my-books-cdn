People aren’t really that different from each other, but their likes and opinions are. That’s because people of the same age have about the same amount of experience, but they use it in different ways since everyone has their own goals. Running a family well and running a kingdom well aren’t about being more or less wise, just about different kinds of work. It’s like drawing a small picture or a huge one—they’re both art, just different sizes. A simple farmer knows more about handling his own home than a government advisor knows about someone else’s problems.

If you add unfair or dishonest tricks to wisdom, like those people use when they’re scared or desperate, that’s not real wisdom—it’s sneaky and cowardly. True courage means not needing to cheat or lie. There’s also something called “shifting,” which means avoiding a small problem by causing a bigger one, like stealing from one person to pay another. That’s just a short-sighted kind of trickiness.

Smartness that you learn from studying and practicing is called reason. It’s based on using language well and helps you learn science. I’ve already talked about reason and science before.

The reasons people think differently come from feelings, which come from both their body and how they were raised. If differences in thinking came only from how our brains or senses work, then people would be very different in how they see, hear, and feel, but that’s not true. So, the real cause is feelings, which are shaped by both our nature and our upbringing.

The feelings that most change how smart people seem are mostly how much they want power, money, knowledge, and respect. But all these are really just different kinds of power.

So, someone who doesn’t care much about any of these things might be a good person who doesn’t cause trouble, but they probably won’t have many strong ideas or good judgement.
