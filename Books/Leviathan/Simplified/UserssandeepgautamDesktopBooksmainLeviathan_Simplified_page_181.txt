No law made after something happened cannot make that thing a crime. This is because if the action goes against natural law, that law already existed before the action. Also, a law that is made later can’t be used as a rule before it exists, so it can’t force anyone to follow it. But if a law is made before the action happens, then the person who does that action can be punished later, unless a smaller punishment was already known before, either by writing or by example.

People often break laws because they make mistakes in their thinking. First, some people believe wrong ideas. For example, they see that in all times and places, unfair actions are allowed if the people who do them are strong or successful. They notice that powerful people often ignore the laws, while weaker people or those who fail are called criminals. So, they start thinking that justice doesn’t mean much, that whatever someone gets by their own effort is theirs, and that because all nations do things in certain ways, those things cannot be wrong. They also think that because people did things in the past, it’s okay to do them again. If these ideas are accepted, then no action is truly a crime unless the law says so, and whether an action is good or bad depends on who wins or loses. This means what one leader calls a crime, another leader might call a good act, which causes constant problems for the peace of the country.

Second, some people who teach others give wrong ideas. They either misunderstand natural law and say it goes against civil law, or they teach ideas from old traditions that don’t fit with what people should do as citizens.

Third, people make wrong conclusions even when they start with true ideas. This often happens to those who rush to decide what to do. These people often think they understand everything well and believe that knowing right from wrong is easy and only needs common sense. But actually, understanding what is right and wrong is very hard and needs a lot of time and study.
