To believe, trust, or depend on someone is a way of showing respect. It means you think they are good and strong. Not trusting or believing them is disrespectful.

Listening carefully to someone’s advice or talk is also respectful because it shows you think they are smart or interesting. Ignoring them by sleeping, leaving, or talking is disrespectful.

Doing things for someone that show respect, or that rules or traditions say are respectful, is a way to honor them. If you don’t do these things, you are being disrespectful.

Agreeing with someone’s opinion is respectful because it shows you think they are wise. Disagreeing is disrespectful and means you think they are wrong or foolish.

Copying someone is a strong way to show respect. But copying your enemy is disrespectful.

Respecting the people someone else respects shows respect for that person. Respecting their enemies is disrespectful.

Asking someone for advice or help with hard things is a way to honor them because it means you think they are smart or capable. If you don’t ask them when they want to help, you are disrespecting them.

All these ways of showing respect are natural and happen both inside and outside of governments. But in governments where leaders decide what shows respect, there are other ways too.

A ruler honors a person by giving them titles, jobs, or important tasks that show the ruler wants to respect them.

For example, the king of Persia honored Mordecai by having him ride through the streets wearing the king’s clothes, a crown, and led by a prince, saying, “This is how the king honors someone.” But another time, the king let a man wear the king’s robe only as the king’s fool, which was a way of disrespect.

So, in governments, respect comes from the ruler’s decisions and is temporary. This kind of respect is called civil honor and includes jobs, titles, and special symbols. People respect those who have these things because they show the ruler’s favor, which means power.
