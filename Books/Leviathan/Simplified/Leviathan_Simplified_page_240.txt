If God hasn’t clearly shown someone that certain rules come from Him, or that the people sharing those rules were sent by Him, then that person doesn’t have to follow those rules unless they come from a real law.

This means the only authority that makes those rules into laws is the government, led by the ruler who has the power to make laws.

If the rules don’t come from the government, then they must come from God through someone else, either a private person or a group.

If it’s a private person, then only the people God has specially told have to follow those rules.

If everyone had to listen to every private person who claimed God spoke to them—whether because they were confused, proud, or lying—then no one would know which rules really came from God.

If it’s a group, then the authority belongs to the government or the Church.

But the Church, if it’s just one person, is the same as a Christian government, because it’s a group of Christians united under one leader.

If the Church isn’t one person, then it can’t really have any power or make any decisions, because those require a person.

If all Christians aren’t part of one government, then there isn’t a single Church with authority over all of them.

So, the Bible’s rules don’t become laws by the Church as a whole.

If there is one Christian government, then all other Christian kings and states are just parts of it and can be judged or punished by its ruler.

So, the main question is whether Christian kings and governments are fully in charge in their own lands, directly under God, or if they have to answer to one leader of the whole Church who can control or punish them for the good of everyone.

This question can’t be answered without looking more closely at the kingdom of God, which helps us understand who has the right to explain the Bible.
