In this Trinity on earth, the unity is not about being the same thing; the spirit, the water, and the blood are different, but they all tell the same story. In the Trinity of heaven, the three persons are actually the same one God, but shown in three different ways and times.

To sum up, the idea of the Trinity from the Bible is this: God, who is always one, was shown as Moses; as His Son when He came to earth; and as the Apostles. The Holy Spirit, which the Apostles spoke through, is God. The Son, who was both God and man, is God. And the Father, shown by Moses and the priests, is God too. This is why the names Father, Son, and Holy Spirit don’t appear in the Old Testament—they are names that came from how God was shown through different people.

So, we see how Jesus gave the church's power to the Apostles. They were given the Holy Spirit to help them, which is sometimes called "paracletus" in the New Testament, meaning someone who helps or comforts.

Now, let’s think about what that power actually was and who it was over.

Cardinal Bellarmine wrote a lot about the Pope’s church power and asked if it should be like a monarchy, aristocracy, or democracy. All these powers are about control and forcing people to obey. But if it turns out that Jesus only gave the power to announce His kingdom and to encourage people to follow it, teaching them what to do by advice and good guidance, then those arguments don’t matter.

I already explained that Christ’s kingdom is not of this world, so His ministers can’t make people obey Him here unless they are kings. If the Supreme King doesn’t have power in this world, then how can His officers make others obey?
