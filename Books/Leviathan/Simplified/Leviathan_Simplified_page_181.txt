A law made after something has already happened can’t make that thing a crime. If the action goes against natural law, that law was already there before the action. Also, a law can’t be enforced before it’s created, so it can’t be a rule for people to follow. But if a law banning something is made before that thing happens, then the person who does it can be punished, as long as no smaller punishment was announced before, either in writing or by example.

People break laws for three main reasons because of mistakes in thinking. First, some people believe wrong ideas. For example, they see how powerful people in history got away with bad actions because they won fights. They also see that weak people or losers are treated as criminals. So, they think justice doesn’t matter, that whatever a person can get by working hard or taking risks belongs to them, and that if lots of people do something, it can’t be wrong. They believe old examples justify doing the same bad things again. If people believe this, then no action is really a crime unless powerful people say so, and the same action can be good or bad depending on who is in charge. This causes constant problems for society.

Second, some people teach wrong ideas about natural law. They either misunderstand it and make it clash with civil law, or they teach their own rules or old traditions that don’t fit what a citizen should do.

Third, some people make wrong conclusions even from true ideas. This often happens to people who decide things too quickly because they think they are very smart and believe that understanding right and wrong only needs common sense and experience. But knowing what is right and wrong is actually very hard and needs a lot of time and study.
