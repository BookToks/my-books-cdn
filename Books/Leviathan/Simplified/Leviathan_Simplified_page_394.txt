Thomas Hobbes talks about purgatory and mentions Psalm 66:12, which says, “We went through fire and water, and you brought us to a safe place.” Back then, preachers used verses like this to make their sermons more interesting or to support their ideas.

But Hobbes also brings up some parts of the New Testament that are harder to explain. One is from Matthew 12:32, where it says that if someone speaks against the Son of Man, it can be forgiven, but if they speak against the Holy Spirit, it won’t be forgiven “in this world or in the world to come.” Some people think purgatory is the “world to come,” where certain sins can be forgiven after death. However, the Bible talks about only three worlds: the first was before the flood and was destroyed by water; the second is the current world, which will be destroyed by fire; and the third is the eternal world after the final judgment, where everyone agrees there is no purgatory. So, purgatory and the “world to come” don’t match up.

So, what does Jesus really mean by these words? It’s hard to say for sure, and it’s okay to admit that the Bible can be very deep and tough to fully understand. Still, Hobbes suggests some ideas for smarter religious thinkers to consider. One idea is that speaking against the Holy Spirit is like speaking against the Church, which is guided by the Holy Spirit. Jesus might be saying that while he was alive, he was forgiving even those who hurt him, but after he was gone, church leaders would be stricter and wouldn’t forgive people who denied their authority.

It’s like Jesus is warning that if you reject the power of church leaders, who have the Holy Spirit’s authority, they won’t forgive you and might punish you both now and in the afterlife. So, these words could be a prediction about how things would be after Jesus’ time. Or, if that’s not the case, maybe there’s still some chance for sinners to repent after the resurrection.
