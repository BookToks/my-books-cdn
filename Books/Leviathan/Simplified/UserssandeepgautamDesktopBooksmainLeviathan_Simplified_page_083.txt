Signs can come from words, silence, actions, or even not doing something. Usually, a sign in a contract is anything that clearly shows what the person wants.

Words alone that talk about the future and only promise something aren’t enough to prove a free gift, so they don’t have to be kept. For example, if someone says, "Tomorrow I will give," it means they haven’t given it yet, so their right to it stays with them until they actually do something else to give it.

But if the words talk about now or the past, like "I have given" or "I give to be delivered tomorrow," then the right for tomorrow’s gift is already given today just by the words. There’s a big difference between saying "I want this to be yours tomorrow," and "I will give it to you tomorrow." The first shows a current decision to give it later, so the right is transferred now. The second is just a promise about the future, so nothing is transferred yet.

If there are other signs besides words about wanting to give something, then even future promises can transfer rights. For example, if someone offers a prize to whoever finishes a race first, the gift is free, but the right to the prize passes with the future words because if they didn’t mean it, they wouldn’t say it.

In contracts, rights pass not only when words are about now or the past but also in the future, because contracts are about exchanging rights. So if someone promises something after already getting a benefit, it’s understood they meant to give up their right. Otherwise, the other person wouldn’t have done their part first. That’s why in buying, selling, and other deals, a promise counts as a real agreement and must be kept.

The person who does their part first in a contract deserves what they are supposed to get from the other person, and they have the right to it. Also, when a prize is offered to many people, like a race prize or money thrown for those who catch it, even though it’s a free gift, the person who wins or catches it earns it and has the right to keep it.
