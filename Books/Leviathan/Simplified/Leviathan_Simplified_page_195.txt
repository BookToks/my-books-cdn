Second, ingratitude is wrong because all power comes from the permission of the people. This power exists to protect those who obey the rules. Punishing innocent people is like doing something bad in return for something good.

Third, the law says justice should be fair and equal. Punishing innocent people does not follow this rule.

Hurting innocent people who are not part of the country is okay if it helps the country and doesn’t break any agreements. People outside the country are either enemies or used to be friends but aren’t anymore. It is okay to fight enemies by the natural right to defend yourself. In war, the winner doesn’t always care if someone was innocent or guilty before. Mercy is only shown if it helps their own people.

Because of this, even citizens who refuse to follow the country’s rules can be punished, sometimes affecting their children and grandchildren who didn’t do anything wrong. This is because refusing to obey is like starting a war again, called rebellion. Those people are treated like enemies, not citizens.

Rewards can be gifts or payments for work. Payments, like salaries or wages, are given for work done or promised. Gifts are given to encourage people to help. When the leader pays someone for a public job, that person must do their job fairly. If they don’t get paid, they only owe respect and thanks, not a full obligation. People aren’t forced by law to leave their private work to serve the public without pay, unless no one else can do the job. It is assumed the leader can use everyone’s abilities, and even a regular soldier can demand payment for fighting.
