People who have to work hard because they need to, or because they want to get more stuff, and those who are lazy or just want to enjoy life (these two groups make up most people), don’t spend much time thinking deeply about the truth. This is true not only about natural justice but also about all other important knowledge. They mostly learn what is right from religious leaders in church and sometimes from friends or neighbors who talk well and seem smarter about law and right and wrong.

The religious leaders and others who act like they know a lot learn their knowledge from universities, law schools, or books written by experts from those places. So, it’s clear that teaching people depends a lot on how well young people are taught in universities. But someone might ask, aren’t English universities already smart enough to do this? Or do you think you can teach the universities?

These are tough questions. But about the first one, I believe I can say this: until the end of King Henry the Eighth’s time, the universities mostly supported the Pope’s power over the country’s government. Many preachers and lawyers educated there spoke against the king’s power. This shows that the universities didn’t create those wrong ideas, but they didn’t know how to teach the right ones either. Because of all these mixed opinions, it’s clear they haven’t been taught well enough. It’s no surprise if they still hold on to old ideas that go against the government. As for the second question, I won’t say yes or no, but anyone who sees what I’m doing can guess what I think.

For the people’s safety, those in power must make sure justice is fair for everyone. This means that rich and powerful people should be treated the same as poor and unknown people when it comes to fixing wrongs done to them. The powerful should not expect to get away with hurting or dishonoring others any more than anyone else would. This is what fairness means, and since it is a rule of natural law, even rulers must follow it just like anyone else. Breaking the law is a crime against the whole country, but some crimes also hurt individual people.
