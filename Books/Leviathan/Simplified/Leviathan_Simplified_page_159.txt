The difference between giving advice and giving orders comes from what advice really is. Advice is about figuring out the good or bad results that might happen to the person getting the advice, based on what the person suggesting the action thinks will happen.

The difference between good and bad advisers comes from the same idea. Experience is just remembering what happened in the past, and advice is when someone shares that experience with another person. So, good or bad advice depends on how smart and clear the adviser is. For a country or group, advisers are like the memory and thinking part of a person’s mind. But there is one big difference between a country and a person: a person learns from the world around them without personal bias, but advisers to a country might have their own goals and feelings, which can make their advice untrustworthy.

So, the first rule for a good adviser is that their goals and interests should match the person they are advising.

Second, when an adviser talks about what might happen if someone does something, they need to explain it clearly so the person can understand the truth. They should use strong logic, clear and simple language, and keep it short if possible. They should avoid jumping to quick conclusions or using only examples or quotes that don’t prove what’s right or wrong. Also, they shouldn’t use confusing or emotional words because those can trick the person or push them toward something that isn’t really best for them.

Third, good advice comes from experience and careful thinking. No one can know everything about running a big country, so a person can only be a good adviser in areas they have studied deeply and know well.
