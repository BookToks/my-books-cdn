(I Kings, 22. 24) This can’t mean a ghost, because Micaiah told the kings of Israel and Judah what would happen in the battle as a vision, not because a spirit was speaking through him.

In the same way, in the books of the Prophets, even though they spoke by the Spirit of God, meaning a special gift to predict the future, their knowledge didn’t come from a ghost inside them. Instead, it came through a supernatural dream or vision.

It says, “God made man from the dust of the earth, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.” (Genesis, 2. 7) Here, the breath of life means God gave him life. And when it says, “as long as the spirit of God is in my nostrils” (Job, 27. 3) it just means “as long as I live.” In Ezekiel, 1. 20, “the spirit of life was in the wheels” means “the wheels were alive.” And when it says, “the spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet,” (Ezekiel, 2. 30) it means “I got my strength back,” not that a ghost or invisible thing came inside him.

In Numbers 11:17, God says, “I will take some of the spirit that is on you and put it on them,” meaning the seventy elders. Two of these elders started to prophesy in the camp. Some people complained, and Joshua wanted Moses to stop them, but Moses didn’t. This shows Joshua didn’t know they had the power to prophesy, and they spoke with a spirit or authority under Moses.

Similarly, it says “Joshua was full of the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him” (Deuteronomy, 34.9). This means Joshua was chosen by Moses to continue the work Moses started—leading God’s people into the promised land—but Moses died before he could finish.

In the same way, it says, “If anyone doesn’t have the Spirit of Christ, they don’t belong to him” (Romans, 8.9). This doesn’t mean the ghost of Christ, but that they follow his teachings. Also, “You will know the Spirit of God by this: every spirit that says Jesus Christ came in the flesh is from God” (1 John, 4.2). This means having true Christian faith and believing Jesus is the Christ, not a ghost.
