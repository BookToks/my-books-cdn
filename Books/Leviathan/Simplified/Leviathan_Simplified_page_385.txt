The flaming sword at the entrance of Paradise stops people from reaching the tree of life, but it doesn’t take away the immortality that God once gave humans before they sinned. It also doesn’t mean people need Christ’s sacrifice to get that immortality back. Because of this, not only good and faithful people but also bad and unbelievers will live forever, without dying again or facing a second, eternal death. To explain this, some say that the "second and everlasting death" actually means a second kind of life, but one full of suffering; this idea is only used here and nowhere else.

This idea comes from some unclear parts of the New Testament, but if you look at the whole Bible, these parts make more sense in a different way and aren’t necessary to believe in Christianity. If when a person dies, only their body is left, can’t God, who made lifeless dust come alive in the first place, just as easily bring a dead body back to life forever or decide to make them die again? In the Bible, the word "soul" always means life or a living creature, and body and soul together mean a living body.

On the fifth day of Creation, God said, “Let the waters produce living creatures,” which shows that living creatures have souls, or life. God also created whales and every living creature. When God made man from dust and breathed life into him, man became a living creature. After Noah left the ark, God promised not to destroy every living creature again. Also, the Bible says, “Don’t eat blood, because the blood is the life.” If "soul" meant some invisible substance separate from the body, this would apply to all living creatures, not just humans.

But I have already shown in chapter 38 that the souls of faithful people stay with their bodies forever after the resurrection because of God’s special grace. When the New Testament talks about people being thrown into hell "body and soul," it really means body and life—they will be thrown alive into the eternal fire of Gehenna.
