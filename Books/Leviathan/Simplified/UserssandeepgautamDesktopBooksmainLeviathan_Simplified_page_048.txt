Some people used to call these men crazy, while others called them possessed by spirits. In Italy today, they are called not only "pazzi," which means madmen, but also "spiritati," meaning men who are possessed.

Once, in a Greek city called Abdera, many people gathered to watch the play Andromeda on a very hot day. Because of the heat and the play, many of the audience got fevers and kept repeating lines from the play about Perseus and Andromeda. Their madness went away when winter came. People thought their madness came from the strong feelings caused by the play.

In another Greek city, a strange madness affected only young girls, causing many to hang themselves. Most people thought this was the work of the devil. But one person guessed that their sadness came from feelings inside their minds. He suggested the leaders make the girls hang without clothes, and this helped stop the madness.

The Greeks often believed madness was caused by spirits called the Furies or gods like Ceres and Phoebus. They thought spirits were real living things in the air. The Romans and Jews believed the same. Jews called madmen prophets or demon-possessed, depending on if the spirit was good or bad. Some even called the same person both. For non-Jews, it was normal to call sickness and health by the names of demons. So, "demon" could mean either a fever or a devil.

But it is strange that Jews believed this because Moses and Abraham said they got their messages from God directly, not from spirits. Nothing in Jewish law says people were possessed. When God took the spirit from Moses and gave it to seventy elders, it didn’t mean God was divided or shared. It was just a way to show God’s power.
