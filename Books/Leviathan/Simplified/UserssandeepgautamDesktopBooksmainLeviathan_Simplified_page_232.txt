This Scripture is where I will get the main ideas for my talk about the rights of the highest rulers on earth in Christian countries, and the duties of Christian people towards their rulers. In the next chapter, I will talk about the books, authors, purpose, and authority of the Bible.

The Books of Holy Scripture are those that should be the official guides, or rules, for Christian life. Since all life rules that people must follow are laws, the question about Scripture is really about what laws should be followed by all Christians, both natural and civil laws.

Even though the Bible doesn’t say exactly what laws every Christian king should make in his kingdom, it does say what laws he should not make. I have already shown that rulers are the only law-makers in their own lands. So, only the books that rulers officially accept are the true laws in each nation.

It is true that God is the highest ruler of all rulers. So when God speaks to any person, that person should obey God, no matter what any human ruler says. But the real question is not about obeying God, but about when and what God has said. People who do not have any special supernatural messages from God can only know this through natural reason, which helps them keep peace and fairness by obeying their lawful rulers.

Because of this, I only accept the Old Testament books as Holy Scripture if the Church of England says they are holy. We don’t need a list here because it is well known which books these are. They are the same ones accepted by St. Jerome, who considered other books like the Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Tobias, the first and second books of Maccabees, and the third and fourth of Esdras as Apocrypha (extra books).
