Thomas Hobbes says that when a ruler gives something to a person because they are scared that person might harm the country, it’s not really a reward. It’s not a salary either, because there isn’t a deal made—everyone is already supposed to not hurt the country. It’s not a kindness either, because it’s given out of fear, which shouldn’t be part of the ruler’s power. Instead, it’s more like a sacrifice the ruler makes to calm someone they think is stronger than them. This doesn’t make people obey more; it actually makes them want to ask for more.

Some salaries are fixed and come from the public money. Others depend on how well a person does their job. The second kind can sometimes hurt the country, like with judges. If judges get paid more when there are more cases, it can make people start more fights just to make money. Also, different courts might fight over which cases they get to handle. But for jobs where pay doesn’t depend on how much work they do, these problems don’t happen. So, punishment and reward are like the muscles and tendons that help a country work.

So far, I’ve talked about human nature, how pride and other feelings make people want to be controlled by a government, and how powerful the ruler is. I compared the ruler to Leviathan, a huge sea monster mentioned in the Bible’s Book of Job. Leviathan is called the king of the proud because nothing on earth is as strong or fearless as he is. But since Leviathan, like all living things, can die and decay, and because there is something in heaven he should respect and obey, I will next talk about his weaknesses and the natural laws he has to follow.
