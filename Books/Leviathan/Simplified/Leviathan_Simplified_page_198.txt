The barons got more power when William Rufus wanted their help to change who would be king, taking the throne from his older brother to himself. This power grew too much and caused problems, like when they rebelled against King John with help from the French.

This kind of problem doesn’t only happen in monarchies. In ancient Rome, the government was called “The Senate and People of Rome,” but neither the senate nor the people had all the power. This disagreement led to fights and wars between different groups, like during the times of Tiberius Gracchus, Marius, Sylla, Pompey, and Caesar. These fights eventually ended their democracy and started a monarchy.

In Athens, the people agreed on just one rule: no one could suggest starting the war over the island of Salamis, or they would be punished by death. But if Solon hadn’t pretended to be crazy and warned the people in a strange way, they might have ended up with a dangerous enemy right outside their city. This shows how even small limits on power can cause big problems in governments.

Next, I notice problems in governments caused by bad ideas. One bad idea is that every person can decide for themselves what is right or wrong. This might be true when there are no laws, but in a government, the law decides what is right and wrong. The lawmaker, who speaks for the whole country, is the judge. If people start deciding for themselves whether to follow the law, it causes fights and weakens the government.

Another bad idea is that anything a person does against their conscience is a sin. This means they think their own conscience is always right about what is good or bad. But a person’s conscience is really just their own opinion, and it can be wrong. If someone has no laws, then yes, doing something against their conscience is wrong because that’s their only guide. But in a government, the law is like a public conscience that everyone agrees to follow.
