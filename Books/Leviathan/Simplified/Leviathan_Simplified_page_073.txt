It’s true that God is the ruler of the whole world, but He can also be the special ruler of a chosen group of people. This is no different from a general who commands the whole army but also has a special group of soldiers under his direct control. God rules the whole earth by His power, but He rules His chosen people by a special promise. I will talk more about God’s kingdom, both by nature and by promise, in another place.

When we look at how religion spreads, it’s easy to understand why it goes back to its basic ideas. These ideas are just a belief in a god and invisible, supernatural powers. These beliefs can never completely disappear from human nature, so new religions can start again because people who believe in these ideas help make them grow.

All organized religions start because many people trust one person. They believe this person is not only smart and trying to help them, but also holy, someone who gets messages from God in a supernatural way. So, if the leaders of a religion are no longer seen as wise, honest, or loving, or if they can’t show any clear signs that they really have God’s messages, then the religion they support will be doubted and rejected—unless people are forced to follow it by law.

A religion’s leader loses respect when they ask people to believe things that contradict each other. Both sides of a contradiction can’t be true, so asking people to believe both shows ignorance. This makes people doubt everything else the leader says is from God. A person might understand things beyond normal reason, but never things that go against natural reason.

A leader also loses respect when they do or say things that show they don’t really believe what they ask others to believe. These actions or words cause problems because they make people lose faith in the religion. Examples are being unfair, cruel, greedy, or living a life of selfish pleasure. These behaviors are called scandalous because they cause people to stumble and stop believing.
