So, when we believe that the Bible is the word of God, but we don’t get a direct message from God Himself, our faith is actually in the Church. We trust what the Church says and accept it. 

Similarly, when people believe what a prophet tells them in God’s name, they trust the prophet and respect him, whether he is telling the truth or not. 

It’s the same with all history. For example, if I don’t believe everything a historian writes about Alexander the Great or Caesar, I don’t think Alexander or Caesar would be upset. Only the historian might be wrong. 

If a historian like Livy says that once a cow spoke because of the gods, and we don’t believe it, we aren’t doubting God, just Livy. 

So, it’s clear that if we believe something only because people say it or write it, whether they are sent by God or not, then we are really just putting faith in people.

Virtue means something that is valued because it is better or stands out compared to others. If everyone was the same, nothing would be special. 

Intellectual virtues are mental skills that people admire and want to have. They are often called "good wit," although the word "wit" can mean a specific ability too.

There are two types of these virtues: natural and learned. 

By natural, I don’t mean what a person is born with, because that’s just basic senses, which don’t differ much between people or animals. 

What I mean is the kind of wit you get from experience and practice without any formal teaching. 

This natural wit mainly includes two things: being quick to think of new ideas, and being able to focus steadily on a goal. 

On the other hand, if someone thinks slowly, that is seen as a flaw of the mind, often called dullness or stupidity, which means being slow to understand or react.
