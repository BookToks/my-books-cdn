In the Old Testament, the word "angel" appears many times, but it would take too long to list them all. So, to understand them better, I say that there is no part of the Old Testament accepted by the Church of England that proves angels or spirits are permanent, invisible beings without a body.

Instead, angels are often understood as messengers who can be in different places at once because they have parts or bodies. For example, John the Baptist is called an angel, and Christ is called the Angel of the Covenant. Also, things like the dove and fiery tongues, which showed God’s special presence, can be called angels too.

In the book of Daniel, two angels named Gabriel and Michael are mentioned. But the text shows that Michael actually means Christ, not just an angel, but a prince. Gabriel was more like a vision or dream that Daniel had, not a real being. God doesn’t need to give names to his heavenly helpers; names just help humans remember them.

In the New Testament, there is no proof that angels are permanent and invisible beings, except when the word "angel" means people God uses as messengers. We do learn from Jesus that the Devil and his angels will be punished forever in fire, which shows that evil angels are permanent. But this idea doesn’t fit if angels are just invisible spirits, because fire can’t hurt things without bodies.

So, angels are not proven to be invisible spirits. This agrees with what St. Paul says about judging the angels.
