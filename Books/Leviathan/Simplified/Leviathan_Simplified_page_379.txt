The darkest part of Satan’s kingdom is where the Church of God isn’t present—that is, among people who don’t believe in Jesus Christ. But that doesn’t mean the Church itself has all the light or understanding needed to do what God asks of us.

Why is it that, since the time of the Apostles, Christians have been fighting each other in foreign and civil wars? Why do they get upset over small problems in their own lives or the success of others? Why do they have so many different ways of trying to be happy? If it’s not completely dark among us, it’s at least very cloudy. So, we are still in the dark.

The enemy took advantage of our natural ignorance and planted spiritual mistakes. First, by misusing and hiding the true meaning of the Scriptures—we make mistakes because we don’t understand the Bible. 

Second, by adding the stories of demons from old pagan poets—these are just made-up ideas, like ghosts and fairies, not real spiritual beings. Third, by mixing Greek ideas, especially those of Aristotle, with the Bible. Fourth, by combining these with false or uncertain traditions and made-up histories. Because of this, we are tricked by false spirits and lies told by people who pretend to be honest but aren’t, and who ignore what they really know is true (as mentioned in I Timothy 4:1-2). In this chapter, I will talk a little about the first problem—people being tricked by wrong uses of the Bible.

The biggest and main misuse of the Bible is twisting it to say that the “kingdom of God,” often mentioned in Scripture, means the current Church or all Christians living now, or those who will rise again one day. But actually, the kingdom of God started with Moses, and it was only for the Jews, who were called God’s special people. This kingdom ended when they chose Saul as king because they didn’t want to be ruled directly by God anymore. God agreed to this, as I explained earlier in Chapter 35.
