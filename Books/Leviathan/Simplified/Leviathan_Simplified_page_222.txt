Some signs of honor come naturally, like being good, fair, and generous, or actions like praying, giving thanks, and obeying. Other signs of honor come from rules or customs made by people. These can be seen as honorable in some places or times, dishonorable in others, or just neutral. For example, how people greet, pray, or give thanks can change depending on where or when you are. The first kind is natural, the second is made up by people.

There are two types of made-up worship: sometimes it is required, and sometimes it is done freely. Required worship is when the person being honored asks for it. Free worship is when the person honoring decides how to do it. When worship is required, what matters is obeying, not the exact words or actions. When it is free, what counts is what others think. If the words or actions seem silly or disrespectful to others, then that is not really worship, because signs of honor only mean something to the people who see them.

Worship can also be public or private. Public worship is done by a whole community acting like one person. Private worship is what one person does alone. Public worship is free when looking at the whole group but not when looking at individual people. Private worship is free when done in secret, but when done in front of others, it is always limited by laws or what people think, which is not true freedom.

The main reason people worship others is power. When someone sees another person being worshipped, they think that person is powerful and are more likely to obey them, which makes that person even more powerful. But God doesn’t want anything from us. The worship we give God is because we should, and we do it in the best way we can, following rules about honoring those who are stronger, hoping for good things, fearing harm, or being thankful for what we already received.

To understand how we should worship God naturally, we start with His qualities. First, it is clear we should believe He exists, because no one wants to honor something they think isn’t real.

Second, philosophers who said the world or its soul is God didn’t speak well of Him and actually denied His real existence. God is the cause of the world. Saying the world is God means saying the world has no cause, which means no God.
