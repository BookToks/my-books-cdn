If an unwritten rule is followed everywhere in a country and no one uses it in a bad way, then that rule must be a natural law that everyone has to follow.

All laws, whether written down or not, get their power from the will of the government. This means the person or group in charge, like a king in a monarchy or a group of leaders in other countries. It’s strange that some lawyers say the power to make laws depends on private people or lower judges.

For example, some say only Parliament can control common law, which is true only if Parliament has full power and can't be called or stopped by anyone else. If someone else can stop Parliament, they can also control it. If no one else can, then the real power is the king with Parliament. Even if many smart people meet in Parliament, it doesn’t mean they get the power to make laws by themselves. Also, some say a country has two parts: force (power) in the king and justice in Parliament. But a country can’t work if the power is with someone who justice doesn’t control.

Law can never go against reason, all lawyers agree on that. But the question is, whose reason? It’s not just anyone’s private opinion because then laws would be all mixed up. It’s also not just the smart ideas of some expert lawyers because even they can be wrong. People who study a lot can still make mistakes, and different experts can have different opinions. So, law comes from the reason of the whole country, which is represented by its leaders as one person. That way, laws don’t easily conflict, and if they do, the same reason can fix the problem by changing or explaining the law.
