In all arguments or disputes, the people involved (including the lords in civil cases) had judges from the area where the problem happened. If someone didn’t agree with a judge, they could object until they picked twelve judges everyone agreed on. Then, those twelve judges made the final decision. Since these judges were from their own area, no one could argue that the decision wasn’t final.

These public officials, who have power from the ruler, are like the voice organs in a human body. They either teach or judge the people.

Public ministers also include those who have the ruler’s power to make sure decisions are carried out, share the ruler’s orders, stop riots, catch and lock up criminals, and do other things to keep peace. Every action they take with this power is like the work of hands in a human body.

Public ministers working in other countries represent their ruler to foreign governments. These include ambassadors, messengers, agents, and heralds, who are sent officially and for public business.

But if someone is sent by a private group from a troubled state, even if they are accepted, they are not official public or private ministers of the whole country because their actions don’t represent the country. Also, if a prince sends an ambassador to say congratulations or attend a ceremony, even though the authority is official, the task is private since it’s about the prince as a person, so the ambassador is a private person. If someone is sent secretly to spy on another country, even if the mission and authority are public, the person acts only for themselves and is a private minister. Still, they serve the country and can be compared to an eye in a body. Those who receive people's complaints or information act like the public ear and represent the ruler in that role.

A counselor or council of state, if they only give advice to the ruler and don’t have power to judge or command, are not public officials. Advice is given only to the ruler, who can’t be represented by someone else when he is present. But councils usually have some other power. In a monarchy, they speak for the king when giving orders to public ministers. In a democracy, the council or senate shares their decisions with the people as advisors. When they pick judges, hear cases, or meet ambassadors, they act as officials for the people. In an aristocracy, the council of state is the main ruling group and only advises themselves.
