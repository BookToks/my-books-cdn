The Third Part Of a Christian Commonwealth XXXII: Of the Principles of Christian Politics

So far, I have talked about the rights of rulers and the duties of people based only on what we know from nature and experience. This means I used what we see in people and what we agree on when we use certain words, which helps us understand politics everywhere.

But now, I want to talk about a Christian government, which depends a lot on what God has revealed to us in a supernatural way. So, I will use not only the natural word of God but also the messages from the prophets.

Still, we should not ignore our senses, experience, or what we can understand from God’s natural word and reason. These are gifts God gave us to use until Jesus comes back. We should not just blindly believe everything without thinking, but instead use our minds to work for justice, peace, and true religion.

Even though some things in God’s word are beyond what we can understand by reason—that means we can’t prove or disprove them—nothing in it goes against reason. If it seems like it does, it’s because we are not understanding it right or are thinking about it in the wrong way.

So, when something written in the Bible is too hard to understand, we are told to accept it and not try to figure out a deep philosophical truth using logic for mysteries that are too complex for science or reason.

Our religion’s mysteries are like medicine for sick people. Swallowed as they are, they heal us, but if we try to chew and analyze them too much, they often lose their power and don’t work.
