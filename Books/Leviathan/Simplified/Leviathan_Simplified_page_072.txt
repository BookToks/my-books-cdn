Second, they made people believe that the gods were upset by the same things that the laws said were wrong. Third, they set up ceremonies, prayers, sacrifices, and festivals to make people think they could calm the gods’ anger. They believed bad things like losing wars, sickness, earthquakes, and personal problems happened because the gods were angry. This anger came from people forgetting or messing up the required worship. 

Even though ancient Romans were allowed to doubt what poets said about pain and pleasure after death, many still believed in those ideas more than not.

Because of these rules and ideas, the leaders kept peace in the country. When people had problems, they blamed themselves for not following the ceremonies or laws properly instead of blaming the rulers. The festivals and games in honor of the gods kept people happy, so they didn’t complain or rebel. 

The Romans, who had conquered most of the known world, didn’t mind any religion as long as it didn’t go against their government. The only religion they didn’t accept was that of the Jews, who believed they shouldn’t obey any human king or government. So, you can see how the Romans used religion as part of their political strategy.

But where God himself gave religion through special revelation, He also created a special kingdom and laws, not just about how to worship Him but also how people should treat each other. In God’s kingdom, the government and religion are connected, so there is no clear separation between spiritual and political power.
