When people read books about the ancient Greeks and Romans, it often makes them want to rebel against kings. Young people, especially, who don’t have strong reasons to think carefully, get excited by the stories of great battles and heroes. They start to believe that the success of those old societies came from their type of government, not from the efforts of individuals. They don’t realize that those governments often had lots of fights and civil wars because their systems weren’t perfect.

Because of these books, some people have even tried to kill their kings. The writers say it’s okay to kill a tyrant, not just any king. So if someone calls their king a tyrant, they think it’s right to get rid of him. These books also make people living under a king believe that they have no freedom, while people in a popular government are free. But those living under a popular government don’t always feel that way.

I think letting people read these books without explaining the truth is very dangerous for a monarchy. The bad ideas in these books are like the bite of a mad dog, which causes a disease called hydrophobia, or fear of water. Just like a person bitten by a mad dog is thirsty but afraid to drink water, people affected by these writings want freedom but are scared of strong kings.

Some doctors say there are three souls in one person. Similarly, some people believe there can be more than one ruler in a country. They create conflicts between different powers, like church rules against civil laws, mixing confusing words that mean nothing but make people think there is another hidden kingdom controlling things secretly, like invisible fairies in the dark.
