Everyone can see that some laws apply to everyone; some only to certain places; some to certain jobs; and some to specific people. So, laws only apply to those they are meant for, and no one else. Also, laws are rules about what is right and wrong, and nothing is called wrong unless it goes against a law.  

Only the Commonwealth (the group or state that rules us) can make laws because we all follow it. Commands must be clearly shown because people need to understand how to obey them. So, anything that logically follows from this should be accepted as true. Now, I will explain what follows from this.

1. The person or group who makes laws in any Commonwealth is the sovereign. This could be one king or queen in a monarchy, or a group of people in a democracy or aristocracy. The sovereign makes the laws, and the Commonwealth only tells people to follow those laws. But the Commonwealth itself isn’t a person and can only act through the sovereign. So, the sovereign alone is the lawmaker. Also, no one can cancel a law except the sovereign, because a law can only be canceled by another law that stops it.

2. The sovereign, whether one person or a group, does not have to follow the civil laws. Since the sovereign can make or cancel laws whenever they want, they can free themselves from any law that bothers them by changing it. This means they were always free. A person who can free themselves whenever they want is truly free. It’s impossible to be bound by yourself because if you can make rules, you can also break them. So, if you are only bound by yourself, you are actually not bound at all.

3. When a law has been followed for a long time, it doesn’t get its power just from time passing. Instead, the sovereign’s silence about it is like agreeing to it. The law only stays a law as long as the sovereign doesn’t speak against it. If there is a legal question based on old laws, the time passed doesn’t affect the rights involved. The question should be decided by fairness. Many unfair actions and decisions have gone on for longer than anyone can remember. Our lawyers say that only fair customs count as law, and bad customs should be removed. But deciding what is fair and what should be removed belongs to the sovereign, whether it is a single ruler or a group.
