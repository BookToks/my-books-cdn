When something happens in one situation, we start to think it will happen the same way everywhere and every time. This helps us stop worrying about when and where things happen, and saves us from using too much brainpower after the first time. It makes what’s true here and now true everywhere.

Using words to keep track of our thoughts is especially clear when it comes to numbers. Someone who can’t remember the order of number words like one, two, and three might hear a clock ticking and say “one, one, one,” but won’t know what time it is. There was a time when people didn’t have number words and had to use their fingers to count things. That’s why most languages only have words for numbers up to ten or five before starting over again. If you say the numbers out of order, you get confused and don’t know when you’re finished. Without words, you can’t really count or do math, or measure things like speed or strength, which are important for people.

When we put two names together like “A man is a living creature” or “If he’s a man, he’s a living creature,” the statement is true if the second name means everything the first one means. If not, it’s false. Truth and falsehood are about what we say, not about the things themselves. Without speech, there’s no truth or falsehood.

People can make mistakes by expecting things that won’t happen or thinking things happened when they didn’t, but that’s not lying.

Since truth comes from using words correctly in what we say, anyone who wants to be exact needs to remember what each word means and use them right. Otherwise, they’ll get stuck in confusing words, like a bird caught in sticky twigs—the more they struggle, the worse it gets. That’s why in geometry (the only science God has given us so far), people start by clearly explaining what their words mean. These explanations are called definitions and come at the beginning.

So, anyone who wants real knowledge should look at the definitions other people have made before and fix them if they’re wrong or make new ones themselves.
