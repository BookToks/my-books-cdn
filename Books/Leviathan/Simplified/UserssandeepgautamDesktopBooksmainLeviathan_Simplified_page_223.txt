Thirdly, saying the world was not created but has always existed, because something eternal has no cause, is like saying there is no God.

Fourthly, when people think God is easygoing and doesn’t care much, they take away His care for humans and His honor. This makes people stop loving and respecting Him, which is the main way to honor God.

Fifthly, saying God is limited or has an end is not honoring Him. It’s not respectful to think less of God than we can imagine. Being limited means you can always add more, so God can’t be limited.

So, saying God has a shape is not honoring Him because all shapes are limited. Saying we can picture God in our mind is wrong because everything we imagine is limited. Saying God has parts, or is in a certain place, is also wrong because that means He is limited. Saying God moves or rests is wrong because those things need a place, and God isn’t limited by place. Saying there is more than one God is wrong because only one can be infinite. Also, saying God feels emotions like sadness, anger, or desire is wrong because those feelings show limits.

When we say God has a will, it’s not like a human will. It means the power God uses to make everything happen.

Also, when we say God sees or knows things, it’s not like human senses or thoughts, which come from our bodies. God doesn’t need those because He is not like us and doesn’t depend on natural causes.

If you want to describe God only using reason, you should use words that say what He is not, like infinite or eternal. Or use words that show how great He is, like most high or most great. Or use general words like good, just, holy, creator. These words don’t try to explain exactly what God is because that would limit Him. Instead, they show how much we admire and respect Him. There is only one name that shows who He is: I Am. And one name that shows how He relates to us: God, which means father, king, and lord.
