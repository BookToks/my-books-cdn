The third argument comes from parts of the Bible that say faith needed for salvation is easy. If you had to fully agree with all the Christian teachings, many of which are debated, then being a Christian would be the hardest thing ever.

The thief on the cross, even though he was sorry for what he did, wouldn’t have been saved if he had to believe in every teaching. He only said, “Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom,” which shows he just believed Jesus was a king. Also, Jesus said in Matthew 11:30 that “His yoke is easy, and His burden is light.” He also said little kids believe in Him, in Matthew 18:6. St. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 1:21 that God saves those who believe, even if the preaching seems foolish. St. Paul himself probably never thought about complicated ideas like transubstantiation or purgatory, but he was still saved and became a great teacher.

The fourth argument comes from Bible verses that are very clear and not debated. For example, in John 5:39, Jesus says to look at the Scriptures because they show about Him. At that time, the Old Testament was all they had, and it only gave clues about Jesus, like where He would be born and that He would do miracles. So, just believing that Jesus is the one described there is enough for eternal life; you don’t need to believe anything more.

Also, in John 11:26, Jesus says, “Whoever lives and believes in me will never die.” So, just believing in Christ is enough faith for eternal life; no extra beliefs are needed.

Believing in Jesus and believing He is the Christ (the promised Savior) are the same. Right after Jesus asks Martha if she believes, she says, “Yes, Lord, I believe you are the Christ, the Son of God.” So, believing this one thing is enough for eternal life; you don’t need to believe more. Also, in John 20:31, it says these things are written so you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and by believing, you can have life through His name.
