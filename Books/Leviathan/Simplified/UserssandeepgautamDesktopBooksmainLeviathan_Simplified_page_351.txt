Leviathan/351 The third part is from John 21:16, where it says, “Feed my sheep.” This isn’t about making laws, but about teaching. Making laws is the job of the head of the family, who chooses his own chaplain and a schoolmaster to teach his kids.

The fourth part, John 20:21, says something different. It goes, “As my Father sent me, so send I you.” But Jesus was sent to save people through his death if they believed, and through his and his Apostles’ preaching to get people ready for his kingdom. Jesus said his kingdom is not of this world, and he taught us to pray for it to come later. He didn’t tell his Apostles when it would come (Acts 1:6-7). When it does come, the twelve Apostles will sit on twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. 

Since God the Father didn’t send Jesus to make laws in this world, we can guess that Jesus didn’t send St. Peter to make laws here either. Instead, he sent him to help people keep strong faith that Jesus will come again. Meanwhile, if people are subjects, they should obey their rulers, and if rulers, they should believe this too and help their people believe it. This is what a bishop’s job is. So, this part actually supports combining church power with civil power, which goes against what Cardinal Bellarmine said.

The fifth part is from Acts 15:28: “It hath seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things, that ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.” Here, they talk about “laying burdens” as a kind of law-making. But anyone reading this can see that the Apostles might just be giving advice, not making strict laws. Laws usually say, “we command,” but advice says, “we think good.” Advice can feel like a burden, but it’s often conditional—only if people want to reach their goals. Like avoiding strangled meat and blood isn’t an absolute rule, but a suggestion to help people avoid mistakes.

I explained before (in Chapter 25) that laws are made for the benefit of the person giving the law, but advice is for the benefit of the person receiving it. Here, the Apostles want what’s best for the new Gentile believers—their salvation—not their own benefit. They’ve done their part, and whether people obey or not, they will be rewarded.
