A douleía means being a slave to God; latreía means serving Him. All kinds of service include not only obeying but also worshipping, which means doing actions, making gestures, and saying words that show respect.

An image, in the strictest sense, is a copy of something you can see. For example, reflections or illusions you see in water or the sky are only images. These aren’t real things, and they don’t look exactly like the real thing because they change depending on how your eyes work or if you use glasses. Sometimes, these images appear in your imagination or dreams when the real thing isn’t there. They can even change colors and shapes because they come from your imagination. These kinds of images are originally called ideas or idols, from the Greek word that means "to see." They’re also called phantasms, which means appearances. Our ability to imagine comes from these images. So, it’s clear that you can’t make an image of something invisible.

It’s also clear that you can’t make an image of something infinite. All images and phantasms come from things we can see and have shapes. Shapes have sizes that can be measured, so you can’t have an image of God, the human soul, or spirits. You can only make images of visible bodies—things that have light or are lit up.

People can imagine shapes they’ve never seen by mixing parts of different animals, like poets do with creatures such as centaurs or chimeras. They can also create these shapes using wood, clay, or metal. These are also called images, not because they look like any real body, but because they look like the imaginary creatures in the person’s mind. The objects made by artists look like the ideas in the creator’s brain, so the physical statue or carving is called the image of the imaginary idea.

In a broader sense, the word image can also mean any way one thing shows or represents another.
