When the spirit came upon them, they started to prophesy and didn’t stop. This shows first that their prophesying was under Moses’ control because God took some of Moses’ spirit and put it on them. So, they prophesied the way Moses wanted. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been allowed to prophesy at all. Some people complained to Moses about this (Numbers 11:27), and Joshua wanted Moses to stop them, but Moses said to Joshua, “Don’t be jealous because of me.”

Second, the Spirit of God here means their willingness and attitude to obey and help Moses run the government. If it meant they had God’s true divine spirit like Christ did, then they would have had it just as fully as Christ, but they didn’t. It actually means God’s gift and grace helped them work with Moses, since their spirit came from him.

It also shows that these people were chosen by Moses to be elders and leaders of the people (Numbers 11:16). Moses had picked judges and officers who feared God, following advice from his father-in-law Jethro (Exodus 18). These 70 men were from that group, and God put Moses’ spirit on them to help Moses lead the people. This is like when God’s spirit came on David and left Saul when David was chosen to lead (1 Samuel 16:13-14). So, “the spirit” means a desire to serve God, not some magical power or special visions.

God also spoke through the casting of lots, which were done by people He put in charge. For example, Saul used lots to find out that Jonathan broke a rule by eating honey (1 Samuel 14:43). God also divided the land of Canaan among the Israelites by lots that Joshua cast in front of the Lord at Shiloh (Joshua 18:10). It seems that God also revealed Achan’s crime in a similar way.
