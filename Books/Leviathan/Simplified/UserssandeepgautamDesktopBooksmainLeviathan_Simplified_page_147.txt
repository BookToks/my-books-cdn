The situation here, according to the laws of those people, was fair; but their meeting was called illegal. The leader scolded them by saying, “If Demetrius and the other workers want to accuse someone, they can do that properly through the right channels. Let them argue with each other. And if you have something else to ask for, your case can be handled in a meeting that is called the right way. We might get blamed for causing trouble today, because no one can explain why so many people gathered.”

He called a meeting where people can’t explain why they’re there a rebellion, and something they can’t take responsibility for. That’s all I will say about groups and meetings of people, which I compared earlier to parts of the human body: legal ones are like muscles; illegal ones are like painful lumps or infections caused by bad things coming together.

XXIII: About the Public Officials of Ruling Power

In the last chapter, I talked about parts of a country; now I will talk about the official people who work for it.

A public official is someone chosen by the ruler, whether a king or a group, to handle important matters and act for the whole country. Since every ruler or group has two sides—you can think of it as two roles, one as a person and one as the leader—public officials only serve in the role of handling public business. So, people who just serve the ruler as a person, like ushers or servants who help the people in a meeting just for their convenience, are not public officials. Also, workers who take care of a king’s household, like stewards or chamberlains, are not public officials in a monarchy.

Some public officials are given the job of managing the whole country or parts of it.
