If someone breaks the law, and they are supposed to follow it, then what they did is a crime.

If a person can’t know the law because they have no way to find out about it, they aren’t blamed. But if they just don’t try to learn the law, that’s not an excuse. Anyone who can think for themselves should know the basic rules of nature, except for kids and people who aren’t mentally well.

If someone is a prisoner or controlled by an enemy, and it’s not their fault, then they don’t have to follow the law. They have to obey the enemy to stay alive, and obeying isn’t a crime. No one has to risk their life if the law can’t protect them.

If a person is forced to do something illegal because they are scared of dying right away, they are not blamed. No law can make someone give up their own life. Even if such a law existed, the person would think, “If I don’t do it, I die now. If I do it, I might live longer.” So, nature forces them to act that way.

If someone has no food or other things they need to live, and the only way to survive is by breaking the law—like stealing food during a famine or taking a weapon to defend themselves—they are excused for doing it, for the same reason as before.

Also, if someone breaks the law because another person in power tells them to, they are excused from blame by the one who gave the order, because that person is responsible. But the person hurt by this is still right to say both are wrong. When a leader or government tells someone to do something against an old law, the person following the order is not blamed. The leader can’t punish them for obeying their command. In fact, when the leader orders something against a previous law, that order replaces the old law for that action.
