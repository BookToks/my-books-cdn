All other times are peaceful.

So, when there is war, and everyone is against everyone else, it’s the same as when people have no safety except their own strength and cleverness. In that situation, no one works hard because there’s no guarantee they will get anything from it. Because of this, there is no farming, no sailing for trade, no nice buildings, no tools to move heavy things, no knowledge about the world, no way to keep track of time, no arts, no writing, no community, and worst of all, constant fear and danger. Life in this kind of world is lonely, poor, ugly, brutal, and short.

Some people might think it’s weird that nature makes people ready to fight and destroy each other. They might want proof from real life instead of just reasoning. So, they should think about themselves: when going on a trip, they take weapons and friends; when sleeping, they lock their doors; even inside the house, they lock their chests. And this happens even when there are laws and police to protect them. What does this say about how they trust other people? Does locking doors and carrying weapons show they don’t really trust others? Both their actions and my words show this, but it doesn’t mean people are naturally bad. Human desires and feelings aren’t wrong by themselves. Actions only become wrong when laws say so. But laws can’t exist until people agree on who will make them.

Some might think there never was or could be a time like this war-like state everywhere. Maybe that’s true for the whole world, but many places still live like this now. For example, some native groups in America, except small family groups, have no government and live in this rough way. Also, when people who have had peace before start to fight each other again, it shows what life would be like without a common power to keep peace.
