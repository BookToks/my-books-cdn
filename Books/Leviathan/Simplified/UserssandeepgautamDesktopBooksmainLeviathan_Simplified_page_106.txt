This is more than just agreeing or getting along; it’s a true unity where everyone comes together as one person. It happens when every person agrees with every other person, like saying: I give up my right to control myself to this one person or group, but only if you do the same and accept their decisions too. When this happens, the whole group joined as one is called a Commonwealth, or in Latin, Civitas. This is how the big Leviathan is created, or to say it respectfully, the mortal god who, under the immortal God, keeps us safe and peaceful.

Because everyone in the Commonwealth gives power to this leader, he has enough strength to make people follow the rules out of fear. This helps keep peace inside the group and helps everyone work together against enemies outside.

The Commonwealth is basically one person whose actions are agreed upon by many people, who all made promises to each other. This person uses the power of the whole group to keep peace and protect everyone.

The person in charge is called the sovereign and has all the power, while everyone else is their subject.

There are two ways to become this powerful leader. One way is by force—like when a parent controls their kids or a ruler wins a war and forces others to obey to stay alive. The other way is when people agree voluntarily to follow a leader or group because they trust them to protect them. The second way is called a political Commonwealth or Commonwealth by Institution, and the first is called a Commonwealth by acquisition. Now, I will explain the Commonwealth by institution.
