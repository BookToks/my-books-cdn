No one has the freedom to fight against the government’s power to protect someone else, whether that person is guilty or innocent. This is because such freedom would stop the government from keeping us safe, which would ruin how government works. But if a lot of people together have already fought against the government unfairly, or done something really serious that could get them all killed, don’t they have the right to stick together and help each other? Of course they do. They are just trying to protect their own lives, and both guilty and innocent people have the right to do that. The first time they went against their duty was unfair, but after that, fighting to keep what they have done is not unfair anymore. And if they are only trying to protect themselves, then it’s not unfair at all.

But if they are offered a pardon, they lose the right to say they are defending themselves, and continuing to help others after that becomes illegal.

Other freedoms depend on the law not saying anything about them. If the government hasn’t made a rule about something, then a person can choose to do it or not do it as they want. So, the amount of freedom someone has can be different in different places and at different times, depending on what the government thinks is best. For example, there was a time in England when a man could enter his own land and forcefully remove people who were there without permission. But later, the government made a law that took away that right.

In some parts of the world, men are allowed to have many wives; in other places, this is not allowed.

If a person has a problem with the government about money owed, land, goods, services, or punishments based on an old law, they have the same right to ask for justice as if the problem was with another person. Because the government is asking based on an old law, not just its own power, it shows that it only wants what the law says is fair. So, the person has the right to have their case heard and decided based on that law.
