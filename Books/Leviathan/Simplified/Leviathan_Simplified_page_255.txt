In short, the kingdom of God is like a government. At first, it was the people of Israel who had to follow the laws that Moses gave them on Mount Sinai. Later, the high priest would remind them of these laws from the special place in the temple. When Saul became king, this kingdom was rejected, but the prophets said that Christ would bring it back.

We pray for this kingdom every day when we say, “Thy kingdom come” in the Lord’s Prayer. We also say, “For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever, Amen” to show we believe it belongs to God. The Apostles told people about this kingdom, and teachers of the Gospel help prepare people to accept it. When someone accepts the Gospel and promises to obey God’s rules, they enter the kingdom of grace. God freely gives these people the chance to be His children when Christ returns to judge the world and rule His people, which is called the kingdom of glory.

If God’s kingdom wasn’t a real kingdom that God’s representatives rule on Earth, there wouldn’t be so many fights about who really speaks for God. Priests wouldn’t care about having spiritual authority, and kings wouldn’t try to stop them.

From this idea about God’s kingdom, we also understand the word holy. In God’s kingdom, holy means the same as public or belonging to the king in our earthly kingdoms.

The king of any country represents all the people in that country. God, as king of Israel, was called the Holy One of Israel.

A nation under one king belongs to that king, meaning the public person. So, the Jews, God’s people, were called a holy nation (Exodus 19:6). The word holy always means either God Himself or something that belongs to God. Just like public means something that belongs to the whole community, not to one person.

That’s why the Sabbath (God’s day) is holy; the Temple (God’s house) is holy; sacrifices, tithes, and offerings (God’s gifts) are holy; priests, prophets, and anointed kings working under Christ (God’s helpers) are holy; and angels (God’s messengers) are holy too. Whenever we say something is holy, it means it belongs to God by agreement.
