People don’t get the power to forgive or keep sins just by words alone, like God does. God knows what’s really in a person’s heart and whether they’re truly sorry and changing. Forgiveness is only given if someone is truly sorry. If a person only pretends to be sorry, then saying they’re forgiven doesn’t really count and won’t help them. In fact, it makes their sin worse.

So, the Apostles and the leaders after them only look for signs that someone is really sorry. If those signs are there, they can’t refuse to forgive. But if the signs aren’t there, they can’t forgive either. The same goes for baptism: the Apostles couldn’t refuse baptism to someone who had changed their heart, nor could they give it to someone who wasn’t sorry.

Since no one can truly know if someone else is really sorry, they have to judge by what they see and hear, like words and actions. But these can be faked. So, the question is: who decides if someone is truly sorry? Jesus answers this in the Bible. He says if a friend wrongs you, first talk to them alone. If they don’t listen, bring one or two others. If they still don’t listen, tell the Church. If they still refuse to listen, treat them like an outsider.

This shows that deciding if someone is truly sorry isn’t up to one person, but to the Church, which means the group of believers or their leaders. Besides judging, someone has to officially say the decision. This job belongs to the Apostle or a Church leader. Jesus said, “Whatever you forbid on earth will be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you allow on earth will be allowed in heaven.”

This matches what St. Paul did. He said that even though he wasn’t there, he had made a decision about someone who sinned and told the Church to remove that person, meaning they were not forgiven. Paul gave the decision, but the Church had to hear the case and agree first.
