This is more than just agreeing or getting along; itâ€™s a true unity of everyone into one person. This happens when every person agrees with every other person like this: I give up my right to control myself and give it to this one person or group, as long as you do the same and accept their decisions too. 

When this happens, the group of people acting as one person is called a Commonwealth, or in Latin, Civitas. This is how the big Leviathan is created, or to say it more respectfully, the mortal god we owe our peace and protection to, under the immortal God. Because each person in the Commonwealth gives the leader power, the leader has enough strength to make everyone follow the rules, keeping peace inside and helping each other against enemies outside.

The Commonwealth is made up of this one person whose actions are agreed on by a large group who all made promises to each other. This way, the leader can use the strength and resources of everyone to keep peace and protect them all.

The person who leads is called the sovereign and is said to have sovereign power. Everyone else is their subject.

There are two ways to get this power. One is by force, like when a father makes his children follow him because he could punish them, or when someone wins a war and forces enemies to obey him to keep their lives. The other way is when people agree to follow a person or group voluntarily, trusting them to protect them from others. This second way is called a political Commonwealth or Commonwealth by Institution. The first way is called a Commonwealth by acquisition. First, I will talk about the Commonwealth by institution.
