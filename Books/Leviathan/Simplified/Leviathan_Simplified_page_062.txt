When someone we see as our equal gives us more help than we can ever repay, it can make us act like we care when really we secretly dislike them. It’s like being a desperate debtor who wants to avoid the person they owe money to and hopes to never see them again. Because when someone helps us, we feel like we owe them. Owing someone is like being trapped, and owing them forever is even worse—especially if they’re our equal, which makes it really annoying. But if the person who helps us is better or above us, we tend to like them more because owing them doesn’t feel like a new problem. Saying thanks happily (which people call gratitude) shows respect to the person who helped us and is seen as a fair way to pay them back.

Also, when we get help from someone equal or lower than us, as long as we think we can return the favor, it makes us like them. That’s because we believe help should go both ways. This leads to a friendly competition about who can do more good for the other, which is a positive and helpful battle where the winner feels proud, and the other feels better by admitting it.

If someone does more harm to another than they can fix or want to fix, the person who caused the harm will start to hate the one they hurt. That’s because they expect either revenge or forgiveness, and both are things they don’t like.

Being afraid of getting treated badly makes people want to find friends or join groups, because that’s the only way to protect their life and freedom.

People who don’t trust their own cleverness are more likely to win in chaos or rebellion than those who think they’re smart or tricky.

The smart people like to plan together, but the others, scared of being tricked, want to attack first. And in a fight or rebellion, since people are always close to battle, sticking together and using all their power is a better plan than trying to be too clever.

People who think they’re cool and brave, even if they don’t really know it, just like showing off but don’t want to take risks. Because when danger or problems come up, they just want to hide their weaknesses.
