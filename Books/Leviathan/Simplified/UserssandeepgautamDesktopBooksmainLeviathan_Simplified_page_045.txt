People aren’t really that different from each other; it’s more about what they like and how they think. When people are the same age, their experiences aren’t that different in number, but they happen in different ways because everyone has their own goals.

Running a family well and running a country well aren’t about being more or less smart, but about handling different kinds of jobs. It’s like drawing a small picture or a big one—they’re both art, just different types. A simple farmer usually knows how to manage his own home better than a high-ranking advisor knows how to manage someone else’s.

If you add dishonest or unfair ways to being careful—like doing bad things because you’re scared or need something—that’s called craftiness, which shows someone is weak inside. Being really great means not needing to cheat or lie to get by. There’s also something called “shifting,” which means avoiding a small problem by causing a bigger one, like stealing from one person to pay another. This is just a less smart kind of craftiness.

When it comes to learned intelligence—that’s the kind you get by studying and practicing—it’s all about reason. Reason is based on using language correctly and leads to knowledge and science. I’ve already talked about reason and science before.

The reason people think differently mostly comes from their feelings or passions. These feelings come partly from their body’s makeup and partly from how they were raised. If it was just about how their brain or senses worked, people would be very different in how they see or hear things, but they’re not. So, it’s really about feelings, which change because of people’s bodies and how they grow up.

The biggest feelings that change how smart people are include how much they want power, money, knowledge, and respect. All of these really come down to wanting power.

Money, knowledge, and respect are just different kinds of power.

So, if someone doesn’t really care much about any of these things and is what people call “indifferent,” they might be a good person who doesn’t hurt others, but they probably don’t have big dreams or strong judgment either.
