In short, the stories and prophecies in the Old Testament, and the gospels and letters in the New Testament, all have the same goal: to get people to obey God. This happened in three main ways: first through Moses and the priests; second through Jesus Christ; and third through the Apostles and those who took over their role.

These three groups showed God’s presence at different times. Moses, the high priests, and kings of Judah did this in the Old Testament. Jesus did it when He lived on earth. The Apostles and their followers have done it since the day the Holy Spirit came to them at Pentecost, and they still do today.

People often argue about where the Bible gets its authority. They also ask how we know it is really God’s word or why we believe it. The problem is that the question is not always asked the right way. Everyone agrees that God is the original author of the Bible. So, the real question is not about who wrote it.

Also, only people who have had a special, supernatural experience from God can truly know the Bible is His word. So, asking how we know this is not the right question either. Finally, when we ask why people believe the Bible, there are many different reasons, so there isn’t one simple answer for everyone. The real question should be: by what authority is the Bible made into law?

If the Bible agrees with the laws of nature, then it’s clear that it is God’s law. This kind of law is obvious to anyone who uses reason and makes sense like other moral rules that are always true.

But if the Bible is made into law directly by God, then it is like a written law. This kind of law only applies to people who have been clearly told by God through the Bible, so no one can say they didn’t know it was from God.
