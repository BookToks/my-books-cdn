A third difference between people is that no one can claim the right to give advice to someone else just for their own benefit. Asking for the right to advise someone means wanting to know their plans or get something good for yourself, which everyone naturally wants.

Also, when you ask for advice, you can't blame or punish the person who gives it. Asking for advice means you allow the other person to give their best opinion. So, if someone advises a leader or group, they can’t be punished for their advice, whether most people agree with it or not, as long as it relates to the topic being discussed. If the group’s opinion is already clear before the discussion ends, they shouldn’t ask for more advice because their decision is already made. Usually, the person who asks for advice is responsible for it and can’t punish the advice given. If someone gives bad advice that breaks the law, whether on purpose or by mistake, the community can punish them because not knowing the law is not an excuse.

Exhortation and dehortation are types of advice where the person strongly wants their advice to be followed. To put it simply, exhortation means encouraging someone to do something, and dehortation means trying to stop them from doing it. People who give this kind of advice don’t explain every logical step but try to persuade others by appealing to their feelings and using examples or stories to show why their advice is useful, honorable, or fair.

From this, we can see that exhortation and dehortation are meant to help the person giving the advice, not the one receiving it. This goes against what a true counselor should do. According to Thomas Hobbes, a good counselor should care about the person they are advising, not themselves.
