There are four main types of names.

First, a thing can be named based on what it is made of, like matter or body. For example, words like living, sensible, rational, hot, cold, moving, or still are all names that describe matter or body.

Second, a thing can be named based on a quality or accident it has. For example, instead of saying “living,” we say “life”; instead of “moved,” we say “motion”; instead of “hot,” we say “heat”; instead of “long,” we say “length.” These names describe qualities that help us tell one thing from another. These are called abstract names because they come from qualities, not the matter itself.

Third, we name things based on how our own bodies experience them. For example, when we see something, we don’t just think about the thing, but about the sight, the color, or the idea in our mind. When we hear something, we think about the sound or hearing, which is how our mind understands it. These are names of ideas or images in our minds.

Fourth, we also give names to names and to types of speech. Words like general, universal, special, and equivocal are names of names. Words like affirmation, question, command, story, argument, and speech are names for different kinds of talking. These are all the different kinds of positive names, which name things in nature, ideas we imagine, qualities, or words and speech themselves.

There are also negative names, which show that a word is NOT the name of the thing we’re talking about. For example, words like nothing, no man, infinite, unexplainable, or “three minus four” are negative names. Even though they don’t name real things, they help us think clearly and avoid mistakes.

All other names are just meaningless sounds. These are of two types.

One type is new words that don’t have clear meanings yet. Many of these were made up by old scholars and confusing philosophers.
