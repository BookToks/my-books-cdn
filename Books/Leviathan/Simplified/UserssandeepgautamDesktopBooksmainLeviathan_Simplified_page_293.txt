In Exodus 24:1-2, it's clear that only Moses was allowed to go up to God. Not Aaron, the other priests, the seventy elders, or the people could go. Moses was the only one who represented God to the Israelites. This means he was their only leader under God.

Later, it says that Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy elders went up and saw God. But this happened only after Moses had already been with God and told the people what God said. The others went up as important guests to see God, which was a special honor not given to everyone. They saw God and lived, but they did not bring any messages from God to the people.

God didn’t harm them when they saw Him. They ate and drank, which means they stayed alive. But it was always said that the Lord spoke to Moses, especially about how to run the community and about religious rules found in chapters 25 to 31 of Exodus and throughout Leviticus. God rarely spoke to Aaron.

Aaron once made a golden calf, but Moses threw it into the fire. When Aaron and Miriam challenged Moses’ authority, God sided with Moses (Numbers 12). Also, when Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and 250 leaders rebelled against Moses and Aaron, God punished them by swallowing them up or killing them with fire (Numbers 16). 

So, neither Aaron, the people, nor the leaders had the right to rule. Only Moses had power under God, both in government and religion. Moses was the only one who talked directly to God and told the people what God wanted. No one else was allowed to go near the mountain where God spoke with Moses. God said to set boundaries around the mountain and warned that anyone who touched it would be put to death.
