If a person or group with the highest power in a country gives up any important part of that power, and this causes people to have freedoms that go against that power, then people still have to obey the rules. Even if someone refuses to follow an order that seems to go against their freedom, it is still wrong and against their duty to obey. This is because the power was created with the people’s agreement and to protect them. Sometimes, freedoms were given by mistake, not knowing the bad results. But if someone not only disobeys, but also fights against a government official trying to enforce the rules, that is a crime. The person could have solved the problem peacefully by complaining.

Crimes are judged based on different things: first, how bad the cause is; second, how much it influences others to do the same; third, how harmful the result is; and fourth, when, where, and who is involved.

If someone breaks the law because they think they are strong, rich, or have friends to protect them, that is a worse crime than if they break the law hoping not to get caught or planning to run away. Thinking you won’t get punished because of your power shows disrespect for all laws. But if someone runs away because they are scared, they are more likely to obey the law in the future. Also, a crime done knowing it’s wrong is worse than the same crime done by mistake. If a person breaks the law on purpose, they think they are strong enough to do it again. But if they make a mistake and learn from it, they follow the law.

If a person makes a mistake because they trusted a teacher or official who explains the law, they are less guilty than someone who follows only their own ideas. What a public teacher says is almost like the law until the government changes it. For crimes that don’t challenge the highest power or break clear laws, this kind of mistake is fully excused. But if someone acts based on their own judgment, they must accept the consequences, whether they are right or wrong.
