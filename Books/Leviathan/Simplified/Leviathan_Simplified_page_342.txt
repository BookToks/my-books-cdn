Before Christianity, every ruler already had the power to teach and choose teachers. So, Christianity didn’t give them any new rights; it just showed them how to teach the truth. Because of this, they didn’t need any special ceremony (besides baptism) to allow them to do things like baptizing or blessing.

In the Old Testament, only priests could bless things when the high priest was in charge. But when the king was in charge, it was different. For example, Solomon blessed the people, dedicated the Temple, and led public prayer (1 Kings 8). This is the example used today for blessing Christian churches. This shows that Solomon had the right to both lead the church and do church duties.

Since Christian rulers combined political and church power, they have all the authority they need to manage their people’s actions, both in government and religion. They can make any laws they think are best for their people, because the State and the Church are made up of the same people.

If they want, Christian kings can give control of religion to the Pope. But in that case, the Pope works under the king’s authority, not God’s direct authority. The king can take away that power if he thinks it’s best for his people. Kings can also choose one main pastor or a group of pastors to lead the church, decide what power they have over each other, give them titles like bishop or priest, and decide how to support them, like through taxes. They must do this honestly, and only God can judge their conscience.

The king is the one who picks judges and interpreters of church laws because he makes those laws. He also enforces punishments like excommunication, which help keep people from being stubborn and make sure everyone stays united in the church.
