In old times, Germany was split into many small areas ruled by lots of little lords or family leaders. These lords were often fighting each other. To show who they were when wearing armor, they painted pictures of animals or other symbols on their shields and helmets. This helped their followers recognize them and also looked cool. These designs were passed down to their children. The oldest child got the exact same design, while the younger ones got slightly different versions.

Later, when many families joined together to form a bigger kingdom, a special person called a herald was made responsible for keeping track of these designs. The children of these lords became the noble families, who often used pictures of brave animals or war-related symbols like castles, weapons, and walls on their shields because being good at fighting was very important back then. Later on, kings and even common governments gave special shields to people who went to war or came back from it as a way to reward or encourage them. You can find these stories in old Greek and Latin histories that talk about Germany and its customs.

Titles like duke, count, marquis, and baron are important because they show respect from the ruling power of the country. Long ago, these titles were linked to jobs and leadership roles. Some come from the Romans, others from Germans and French. Dukes were war leaders, counts were friends of the leader who helped govern and protect lands, and marquises were counts who looked after border areas of the empire.

The titles duke, count, and marquis came into the empire around the time of Constantine the Great, from German military traditions. But the title baron came from the Gauls and means a great man. These were men who worked closely with kings or princes in war. The word baron comes from old words meaning "man" in the Gauls' language, similar to the Latin word "vir." Over time, these men were called berones, then barones, and in Spanish, varones.
