Imagine a man is accused of a very serious crime. He is scared because some enemies are powerful and mean, and judges can be unfair or biased. So, he runs away to protect himself. Later, he is caught and put on trial. He proves he didn’t do the crime and is found not guilty. But even though he is innocent, he still loses all his belongings. This is clearly unfair.

I say that no place in the world should accept this as a natural law or make it a rule just because other judges have done the same before. The first judge who decided this was wrong, and no wrong decision should be copied by others. There might be a written law that says innocent people can’t run away and can be punished for it. But thinking that running away means someone is guilty, especially after they have been declared innocent by the court, goes against how we should assume things. This assumption should not happen once a judge has made a decision.

Still, a famous English lawyer said that if an innocent person is accused of a crime and runs away because they are scared, even if the court proves they are innocent, they can still lose all their goods. The law says no evidence can be used to argue against the idea that running away means guilt. Here, you see an innocent person, cleared by the court, but still punished because of the assumption linked to running away. If running away is proof of a serious crime, then the punishment should be serious too. But losing only goods doesn’t fit that idea. So, this is not really a law of England. The punishment is based on the judge’s guess, not on real law. Also, it’s wrong to say you can’t bring evidence to challenge this kind of assumption.

All judges, whether the highest or the lowest, must listen to evidence. If they don’t, they are not doing justice. Even if their decision is right, judges who punish without hearing the proof are unfair. Their guess is just a prejudice, and nobody should bring that kind of bias into court, no matter what past decisions they try to follow. There are other examples like this where people’s judgments have been messed up by trusting old cases too much. But this example is enough to show that even if a judge’s decision is law for the person involved, it is not law for any future judge in that position.
