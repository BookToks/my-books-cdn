If someone makes a promise knowing they can only rely on their own word, then that promise is still valid because they are responsible for it themselves. So, when someone clearly has permission from another person, the promise binds the person giving permission. But if the permission is fake, only the person making the promise is responsible, since there’s no real permission from anyone else.

Almost anything can be represented by someone pretending. For example, things like a church, hospital, or bridge can be represented by a leader or manager. But these things can't actually make decisions or give permission because they aren’t alive. The people representing them only have power if the owners or leaders of those places give it to them. So, things like this can’t be represented unless there is some kind of government in place.

Similarly, kids, people who aren’t able to think clearly, or people who are mentally ill can be represented by guardians or caretakers. But these guardians can’t make decisions for them forever—only until the person can think reasonably again and decide if the actions were good.

During the time someone can’t think properly, the person in charge of them can give permission to the guardian. But this only works when there is a government because before that, no one really has control over others.

An idol, or something made up in someone’s mind, can be represented by people, like how ancient gods were treated. The government chose people to act for these gods, and these gods were given things and rights by people. But idols can’t actually make decisions because they aren’t real. The power came from the government, so before there was government, these gods couldn’t be represented.

The true God can be represented. First, Moses led the Israelites, who belonged to God, and he spoke not for himself but for God. Second, Jesus, God’s Son, came to bring people into God’s kingdom, not by his own power but because God sent him. Third, the Holy Spirit worked through the Apostles, not by itself but sent by God and Jesus to help and guide them.
