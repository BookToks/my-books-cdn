This was the goal of our smartest king, King James, who wanted to unite his two countries, England and Scotland. If he had succeeded, it probably would have stopped the civil wars that both kingdoms are suffering from right now. So, it’s not wrong for a king to decide who will take over after him by writing a will. Even though some kings have made mistakes with this, it’s still legal.  

Another reason this is okay is that any problems that come from giving a kingdom to someone from another country can also happen if the royal family marries someone from another country. But everyone agrees that marrying foreigners is allowed.

Chapter 20: About Different Types of Rule  

A government by force happens when someone becomes the ruler because they use power or violence. This happens when people, either alone or in a group, agree to give control to someone because they are scared of losing their lives or freedom.  

This kind of rule is different from when people pick a leader by choice. When people pick a leader, they do it because they don’t want to fight each other, not because they are afraid of the leader. But when someone rules by fear, people obey because they are scared of that person.  

Some people say that any agreement made because of fear isn’t real and shouldn’t be followed. But if this were true, no one in any government would have to obey the rules.  

It’s true that if someone promises something because they are scared, that promise isn’t valid if it breaks the laws. But that’s not because they were scared—it’s because they don’t have the right to make that promise.  

Also, if someone can legally keep a promise but doesn’t, it’s not the promise itself that’s broken, but the leader who says it’s okay. If the leader excuses them, then they are excused by the one who made the promise in the first place.
