(I Kings, 22:24) This can’t mean a ghost; Micaiah told the kings of Israel and Judah about the battle through a vision, not because a spirit was speaking through him.

In the same way, the Prophets spoke by God’s Spirit, which means they had a special gift to predict the future. But their knowledge didn’t come from a ghost inside them, it came through dreams or visions from God.

It says, “God made man from the dust of the earth and breathed into his nose the breath of life, and man became a living soul” (Genesis 2:7). Here, “breath of life” just means God gave him life. When it says, “as long as the spirit of God is in my nostrils” (Job 27:3), it simply means “as long as I live.” In Ezekiel 1:20, “the spirit of life was in the wheels” means “the wheels were alive.” And “the spirit entered into me and set me on my feet” (Ezekiel 2:1) means “I got my strength back,” not that a ghost took over his body.

In Numbers 11:17, God says, “I will take some of the spirit on you and put it on them,” meaning the seventy elders. Two of them started to prophesy, which some people didn’t like. Joshua wanted Moses to stop them, but Moses didn’t. This shows Joshua didn’t know they were allowed to prophesy and that they spoke with Moses’ permission, meaning they had a kind of authority from him.

Similarly, it says Joshua was “full of the spirit of wisdom because Moses laid his hands on him” (Deuteronomy 34:9). This means Joshua was chosen by Moses to continue the work Moses started, bringing God’s people into the promised land, which Moses couldn’t finish because he died.

Also, when it says, “If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they don’t belong to him” (Romans 8:9), it doesn’t mean Christ’s ghost, but that person follows Christ’s teachings. And, “You will know the Spirit of God by every spirit that admits Jesus Christ came in the flesh” (1 John 4:2) means true Christianity, accepting that Jesus is the Messiah. This doesn’t mean a ghost either.
