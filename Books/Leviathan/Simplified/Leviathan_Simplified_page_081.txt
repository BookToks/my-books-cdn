This is the law of the gospel: Treat others the way you want to be treated. And the law for all people is: Don’t do to others what you don’t want done to you.

Giving up your right to something means you stop blocking someone else from having the same right.

If you give up your right, you don’t give someone a new right they didn’t have before. Everyone naturally has the same rights. You just step aside so they can enjoy their right without you getting in the way. So, when someone loses their right, it only means fewer obstacles for others to use their own rights.

You can give up your right by either simply quitting it or by giving it to someone else. Simply quitting means you don’t care who benefits. Giving it means you want a specific person or people to have it. When you do this, you must not stop others from using that right. It’s your duty to respect your choice, and stopping them would be unfair and wrong because you gave up or shared the right before. Being unfair or wrong in real life is like contradicting yourself in a debate. Just like that would be silly, undoing what you willingly did before is unfair.

When you give up or transfer your right, you show it clearly by words, actions, or both to the person who accepts it. These signs are like promises that bind people. These promises aren’t strong by themselves because words can be broken easily, but people keep them because they fear bad consequences if they don’t.

Whenever you give up or transfer your right, it’s because you expect some other right or benefit in return. It’s a choice you make because you hope it will be good for you.
