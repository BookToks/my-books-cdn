Someone might ask, since there is no marriage in heaven, will people still eat and drink there? So, what kind of eating is talked about here? Jesus explains this when he says, “Don’t work for food that spoils, but for food that lasts forever, which the Son of Man will give you.” (John 6:27) Eating at Jesus’ table means enjoying eternal life, like eating from the tree of life in his kingdom.

From this and many other examples, it’s clear that Jesus will rule his kingdom in his human form.

Also, Jesus will be king in a way that shows he is under God the Father’s authority, like Moses was leading the people in the wilderness, or like the priests were before King Saul, and the kings after him.

One prophecy says Jesus will be like Moses in his role: “I will raise up a prophet from among their people, like you, and I will put my words in his mouth.” (Deuteronomy 18:18) We can see this similarity because Jesus picked twelve apostles, just like Moses chose twelve leaders of the tribes. These apostles will sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.

Moses also chose seventy elders to receive God’s Spirit and speak for him, and Jesus did the same by sending out seventy disciples to spread his kingdom and salvation to all people. When some of the seventy were criticized for speaking in the camp, Moses defended them as part of his leadership. Similarly, when John complained about a man casting out demons in Jesus’ name, Jesus said not to stop him, because “Anyone who is not against us is for us.” (Luke 9:50)

Jesus was also like Moses in setting up ceremonies that welcomed people into God’s kingdom and reminded them of their rescue from suffering. Before Moses, the Israelites used circumcision as a sign of joining God’s people. Even though this was stopped in the wilderness, it was started again when they entered the Promised Land. In the same way, before Jesus came, Jews used baptism, washing with water, for Gentiles who wanted to follow God.
