So, when people argue about something, they need to agree to let a judge or someone fair decide who's right. If they don’t, the argument might either turn into a fight or never get solved because there’s no natural way to figure out the right answer. This happens in all kinds of debates. But sometimes, people who think they are smarter than everyone else want to be the only ones deciding what’s right. That’s not okay in a group, just like in a card game where someone always tries to use their strongest cards no matter what. These people just want their feelings to be accepted as the truth, which actually shows they don’t really have a good reason.

Reason is not about just finding one or two true facts far away from what words actually mean. It’s about starting with clear definitions of words and then moving step by step from one idea to the next. You can’t be sure about the final answer unless you’re sure about all the smaller ideas that lead up to it. It’s like a head of a family adding up all the bills without checking if each bill is correct or what it’s for. If he just trusts the people who gave him the bills without checking, he might get tricked. It’s the same with reasoning: if you just trust what authors say without understanding the basic meanings behind their ideas, you won’t really know anything—you’ll just believe it.

Sometimes people think without using words, like guessing what happened before or what might happen next when they see something. But if what they guess doesn’t happen, or what they thought came before didn’t really come before, that’s called a mistake. Even the smartest people make mistakes like this.
