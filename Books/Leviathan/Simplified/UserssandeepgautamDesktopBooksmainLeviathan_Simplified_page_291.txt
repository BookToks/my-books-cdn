God said, “All the nations of the earth will be blessed through him, because I know he will teach his children and family to follow God’s way.” (Genesis 18:18-19) From this, we can understand the first point: people who haven’t heard directly from God should follow the rules given by their leader, just like Abraham’s family followed Abraham, their father and leader.

So, in every country, if people don’t have a special message from God, they should obey their leader’s laws about how to practice religion. What people believe or think inside is something only God can know, and governments can’t control that. These thoughts aren’t something people choose freely or because of laws, but come from God’s secret will, so they don’t have to be controlled by rules.

This brings us to the second point: Abraham was allowed to punish anyone in his family who claimed to have a private message from God but taught things Abraham didn’t allow. So, today, leaders can punish anyone who goes against the laws using their own private beliefs because leaders have the same role in their countries as Abraham had in his family.

The third point is that only Abraham in his family, and only the leader in a Christian country, can decide what really is God’s word. God spoke only to Abraham, so only Abraham could understand and explain God’s words to his family. Therefore, leaders today are the only ones who can interpret what God has said.

This special promise was made again with Isaac and then with Jacob, but after that, not again until the Israelites were freed from Egypt and reached Mount Sinai. Then it was renewed by Moses, as I said before (Chapter 35), and from that time, the Israelites became God’s special kingdom. Moses was God’s representative at that time, and the job was passed down to Aaron and his descendants to be God’s religious leaders forever.
