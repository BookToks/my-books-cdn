When people have a disagreement, they need to agree on someone fair, like a judge or an arbitrator, to decide what’s right. If they don’t, their argument might turn into a fight or stay unresolved because there’s no natural way to find the right answer. This happens in any kind of argument. 

Sometimes, people who think they are smarter than everyone else want to be the only ones to decide what’s true. This is annoying and unfair, like in a card game where someone always uses their strongest cards no matter what. These people want their feelings to be treated as the right reason, showing that they actually don’t have a real good reason.

The point of using reason is not just to find one answer far away from the basic ideas and meanings of words. Instead, it’s to start from clear definitions and work step by step from one idea to the next. You can’t be sure about the final answer unless you’re sure about all the steps that lead to it. 

It’s like when a head of a family adds up all the bills to see how much money was spent. If he just trusts the total and doesn’t check each bill carefully, he can’t be sure the total is correct. The same happens in reasoning: if you just trust what others say without understanding the basic meanings and details, you don’t really know anything—you only believe it.

People can also think without using words, like guessing what happened before or what might happen next when they see something. But if what they guess doesn’t happen or isn’t true, that’s called a mistake. Even the smartest people make mistakes sometimes.
