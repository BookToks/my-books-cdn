So, when we believe the Scriptures are God’s word but don’t get a direct message from God ourselves, we actually trust the Church. We accept what the Church says and have faith in it. People who believe what a prophet says in God’s name trust the prophet and respect him, whether the prophet is real or fake. It’s the same with other stories from history. For example, if I don’t believe everything a historian writes about Alexander or Caesar’s amazing deeds, I don’t think Alexander or Caesar would be upset—only the historian would be. If Livy says the gods once made a cow talk, and we don’t believe it, that doesn’t mean we doubt God, but that we doubt Livy. So, it’s clear that if we believe something just because people say it or write it, whether they are from God or not, we are only trusting humans.

Virtue means something valuable and special, and it depends on comparing things. If everyone had the same qualities, nothing would be special. Intellectual virtues are the mental skills people admire and want to have, often called a good wit. The word "wit" can also mean a specific kind of ability.

There are two kinds of these virtues: natural and learned. By natural, I don’t mean what you’re born with, because that’s just basic senses, which everyone and even animals have and don’t count as virtues. I mean the kind of wit you get by using your mind a lot and gaining experience, but without any formal teaching or training. This natural wit mainly includes two things: being quick to think (moving quickly from one thought to another) and being focused on a clear goal. On the other hand, if your thinking is slow, that’s a problem often called dullness or stupidity, or other words that mean slow or hard to move.
