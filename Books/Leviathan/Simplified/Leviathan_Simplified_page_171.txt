Imagine a man is accused of a serious crime, and because he’s scared of his enemy’s power and unfair judges, he runs away. Later, he’s caught and goes to trial, where he proves he didn’t do the crime and is found not guilty. But even after proving his innocence, he still loses all his stuff. This clearly punishes someone who did nothing wrong.

I’m saying that no place in the world should accept this as natural law or as a rule based on past judges’ decisions. The first judge who decided this way was unfair, and unfair decisions shouldn’t be used as examples for other judges. A written law might say innocent people aren’t allowed to run away, and they could be punished for that. But if someone is already proven innocent, running away shouldn’t be seen as proof they are guilty. This idea doesn’t make sense after a judge has already decided someone is innocent.

Still, a famous English lawyer said, “If an innocent person is accused of a felony and runs away because of fear, even if they prove they didn’t commit the crime, if it’s clear they ran away because of the felony, they will lose all their property. The law won’t accept any proof against this assumption based on their running away.” So here, even after proving innocence (and with no law saying running away was forbidden), the person loses everything just because judges assume guilt from their running.

If running away was proof of a serious crime, the punishment should be serious too. Since the punishment is losing property, not a harsher penalty, it means the assumption isn’t really about the crime but about the judges’ guesses. This isn’t true English law, and it’s wrong to say no proof can be accepted against such assumptions.

All judges, whether the highest or lowest, must listen to evidence or they aren’t doing justice. Even if the final decision is fair, judges who punish without hearing proof are unfair. Their guesses are just bias, and no one should bring that to court, no matter what past cases say. There are other examples like this where people’s judgments were wrong because they blindly followed past decisions. But this example is enough to show that even if one judge’s decision is a rule for the person involved, it isn’t a rule for future judges.
