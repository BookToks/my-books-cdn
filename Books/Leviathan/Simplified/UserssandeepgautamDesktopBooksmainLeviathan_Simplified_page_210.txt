This matches with the fifth Commandment.

Every ruler should make sure that people learn about justice. Justice means not taking away what belongs to others. In other words, people should be taught not to steal or hurt their neighbors or take what is rightfully theirs by force or trickery. The things people care about most are their own life and body. After that, many care about their relationships, like with their spouse, and then their money and belongings. So, people must learn not to hurt each other, not to disrespect their partners, and not to steal or cheat. It’s also important to show them why lying or cheating in court is bad because it ruins justice. These ideas are all part of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth Commandments.

Finally, people should understand that even planning to do something wrong is bad, even if they don’t actually do it. This is about having a bad intention, not just doing a bad action. This idea comes from the tenth Commandment and sums up the second set of laws. The main rule is to love your neighbor as yourself. The first set of laws is about loving God, who they had just accepted as their ruler.

To teach people all this, we need to understand why many wrong ideas about what’s right and wrong have become so common. For example, some believe people should decide what’s right based on their own feelings, not the law; that it’s wrong to follow the government if they don’t agree with it; that their own property shouldn’t be controlled by the government; that it’s okay to kill rulers they call tyrants; or that the government’s power can be split. These wrong ideas have spread among people through certain ways.
