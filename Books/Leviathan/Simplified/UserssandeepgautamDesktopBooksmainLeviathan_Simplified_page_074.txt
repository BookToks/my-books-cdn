Who would believe that someone who usually does things for selfish reasons really thinks there’s some invisible power to be afraid of, when they scare others for smaller mistakes?

What ruins the idea of love is when people find out someone has hidden motives, like wanting power, money, status, or comfort just for themselves. When people gain something for themselves, it looks like they are doing it for their own benefit, not because they care about others.

The only real proof that someone is truly chosen by God comes from miracles, true predictions, or amazing luck. So, people only fully believe in religious ideas that come from those who showed such miracles. Others who don’t show miracles only get as much belief as their culture or laws have taught them. Just like people need natural proof for real-world things, they need supernatural proof (miracles) to truly believe in spiritual things.

We can see these reasons why people’s faith weakens in the examples below. First, the Israelites, who saw Moses prove he was sent by God with miracles and leading them out of Egypt, turned away from God after Moses was gone for just 40 days. They made a golden calf to worship and went back to the false gods of Egypt. Later, a new generation that never saw God’s miracles started worshipping Baal. So, when miracles stopped, faith also failed.

Also, when Samuel’s sons became judges, they took bribes and were unfair. Because of this injustice, the people of Israel didn’t want God to be their king in a special way anymore. Instead, they asked Samuel to choose a king like other nations had. So, when justice failed, faith failed too, and they stopped seeing God as their ruler.

When Christianity began, the old pagan priests lost respect because of their bad behavior and greed. At the same time, many people became Christians through the preaching of the Apostles and Evangelists all over the Roman Empire. Much of this success happened because people looked down on the corrupt pagan priests.
