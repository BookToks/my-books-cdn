Nature has made people pretty equal in body and mind. Sometimes one person might be stronger or smarter than another, but overall, the differences aren’t big enough for anyone to claim special advantages over others. Even the weakest person can hurt the strongest, either by surprise or by teaming up with others who feel the same way.

When it comes to the mind, people are even more equal. Skills like science or deep knowledge come from learning and experience, not something you’re born with. Everyone gains experience over time if they focus on the same things. The idea that some people are much wiser than others is mostly just people thinking they are smarter than most, which isn’t really true. People tend to believe they are among the wisest because they know their own thoughts better than others’. This actually shows that people are quite equal because everyone feels okay with what they have.

Because people have similar abilities, they also have similar hopes for what they want. So, if two people want the same thing but only one can have it, they become enemies. They try to beat or destroy each other to get what they want, especially to protect themselves or enjoy something. That’s why if someone builds or owns something useful, others might come together to take it away, not just the thing but also the person’s freedom or life. And the person who tries to take it risks the same thing happening to them.
