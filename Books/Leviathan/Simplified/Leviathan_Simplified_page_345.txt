We need to understand that the Apostle Simon was called Stone, because the Syriac word "cephas" and the Greek word "petrus" both mean stone. After Simon said that Jesus was the Christ, Jesus replied, “You are Stone, and on this Stone I will build my Church.” This means Jesus was saying, “Believing I am the Christ is the most important part of faith for anyone who wants to be in my Church.” Using a name like this is normal in everyday talk. But if Jesus meant to build his Church on Peter himself, he could have just said, “I will build my Church on you,” which would have been clearer.

When Jesus said, “I will give you the keys of heaven,” he was giving the same power to all his disciples. He told them, “Whatever you decide on earth will be decided in heaven.” This power belongs to all leaders of the Church, especially Christian rulers who are in charge in their own lands.

If Peter or Jesus converted a ruler to believe in him, the ruler still kept control over his own people. Jesus’ kingdom is not part of this world, so he didn’t take away any ruler’s power to teach their people. This shows that Peter was not the boss of all Christians everywhere.

The second book says two things: Peter was the Bishop of Rome and he died there, and the Popes of Rome are his successors. Some people disagree with this. But even if these are true, being Bishop of Rome didn’t mean being the leader of the whole Church. It was the emperor Constantine, the first Christian emperor, who was the real leader. Like Constantine, all Christian emperors had the right to be leaders in their own empires. That means they were leaders in their own lands, not over all Christians everywhere. Other Christian rulers had the same right in their own countries. This is the answer to Thomas Hobbes’ second book.
