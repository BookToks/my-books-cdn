The first council that decided which books should be in the Bible doesn’t exist anymore. People question a list of these books that is linked to Clemens, the first bishop of Rome after St. Peter. Even though the list names the books, it talks about “clergy and laity,” meaning church leaders and regular people, which wasn’t a common idea so soon after St. Peter’s time. 

The first council we still have records of is the one at Laodicea. Rule 59 says only certain books are allowed to be read in church. This rule wasn’t for every Christian, but only for church leaders who read in public.

Back when the apostles were alive, church leaders had different jobs. Some were “magisterial,” meaning they taught the gospel, led church services, and helped new believers learn how to live. Others were “ministerial,” like deacons, who took care of the church’s everyday needs, using money given by the people.

Among the magisterial leaders, the most important were the twelve apostles. Jesus himself chose them. Their job was not just to teach and baptize but also to be witnesses who could prove Jesus rose from the dead. This was what made apostles different from other church leaders. To be an apostle, you had to have seen Jesus alive after his resurrection or known him before that time and seen his miracles. This proved they were trustworthy witnesses.

When Judas Iscariot died, the apostles needed to pick a new one. Peter said they had to choose someone who had been with them the whole time Jesus was alive—from John the Baptist’s time until Jesus went up to heaven. This shows that being an apostle meant you had to have been with Jesus during those important days.
