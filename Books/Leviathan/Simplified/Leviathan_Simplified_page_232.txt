This passage is where I will explain the main ideas about the rights of the top rulers on Earth in Christian countries and what Christian people should do toward their leaders. In the next chapter, I will talk about the Bible’s books, who wrote them, what they cover, and how important they are.

The Books of Holy Scripture are the ones that should be the official rules for Christian life. Since all rules people must follow are like laws, the Bible’s question is about what laws apply everywhere in Christian lands, both natural and civil laws. The Bible doesn’t say exactly what laws every Christian king must make in his land, but it does say what laws they cannot make. I have already shown that rulers in their own lands are the only lawmakers; so, only the books that rulers accept as official are true laws in each country.

It’s true that God is the highest ruler of all, so when God speaks to a person, they must obey Him no matter what any human leader says. But the real question is not about obeying God, but about what God actually said. People who don’t have direct messages from God can only understand this through natural reason, which helps them follow the rules of their country and obey their lawful rulers. Because of this, I can only accept the Old Testament books as Holy Scripture if the Church of England says they are. We don’t need to list all these books here, but they are the same ones St. Jerome accepted. He considered other books like Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Tobias, the first and second books of Maccabees, and the third and fourth books of Esdras as Apocrypha (extra writings).
