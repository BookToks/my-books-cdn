The book of Job is not really a history book. Instead, it’s more like a discussion about a question people argued about a long time ago: why do bad people often do well in life while good people suffer? This idea makes sense because, at first, the book is written in normal prose until the third chapter. Then, from that point until near the end, the story is told in poetry, and the rest goes back to prose. The argument is all in poetry, with regular writing at the beginning and end. People usually don’t write poetry when they’re really upset, like Job, or when they’re trying to comfort someone, like his friends. But in old times, poetry was often used for deep thinking, especially about morals.

Most of the Psalms were written by David to be sung by choirs. There are also some songs by Moses and other holy people. Some Psalms, like number 137 and 126, were written after the Jews returned from being held captive in Babylon. This shows that the Psalms were put together and organized after this return.

The Proverbs are a collection of wise sayings from Solomon, Agur (the son of Jakeh), and the mother of King Lemuel. It’s unlikely Solomon collected all these sayings himself. Even though the wise words belong to them, someone else probably gathered and put them into one book, likely a godly person who lived after them.

The Books of Ecclesiastes and Canticles (Song of Songs) only contain Solomon’s words, except maybe for the titles. The Books of Ecclesiastes (“The Words of the Preacher, the Son of David, King in Jerusalem”) and Canticles (“The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s”) were probably named that way to make it clear who wrote them when all the Scriptures were collected together. This was to make sure people knew both the teachings and the authors.

The oldest Prophets include Zephaniah, Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, and Micaiah. They lived during the time of Kings Amaziah and Azariah (also called Ozias) of Judah. The Book of Jonah isn’t really a record of his prophecies. His prophecy was simple: “Forty days and Nineveh shall be destroyed.” The book tells the story of Jonah’s stubbornness and arguing with God’s commands, so it’s unlikely Jonah wrote it since he’s the main character. But the Book of Amos is truly his prophecy.

Jeremiah, Obadiah, Nahum, and Habakkuk were prophets during the time of King Josiah.
