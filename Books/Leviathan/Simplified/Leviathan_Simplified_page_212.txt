If someone breaks the rules against the whole country, they can be forgiven without breaking fairness, because everyone can forgive things done against themselves if they want to. But if someone hurts a private person, they can only be forgiven if that person agrees or gets fair payment.

Differences between people come from what the rulers do, so those differences don’t matter when everyone is judged fairly, like in a court. The respect given to important people should be because they help others, not because of their status. When powerful people do bad things, it’s worse because they don’t need to do them. If important people get away with bad behavior, it makes them rude and others angry, which can lead to trying to destroy those in power, even if it hurts the whole country.

Fair justice means taxes should be fair too. Taxes don’t have to be based on how rich someone is, but on how much each person owes the country for protecting them. People don’t just work to live; they also need to be ready to fight if needed to protect their work. Like the Jews who rebuilt their temple while also defending themselves, people must either protect themselves or pay others to do it.

Taxes are like paying the soldiers who protect everyone while people do their jobs. Since life is equally valuable to both poor and rich people, the amount each owes for protection is also equal. Rich people may owe more because they have more people working for them. So, fairness in taxes depends more on what people use than how rich they are. It wouldn’t make sense to charge someone who works hard and saves money more than someone who wastes all they earn, since both get the same protection.
