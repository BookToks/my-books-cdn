But it doesn’t seem right that God’s followers would be placed as high as His throne or even higher than His footstool. That wouldn’t fit the respect a king deserves, and I can’t find any clear Bible verse that says so.

From what has been said about God’s kingdom and salvation, it’s not hard to understand what “the world to come” means. The Bible talks about three worlds: the old world, the present world, and the world to come. St. Peter talks about the first world: “If God didn’t spare the old world but saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing the flood on the ungodly.” So, the first world was from Adam until the big flood. Jesus talks about the present world when He says, “My kingdom is not of this world.” He came to teach people how to be saved and to renew His Father’s kingdom through His teachings. St. Peter also talks about the world to come: “We look for new heavens and a new earth.” This is the world where Christ will come down from heaven with great power and glory, send His angels, gather His chosen people from everywhere on earth, and rule over them forever under His Father.

For a sinner to be saved, there has to be a payment made first. If someone sins, they owe a penalty. Either they must pay it themselves or someone else must pay a ransom that the one offended, who is God, demands. Since God is all-powerful, this ransom must be paid before a person can be saved, as God requires it.

This ransom doesn’t mean paying back exactly what the sin caused, because no sinner or even a perfectly good person can do that for someone else. When a person harms another, they can fix it by paying them back, but sin isn’t something you can fix by paying money. That would make sin something people could just buy and sell.

But sins can be forgiven if a person is truly sorry, either freely or by a penalty that God accepts. In the Old Testament, God usually accepted a sacrifice or offering. Forgiving sin isn’t unfair, even if punishment was promised.

Even among people, promises of good things usually must be kept, but threats or promises of bad things don’t always bind people. So, they are even less likely to bind God, who is much more merciful than humans.
