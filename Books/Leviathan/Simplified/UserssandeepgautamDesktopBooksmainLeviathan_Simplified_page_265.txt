But how God spoke to them is not clear. Saying that when Moses went up Mount Sinai it was just a dream or vision, like other prophets had, is wrong because God made Moses different from the other prophets (Numbers 12:6-8). Saying God spoke or showed Himself exactly as He really is would deny that He is infinite, invisible, and beyond understanding. Saying He spoke through inspiration or the Holy Spirit, meaning God Himself, would make Moses equal to Christ, who alone fully shows God in human form (Colossians 2:9). Finally, saying God spoke through the Holy Spirit as gifts or graces doesn’t mean anything supernatural happened. God guides people to be good and believe through teaching, examples, and normal events.

Since these ways don’t explain how God spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, they also don’t explain how God spoke to the high priests at the mercy-seat. So, how God spoke to the main prophets of the Old Testament, whose job was to ask Him questions, is not understandable. In the New Testament, the only main prophet was Jesus, who was both God speaking and the prophet He spoke to.

For lower-level prophets who were always called to speak for God, there is no proof God spoke to them in a supernatural way. Instead, God naturally moved people toward goodness, belief, and right living, like He does to all Christians. This happens through teaching, learning, and everyday chances to do good. We say this is the work of the Holy Spirit because there is no good feeling or desire that doesn’t come from God. But these actions are not always supernatural. So, when a prophet is said to speak “in the Spirit” or “by the Spirit of God,” it just means they speak following God’s will, as shown by the highest prophet. Most of the time, “spirit” just means a person’s intention, mind, or attitude.

When Moses lived, there were seventy other men who also prophesied among the Israelites. How God spoke to them is explained in Numbers 11:25: “The Lord came down in a cloud, spoke to Moses, took some of the spirit on him, and gave it to the seventy elders.”
