If people think they should be free from laws, it’s weird because they also want to be free in a way that lets others control their lives. But even though this idea is strange, that’s what they want, not realizing that laws don’t work without someone with power to make sure they are followed. A person’s freedom only includes things the ruler doesn’t control, like buying and selling, choosing where to live, what to eat, what job to have, and how to raise their kids.

Still, this kind of freedom doesn’t mean the ruler loses the power to decide life or death. It’s already explained that anything the ruler does can’t really be called unfair or harmful, because everyone agrees to follow the ruler’s decisions, except when they break God’s natural laws.

So, sometimes in countries, the ruler can order someone’s death without doing wrong to others. For example, Jephthah sacrificed his daughter because of his promise, and even though she died, it wasn’t unfair to her. The same goes for a ruler who kills an innocent person. Even if the act seems wrong by natural law, like David killing Uriah, it isn’t unfair to Uriah because he gave up his rights by agreeing to the ruler’s power. But it is wrong against God, because the ruler must follow God’s laws too. David admitted this when he said, “To thee only have I sinned.”

Similarly, in Athens, people banished a powerful man for ten years without accusing him of a crime, just because they feared what he might do. They didn’t know who they were banishing, and people voted by writing names on oyster shells. Sometimes they banished a fair man named Aristides or a silly person named Hyperbolus just for fun.
