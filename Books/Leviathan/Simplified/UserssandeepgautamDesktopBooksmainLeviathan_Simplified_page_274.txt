A clever person who has learned the secrets and stories that one man usually tells another about his past actions and adventures can easily repeat them. Many people use this skill to get a reputation for being magic workers. But there are many kinds of these people, called Thaumaturgi by the Greeks, meaning workers of wonders. They do all their tricks by their own skill.

However, when people work together to trick others, even the most impossible things can be believed. For example, if two people plan it so one pretends to be lame and the other pretends to heal him with a magic charm, they can fool many people. If more people join in to act as witnesses, they can fool even more.

Because people often believe fake miracles too quickly, the best advice comes from God’s rules given through Moses. Moses said we should not believe anyone claiming to be a prophet unless they teach the same religion that Moses taught. Also, if they make predictions, those predictions must come true. So, before trusting a miracle or a prophet, we should check with God’s representatives, like Moses, Aaron, or the leaders of the Church.

When we see a claimed miracle, we must watch carefully and try to prove if it really happened. We also must check if it is something no person could do naturally and needs God’s power. We should always ask God’s leaders for help when we are unsure.

For example, if someone says that by saying special words over a piece of bread, God changed it into a god or a man, but it still looks like bread, there is no reason to believe it or be afraid. We should ask God’s representative if it really happened. If they say no, then, as Moses said, the person is speaking wrongly and we should not fear them.
