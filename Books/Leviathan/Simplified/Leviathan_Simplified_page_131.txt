If we think of liberty as being free from laws, it doesn’t make sense for people to want freedom that lets others control their lives. But even though this is silly, that’s exactly what people ask for. They don’t realize that laws can’t protect them unless someone has the power to enforce those laws.

A person’s freedom only includes things the ruler doesn’t control, like buying and selling, making deals, choosing where to live, what to eat, what job to have, and how to raise their children.

Still, we shouldn’t think that this kind of freedom means the ruler can’t decide life or death. It has already been explained that whatever the ruler does can’t really be called unfair or harmful, because every person agrees to the ruler’s actions by being part of the society. The only higher rule is the law of nature, or what God commands.

So, sometimes a person can be put to death by the ruler’s order without it being unfair. For example, Jephthah sacrificed his daughter because of a promise he made; she had the freedom to act, but was still put to death without injustice. The same goes for a king who kills an innocent person. Even if the act is against natural law, like when David killed Uriah, it’s not unfair to Uriah because he gave the king power over him. But it is wrong against God, because David broke a moral rule. David admitted this when he said, “To you alone have I sinned.”

In a similar way, the people of Athens once exiled an important citizen for ten years without accusing him of a crime, only because they feared what he might do. They even let every citizen vote by writing a name on a shell, sometimes exiling good people like Aristides just because of their reputation, or even joking by exiling a funny man named Hyperbolus.
