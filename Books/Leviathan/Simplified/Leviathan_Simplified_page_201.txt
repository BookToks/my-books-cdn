When it comes to rebelling against kings, one big reason is that people read old books about the Greeks and Romans. Young people and others who don’t think carefully get excited by stories of great battles won by their leaders. They also start to believe that these successes happened because of their type of government, not because of the efforts of individual leaders. But they don’t see all the fights and civil wars that happened because their system wasn’t perfect.

Because of these books, some people have even tried to kill their kings. The writers say it’s okay to kill a "tyrant," not just any king. So if someone calls their king a tyrant, they think it’s right to get rid of him. These books also make people believe that in a democracy, people are free, but under a monarchy, they are slaves. People living under a king believe this, even if it’s not true since they don’t actually live in a democracy.

I think nothing is worse for a monarchy than letting people read these books without giving them proper advice to stop their dangerous ideas. The harm these books cause is like the bite of a mad dog. People who get bitten keep feeling thirsty but hate water, which could save them. It’s like the poison tries to turn them into a mad dog themselves. When a monarchy is attacked by writers who always criticize it, the only thing that can save it is a strong king. But because people are afraid of being ruled strongly, when they get a strong king, they don’t like him.

Some experts believe that a person has three souls, and some think there can be more than one ruler in a country. They set up a higher power against the real ruler, religious laws against civil laws, and spiritual authority against government. They confuse people with fancy words that don’t mean much but show that there’s an invisible kingdom, like a kingdom of fairies, that secretly controls things in the dark.
