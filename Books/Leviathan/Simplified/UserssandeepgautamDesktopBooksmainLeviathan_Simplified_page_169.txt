If you have to obey a public officer, just seeing their official paper with the public seal and hearing it read, or having a way to find out about it if you want, is enough proof that they have the right authority. Everyone has to try their best to learn about all written laws that might affect what they do in the future.

The lawmaker is known, and the laws are shared either in writing or through natural understanding, but there is one more important thing to make them binding. It’s not just the exact words, but the meaning or intention behind the law—that is, the true interpretation, which shows what the lawmaker really meant. So, only the highest authority can decide how to interpret the laws, and only those chosen by this authority can explain them.

If not, a clever interpreter could twist the law to mean something opposite to what the lawmaker wanted, making the interpreter act like a lawmaker instead.

All laws, whether written down or not, need to be interpreted. Natural law, which is unwritten, is easy to understand for people who think fairly and calmly, so those who break it can’t make excuses. But since most people are often biased by self-interest or other feelings, natural law has become the hardest to understand and needs the best interpreters.

Written laws can be misunderstood too. If they are short, a word or two can be confusing; if long, many words can cause even more confusion. So, no written law can be fully understood without knowing the real reasons why it was made, and only the lawmaker knows those reasons. That means the lawmaker can solve any problem in the law, either by explaining its purpose or by changing it completely, just like Alexander cut the Gordian knot with his sword. No other interpreter can do this.

In a society, laws of nature are not based on the ideas of moral philosophers. Writers’ opinions don’t become laws just because they are true unless the authority of the society agrees with them.
