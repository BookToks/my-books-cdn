Every crime happens because someone doesn’t understand something, makes a mistake in thinking, or suddenly loses control of their feelings. Not understanding something means being ignorant; making a mistake in thinking means having wrong opinions.

There are three kinds of ignorance: not knowing the law, not knowing who is in charge, and not knowing the punishment. Not knowing the basic rule of treating others how you want to be treated doesn’t excuse anyone. So, no matter where a person goes, if they break this rule, it’s a crime.

For example, if someone comes from far away and tries to make people change their religion or disobey the laws, even if they truly believe what they say, they are committing a crime. They are doing something they wouldn’t want others to do to them. But if someone doesn’t know the local civil laws because they are new to the place, they can’t be punished until those laws are explained to them.

If a person’s own country’s laws aren’t clear or they don’t know that what they did was against the basic rule of treating others right, then ignorance is a good excuse. But in other cases, not knowing the law doesn’t excuse them.

Not knowing who is in charge where they live is never an excuse, because they should know who protects them. Also, not knowing the punishment for breaking a law doesn’t excuse anyone if the law is clear.

When someone breaks a law, they accept all the consequences, even if they don’t know what the punishment is. Punishment is a normal part of breaking laws. If the law already says what the punishment is, they have to accept it. If not, they can be punished in any way the person in charge decides.

If the punishment is already stated in the law or usually given for that crime, then the person can’t be punished more than that. If the punishment isn’t strong enough to stop people from breaking the law, it actually encourages them to do it because they think the risk is worth it.

So, when people are punished more than the law says or more than others for the same crime, the law itself is to blame for tricking them into doing wrong.
