When we think about something we once sensed, like a picture in our mind, we call that imagination. But when we remember something that is fading or old, that’s called memory. So, imagination and memory are basically the same thing, but we use different words depending on how we think about them.

When we remember a lot of things, we call that experience.

Imagination only works with things we’ve already seen or sensed before, either all at once or in parts at different times. Imagining the whole thing, like picturing a man or a horse you’ve seen, is simple imagination. But when you mix parts from different things you’ve seen, like combining a man and a horse to imagine a centaur, that’s compound imagination. For example, if someone imagines themselves as a hero like Hercules or Alexander because they’ve read stories about them, that’s also compound imagination, which is basically just a made-up idea in the mind.

Sometimes, even when we are awake, we see images because of something we stared at for a long time. Like after looking at the sun, you might still see a spot of light, or after studying shapes, you might see lines and angles when it’s dark. These kinds of images don’t have a special name because they aren’t talked about much.

When people sleep, their imaginations are called dreams. Dreams are made up of things we’ve seen or sensed before, either completely or in parts. Since our brain and nerves don’t work well with outside things during sleep, dreams come from inside the body. When the inside parts of the body get disturbed, they affect the brain and cause these images or dreams. Because the senses are "turned off" during sleep, our dreams can seem clearer than our thoughts when we’re awake. That’s why it’s really hard, and some even say impossible, to tell exactly if we’re dreaming or awake sometimes.
