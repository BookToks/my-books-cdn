When people make decisions or argue, they need to think clearly and logically. Without this, their choices can be quick and unfair. But if they don’t speak well and convince others, their good ideas won’t matter much. These two skills are different: thinking is based on truth, while speaking depends on what people already believe and how they feel, which can change.

Among feelings, courage means not being scared of pain or death, and this can make people want to get revenge or cause trouble in society. On the other hand, being scared can make people avoid helping defend the community.

They say a person can’t be both brave and scared at the same time.

Also, because people have different opinions and ways of living, it’s said that it’s impossible to always get along with everyone we have to deal with. Most of our interactions involve fighting over respect, money, and power.

I think these problems are hard but not impossible to fix. With learning and practice, people can balance these things. Sometimes we focus on clear thinking, other times on imagination, depending on what we need. Just like the Israelites in Egypt sometimes made bricks and other times gathered straw, our minds can switch between careful thought and creativity. Reasoning and speaking well can work together, especially about people and behavior. If people can make mistakes sound good, they can also make the truth sound better if they want to. It’s not weird to respect laws but still be brave against enemies, or to avoid hurting others but forgive people who hurt you. Human nature and being a good citizen are not as opposite as some think. 

I’ve seen someone with clear thinking, creativity, strong reasoning, and great speaking skills, who was brave in war but also respected laws. That person was my dear friend, Mr. Sidney Godolphin. He didn’t hate anyone and wasn’t hated by anyone, but sadly, he was killed early in the recent civil war by someone who didn’t understand him.
