People who are alone and don’t care about anything still have busy thoughts, but their thoughts don’t make sense together. It’s like hearing a guitar that’s out of tune, or hearing music but not knowing how to play it. Even so, sometimes a person can notice how one thought leads to another.

For example, during a talk about a civil war, someone asked a strange question about how much a Roman penny was worth. It might seem weird, but the connection was clear. Thinking about the war made them think about the king being handed over to his enemies, which made them think about Christ being handed over, then about the 30 pieces of silver paid for that betrayal, and that led to the question about the penny. All this happened super fast because thoughts move quickly.

There is another kind of thinking that is steadier, guided by what we want or fear. When we really want or fear something, it sticks in our mind and can even keep us awake. From wanting something, we think about ways to get it, then ways to get those ways, and so on, until we find a starting point we can control. Because the goal is strong in our mind, if our thoughts start to wander, they quickly come back to the main idea. One wise man once said, “look to the end,” meaning always think about what you want so it guides your thoughts to reach it.

There are two types of planned thinking. One is when we imagine an effect and try to find the cause or the way to make it happen. Both animals and people do this. The other is when we imagine something and think about all the things we can do with it. This kind of thinking, about what we can do with something once we have it, only happens in people. Animals don’t do this because they mostly just follow basic needs like hunger, thirst, or anger. In short, when our mind is focused on a goal, it’s like hunting for answers or figuring out how things work—something people are especially good at.
