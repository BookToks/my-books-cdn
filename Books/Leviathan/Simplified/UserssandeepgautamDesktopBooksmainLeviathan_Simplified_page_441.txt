So, one of the biggest reasons a state can fall apart is when the people who take over don’t just want others to obey them from now on, but also want everyone to agree with everything they did in the past. Almost no country in the world can honestly say their beginnings were completely fair.

The word “tyranny” basically means the same as having full power, whether it’s one person or many. But people who use the word “tyrant” usually mean to show they don’t like those in power. I think allowing people to openly hate tyranny is like allowing them to hate the whole idea of a country or government, which is also a problem similar to the first one. When someone conquers a place, they often have to make the defeated people look bad to justify their own actions, but that doesn’t mean the defeated must accept it. That’s what I wanted to explain about the first and second parts of this discussion.

In Chapter 35, I explained using the Bible that in the Jewish nation, God was made the ruler by an agreement with the people. Because of this, they were called His “special people,” to set them apart from the rest of the world, where God ruled by His own power without asking. Moses was God’s representative on Earth and told the people the laws God set for them. But I didn’t say who was in charge of carrying out punishments, especially death penalties, which now seems important.

In most countries, punishments were usually carried out by soldiers or guards, or by people who wanted the job even if it was looked down on. But among the Israelites, God’s law was that anyone found guilty of a serious crime had to be stoned to death by the people. The witnesses who saw the crime had to throw the first stones, then the rest of the people could join in. This law made it clear who should punish the criminal, but no one could start throwing stones before the person was found guilty by the community. The witnesses had to be listened to before punishment, unless the crime happened right in front of everyone or the judges, in which case no other proof was needed.
