So, what does this place mean? It might just mean that Jesus went into the wilderness by himself. The moving from wilderness to city and then to a mountain was probably a vision. This fits with what St. Luke says, that Jesus was led into the wilderness by the Spirit, not physically. When Jesus was taken up to the mountain or the top of the temple, St. Matthew talks about it like a vision too.

Also, when St. Luke says that Satan entered Judas Iscariot, and then Judas talked to the priests about betraying Jesus, it means Judas had bad thoughts and plans to betray Jesus. Just like the Holy Spirit gives good feelings, Satan entering Judas means he had evil intentions. It wouldn’t make sense to say the devil entered Judas before he wanted to betray Jesus, or that Judas was first Jesus’ friend and then the devil entered him later. So, the devil entering Judas and his bad plan are the same thing.

If there are no spirits or possession of people’s bodies by spirits, then why didn’t Jesus’ Apostles teach everyone that clearly? But these kinds of questions aren’t really important for a Christian’s salvation. People could also ask why Jesus gave faith and good qualities to some people but not all, or why he didn’t reveal all natural science answers to everyone. There are good reasons for this. Just like when God brought the Israelites to the Promised Land but didn’t get rid of all the enemies around them, so they had to stay strong and faithful, Jesus also didn’t solve every hard question for us. He wanted us to use our own brains and effort.

The main point of Jesus’ teaching is simple: believe that he is the Christ, the Son of God, who came to save us by dying for our sins. When he comes back, he will rule and save his followers forever. Whether or not you believe in possession by spirits doesn’t stop you from this belief, even if some people get confused and follow their own ideas.
