They argue badly, kind of like if people who never saw strong houses said there’s no way to build a house that lasts as long as the materials it’s made from. Every day, with time and hard work, people learn new things. Just like building a good house comes from understanding how materials work and the right shapes and sizes, which took a long time to figure out, the same goes for making good governments. Even though people started making governments a long time ago, they were often messy and could fall apart. But after thinking hard for a long time, people can find smart rules to make governments last a long time, unless they are destroyed by outside forces. I’ve shared some of these smart rules here. Whether the people in charge see them or use them doesn’t matter much to me right now. But even if my ideas aren’t based just on reason, I’m sure they come from the Bible, which I will explain later when I talk about how God’s kingdom was run by Moses for the Jewish people.

Some say that even if these rules are good, regular people aren’t smart enough to understand them. I’d be happy if the rich and powerful, or the so-called smart people, were just as unable to understand them as the regular folks.

But everyone knows that the real problem isn’t that the ideas are too hard. It’s that people don’t want to learn them if it means losing power or admitting they’re wrong. Powerful people don’t like anything that limits what they want, and smart people don’t like anything that shows their mistakes and weakens their control. But regular people’s minds, if they aren’t controlled by powerful people or influenced by their teachers’ opinions, are like blank pages ready to accept whatever the government teaches them. If whole countries can believe in big mysteries of religion that don’t make sense, and millions can believe that one body can be in many places at once, which is against reason, then surely people can learn simple, reasonable ideas about their rights if someone teaches them well and the law supports it. So, I believe that teaching people about their basic rights and the natural laws of ruling isn’t hard, as long as the ruler keeps full power. If there are problems, it’s because of the ruler’s mistakes or the mistakes of those the ruler trusts to run the government. It’s the ruler’s job and also in their own best interest to make sure people are taught these things, so they don’t face rebellions or dangers to their own safety.
