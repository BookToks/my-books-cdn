But it’s clear that King Solomon took away Abiathar’s job as high priest (I Kings, 2. 26, 27) and put Zadok in his place (Ibid., 2. 35). So, kings can also choose and remove bishops as they think is best to keep their people well governed.

His sixth point is this: if bishops get their power directly from God (called de jure divino), then those who say this should show some proof from God. But they can’t. This is a good point, and I don’t argue against it. But this also means the Pope doesn’t have authority in other rulers’ lands.

Finally, he uses the words of two Popes, Innocent and Leo, as proof. And I’m sure he could have used words from almost all Popes since St. Peter, because people naturally want power. So, any Pope would want to support this idea. But even then, they are just supporting themselves, so their proof isn’t strong.

In the fifth book, he makes four points. First, the Pope is not the ruler of the whole world. Second, he is not ruler of all Christians. Third, without his own land, the Pope doesn’t have any direct political power. These three points are easy to agree with. The fourth says the Pope has power over other rulers, but only indirectly. This is denied—unless “indirectly” means he got power in a roundabout way, which is true. But what he really means is that the Pope’s spiritual power includes political power, so he can change kings and kingdoms if he thinks it will help save souls.

Before I look at the reasons he gives for this idea, it’s good to think about what it means. Princes and states who have political control should think carefully if it’s right or helpful for their people to accept this idea, since they will have to answer for their actions on Judgment Day.
