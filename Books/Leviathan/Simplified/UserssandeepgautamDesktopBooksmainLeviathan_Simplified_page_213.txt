But when taxes are put on things people use, everyone pays the same amount for what they consume; the country isn’t cheated by people wasting stuff on fancy things.

Sometimes, people can’t work and take care of themselves because of things that happen by chance. These people shouldn’t have to rely on others’ kindness. Instead, the government should take care of them as much as they need. It’s not kind for anyone to ignore those who can’t help themselves. It’s also not right for the leaders to leave them depending on uncertain help from others.

For people who are strong and able to work, the situation is different. They should be made to work. To make sure they can find jobs, there should be laws that support different kinds of work like sailing, farming, fishing, and making things. If there are too many poor but strong people, they should be moved to places that don’t have many people yet. When they move, they shouldn’t push out the people already there. Instead, everyone should live closer together and work their land carefully to get enough food. If the whole world gets too crowded, the last option is war, which provides for everyone either by winning or by death.

It is the leader’s job to make good laws. But what is a good law? A good law isn’t just a fair law because no law can be unfair. Laws come from the leaders, and everything they do is accepted by the people. If everyone agrees on a law, it can’t be unfair to anyone. Laws are like the rules of a game: whatever players all agree on is fair. A good law is one that people really need and understand clearly.

Laws aren’t meant to stop people from doing things they want to do. Instead, laws guide people so they don’t hurt themselves by acting too fast or making bad choices. Laws are like fences that don’t block travelers but keep them on the right path. So, a law that isn’t necessary and doesn’t have a clear purpose is not a good law. Sometimes a law might help the leader but not the people, but that’s not a good law either. The leader’s good and the people’s good must always go together.
