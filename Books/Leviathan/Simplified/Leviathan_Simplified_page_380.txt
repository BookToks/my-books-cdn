After that time, there was no other kingdom of God in the world except that He always was, is, and will be the king of all people and creatures, ruling with His unlimited power. However, He promised through His prophets to bring back His rule again when the right time comes, which only He knows. This will happen when people turn to Him by feeling sorry for their wrongs and changing their lives. Not only that, but He also welcomed the Gentiles (non-Jews) to join and enjoy His kingdom if they also repent and change. He promised to send His Son to the world to take away everyone's sins by dying, and to teach people how to be ready for His return. Since His second coming hasn’t happened yet, the kingdom of God is not here now, and we live under our own civil rulers. But Christians are already part of God’s kingdom of grace because they have the promise of being accepted when Jesus comes back.

Because of the wrong idea that the current Church is Christ’s kingdom, some people think there should be one person or group who speaks for Jesus in heaven, makes laws, and represents Him to all Christians. Or that different people or groups do this in different parts of the Christian world. The Pope claims this power over Christ’s kingdom everywhere, and local groups of pastors also claim it in their areas, even though the Bible only gives this power to civil rulers. This causes a lot of arguments and confusion, making people unsure about who they should really obey.

Because the Pope claims to be Christ’s representative in the Church (which some think is His kingdom), people believe that a Christian king must be crowned by a bishop. They think this ceremony is how the king gets the phrase "by the grace of God" in his title, and that only when crowned by the Pope’s authority is a king truly made by God’s favor. They also believe that every bishop must promise total obedience to the Pope when they are made bishops. Because of this, the fourth Council of Lateran under Pope Innocent III said that if a king does not remove heresies from his kingdom after the Pope tells him to, and the king is excommunicated but does not fix things within a year, then the king’s subjects are free to stop obeying him.
