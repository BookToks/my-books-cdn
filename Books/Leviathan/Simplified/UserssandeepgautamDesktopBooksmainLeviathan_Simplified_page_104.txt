It's not just a small group of guys coming together that makes them safe. Because if there are only a few people, even a small change in numbers on one side can give a big advantage, enough to win. This actually encourages people to invade.

The number of people needed for safety isn’t a fixed number. It depends on how many enemies you’re worried about. You have enough people when the enemy’s chances aren’t clearly strong enough to make them try to attack.

Even if there are a lot of people, if everyone just does what they think is best for themselves, they won’t be safe. They won’t be protected from enemies or even from each other. When people disagree about how to use their strength, they don’t help each other. Instead, they get in each other’s way and weaken themselves. This makes it easy for a small group that agrees to take over. Also, when there’s no common enemy, people fight each other for their own goals. If we imagine a big group of people all agreeing to follow rules and justice without a common power to keep them in line, then all humans would do the same. In that case, there wouldn’t be any need for government or rules because everyone would live peacefully without being controlled.

It’s also not enough for people to be united just for a short time, like during a battle or a war. Even if they win by working together against an outside enemy, later on, when there’s no common enemy or when some people see someone as a friend and others as an enemy, they will break apart and start fighting each other again.

Some animals, like bees and ants, live together peacefully. Aristotle called them political creatures because they work as a group. But they don’t have speech or other ways to tell each other what’s best for everyone. So, some people might wonder why humans can’t live the same way.
