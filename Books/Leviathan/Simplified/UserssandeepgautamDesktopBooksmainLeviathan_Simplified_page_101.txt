A group of people becomes one person when they are represented by one person, but only if everyone agrees to it. It’s the person who represents the group that makes them one, not the people being represented. The representative acts for the whole group, and there can only be one representative; that’s what makes many into one.

Since a group is naturally many people, they can only be seen as one through their representative’s actions or words. Each person gives the representative permission to act for them, and they accept whatever the representative does if they give full authority. If they limit what the representative can do, then the representative can only act within those limits.

If the representative is made up of many people, the opinion of the larger group counts as the opinion of everyone. For example, if the smaller group says yes and the bigger group says no, the no votes cancel out the yes votes. So, the representative only has the power of the majority opinion.

If the group has an even number of people and the votes are tied, the group can’t make a decision and becomes stuck. But in some cases, a tie can mean a decision, like not condemning someone means they are forgiven, even if it’s just because the votes are equal. However, not forgiving doesn’t mean condemning.

When deciding if something should happen now or later, if the votes are tied, not doing it now is the same as deciding to wait.

If the group has an odd number of people, like three or more, and any one person can cancel out all the others’ votes by saying no, then this group isn’t a real representative. Because people often have different opinions, such groups can get stuck and be unable to act, especially in important situations like war.

There are two types of people who act for others. The first type is simply someone who owns or accepts the actions done by another person.
