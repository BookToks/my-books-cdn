Sometimes people swear by their kings because they are scared or want to please them. When they do this, they act like the king deserves special, almost god-like respect. But swearing by God when it’s not needed is disrespectful. Swearing by other things in normal talk isn’t really swearing; it’s just a bad habit from talking too strongly.

An oath doesn’t add anything to a promise. If a promise is good and fair, it’s binding in God’s eyes even without an oath. If the promise is bad or unfair, it’s not binding at all, even if there is an oath.

There is a natural law that says we should give up some rights if keeping them causes problems for everyone’s peace. From this comes another law: people must keep the promises they make. Without keeping promises, promises mean nothing, and everyone would still be fighting for everything.

This law is the source of justice. Before any promises are made, everyone has rights to everything, so nothing can be unfair. But once a promise is made, breaking it is unfair. Injustice means not keeping promises. Anything not unfair is fair.

Because some promises are made where people don’t trust each other, those promises don’t count yet. Real injustice can’t happen until that fear is gone, but when people are in a state of constant fighting, the fear stays. So before we can talk about what’s fair or unfair, there must be a strong power to force people to keep their promises. This power must punish those who break promises more than the reward they get from breaking them. This power also protects what people own after they give up their right to everything. This power doesn’t exist until a government or commonwealth is created.

This matches what schools say about justice: it means always wanting to give everyone what is theirs. Without ownership, there is no injustice. Without a government, there is no ownership, and everyone can take anything. So without a government, nothing is unfair.
