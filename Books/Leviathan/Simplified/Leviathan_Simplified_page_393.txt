The elect are the only people who will really come back to life forever; they are the only ones who will live forever and never die again. They are equal to angels and are called children of God, unlike the reprobate. The reprobate will face a second death after the resurrection, which will last forever. Between the resurrection and this second death, they will suffer punishment and pain. This punishment will continue as long as humans exist, which is forever.

This idea that souls live forever separated from the body is the basis for the belief in purgatory. If eternal life comes only by God’s grace, then life only exists with the body, and people don’t become immortal until the resurrection. Bellarmine uses some Bible stories to support purgatory. For example, David fasted for Saul and Jonathan in 2 Samuel 1:12, and again for Abner in 2 Samuel 3:35. Bellarmine says David fasted to ask God to help them after they died. Since souls exist without bodies, and fasting can’t help souls in heaven or hell, there must be some souls in a third place, which he calls purgatory. But this is a stretch. The fasting and mourning were just ways to honor the dead or express grief. David fasted to honor Saul and Abner, and he stopped fasting when his own child died because he needed to take care of himself.

The other Bible verses Bellarmine uses don’t really prove purgatory either. He uses any verse with words like anger, fire, burning, purging, or cleansing, especially if some church fathers once linked them to purgatory in their sermons. For example, Psalm 37: “O Lord, don’t punish me in your anger or discipline me in your hot displeasure” would mean nothing about purgatory if Augustine hadn’t said that the anger means hell’s fire and the displeasure means purgatory’s fire.
