Only certain people can truly be called martyrs of Christ. St. Peter said that one of the men who had been with Jesus from the time of John’s baptism until Jesus was taken up must be chosen to be a witness of Jesus' resurrection (Acts 1:21-22). This means that to honestly prove Jesus rose from the dead, the person must have been one of Jesus’ original followers who saw Him before and after His resurrection. People who weren’t there can only share what others told them, so they are just secondhand witnesses, or martyrs of the martyrs.

Someone who opposes the government just to defend any belief they made up from the stories about Jesus or the teachings of the Apostles is not really a martyr of Christ or even of the original martyrs. There is only one belief worth dying for, and that is that Jesus is the Christ—the one who saved us and will come back to give us eternal life. Dying for other ideas that only serve church leaders’ ambitions or profits is not needed. Also, being a martyr means being a witness—someone who tells the truth about Jesus—whether or not they are killed for it.

If a person decides on their own to preach this important belief without being sent to do so, they might be a witness or martyr in a way, but they are not required to die for it because they weren’t called to preach. They shouldn’t complain if they don’t get rewards from those who never asked them to work for this mission. So, no one can be a true martyr unless they have been authorized to preach about Christ coming in the flesh—that means being sent to help those who don’t believe yet. Nobody is a witness to someone who already believes, only to those who doubt, deny, or never heard about Jesus. Christ sent His Apostles and seventy Disciples with the power to preach, but He did not send everyone who believed.
