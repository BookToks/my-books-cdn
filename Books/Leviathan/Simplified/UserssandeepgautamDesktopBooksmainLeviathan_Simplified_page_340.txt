It is clear that bigger responsibilities, like leading the Church, are meant to help with smaller duties. That’s why Christian kings usually don’t baptize people, and why today, only a few people are baptized by bishops, and even fewer by the Pope.

Now, about the laying on of hands—whether it’s needed for a king to baptize and bless someone—we can think about it like this.

Laying on of hands was an old public tradition among the Jews. It showed clearly who or what was being blessed, prayed for, or set apart. For example, Jacob placed his right hand on Ephraim, the younger son, and his left hand on Manasseh, the firstborn, to show who would get the bigger blessing. Also, when Aaron made burnt offerings, he was told to put his hands on the heads of the bull and the ram. This is mentioned several times in the Bible.

Similarly, when Moses made Joshua the leader of the Israelites, he laid his hands on him to show everyone who was in charge during battles. When the Levites were chosen for God’s service, the Israelites laid hands on them. Even when someone blasphemed God, those who heard it were told to lay hands on that person’s head before the whole group punished him. This was so everyone knew exactly who was guilty, and it was clearer to point with hands than just say a name.

This tradition was so important that when Aaron blessed the whole group at once, he couldn’t lay hands on each person, so he raised his hand toward them instead. We also read that in other religions, priests laid hands on parts of temples while saying special words to make the temple holy.
