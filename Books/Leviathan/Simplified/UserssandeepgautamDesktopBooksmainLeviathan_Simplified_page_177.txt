At Mount Sinai, Moses went up to God, but the people were not allowed to come near, or they would die. Still, they had to follow everything Moses told them as God’s law. They said, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but don’t let God speak to us, or we will die.” This shows that in a country, if a person doesn’t have a clear message from God for themselves, they must obey the country’s laws. 

If everyone made up their own ideas of what God said, no two people would agree on the rules. Then, people would ignore the country’s laws. So, as long as the laws don’t go against basic moral rules (the law of nature), everyone must obey the laws that the country says are God’s laws. This makes sense because anything not against nature’s law can be made a law by those in charge. People should follow these laws, especially when they are said to come from God. 

No one is allowed to claim other commands from God than those declared by the country. Christian countries punish people who reject the Christian religion; other countries punish those who start forbidden religions. If something isn’t controlled by the country, it is fair (which is based on natural law and God’s eternal law) that everyone enjoys their freedom equally.

There is also a difference between fundamental laws and other laws, but I have never seen a clear explanation of what a fundamental law means. Still, it’s reasonable to make this difference.

A fundamental law is one that, if removed, causes the country to fail and fall apart, like a building losing its foundation. So, a fundamental law is one that makes people support the authority of the ruler or government, whether it is a king or a group. Without these laws, the country cannot survive. Examples include the power to make war and peace, judge cases, choose leaders, and do whatever is needed for the public good. 

Laws that are not fundamental are those that can be removed without breaking the country, like laws about arguments between citizens.
