Again, Jesus told his Apostles and followers to share the news about his kingdom, which wasn’t here yet but would come in the future. They were to teach all people and baptize those who believed. They were to enter the homes of those who welcomed them, but if people didn’t accept them, they were to leave without causing trouble. They were not supposed to call down fire from heaven or force anyone to obey by using violence. Their power came from convincing people, not from forcing them. Jesus sent them out like sheep among wolves, not like kings ruling over subjects. They weren’t allowed to make laws but had to follow existing laws and teach others to do the same. Because of this, their writings couldn’t become official rules without the support of the government.

So, the New Testament is only considered law where the government says it is. Even the king or ruler makes these rules for themselves, following God and Jesus directly, just like the Apostles did, not because any teacher or Apostle told them to.

What made the New Testament seem like law during times of persecution were the decisions made by early Christian leaders in their meetings. For example, in the Bible, the council of Apostles and elders said, “It seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things” (Acts 15:28). This kind of language shows they thought they had the power to require those who believed in their teachings to follow certain rules. So, their decisions acted like laws for early Christians. But these were not much different from other teachings like “Repent,” “Be baptized,” “Keep the Commandments,” “Believe the Gospel,” “Come to me,” “Sell all you have,” “Give to the poor,” and “Follow me.” These are not commands but invitations to live a Christian life, just like in Isaiah when it says, “Everyone who is thirsty, come to the waters; come, buy wine and milk without money” (Isaiah 55:1).

In the end, the Apostles’ power was just what Jesus gave them: to invite people to accept God’s kingdom, which they knew was not here yet but was coming. And since they didn’t have a kingdom on earth, they couldn’t make laws.
