Leviathan/229 But when we say our understanding is "captivated," it doesn’t mean we just accept someone else’s opinion without thinking. It means our will chooses to obey when we should obey. Our senses, memory, understanding, reason, and opinions are not things we can easily change. They come from what we see, hear, and think about. So, our will depends on these, not the other way around. We "capture" our understanding and reason when we don’t argue, when we speak because someone with real authority tells us to, and when we live by those rules. In short, it means trusting and having faith in the person speaking, even if our mind can’t fully understand the words.

When God speaks to people, it happens either directly or through another person who God has already spoken to directly. How God speaks directly is clear only to those who have experienced it. But it’s very hard, maybe impossible, for others to understand it. If someone tells me God spoke to them in a supernatural way, and I doubt it, I don’t see how they can prove it to me. If that person is my ruler, they can make me obey and not say I don’t believe them, but they can’t force me to think differently from what my reason tells me. If someone without that power claims God spoke to them, nobody has to believe or obey them.

Saying God spoke to someone through the Bible means God spoke through prophets, apostles, or the Church, just like He does to all Christians. Saying God spoke to someone in a dream just means they dreamed God spoke to them. This doesn’t make others believe it because most dreams come from normal thoughts or feelings. Sometimes people think God talks to them because they feel proud or think they deserve special attention. Saying someone saw a vision or heard a voice usually means they were half asleep and confused a dream for reality. Saying someone speaks by supernatural inspiration often means they just feel a strong urge to talk or have a high opinion of themselves, without any real reason.
