First, I will think about human thoughts one by one, and then how they connect to each other. Each thought is like a picture or idea of some quality or feature of something outside us, which we usually call an object. This object affects our eyes, ears, and other parts of our body in different ways, making us see or hear different things.

All thoughts start from what we call sense. There is no idea in a personâ€™s mind that did not first come from our senses, either completely or partly. All other thoughts come from these original senses.

It is not very important right now to know exactly how sense works in nature, and I have written about that in detail somewhere else.

But to keep my explanation complete, I will quickly explain it here.

Sense happens because something outside our body pushes on the right part of the body for each sense. This happens directly for taste and touch, or through something else for seeing, hearing, and smelling. This push goes through nerves and other body parts to the brain and heart, causing them to push back. This push-back feels like something outside us. This feeling is what people call sense.

For example, the eye senses light or color, the ear senses sound, the nose senses smell, the tongue senses taste, and the skin senses heat, cold, hardness, softness, and other things we feel. These qualities exist in the object as different movements of its matter, which push our body parts in different ways.
