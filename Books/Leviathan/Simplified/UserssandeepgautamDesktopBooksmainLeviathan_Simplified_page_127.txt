Here it is confirmed that rulers have the right to control the army and make all legal decisions. This power is as complete as one person can give to another.

King Solomon prayed to God, asking for understanding to judge people and tell good from evil. So, it was the ruler’s job to be the judge and make the rules about what is right and wrong. These rules are laws, which means the ruler has the power to make laws.

Saul wanted to kill David, but when David had the chance to kill Saul, he stopped his men because Saul was God’s chosen leader. For people who serve others, St. Paul says, “Servants obey your masters in everything” and “Children obey your parents in everything.” This means simple obedience is expected from those under authority.

Also, the scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses’ place, so people should do whatever they tell them to do. St. Paul also says people should obey rulers and those in power. This kind of obedience is simple.

Jesus Himself said people should pay the taxes that kings ask for, saying “Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar,” and He paid taxes too. The king’s word is enough to take anything from a person if needed, and the king decides when it’s needed. For example, Jesus, as king of the Jews, told His disciples to take a donkey and its colt for Him, saying, “The Lord needs them.” When people asked why, they accepted it without question.

Also, in Genesis, it says, “You will be like gods, knowing good and evil.” When God asked Adam who told him he was naked and if he ate from the forbidden tree, it showed that knowing good and evil was forbidden as a test of obedience. The devil made the woman want the fruit by saying it would make them like gods, knowing good and evil.
