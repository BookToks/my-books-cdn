It doesn’t make sense to think that a group of people, who ask others to send representatives to share their ideas or wishes, should see those representatives as the only true voice of the people instead of the whole group.

The same idea applies to a monarchy. It’s strange that people don’t notice this more: in a monarchy, the king who has ruled for hundreds of years is called sovereign and respected by everyone, but he is never seen as just a representative of the people. Instead, the word “representative” is used for those who are sent by the people to bring their requests or advice to the king, if he allows it. This shows that true representatives should understand their role and be careful about letting others claim they represent the people.

There are three types of governments, and they don’t differ in power but in how well they keep peace and safety for the people, which is their main goal. When we compare a monarchy to the other two types, we see this: anyone who represents the people also looks out for themselves and their family. Even if they try to do what’s best for everyone, they often put their own interests first because feelings usually win over logic.

So, the public does best when private and public interests are closely linked. In a monarchy, the king’s private interests and the people’s interests are the same. A king’s wealth, power, and honor come from how rich, strong, and respected his people are. No king can be powerful or safe if his people are poor, weak, or divided. But in a democracy or aristocracy, public success doesn’t always help the personal gain of one person, and bad advice, betrayal, or civil war can cause big problems.
