Stephen. But what good have those schools really done? What useful knowledge do people get today from their reading and arguing? The geometry we have, which is the base of all natural science, didn’t come from those schools. Plato, the best Greek philosopher, didn’t let anyone into his school unless they already knew some geometry.

Many people studied geometry and helped mankind a lot, but there is no record of their schools or groups, and they weren’t called philosophers back then. The natural philosophy taught in those schools was more like a dream than real science, using confusing language. You can’t teach philosophy well without first knowing a lot about geometry. Nature works through movement, and to understand this, you need to know about lines and shapes.

Their moral philosophy was just a description of their own feelings. Without a government, the law of nature is the rule for behavior. Civil law decides what is honest or dishonest, just or unjust, good or bad.

But those philosophers made rules about right and wrong based on what they liked or didn’t like. Because everyone has different tastes, no one agrees on anything, and people do whatever they want, which can destroy society.

Their logic, which should help with clear thinking, is just tricks with words meant to confuse people trying to question them. In the end, there’s nothing so silly that old philosophers, like Cicero, didn’t support. I think Aristotle’s Metaphysics has some of the most ridiculous ideas about natural philosophy, his Politics has ideas that go against good government, and much of his Ethics shows ignorance.

The Jewish school was originally about teaching the law of Moses. He said that every seventh year, during the Feast of Tabernacles, the law should be read to everyone so they could hear and learn it. So, reading the law every Sabbath was meant to help people know the Commandments they had to follow and understand the writings of the prophets.
