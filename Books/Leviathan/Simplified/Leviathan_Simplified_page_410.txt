Besides worshiping images like idols, there is also a kind of fake worship that’s still wrong but not exactly idolatry. Idolatry means truly honoring something inside, but fake worship is just pretending. Sometimes people do this because they are scared of dying or getting punished. Even if they hate the idol inside, it’s still a sin if they do this and other people look up to them, because their actions can make others mess up in their faith. But if someone nobody respects does it, it doesn’t really affect others.

If a pastor or someone smart in religion shows respect to an idol out of fear, and doesn’t clearly show that they don’t agree with it, they cause confusion for others. People might think it’s okay to worship idols because of their example, which is wrong and a sin. But if a regular person without much knowledge does the same and someone else follows them, that’s not really their fault because people shouldn’t follow someone who isn’t a good example. 

If a person who doesn’t know much is forced by an evil king to worship an idol or die, they secretly hate the idol in their heart, and that’s better. But if a pastor, who is supposed to teach God’s truth, does the same, it’s not just a sin but also a betrayal of his duties.

To sum up, anyone who truly worships an image or any created thing, or thinks it hears their prayers, is committing idolatry. Someone who only pretends to worship out of fear, but is a respected example, is sinning too. But worshiping God in a place or before an image chosen by God, like the Jews did with the cherubim or the brazen serpent for a time, is not idolatry.
