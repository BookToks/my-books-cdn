Peter and the other Apostles are supposed to be judges of the world.

The first mistake in this argument is that it says all members of a country, like parts of a body, depend on each other. It’s true they stick together, but they really depend only on the leader, who is like the soul of the country. If the leader fails, the country falls apart into chaos, because no one trusts or follows each other without a common leader. Just like a body falls apart without a soul to hold it together. So, this doesn’t prove that regular people must depend on church leaders, or that government officials must depend on religious ones. Instead, both depend on the civil leader, who should guide the country in a way that helps people’s souls. But this leader answers only to God. This shows that the first argument is tricky and tries to confuse people who don’t understand the difference between following steps to reach a goal and being controlled by another person. For every goal, the steps are set by nature or God, but the power to make people follow these steps is given by each country’s laws, which say people must keep their promises to their civil leaders.

The second argument says: “Every country, since it is complete and strong by itself, can tell another country that is not under it what to do. It can even remove their ruler and put someone else in charge if it needs to protect itself from harm. So, a church power can also tell a government to change how it runs things, and remove rulers if they don’t protect the church’s interests.” It’s true that a country can do what’s needed to protect itself, including what was said here, and this has already been explained earlier.
