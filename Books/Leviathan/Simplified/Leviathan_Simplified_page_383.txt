The Egyptian magicians, who are said to have turned their rods into snakes and water into blood, probably just tricked people’s eyes with fake shows. Still, people called them wizards.

But what if their rods didn’t look like snakes at all, and the water didn’t look like blood or anything else but water? What if they just lied and said their rods were snakes and water was blood? That would be both magic and lying.

Priests today do something similar. They use special words like a magic spell, but nothing really changes in what you see or feel. Yet, they tell us that the bread actually turns into a man, even a God, and they want people to worship it like it’s Jesus himself. This is a big kind of idol worship.

If it’s okay to say the bread is really God and not just bread, then why wouldn’t it be okay for the Egyptians to say the vegetables they worshipped were really gods? When priests say, “This is my body,” it really means, “This represents my body,” which is just a common way of speaking. Taking it literally is wrong, and even then, it only applies to the bread Jesus blessed with his own hands.

Jesus never said that any priest could say “This is my body” over any bread and have it actually change. The Catholic Church didn’t officially accept this idea of bread turning into Jesus until about 500 years ago, under Pope Innocent the Third. That was when Popes had a lot of power, and people were confused, especially because the bread had a picture of Jesus on the cross. It seemed like they were supposed to believe the bread changed not just into Jesus’ body but also into the wood of the cross, and that they were eating both.

A similar kind of magic trick happens in baptism, where saying God’s name and making the sign of the cross over and over acts like a spell.
