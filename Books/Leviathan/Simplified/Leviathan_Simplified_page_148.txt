When a king is a child, someone he trusts, like a protector or regent, can be put in charge of running the whole kingdom until the king is old enough. Everyone has to obey this person, but only if their orders are given in the king’s name and don’t go against the king’s power.

Sometimes, only part of the kingdom, like a province, is given to a governor or viceroy to control. People in that area must obey them as long as they act in the name of the king or ruler and don’t go against the ruler’s rights. These protectors and governors only have power because the ruler allows it, and they can’t take over the ruler’s power unless it’s clearly said so. These leaders are like the nerves and muscles that move different parts of a body.

Other officials have special jobs. For example, some manage money for the kingdom, like taxes, rents, or fines. These people are public ministers because they serve the ruler and can only act with the ruler’s permission.

There are also those who take care of the army and defense. They look after weapons, forts, and soldiers, and make sure everything needed for war is ready. A soldier who doesn’t have a command doesn’t represent the kingdom by themselves, because only those in charge represent it to others.

Some officials teach people about their duties to the ruler and explain what is right and wrong. This helps people live peacefully, follow the law, and protect the kingdom from enemies. These teachers are public ministers because they only teach with the ruler’s permission.

Only the king or ruling group has God’s direct authority to teach and guide the people. No one else gets their power directly from God. Instead, others get their power from God through the king or ruler, meaning their authority comes from both God and the ruler’s approval.
