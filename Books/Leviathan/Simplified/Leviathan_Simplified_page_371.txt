The third argument comes from parts of the Bible that say having faith to be saved is easy. If you had to fully agree with every Christian belief, many of which are debated, then being a Christian would be the hardest thing in the world.

The thief on the cross, even though he was sorry for his sins, couldn’t have been saved by just saying, “Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” He didn’t say he believed in everything else, just that Jesus was the King. It wouldn’t make sense to say, like in Matthew 11:30, that “Christ’s yoke is easy, and his burden is light,” or that “little children believe in him,” if you needed to believe in many difficult things to be saved. St. Paul even said in 1 Corinthians 1:21, “God saves those who believe, even if the preaching seems foolish.” St. Paul himself was saved and became a great teacher without knowing about complicated ideas like transubstantiation or purgatory, which were taught later.

The fourth argument comes from clear Bible verses that everyone agrees on. For example, in John 5:39, Jesus says, “Search the Scriptures, because you think they give eternal life, and they point to me.” Here, Jesus was talking about the Old Testament, since the New Testament wasn’t written yet. The Old Testament doesn’t explain everything about Jesus, but it shows signs to recognize him when he came, like being born in Bethlehem and doing miracles. So, just believing that Jesus is the one who fits those signs is enough for eternal life. You don’t need to believe anything more.

Also, in John 11:26, Jesus says, “Whoever lives and believes in me will never die.” So, believing in Jesus is enough faith to have eternal life, and nothing else is needed.

Believing in Jesus and believing that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah) is the same thing. This is clear in the next verses where Jesus asks Martha, “Do you believe this?” and she replies, “Yes, Lord, I believe you are the Christ, the Son of God.” So, just believing this one thing is enough for eternal life, and you don’t need to believe anything more. In John 20:31, it says, “These things are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and by believing you may have life through his name.”
