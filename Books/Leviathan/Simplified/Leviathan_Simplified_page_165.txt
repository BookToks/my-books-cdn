If an unwritten rule is followed everywhere in a country and no one uses it unfairly, then that rule must be a natural law that applies to all people.

All laws, whether written down or not, get their power from the government. In a monarchy, that means the king or queen, and in other governments, it means the group in charge. Some lawyers say that the power to make laws comes from private people or lower judges, but that can be confusing.

For example, some say that only Parliament can control common law. This is true only if Parliament has all the power and can meet or stop meeting whenever they want. If someone else can stop Parliament, they can also control it. If no one else has that power, then the real controller is the king working with Parliament. Even if Parliament gathers many smart people, that doesn’t mean they automatically get the power to make laws. Also, some say a country’s power is split between force (like the army) and justice (like the courts), but force should always be controlled by justice.

Law can never go against reason, all lawyers agree on that. But the question is, whose reason should count? It’s not anyone’s personal opinion, because then laws would always conflict like in school debates. Nor is it just the opinion of experts who have studied a lot, because even they can be wrong. People who study the law can disagree, and build wrong ideas on wrong ideas. So, it’s not the judges’ wisdom that makes the law, but the reason of the whole country acting as one person through its representatives. Since the country speaks as one, laws don’t usually conflict, and if they do, this same reason can fix or change them.
