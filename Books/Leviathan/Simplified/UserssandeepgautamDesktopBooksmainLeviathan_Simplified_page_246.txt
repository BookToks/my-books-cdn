The word "angel" usually means a messenger, mostly a messenger from God. A messenger from God means anything that shows His special presence, like His power appearing in a dream or vision.

The Bible doesn’t say anything about how angels were made. It often says angels are spirits, but the word "spirit" can mean different things. Sometimes it means things like air or wind, or the life force in animals. Other times, it means images we see in dreams or visions, which aren’t real things and only last as long as the dream or vision. These images aren’t real things but just tricks of the brain. However, when God makes these images appear for a special reason, they are called His messengers, or angels.

People who didn’t follow God often thought these images were real and permanent beings, not just tricks of the brain. They called them demons, both good and bad. Since they couldn’t touch them, they thought these beings were invisible or without bodies. The Jewish people also believed this, except for one group called the Sadducees. They thought these images were real creatures made by God. They believed good ones were angels of God, and bad ones were evil spirits, like the spirit of Python or the spirits of people who were sick or crazy. People with mental illnesses were often thought to be controlled by these evil spirits.

If we look at the Bible, most times when angels are mentioned, it means a special image made in the mind by God to show He is present and doing something supernatural. So, when the Bible doesn’t explain what angels are, we can understand them this way.

For example, the same image is sometimes called an angel and sometimes called God. When the "angel of the Lord" talks to Hagar in the Bible, saying "I will multiply your children a lot" (Genesis 16:7,10), it’s like God Himself is speaking through that angel.
