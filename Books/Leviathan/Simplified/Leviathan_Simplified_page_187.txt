If a person does something wrong and others have been punished for the same thing before, it’s a bigger deal than if many people got away with it. This is because when the ruler lets some people off, it gives others hope they can also get away with it. The ruler partly shares the blame if they encourage people to break the rules by not punishing them.

A crime done in a sudden moment of anger isn’t as bad as one planned out carefully. When someone acts in the heat of the moment, it shows a weakness in human nature. But if someone thinks about the crime first, knowing the law and punishment, then chooses to do it anyway, it’s worse. Still, getting angry suddenly doesn’t excuse the crime completely because from the time they learn the law until they act, they should control their feelings.

If the law is clearly explained and shared with everyone, breaking it is worse than if people don’t know the law well and have a hard time finding out what it says. When people aren’t taught the law, part of the blame goes to the fact that they’re confused or busy. But when the law is clear and people ignore it, it shows they are careless and disrespect the ruler’s power.

Sometimes the law says one thing is illegal, but the ruler’s actions show they don’t really mind. In these cases, the crime is less serious than when both the law and the ruler clearly say it’s wrong. This is because there are two confusing messages, and if people only follow the law’s words, they might get punished for doing what the ruler actually expects. For example, dueling is illegal and punished by death, but refusing to duel can bring shame or lose favor with the ruler. So if someone duels to keep their honor or job, they shouldn’t be punished too harshly. This doesn’t mean people should take private revenge or break rules, but rulers should be careful not to encourage things they officially say are wrong.
