All the languages that Adam and his descendants created were lost again at the tower of Babel. God punished everyone for their rebellion by making them forget their old language. Because of this, people had to spread out into different parts of the world. Over time, new languages slowly developed from these groups, and they became more complex everywhere.

The main purpose of speaking is to turn our thoughts into words. We do this for two reasons. First, to remember what we are thinking because thoughts can easily be forgotten. Words help us keep track of our ideas like notes. So, the first job of names is to help us remember things. Second, many people use the same words to share what they think or feel, like what they want or fear. For this reason, words are called signs.

There are special uses of speech. First, to explain the cause and effect of things we understand, which helps us learn new skills. Second, to share what we know with others, so we can teach and advise each other. Third, to tell others what we want or plan, so we can help each other. Fourth, to enjoy playing with words for fun or beauty.

There are also four ways people misuse speech. First, when they use words incorrectly and end up misunderstanding their own thoughts. Second, when they use words in a different way than they are meant to, tricking others. Third, when they say things they don’t really mean. Fourth, when they use words to hurt others. Since animals have teeth, horns, or hands to hurt enemies, it’s wrong for people to hurt others with words—unless it’s to correct someone we need to guide. Then it’s not to hurt but to help them improve.
