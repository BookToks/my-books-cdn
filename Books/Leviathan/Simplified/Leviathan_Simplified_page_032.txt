Imagination is the first step inside us that starts all voluntary actions like walking or talking because these actions always begin with a thought about where to go or what to do.

Even if people don’t notice small movements inside their bodies, these tiny motions still happen before bigger actions like walking or speaking. These small beginnings of motion are called “endeavour.”

When this endeavour is toward something that causes it, it’s called appetite or desire. Desire is a general word, while appetite often means wanting food, like hunger or thirst. When the endeavour is away from something, it’s called aversion. These words come from Latin and mean moving closer or moving away. Nature often makes people accept simple truths, but sometimes when they try to think beyond Nature, they get confused. Some scholars say that just wanting to move isn’t real motion, but that’s wrong because motion and bodies can’t be just a metaphor.

When people want something, we say they love it, and when they want to avoid something, we say they hate it. Desire and love mean the same, but desire means the thing isn’t there, while love means the thing is present. Similarly, aversion means the thing isn’t there, and hate means it is.

Some desires and dislikes are born with people, like wanting food or needing to get rid of waste, which can also be seen as aversions because of how we feel in our bodies. Most other desires come from experience and learning what things do to us or others. If we don’t know or believe something exists, we can only want to try or taste it to learn about it.
