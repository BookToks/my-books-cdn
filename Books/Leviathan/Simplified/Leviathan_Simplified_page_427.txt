When people don’t like the leaders in a democracy or aristocracy, they shouldn’t just use mean names to show their anger. Instead, they call the system anarchy, oligarchy, or tyranny, depending on what they don’t like. What really bothers people is that they aren’t ruled the way they want, but how the leaders decide is best. This kind of rule feels unfair, so people give bad names to their rulers without realizing that without this kind of control, there would be constant fighting. It’s not words or promises that keep laws strong, but people with power and weapons.

Another mistake in politics is thinking that laws should rule, not people. Any person, even if they can’t read or write, knows they have to follow rules because breaking them can hurt them. No one believes that just words or papers can punish someone without people to enforce them. This wrong idea makes people think it’s okay to fight their rulers whenever they don’t like them, and sometimes religious leaders even encourage this.

There’s also a bad idea that laws should control not just what people do, but what they think and believe. This means people can be forced to say things they don’t believe or punished for telling the truth about their thoughts. It’s okay for leaders to ask teachers if they agree with certain ideas before letting them teach, but forcing someone to admit to beliefs they don’t act on is against natural law. This is especially true for those who teach that people will suffer forever if they believe the wrong thing about religion. Who wouldn’t want to decide for themselves what to believe, since their soul’s fate depends on it?
