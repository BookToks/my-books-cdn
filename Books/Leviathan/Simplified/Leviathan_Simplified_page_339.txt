The king, and every other ruler, acts as the highest leader under God’s authority, meaning they rule because God gave them the right to do so. That’s why only kings can call themselves “By the grace of God, King,” showing they answer only to God. Bishops should say at the start of their job, “By the favor of the King, Bishop of this area,” or as government officials, “In His Majesty’s name.” If they say “By divine providence” or “By the grace of God,” they are acting like they don’t get their power from the government, which goes against keeping the country united and strong.

If every Christian ruler is the top religious leader for their people, it seems they should have the power not only to preach—which most people agree with—but also to baptize, give communion, and bless churches and religious leaders. Many people disagree because kings don’t usually do these things. Also, these religious duties usually require laying hands on people, a tradition passed down from the Apostles to officially give someone that role. To prove kings can baptize and bless, I will explain why they don’t usually do it and how they can do it even without the laying on of hands.

There’s no doubt that if a king was smart in a certain subject, he could teach it himself, just like he lets others teach in universities. But since running the whole country takes all his time, it’s not practical for him to do that. A king can also personally judge any case if he wants, or let others judge for him. But because he must always lead and govern, he has to give these tasks to others. Similarly, Jesus had the power to baptize but didn’t do it himself; instead, he sent his Apostles and followers to do it. St. Paul also baptized very few people because he was busy preaching in many places—he only baptized Crispus, Gaius, and Stephanas in Corinth—because his main job was to preach.
