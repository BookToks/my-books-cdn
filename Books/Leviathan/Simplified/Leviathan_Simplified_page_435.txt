After this, the Presbyterians in England managed to get rid of Episcopacy, so the second problem was solved. Almost at the same time, the Presbyterians also lost their power. This left us with the independence of the early Christians, who followed leaders like Paul, Cephas, or Apollos—each person choosing who they wanted to follow.

If this happens without fighting and without judging Christ’s teachings based on how much we like the minister (which the Apostle criticized in the Corinthians), it might be the best way. First, because no one should control what people believe except the word of God itself, which works faith in each person. This faith doesn’t always depend on the efforts of those who teach, but on God who makes it grow. Second, it’s unfair for teachers who say even small mistakes are dangerous to expect a reasonable person to follow someone else’s opinion blindly, or the opinions of many others, which is like gambling with their salvation.

Those teachers shouldn’t be upset about losing their old authority because they know better than anyone that power stays only if it’s earned and kept by wisdom, humility, clear teaching, and honest living. It doesn’t come from hiding natural knowledge, confusing language, pretending to know more than they do, using fake piety, or other faults that not only are wrong but also cause people to lose respect and trip up their faith.

After people accepted the idea that the Church on earth is the kingdom of God mentioned in the Bible, the ambition to get church jobs and especially the top job of being Christ’s representative grew a lot. This made people lose respect for pastors. So much that even the smartest leaders only needed their rulers’ orders to stop obeying church leaders.

From the time the Bishop of Rome was accepted as the universal bishop by claiming to succeed St. Peter, their whole church system, or “kingdom of darkness,” could be compared to the kingdom of fairies. This is like the old English stories about ghosts and spirits playing tricks at night.
