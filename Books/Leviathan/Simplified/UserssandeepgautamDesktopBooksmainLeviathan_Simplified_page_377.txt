But what kind of unreasonable king would, knowing he has a subject who is waiting for Jesus to come back after the world ends and plans to obey Him (which is what believing in Jesus means), still expect that person to obey the king’s laws? All Christians believe they should follow the laws of the king, but would the king really want to hurt or punish someone like that?

This is enough to say about the kingdom of God and church rules. I am not trying to make my own ideas here, just to show what I think follows from Christian politics (which means the Bible) to support the power of rulers and the duty of people to obey them. When I use the Bible, I try to avoid verses that are hard to understand or cause arguments, and I only use those that are clear and fit with the overall message of the Bible, which was written to bring back God’s kingdom through Jesus.

The true meaning of any writing comes from what the writer is trying to say, not just the exact words. People who focus on single Bible verses without thinking about the whole purpose don’t understand the message clearly. Instead, by throwing out small pieces of Scripture without care, they make things more confusing on purpose, which is something people do when they want to trick others, not find the truth.
