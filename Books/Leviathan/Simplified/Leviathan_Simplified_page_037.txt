No one laughs at old jokes or cries over old troubles.

Feeling sad because you find out you’re not good at something is shame. It’s like blushing because you think you’ve done something embarrassing. For young people, it shows they care about having a good reputation, which is a good thing. For older people, it means the same, but it’s not as good because it comes too late.

Ignoring the importance of a good reputation is called being rude or shameless.

Feeling sad when someone else has a problem is called pity. It happens because we imagine the same bad thing could happen to us. That’s why it’s also called compassion or “fellow-feeling.” People feel less pity when the problem is caused by someone’s bad behavior. Also, those who think they won’t face the same problem feel the least pity.

Not caring about other people’s problems is called cruelty. It happens because people feel safe and secure in their own lives. I don’t think anyone enjoys seeing others suffer without a reason.

Feeling upset when someone else does better than you in money, fame, or other good things can be two things. If it makes you want to work harder and be better, it’s called emulation. But if it makes you want to stop or hurt that person, it’s called envy.

When a person’s feelings about something keep changing—sometimes wanting it, sometimes not; sometimes hoping to do it, sometimes afraid—it’s called deliberation. This happens when we think about the good and bad results of doing or not doing something until we either do it or decide it’s impossible.

We don’t deliberate about things that already happened because they can’t be changed. We also don’t deliberate about things we know are impossible because it would be pointless. But sometimes we think something is possible when it’s really not, and we still deliberate. Deliberation means deciding what to do based on what we want or don’t want.

Animals have these changing feelings too, so they also deliberate in their own way.
