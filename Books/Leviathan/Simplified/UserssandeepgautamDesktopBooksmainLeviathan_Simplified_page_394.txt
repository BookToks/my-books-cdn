Thomas Hobbes talks about purgatory by looking at Psalm 66:12, which says, “We went through fire and water, and you brought us to a safe place.” Back then, religious teachers used verses like this to make their sermons longer or more interesting by using clever ideas.

But Hobbes also mentions other Bible parts from the New Testament that are harder to explain. One example is from Matthew 12:32: “Whoever speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this life or in the life to come.” Some people think “the life to come” means purgatory, a place where certain sins might be forgiven after death. But the Bible talks about only three worlds: the old world before the flood, which was destroyed by water; the current world, which will be destroyed by fire; and the world to come, which lasts forever and, everyone agrees, has no purgatory. So, purgatory and “the world to come” don’t fit together.

So what do Jesus’ words really mean? It’s hard to fully understand, and it’s okay to admit that the Bible can be really deep and confusing sometimes. Hobbes suggests that more knowledgeable religious experts should think about this. One idea is that speaking against the Holy Spirit means speaking against the Church, since the Holy Spirit lives there. The comparison might be between how patient Jesus was when he was alive and how strict Church leaders have been since then.

It’s like saying: people who deny Jesus or even hurt him will be forgiven if they truly repent. But if you refuse to accept the authority of Church leaders who speak for the Holy Spirit, they won’t forgive you. Instead, they will punish you in this life and leave you without forgiveness, even if you try to repent later. So, these words might be a warning about what would happen in the future to those who reject Church authority.

Or, if that’s not the right explanation, maybe after the resurrection, some sinners will still have a chance to repent. Hobbes doesn’t claim to have all the answers, especially about such tricky topics.
