The right of colonies, while keeping their honor and connection with their home country, completely depends on the permission or letters their ruler gives them to start a colony.

XXV: About Advice

It’s tricky to understand things just by the usual way words are used. This is clear when people get confused between advice and commands because both can sound very similar. The phrase “do this” can come from someone ordering, advising, or encouraging. Most people can tell the difference by knowing who is speaking, who they are talking to, and why. But when reading, some people mix up advice with commands or the other way around, depending on what they want to believe or approve.

To clear this up, I explain the difference between commanding, advising, and encouraging.

A command is when someone says, “Do this,” or “Don’t do this,” expecting you to obey just because they said so. The person giving the command wants something for themselves because commands are based on their own will and benefit.

Advice is when someone says, “Do this,” or “Don’t do this,” and gives reasons based on what’s good for the person they’re talking to. So, the one giving advice wants what’s best for the other person, even if they have different intentions.

The main difference is that commands focus on the benefit of the person giving them, while advice focuses on the benefit of the person receiving it. Also, a person must follow commands if they have agreed to obey, but they don’t have to follow advice because the consequences affect only themselves. And if they agree to follow advice, it then becomes like a command.
