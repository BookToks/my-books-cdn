Now it’s clear that the government and the country’s power are the same thing. When one group has the highest power and can make rules and give special permissions, that means there is one government.  

If one group is the boss, and another group is also the boss and can make their own rules, then there are two governments for the same people. This splits the country and it can’t work properly. Even if they say one is for everyday life and the other is for religious things, they are still two separate governments, and everyone has to listen to both.  

Since the religious group says what is a sin, they are also saying what is against the law. At the same time, the government says what is law. So people end up having to obey two bosses who both want their rules followed, which is impossible.  

If it’s really just one government, then either the government has to listen to the religious group, making the religious group the real boss, or the religious group has to listen to the government, making the government the real boss.  

When these two groups fight, the country is in danger of civil war and falling apart. The government is easier to see and understand, so many people support it. The religious group might use confusing ideas and scary stories, but because people fear the unknown, they also have enough followers to cause problems and sometimes even destroy the country.  

This problem is like epilepsy, a sickness where a person’s body moves uncontrollably because the brain is not working right. The person might fall into dangerous places without knowing it.  

Similarly, when the religious group controls people by fear and promises instead of the government’s fair rules, and confuses them with difficult words, it messes up the country. This can either crush the people with too much control or start a civil war.
