The people who have the power to make legal decisions are public officials. When they make judgments, they act as if they are the ruler. This is because all legal authority is connected to the ruler’s power. So, all other judges are just helpers of the ruler or those with the ruler’s power. There are two types of disagreements: about facts and about the law. Judges can decide on either facts or law. So, in one case, there might be two judges—one for facts and one for the law.  

Sometimes, a problem can come up between the person being judged and the judge. Since both are under the ruler’s power, it’s fair that the dispute should be settled by people both sides agree on. Nobody should judge their own case. But the ruler is already chosen by both sides to be the final judge. The ruler can either decide the case personally or pick a judge both sides agree on.  

This agreement happens in different ways. First, the person being judged can reject any judges who seem biased against them (the person who complains already picked their judge). The judges not rejected are the ones the person agrees with. Second, if the person appeals to another judge, they can’t appeal again because their appeal is their choice. Third, if the person appeals to the ruler, and the ruler or their chosen helpers decide, that decision is final. This means the person is judged by the judges they chose themselves.  

Thinking about all this, I have to say that the court system in England is really well set up. There are two types of courts: common courts, where both people involved are regular citizens, and public courts, where the ruler is the one making the complaint. In the past, there were two groups of people: lords and commoners. The lords had a special right to have only other lords judge them in serious crimes. They could choose as many lords as wanted to be judges. This was seen as a special privilege because the lords got to pick their own judges.
