Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world.” But someone who can’t listen to and decide problems between people can’t really have authority. Still, this didn’t stop Jesus from giving people the power to preach and baptize everywhere, as long as their own rulers didn’t forbid it. Jesus and his Apostles also told us to obey our own rulers in everything.

Some people try to say that bishops get their authority from the Pope, but this doesn’t work because the Pope has no authority in other rulers’ lands. However, these arguments do show that bishops get their authority from their own civil rulers when they have it, so I will explain these points.

The first example is from the Bible, Numbers 11. Moses was having a hard time leading the people of Israel by himself, so God told him to pick seventy elders to help. God shared part of Moses’ spirit with them. This doesn’t mean Moses became weaker, but that the elders got their authority from him. Since Moses was the ruler of Israel, this means the elders’ power came from the ruler. So, this shows that bishops in Christian countries get their authority from their civil rulers, and the Pope only has authority in his own land.

The second point is about monarchy, where all power belongs to one person and others get their power from him. The Church’s government is also like this monarchy. This supports Christian rulers because they really are the leaders of their own people and their own Church. The Pope’s power, even if he were St. Peter, is not like a king’s power. It is only teaching authority. God wants people to obey willingly, not because they are forced.
