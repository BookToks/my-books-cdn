Here are some reasons why people make silly or confusing statements.

2. First, they mix up the names of things and their qualities. For example, some say faith is “put into” or “breathed into” someone, but only physical stuff can be poured or breathed in. Also, they say things like “phantasms are spirits,” which is confusing.

3. Second, they confuse the qualities of things outside us with qualities inside our own bodies. Like saying color is inside an object, or sound is inside the air, when it’s really about how we see or hear them.

4. Third, they use the names of real things to talk about ideas or words. For example, saying “a living creature” is a general kind of thing, like a group or category.

5. Fourth, they give the names of qualities to words or ideas. For example, saying the nature of something is just its definition, or that a person’s order is the same as their will.

6. Fifth, they use metaphors or figures of speech instead of clear words. Like saying “the road goes this way” or “the proverb says,” even though roads don’t move and proverbs don’t talk. These are okay in normal talk, but not when you really want to be accurate.

7. Sixth, they use fancy, confusing words from schools that don’t really mean anything clear, like “hypostatical,” “transubstantiate,” or “eternal-now.”

If someone can avoid these mistakes, it’s hard for them to say something really wrong, unless they forget what they were thinking about. Everyone can reason well if they start with good ideas. For example, no one is so dumb that they keep making the same math mistake after someone shows them the error.

This shows that reason isn’t something we’re born with like our senses or memory, and it’s not just learned from experience like common sense. Instead, we get reason by working at it: first by using names carefully, then by learning a good way to connect ideas step by step. This leads to understanding all the results that come from those ideas, and that’s what people call science.
