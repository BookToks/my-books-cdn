Even if God, when people pray, helps some who haven’t heard about Christ to believe in Him, and those people haven’t rejected Christ, and people’s kindness can’t be blamed for this, it still doesn’t prove purgatory is real. Because coming back to life after death is one thing; coming back from purgatory to life is different—it’s like going from a life of pain to a life of happiness.

Another example is from Matthew 5:25: “Make peace with your enemy quickly while you are with him, or the enemy will hand you over to the judge, the judge to the officer, and you will be thrown into prison. You won’t get out until you have paid the last penny.” Here, the sinner is like the offender; the enemy and judge represent God; this life is the way; the prison is the grave; and the officer is death. The sinner won’t come back to eternal life but to a second death, until they have fully paid their debt, or Christ pays it for them through His suffering, which covers all sins, big or small, because Christ’s suffering makes all sins equally forgivable.

Another passage is Matthew 5:22: “Anyone who is angry with their brother without a reason will be judged guilty. Anyone who says ‘Raca’ to their brother will be judged by the council. But anyone who says ‘You fool’ will be guilty enough to go to hell.” From this, some think there are three kinds of sins with different punishments, and only the last sin leads to hell, so smaller sins are punished in purgatory after life. But this idea doesn’t really fit with any clear explanation so far. Will there really be different courts after life, like the Jews had in Jesus’ time, to decide different crimes? Isn’t all judgment done by Christ and His Apostles?

To understand this, we shouldn’t look at this verse alone but together with the verses before and after. Jesus is explaining the Law of Moses, which the Jews thought was obeyed if they followed the exact words, even if they broke the real meaning. For example, they thought the sixth Commandment was only broken by killing someone, and the seventh only by sleeping with someone else's wife. But Jesus tells them that being angry at your brother without a good reason is like murder.
