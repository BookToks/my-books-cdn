If everyone has different private opinions, which are just personal beliefs, the country will be confused and no one will follow the ruler unless they feel like it.

People often say that faith and holiness can’t be learned by studying or thinking, but only come from a special, supernatural way. If that’s true, then why should anyone explain their faith? Why wouldn’t every Christian be able to predict the future? Why should anyone follow the country’s laws instead of their own special inspiration? This idea makes people think they can decide what’s right or wrong on their own or trust people who claim to be supernaturally inspired, which would break down the government. Faith comes from hearing others, and the situations that bring us to listen are planned by God, but they aren’t supernatural—just very complex and hard to notice. Faith and holiness don’t happen often, but they aren’t miracles. They come from learning, discipline, correction, and other natural ways God uses for those He chooses, at the right time. These three wrong ideas, which harm peace and government, mostly come from uneducated religious teachers who mix up scripture and reason to make people think faith and reason can’t go together.

Another wrong idea that doesn’t fit with a country’s nature is that the ruler must follow the country’s laws. It’s true rulers must follow natural laws because those come from God and can’t be changed. But the laws that the ruler or country makes don’t apply to the ruler. To follow laws means to obey the country, which is the ruler. So the ruler obeying laws made by himself isn’t really obeying, but being free from laws. This wrong idea puts laws above the ruler and a judge above him who can punish him. That would create a new ruler above the first one, then another above that one, and so on, leading to endless confusion and the country falling apart.
