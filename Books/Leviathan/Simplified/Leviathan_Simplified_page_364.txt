Sometimes people worry that letting a ruler who doesn’t follow the right religion stay in charge could be dangerous. But regular people aren’t the ones to decide this. If they were, then the Pope’s own followers could also decide what the Pope teaches. Every Christian king is just as much the leader of their people as the Pope is of his.

The next point comes from when kings are baptized. They give up their power to Christ and promise to protect the Christian faith. This is true because Christian kings are followers of Christ. But even so, they can still be equals to the Pope since they are the main leaders of their own people. The Pope is also just a king and leader in Rome.

Another argument comes from when Jesus said, “Feed my sheep.” This means a leader has all the power needed to care for their followers, like protecting them from bad people and giving them what they need. Some say this means St. Peter got three powers from Jesus: to teach, to protect from heretics (people with wrong beliefs), and to control bad Christian kings. But the last power really just means teaching.

The idea of chasing away heretics comes from a Bible warning about false prophets, who are not the same as heretics. Jesus didn’t tell his followers to fight or remove heretics or kings who disagreed, but to be careful and avoid them. This advice was given to many Jews who weren’t even Christians yet. So, if it meant removing kings, it would apply to everyone, not just Christians.

As for controlling angry kings who won’t submit to the Pope, Jesus didn’t take that power on himself while on earth. Instead, he said to let good and bad people live together until the final judgment day. So, he definitely didn’t give that power to St. Peter.
