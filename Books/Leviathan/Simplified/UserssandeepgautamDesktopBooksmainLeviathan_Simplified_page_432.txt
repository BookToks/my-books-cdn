Thirdly, priests, monks, and friars don’t have to follow civil laws like everyone else. This means a big part of the population enjoys the laws and protection of the state but doesn’t pay taxes or face punishments for crimes like others do. Because of this, they only listen to the Pope and support his control over everyone.

Fourthly, priests are called “sacred ones” or sacrificers, which was a title used by leaders among the Jews when God was their king. Also, making the Lord’s Supper a sacrifice makes people think the Pope has the same power over all Christians as Moses and Aaron had over the Jews, meaning he has both religious and civil authority.

Fifthly, saying marriage is a sacrament gives the church control over deciding if marriages are legal. This also means they decide if children are legitimate and who can inherit kingdoms.

Sixthly, priests not being allowed to marry helps the Pope keep power over kings. If a king was a priest, he couldn’t marry or pass his kingdom to his children. If he’s not a priest, the Pope claims authority over him and his people.

Seventhly, through confession, priests get secret information about what princes and important people are planning, which helps the church keep control over the state.

Eighthly, by naming saints and martyrs, the church makes ordinary people stubbornly obey the Pope’s rules, even risking death if they’re declared enemies of the church.

Ninthly, priests are believed to have the power to act as Christ, deciding penance and forgiving or keeping sins, which helps keep the Pope’s power strong.
