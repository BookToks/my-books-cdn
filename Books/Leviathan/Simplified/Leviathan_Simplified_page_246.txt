The word "angel" usually means a messenger, mostly a messenger from God. A messenger from God is something that shows His special presence, like a powerful sign, often through a dream or vision.

The Bible doesn’t say anything about how angels were made. It often says angels are spirits. But the word "spirit" can mean different things. It can mean things like air or wind, or the life forces in animals. It can also mean images that appear in our dreams or visions. These images aren’t real things and only last as long as the dream or vision. Even though these images aren’t real, when God makes them appear to show His will, they are rightly called His messengers, or angels.

People who didn’t follow God (called Gentiles) thought these images in the brain were real things outside the mind. They believed in spirits, good and bad, and called them real but invisible beings. The Jews, except for one group called the Sadducees, thought the same. They believed that when God made these images appear to help people, they were real creatures made by God. They called the helpful ones angels of God and the harmful ones evil angels or spirits. For example, they thought people with certain illnesses like madness or epilepsy were controlled by evil spirits.

If we look at the Bible verses where angels are mentioned, most of the time the word "angel" means an image made in the mind by God to show His presence during a special event. So, in other cases where the nature of angels isn’t explained, we can understand it the same way.

For example, the same vision is called both an angel and God. When the "angel of the Lord" speaks to Hagar in the Bible, it is like God speaking directly.
