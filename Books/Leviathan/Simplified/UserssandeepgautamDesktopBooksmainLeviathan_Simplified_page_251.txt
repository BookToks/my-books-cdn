In the writings of religious people, especially in sermons and devotional books, the "kingdom of God" usually means the happiness we get after this life, in the highest heaven. They also call this the kingdom of glory. Sometimes, it means the promise of that happiness, which they call the kingdom of grace. But it never means the actual political power or rule of God over people who agree to follow Him, which is what "kingdom" really means.

Actually, in most parts of the Bible, the kingdom of God means a real kingdom, where the people of Israel chose God as their king by making a special agreement with Him. God promised them the land of Canaan in return. The phrase is only used as a metaphor sometimes, and then it means ruling over sin (only in the New Testament), because everyone in God’s kingdom will be under His rule without Him losing any power.

From the very beginning, God ruled over all people by His power, but He also had special people He spoke to directly, like one person talking to another. For example, God ruled over Adam and told him not to eat from the tree of knowing good and evil. When Adam disobeyed and tried to be like God by deciding good and evil on his own, he was punished by losing eternal life, which God had originally created him for. Later, because of people's sins, God punished everyone except eight people with a huge flood. These eight people made up God’s kingdom then.

After this, God spoke to Abraham and made a special promise with him. God said, “I will make a promise between me and you and your children forever. I will be your God and the God of your children. I will give you and your children the land of Canaan as a forever home.” Abraham promised to obey God, and God promised him the land. To remember this promise, God made the ritual of circumcision. This promise is called the Old Covenant or Testament. It was a contract between God and Abraham, making Abraham and his children follow God’s special laws, in addition to the usual moral laws they already had to obey.
