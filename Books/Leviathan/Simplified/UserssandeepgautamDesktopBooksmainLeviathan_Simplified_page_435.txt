After this, the Presbyterians in England got rid of the system called Episcopacy, which was the second big problem. Almost at the same time, they also lost their own power. So now, people were left to follow the example of the first Christians, like Paul, Cephas, or Apollos, each person choosing whoever they liked best.

This is probably the best way, as long as there are no fights about it, and people don’t judge the teachings of Christ based on how much they like the teacher. The Apostle talked against this kind of fault with the Corinthians. First, because no one should control someone else's beliefs except the teachings themselves, which create faith in each person. This faith doesn’t always depend on those who teach, but on God who helps it grow. Second, it doesn’t make sense for teachers to say every small mistake is dangerous and then expect a reasonable person to just follow someone else’s ideas or even the majority’s ideas. That’s like gambling with their salvation.

Those teachers shouldn’t be upset about losing their old power. They should know better than anyone that power stays only if it is earned by wisdom, humility, clear teaching, and honest behavior. It doesn’t come from hiding science and reason, using confusing language, pretending to know more than they do, tricking people in the name of religion, or making mistakes that cause others to lose respect for them.

After people accepted the idea that the Church on Earth is the kingdom of God mentioned in the Bible, many leaders started fighting for the important church jobs, especially the top one of being Christ’s representative. They showed off so much that people stopped respecting the pastors properly. Even the smartest people with political power only needed their rulers to tell them to stop obeying the church leaders.

When the Bishop of Rome became known as the universal bishop, claiming to be St. Peter’s successor, their whole church system, or “kingdom of darkness,” was like the stories about fairies and ghosts in old English folklore—mysterious and full of strange tricks played at night.
