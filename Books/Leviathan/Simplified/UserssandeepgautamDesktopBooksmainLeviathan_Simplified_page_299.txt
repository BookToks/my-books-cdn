In the next chapter, we will talk about this more.

There are three main roles of Jesus, the Messiah, according to the Bible. First, He is a redeemer or savior. Second, He is a pastor, counselor, or teacher—a prophet sent by God to help those chosen by God to change their ways. Third, He is a king, an eternal king, but under His Father, like Moses and the high priests were in their own times.

These three roles match three different times. Jesus saved us by His first coming, when He sacrificed Himself on the cross for our sins. He started helping people change their hearts then, and He still helps now through His followers, and He will keep doing this until He comes again. When He comes back, His glorious reign over His chosen people will start and last forever.

As a redeemer, He paid the price for our sins, and that price was death. He was killed and carried away our sins, just as God asked. It’s not that one man’s death, even if he was without sin, could fully pay for everyone's sins by strict justice. But God, in His mercy, allowed sacrifices for sin that He accepted.

In the old law (like in Leviticus 16), every year there had to be a sacrifice for the sins of all Israel, including priests and others. Aaron, the high priest, had to offer a young bull for himself and the priests, and two young goats for the people. One goat was sacrificed, but the other, called the scapegoat, had Aaron lay the people’s sins on its head, and it was sent away into the wilderness to carry the sins away. Just like the sacrifice of one goat was enough to pay for all Israel’s sins, the death of Jesus, the Messiah, was enough to pay for the sins of all people because nothing more was needed.
