These are the ways God showed His will in the Old Testament.

He used these same ways in the New Testament too. For example, He spoke to the Virgin Mary through an angel’s vision; to Joseph in a dream; to Paul on the way to Damascus in a vision of Jesus; to Peter in a vision about a sheet with different kinds of animals; and even in prison, an angel appeared to someone. God also spoke to all the Apostles and writers of the New Testament through the gifts of His Spirit. When choosing Matthias to replace Judas Iscariot, the Apostles used casting lots.

Since all prophecy involves visions or dreams (which are basically the same when natural), or special gifts from God that are very rare, we need to use reason to tell the difference between natural and supernatural gifts, and between natural and supernatural visions or dreams.

Because of this, people must be very careful before listening to anyone who says they are a prophet and claims to speak for God about the way to happiness. Someone who says they can teach the way to true happiness is trying to control others, and since wanting to rule others is natural, we should be suspicious of their intentions. Everyone should check carefully before obeying such people, unless they are officially in charge, like a government leader or someone the government approves. If people weren’t allowed to judge prophets and spirits for themselves, there would be no point in giving signs to help tell who is a true prophet and who is not.

Since there are signs to recognize true prophets (like in Deuteronomy 13:1) and true spirits (like in 1 John 4:1), and since the Old Testament warns a lot against false prophets, and the New Testament also teaches about them, everyone should be careful about following these people because there are usually more false prophets than true ones. For example, when King Ahab asked 400 prophets, all of them were false except one named Micaiah.
