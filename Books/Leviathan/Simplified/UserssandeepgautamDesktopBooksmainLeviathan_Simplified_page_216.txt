The best advisers are the ones who don’t expect to gain anything from giving bad advice and who really understand what helps keep the country safe and peaceful.

It’s hard to tell who wants to cause trouble for their own benefit. But a sign to watch for is when people who don’t have enough money to cover their usual expenses try to calm others down about problems that can’t be fixed or aren’t fair. Anyone interested can notice this.

It’s even harder to know who truly understands public matters. People who understand them actually need them less. This is because knowing who understands something well means you already know a lot about it yourself. You can’t trust someone else’s rules unless you’ve learned how to understand them first.

The best way to show you know something is by spending a lot of time doing it and having good results. Good advice doesn’t come by chance or because of family background. So, there’s no reason to expect rich or noble people to give good political advice, any more than they would be good at designing a fortress—unless they’ve actually studied it carefully, which usually isn’t the case.

Politics is actually harder to learn than things like geometry. In parts of Europe, some people have had the right to be part of the highest councils just because of their family history. This comes from the old German conquerors. They made sure their families would have special privileges to stand out from their subjects. These privileges don’t really fit with the power of the ruler, so even if rulers let them keep these rights for a while, over time these families lose them and only keep respect based on their actual abilities.

No matter how good advisers are, their advice works best when they give it to each person separately and explain their reasons, instead of giving speeches in a big group. It’s also better when they think about their advice beforehand instead of speaking without preparation. This way, they have more time to think about what might happen and are less likely to argue just because of jealousy or different opinions.
