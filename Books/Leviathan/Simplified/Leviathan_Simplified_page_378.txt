The Fourth Part Of the Kingdom of Darkness XLIV: Of Spiritual Darkness From Misinterpretation of Scripture

Besides the powerful forces from God and humans that I have talked about, the Bible also talks about another power. This power is called “the rulers of the darkness of this world” (Ephesians 6:12), “the kingdom of Satan” (Matthew 12:26), and “the principality of Beelzebub over demons” (Matthew 9:34). These demons are like ghosts or spirits that appear in the air. That’s why Satan is also called “the prince of the power of the air” (Ephesians 2:2) and “the prince of this world” (John 16:11), because he rules in the darkness of this world.

People who follow Satan are called “children of darkness,” while those who follow God are “children of the light.” Since Beelzebub is the leader of these spirits of darkness, the “children of darkness” and these spirits are similar in meaning. The kingdom of darkness, as described in the Bible, is a group of deceivers. They try to control people by spreading wrong ideas that put out the light of both natural understanding and the gospel. This stops people from being ready for God’s kingdom in the future.

Just like people who are born blind don’t understand what light is, people can only understand the gospel’s light and true understanding as much as they have already experienced. No one imagines a brighter light than what they have seen before. Because of this, people only realize their own spiritual darkness when bad things suddenly happen to them, making them think about their situation.
