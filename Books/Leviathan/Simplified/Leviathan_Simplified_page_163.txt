Everyone can see that some laws apply to everyone; some only to certain areas; some only to certain jobs; and some only to specific people. So, laws only apply to the people they are meant for, and no one else.

Also, laws are the rules that say what is fair and unfair. Nothing is unfair unless it goes against a law. Only the Commonwealth (the whole community or government) can make laws because we all follow the Commonwealth. Commands must be clearly given so people know how to follow them. Because of this, anything that logically comes from this idea should be accepted as true. Now, I will explain what follows.

1. The lawmaker in every Commonwealth is only the ruler, whether that is one person (like a king) or a group of people (like in a democracy or aristocracy). The lawmaker is the one who makes the laws. The Commonwealth only sets and enforces the laws we call law, so the Commonwealth is the lawmaker.

But the Commonwealth is not a person and can only act through its representative, the ruler. So, the ruler is the only lawmaker. For the same reason, no one can cancel a law except the ruler, because a law can only be canceled by another law that forbids it.

2. The ruler of a Commonwealth, whether a group or one person, does not have to follow civil laws. Since the ruler can make and cancel laws, they can free themselves from any law by canceling it and making a new one. This means the ruler was always free. Being free means you can choose to be free whenever you want. It is impossible for someone to be bound by their own laws because if you can make a rule, you can also break it. So, no one is truly bound by laws they make themselves.

3. When a law has been used for a long time, it doesn’t get its power from how long it has been around but from the ruler’s approval shown by not stopping it. Silence can mean agreement. But a law lasts only as long as the ruler allows it. If the ruler faces a legal question based on old laws, the time those laws existed doesn’t matter. Instead, the question will be decided based on fairness. Many unfair actions and decisions have gone on for a long time. Our lawyers say that only reasonable customs count as laws, and bad customs should be stopped. But deciding what is reasonable or should be stopped belongs to the lawmaker, which is the ruler or the ruling group.
