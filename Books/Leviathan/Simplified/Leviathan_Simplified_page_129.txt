Liberty, or freedom, means not having anything stopping you from moving. This idea applies not only to people who can think but also to animals and things without life. For example, if something is tied up or trapped so it can only move in a small space because something outside is blocking it, we say it doesn’t have freedom to go further. Like animals locked in cages or water held back by walls—it can’t move the way it wants because of outside things stopping it. But if something can’t move because of its own nature, like a rock lying still or a sick person stuck in bed, we don’t say it lacks freedom but that it lacks the power to move.

A free person is someone who can do whatever they want to do, as long as it’s something they are able to do and nothing is stopping them. When we say “free” or “liberty” about things that don’t move, those words don’t really make sense. For example, if we say “the way is free,” we don’t mean the path itself is free, but that people can walk on it without being stopped. If we say a gift is free, it means the person giving it wasn’t forced by any rule to give it. When someone speaks freely, it means no law made them say anything different. When we talk about “free will,” it doesn’t mean the will itself is free, but that the person can do what they want without being blocked.

Fear and freedom can exist together. For example, if a man throws his things into the sea because he’s afraid the ship might sink, he does it by his own choice and can say no if he wants. That means he is acting freely. Also, if someone pays a debt because they fear going to jail, and no one actually stops them from keeping their money, they are still acting freely.
