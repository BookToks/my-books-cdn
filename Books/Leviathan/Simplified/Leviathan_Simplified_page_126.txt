The ruler has total control over everyone; if not, then there is no real ruler at all. Without a ruler, everyone would have to protect themselves with their own weapons, which would lead to a state of war.

A big family, if it’s not part of a bigger group or country, is like a small kingdom. This could be a man with his children, servants, or both, and the father or master is the ruler. But a family isn’t really a country unless it has enough power or numbers to defend itself without being easily defeated.

If a group of people is too weak to protect themselves together, each person has to use their own judgment to stay safe during danger. They might run away or give in to the enemy to survive, like a small group of soldiers who get caught by a bigger army might surrender or escape instead of fighting to the death. This explains how people create countries and choose rulers to protect them.

Now, let's look at what the Bible says about this.

When the Israelites talked to Moses, they said, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but don’t let God speak to us, or we might die.” This shows they obeyed Moses completely. About kings, God told Samuel that the king would have a lot of power: he would take their sons to serve as soldiers and workers, their daughters to work as cooks and servants, their fields and harvests to give to his helpers, and even take part of their animals. The king would take many things for himself and make the people his servants.

Even after hearing how much power the king would have, the people agreed and said, “We want to be like other nations. Our king will judge our problems and lead us in war.”
