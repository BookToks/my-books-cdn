People can't get rights just by using force. These rights are about keeping everyone safe. So, people agree together to choose leaders with real power to protect and rule them. If there was someone with unstoppable power, they could just rule and protect everyone however they wanted. 

Those who have unstoppable power naturally rule over others because of their strength. This kind of power and control over people comes from God, not just because He created everything or is kind, but because He is all-powerful. Even though punishment is supposed to be for sin, the right to cause suffering comes from God's power, not always from people's sins.

People have long wondered why bad people often do well while good people suffer. This question is similar to asking why God lets some people have good things and others face problems. This is a hard question that has made many people, including smart thinkers and even holy people, doubt God's plan. David said, "God is good to those who are honest, but I almost lost my way because I was upset seeing bad people do well." Job also asked God why he suffered so much even though he was good. 

In Job's story, God answers not by blaming Job but by showing His own power. Job’s friends said he must have sinned to deserve suffering, but Job said he was innocent. God showed that Job was right and his friends were wrong by reminding Job of His great power, like how He created the earth. This shows that suffering isn't always because someone did wrong.

Jesus said about a man born blind, "Neither he nor his parents sinned, but this happened so God's work could be shown." Even though death came into the world because of sin, it doesn't mean God couldn't cause suffering without sin. He can also cause suffering to animals who don’t sin.
