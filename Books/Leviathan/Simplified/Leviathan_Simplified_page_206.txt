If the main rights of sovereignty (explained earlier in Chapter 18) are taken away, the whole government breaks down. Then, everyone goes back to fighting each other, which is the worst thing that can happen in life. So, it’s the leader’s job to keep those rights safe. The leader should never give any of these rights to someone else or give them up. 

If the leader gives up the power to make laws, decide on war or peace, judge what the country needs, raise money and soldiers when needed, choose officers and teachers, or check what ideas are good for the people, then they are abandoning their job. Also, the leader must not let people be confused or lied to about why these rights are important, because if people don’t understand, they might resist when the government asks them to follow the rules.

These rights need to be clearly and honestly taught because laws or punishments alone can’t protect them. A law that stops people from rebelling only works because of natural rules that say people must keep their promises. If people don’t understand this, they won’t respect any laws the leader makes. And if they only fear punishment, they might fight back when they feel strong enough.

Some people say justice is just a word with no real meaning, and that whatever a person can take by force is theirs, even in a government. I have already shown this is wrong. Others say there are no real reasons to support the leader’s absolute rights. But if there were no reasons, these rights would have never been accepted or challenged anywhere, yet we see that they are important in every government so far.
