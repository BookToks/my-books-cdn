People don’t trust each other. So, the best way for someone to stay safe is to take control of as many people as possible, using force or trickery, until no one is strong enough to threaten them. This is just about protecting themselves, and most people agree it’s okay. 

Also, some people enjoy showing off their power by taking over others, even more than they need to feel safe. Because of this, if others don’t try to get stronger by taking over more land or people, they won’t be able to survive just by defending themselves. So, gaining more control over others is necessary for survival and should be accepted.

People don’t like being around others if no one is strong enough to keep everyone in check. Everyone wants to be respected as much as they respect themselves. If someone feels looked down on, they try, as much as they can, to get back respect by hurting those who disrespect them or by setting an example to others.

So, there are three main reasons people fight. First, competition; second, fear; third, pride.

Competition makes people fight to get more stuff. Fear makes people fight to protect themselves. Pride makes people fight over small things like words, looks, opinions, or anything that seems disrespectful to them or their family, friends, country, job, or name.

This shows that when people live without a common power to keep them all in control, they are basically at war with each other. War isn’t just about fighting in battles, but about a time when everyone is ready and willing to fight. Like bad weather isn’t just one or two rainy days, but several days of rain, war is about the constant threat of fighting until there is peace or security.
