In II Thessalonians 3:14, it says, "If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, don’t hang out with them, so they feel ashamed." Some people think "obey" here means the letter is like a law for the Thessalonians. Emperors’ letters were laws, so if Paul’s letter was also a law, people would have to obey two masters.

But the word "obey" in Greek means to listen to or follow advice, not just laws made by someone with power to punish. Paul doesn’t tell people to punish those who disobey by beating or imprisoning them. Instead, he tells them to avoid their company so they feel ashamed. This shows that it wasn’t about Paul’s power, but about his reputation among Christians that mattered.

Hebrews 13:17 says, "Obey your leaders and submit to them because they watch over your souls and will give an account." Here, obeying means following their advice. We obey because it helps us, not because leaders want more power. If everything pastors taught was law, then every pastor would have the power to make laws, which doesn’t make sense.

Also, those who obey pastors don’t have to accept everything without question. St. John says in 1 John 4:1, "Don’t believe every spirit, but test them to see if they are from God, because many false prophets are in the world." This means we can question our pastors’ teachings, but we can’t question laws. Civil rulers’ commands are laws, and if anyone else could make laws besides the ruler, peace and justice would break down, which goes against all laws, both from God and humans.
