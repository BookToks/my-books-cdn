Here’s a simple version of the passage, keeping the same number of sentences:

There are different kinds of laws.

I see that people often mix up the words lex civilis and jus civile, which mean civil law and civil right, even smart writers do this. But they shouldn’t mix them up. A right is freedom, the kind of freedom that civil law lets us have. Civil law is a rule that limits our freedom. Nature gave everyone the right to protect themselves and even attack a neighbor if needed to stay safe. But civil law takes away that freedom whenever the law’s protection is enough. So, lex (law) and jus (right) are as different as rules and freedom.

Also, people confuse laws and charters as if they are the same. But charters are gifts from the ruler and are not laws; they are exceptions to laws. When making a law, the ruler says “I command.” When giving a charter, the ruler says “I have given or granted.” What is given by a charter is not forced by law. Laws apply to everyone in a country, but a charter only applies to one person or a small group.

Saying everyone in a country has freedom in every situation means either no law was made for that case or the law was canceled.

XXVII: About Crimes, Excuses, and Reducing Punishments A sin is not just breaking a law but also disrespecting the lawmaker. Disrespect breaks all laws at once. Sin can happen by doing something forbidden, saying forbidden words, not doing what the law says to do, or even planning to break the law. Just planning to break the law shows some disrespect to the lawmaker. Imagining having someone else’s stuff or thinking about their death without planning to act on it is not breaking the law. The law says "Thou shalt not covet," but just wanting something in your mind isn’t a crime. Enjoying thinking about bad things isn’t a sin either. If it were, then being human would be a sin, because all creatures naturally have feelings like that.
