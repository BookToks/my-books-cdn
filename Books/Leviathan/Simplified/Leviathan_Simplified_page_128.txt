After they both ate, they took on God’s role of deciding what is good and bad, but they didn’t actually get better at knowing what’s right. When it says they saw they were naked, it doesn’t mean they were blind before and couldn’t see their skin. It means that this was the first time they thought their nakedness was shameful, even though God made them that way. By feeling ashamed, they were indirectly judging God’s creation. Then God asks, “Did you eat?” as if saying, do you think you can judge my rules when you should obey them? This shows, in a symbolic way, that people shouldn’t question or argue against the rules made by those in charge.

So, it’s clear to me, both by thinking and by the Bible, that the highest power—whether held by one person like a king or by a group of people like in a democracy or aristocracy—is as strong as it can be. Even though having so much power might seem dangerous, having no strong power leads to worse problems, like constant fighting between people. Life always has problems, but big problems in any country mostly come from people not following the rules that keep the country together. And if someone thinks the ruler’s power is too much and tries to make it less, they have to accept an even stronger power controlling them instead.

The biggest question is about real life: when have people actually agreed to give so much power to one ruler? But you can ask back: when has there ever been a kingdom that stayed peaceful and free from rebellion for a long time? Countries that have lasted a long time without being destroyed by others never had people arguing about the ruler’s power. But arguments based on how people live without really understanding how countries work aren’t good arguments. Just because people build houses on sand doesn’t mean that’s the right way. Knowing how to build and keep a country safe is like knowing math or science—it follows certain rules, not just practice. Most people either don’t have time or haven’t tried to learn these rules carefully yet.
