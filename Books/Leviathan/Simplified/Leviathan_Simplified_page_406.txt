A douleía means being a servant of God; latreía means serving Him. All kinds of service include not just obeying, but also worship, which means showing respect through actions, gestures, and words.

An image, in the strictest sense, is something that looks like a visible thing. For example, reflections or illusions you see in water or air are images. These are not real things where they appear to be. Their size and shape can change depending on how you see them or if you use lenses. Sometimes, these images appear in your imagination or dreams, even when the real thing is not there. They can also change colors and shapes because they come from your imagination. These kinds of images are called ideas or idols, based on Greek words meaning "to see." They are also called phantasms, which means appearances. From these images, humans have a part of their mind called imagination. This shows that you cannot make an image of something invisible.

Also, you cannot make an image of something infinite. All images are shaped and have a set size. So, you cannot have an image of God, a soul, or spirits. You can only have images of things you can see, like bodies that give off light or are lit up.

People can imagine shapes they have never seen by mixing parts of different creatures, like how poets create centaurs or chimeras. They can even make these shapes out of wood, clay, or metal. These are also called images, but not because they look like real bodies—they look like creatures made up in the maker’s mind. When these imaginary creatures are made into art, there is a similarity between the idea in the mind and the material object, so the object can be called an image of that idea.

In a broader sense, the word image can mean any way of showing one thing by using another.
