We can also talk about the endless desire, or bulimia, to keep gaining more land, even though this often leads to serious injuries from enemies. There are also problems with taking over places that don’t work well together, which can be more trouble than they’re worth and easier to lose than to keep. Plus, there’s the laziness that comes with comfort and the waste of money and resources on useless things.

Finally, when a war happens—whether between countries or inside one—and the enemies win so that the Commonwealth’s forces can’t hold their ground anymore, the Commonwealth breaks apart. After that, people are on their own and have to protect themselves however they think is best. The leader or ruler is like the soul of the Commonwealth, giving it life and energy. When that soul dies, the people are no longer connected to it, just like a dead body without a soul. Even though the ruler’s right to rule can’t be taken away by someone else, the people’s duty to follow can end. If someone isn’t protected, they can try to find protection elsewhere and then have to defend that protection as long as they can. But if the group in charge is crushed, their power disappears completely, because the group itself no longer exists. That means there is no chance for the ruler’s power to come back.

XXX: About the Job of the Ruler The ruler, whether a king or a group, has the job they were given power for: to keep the people safe. This is a natural law, and the ruler must answer only to God, who gave that law. But safety doesn’t just mean staying alive—it also means having a good life with things people can earn by working hard, without hurting others or the Commonwealth.

This should be done not by taking care of every single person, except protecting them from harm when they complain, but by having good public rules and examples. These rules should help people know how to handle their own situations.
