What is baptism? It means dipping someone into water. But what does it mean to dip a person into water in the name of something? Baptism means that the person being baptized is washed as a sign that they are becoming a new person and a loyal follower of God. Long ago, God was shown through Moses and the high priests who led the Jews. Now, God is shown through Jesus Christ, His Son, who saved us and will represent God after He rises from the dead. Baptism also means agreeing with the teachings of the Apostles, who were helped by the Spirit of God to guide us to God’s kingdom. This promise is made during baptism.

Earthly rulers still have power until the day of judgment, as St. Paul said: “Just like everyone dies because of Adam, everyone will be made alive through Christ. But each in their own order: Christ first, then those who belong to Him when He comes, and then the end, when He gives the kingdom to God the Father after taking down all power.” This shows that baptism doesn’t make someone follow a new earthly ruler, but promises to follow the Apostles’ teachings to find eternal life.

The power to forgive or keep sins, called the power to “loose and bind” or the “keys of the kingdom of heaven,” comes with the authority to baptize or refuse baptism. Baptism is a way to show that someone is accepted into God’s kingdom, which means eternal life and forgiveness of sins. Since eternal life was lost because of sin, it is gained back by forgiving sins. The goal of baptism is to forgive sins. That’s why St. Peter told people on the day of Pentecost to “repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus for the forgiveness of sins.” Because baptism means letting people into God’s kingdom, and refusing baptism means keeping them out, the same power to accept or reject people was given to the Apostles and those who come after them. After Jesus gave the Holy Spirit to the Apostles, He said, “Whosever sins you forgive are forgiven, and whosever sins you don’t forgive are not forgiven.”
