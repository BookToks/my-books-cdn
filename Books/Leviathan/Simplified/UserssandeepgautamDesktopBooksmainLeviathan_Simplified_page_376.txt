Thomas Hobbes explains what it takes to be saved and how we can obey both God and the government, even if the ruler is Christian or not.

If the ruler is Christian, he believes that Jesus is the Christ, which is all the faith needed for salvation. As a leader, he asks people to follow his civil laws, which include natural laws—these are God’s laws. The laws of the Church are also part of these civil laws because the Church that makes laws is part of the government. So, obeying a Christian leader doesn’t stop you from believing in or obeying God.

What if a Christian king makes some mistakes and teaches wrong ideas? St. Paul says that even the king will be saved, so anyone who teaches those ideas because the king commands it will be saved too. Even more so, the people who just believe the king without teaching those ideas will be saved.

If the ruler says you can’t share some of your opinions, on what reason could you disobey? Christian kings might make mistakes, but who can judge them? Should a regular person decide if they should obey? Or should only the Church or the government judge? Even the Pope or Apostles can make mistakes. For example, St. Paul corrected St. Peter once. So, there is no real conflict between God’s laws and the laws of a Christian government.

When the ruler is not Christian, anyone who fights against him is sinning because they break natural laws, which are God’s laws. The Apostles tell Christians to obey their leaders, parents, and bosses. Their faith is personal and hidden, like Naaman's story in the Bible. They don’t need to risk their safety for their faith. But if they do face danger for it, they should expect a reward in heaven and not blame or fight their rightful ruler. Anyone who isn’t willing to risk their life for their faith doesn’t truly believe but just uses religion as an excuse to rebel.
