The meaning of these words is clearer when you think about a time long ago, when the earth was covered in water, like at the very beginning. God wanted to make the waters go down and show the dry land again. He said something like, “I will bring my Spirit upon the earth, and the waters will go down.” Here, the Spirit means a wind, like air moving, which can be called the Spirit of God because it was God’s doing.

Pharaoh called Joseph’s wisdom the Spirit of God. Joseph told Pharaoh to find a smart and careful man to help rule Egypt. Pharaoh said, “Can we find a man like this, who has the Spirit of God?” In another part of the Bible, God tells people who are wise and skilled to make special clothes for Aaron, the priest, because their wisdom is a gift from God. This Spirit of God means special understanding or talents God gives people.

The prophet Isaiah talks about the Messiah having the Spirit of the Lord with many gifts like wisdom, understanding, advice, strength, and respect for God. This doesn’t mean many spirits, but lots of great gifts God gives.

In the Book of Judges, having the Spirit of God means having strong courage to protect God’s people. It helped leaders like Othniel, Gideon, Jephtha, and Samson fight for their people. When Saul heard that the Ammonites were being cruel to some men, it says “The Spirit of God came upon Saul, and he got really angry.” This didn’t mean a ghost, but a strong passion to stop the cruelty. Later, when Saul was with prophets who were singing and praising God, the Spirit of God made him want to join them, showing a sudden excitement in worship, not a ghost.

The false prophet Zedekiah asked Micaiah, “Where did the Spirit of the Lord go when it left me and spoke to you?”
