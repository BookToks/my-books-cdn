The Fourth Part Of the Kingdom of Darkness XLIV: About Spiritual Darkness Caused by Misunderstanding the Bible

Besides the powerful forces, both divine and human, that I have talked about before, the Bible also mentions another force. This force is called “the rulers of the darkness of this world” (Ephesians 6:12), “the kingdom of Satan” (Matthew 12:26), and “the principality of Beelzebub over demons” (Matthew 9:34). This means Satan controls spirits or illusions that seem to appear in the air. Because of this, Satan is also called “the prince of the power of the air” (Ephesians 2:2) and “the prince of this world” (John 16:11). People under his control are called “children of darkness,” while those who follow God are the “children of light.”

Since Beelzebub is the prince of these spirits and illusions in the air and darkness, the “children of darkness” and these spirits mean the same thing in a symbolic way. So, the kingdom of darkness described in the Bible is really a group of deceivers. They try to control people by spreading wrong and confusing ideas. Their goal is to put out the light of understanding, both natural and from the gospel, so people won’t be ready for God’s kingdom.

People who are born blind have no idea what light looks like. No one can imagine a brighter light than what they have already seen with their eyes. The same is true for the light of the gospel and understanding. No one thinks there is more understanding than what they already have. Because of this, people only realize their own darkness or lack of understanding when unexpected problems happen to them.
