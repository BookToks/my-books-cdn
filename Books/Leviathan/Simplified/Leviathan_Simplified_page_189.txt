Some crimes are worse because they mess up the whole justice system, not just hurt one or two people. For example, taking money to give a fake judgment or lie in court is worse than just tricking someone out of money. That’s because fake judgments make all court rulings useless and can lead to violence and personal revenge.

Stealing from the government or public money is a bigger crime than stealing from one person because it hurts many people at once. Also, pretending to be a government official or faking official stamps or money is worse than faking a private person’s signature or seal, since it causes harm to a lot of people.

When crimes hurt individuals, the worst ones are those that cause the most obvious damage to people’s lives.

Killing someone illegally is the worst crime of all, more serious than any other harm that doesn’t kill. Torturing someone before killing them is even worse.

Cutting off a limb is worse than just stealing someone’s stuff. Scaring someone into giving up their belongings is worse than tricking them quietly. And tricking someone secretly is worse than cheating them with their permission.

Forcing someone into sex is worse than just persuading them. Forcing a married woman is worse than forcing someone who isn’t married.

People usually agree on these rankings, though some feel differently. The law doesn’t care about just one person’s feelings but what most people think is right.

Insults or rude gestures that only hurt someone’s feelings but don’t cause real harm were often ignored by old laws in places like Greece and Rome. They believed only weak people get truly hurt by words, not those confident in themselves.

Crimes are also worse depending on who you hurt, when, and where. For example, killing your parent is worse than killing someone else because parents deserve special respect, like rulers, since they gave you life.
