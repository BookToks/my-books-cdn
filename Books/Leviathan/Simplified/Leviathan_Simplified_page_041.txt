After that, people started using the word "conscience" in a different way. They used it to mean knowing their own secret thoughts and facts. So, people would say that conscience is like having a thousand witnesses inside you. Finally, some people, who really loved their own new ideas—even if those ideas were silly—called those ideas their conscience. They acted like it was wrong to change or argue against their ideas, pretending they knew for sure their ideas were true, even though they only believed them.

When someone starts talking without explaining what they mean first, they either start with their own thoughts, which is just an opinion, or they start by repeating what someone else said. If they trust that person is honest and knows the truth, then what they have is called belief or faith. Faith means trust in the person; belief means trust in both the person and the truth of what they say. So, belief has two parts: trusting the person and trusting what the person says.

To have faith in, trust, or believe a person all mean the same thing: thinking the person is honest. But to believe what someone says just means thinking the saying is true. We should notice that the phrase "I believe in," and similar phrases in Latin and Greek, are mostly used by religious writers. In other kinds of writing, people say things like "I believe him," "I trust him," or "I rely on him." This special use of "believe in" in religion has caused many arguments about what exactly Christian faith means.

But when the Creed says "believe in," it doesn't mean trust in a person. It means agreeing with and accepting the teachings. Not only Christians, but many people believe in God enough to accept everything He says, even if they don’t fully understand it. That’s the most trust or faith anyone can have in a person. But not everyone agrees with the Creed’s teachings.

So, when we believe something is true, not because we understand it ourselves or from reason, but because we trust the person who told us, then the person we believe in is the real focus of our faith. The respect we show by believing is really for that person only.
