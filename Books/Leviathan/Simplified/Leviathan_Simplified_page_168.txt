When regular people think they have enough power to get what they want, even if it’s unfair, they might try to make their own rules without listening to the government. That’s why laws need to clearly show who made them and where the power comes from. In every country, the person or group who makes the laws is known as the ruler or government, chosen by the people, so everyone is supposed to know who is in charge.

Even though most people forget or don’t think about who protects their rights and keeps them safe, anyone who thinks carefully can’t really be confused about who the ruler is. It’s common sense and a basic rule of nature that no one should try to weaken the power that protects them. So, no one should doubt who the ruler is unless they are ignoring the facts.

The tricky part is proving that the ruler’s power is real. We can check government records, official meetings, and public documents like seals to confirm laws. But these proofs only show the law exists, they don’t give the law its power—that power comes only from the ruler’s orders.

If someone feels wronged based on fairness or natural law, a judge with the right authority can decide what’s fair in that situation. Advice from a law expert can help avoid fights, but only the judge can officially say what the law means in a conflict.

When a crime or wrong is written down as a law, anyone can check the official records to see if what they plan to do is allowed or not. They should do this before breaking the law because if they don’t check and then do something wrong, it’s still illegal. Similarly, if someone thinks they were treated unfairly according to the law, they should look at the law first before complaining. If they complain without checking the law, it shows they might just want to cause trouble instead of really getting justice.
