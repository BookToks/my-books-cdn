When people worship God, they show it in ways that make it clear they want to honor Him. 

First, they pray. When people made statues, they didn’t think the statues were gods, but they prayed to them. 

Second, they say thank you to God. Thanking God is different from praying because praying happens before something good, and thanking happens after. Both are ways to show God is the source of all good things, past and future. 

Third, they give gifts like sacrifices. If these gifts are the best they have, it shows respect because it’s a way of saying thanks. 

Fourth, only God’s name should be used in promises or oaths. This shows respect because it admits that only God truly knows what’s in a person’s heart and that no one can avoid God’s punishment if they lie. 

Fifth, it’s important to speak carefully about God. This shows you respect and fear Him, and fear means you recognize His power. 

Because of this, you shouldn’t use God’s name carelessly or without a good reason. The only good reasons are when making serious promises in court or between countries to keep peace. Arguing about God’s nature is against His honor because natural science, which helps us understand the world, can’t really teach us about God. It can’t even fully explain ourselves or small creatures. 

So, when people try to argue about God’s traits using only reason, they actually disrespect Him. Instead of focusing on deep truths, we should focus on honoring God with good intentions. Many long arguments about God’s nature don’t honor Him but only show off people’s own cleverness, which wastes God’s sacred name.
