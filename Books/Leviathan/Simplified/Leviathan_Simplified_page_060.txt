If someone wants to learn more, especially about where titles of honor come from, they can find it in Mr. Selden’s great book on the topic. Over time, these honor jobs changed because of problems and to keep peace and good government. They became just titles to show who was more important, the order, and place of people in the country. People were called dukes, counts, marquises, and barons of places they didn’t even own or control, and other titles were made for the same reason.

Being worthy is different from a person’s value or what they deserve. It means having a special skill or ability for something they are called worthy of. This ability is often called fitness or being right for the job.

The person best suited with the right qualities to do a job like leading, judging, or any other role is the most worthy. The person best able to use riches well is the most worthy of wealth. Even if someone doesn’t have these qualities, they can still be worthy and valuable in other ways.

Also, someone can be worthy of money, jobs, or roles but still have no right to get them before others. So, they don’t exactly deserve it. To deserve something means you have a right to it, like a promise, which I will explain more later when I talk about contracts.

Now about manners: I’m not talking about small polite actions like how to greet someone, or how to clean your teeth in front of others. I mean the qualities people need to live together peacefully. We should know that true happiness isn’t about having a calm, satisfied mind all the time. There is no final goal or greatest good like old philosophers said. A person can’t live if their desires completely stop, just like if their senses and imagination stop working. Happiness is always wanting something new after getting what you wanted before. This is because people don’t want to enjoy something just once but want to keep wanting and enjoying things forever.
