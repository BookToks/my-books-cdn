Punishments given by people’s rules can be different types. They can hurt the body, take away money or property, cause shame, put someone in jail, send them away from their home, or a mix of these.

Hitting or hurting the body is called corporal punishment. This includes things like beating, wounds, or taking away physical pleasures someone used to enjoy legally.

Some corporal punishments cause death, called capital punishment. Others don’t cause death, like beating, wounds, or being chained. If someone dies by accident during a punishment that wasn’t meant to kill, it’s not called capital punishment, but an accidental death.

Money punishments involve taking money, land, or things that can be sold. Sometimes laws are made just to get money from people who break the rules, which isn’t really punishment but paying to avoid getting in trouble. But if the law is about natural rules or religion, paying money is a real punishment. For example, paying money for cursing God is a punishment, not a way to get permission to do it. Also, if someone pays money to a person they hurt, it’s just to make up for the damage, but it doesn’t erase the bad act.

Shame punishments take away honor or respect given by the community. Some honors come from natural qualities like courage or wisdom and can’t be taken away by law. But honors given by the government, like titles or special jobs, can be taken away as a punishment. For example, people can lose their titles or jobs if they are found guilty and may not get them back for a while.
