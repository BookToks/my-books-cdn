(II Kings, 5. 17, 18) The Prophet agreed and told him, “Go in peace.” Naaman believed deep down, but by bowing to the idol Rimmon, he was actually denying the true God just as much as if he had said it out loud. But what about what Jesus said: “Whoever denies me before others, I will deny before my Father in heaven” (Matthew 10:33)?  

We can say this: if someone like Naaman has to obey their king and do something they don’t agree with, just because it’s the law of their country, then that action belongs to the king, not to the person. So in that case, it’s the ruler and the law who deny Christ, not the person themselves.  

If someone says this idea goes against real Christianity, I ask them: what if a person in a Christian country secretly believes in Islam? If their king orders them to attend Christian church services, even under threat of death, should that person choose to die instead of obeying? If they say yes, that means anyone could disobey their rulers for their own religion, whether it’s right or wrong. But if they say no, that means they accept what others do for themselves but deny it to others. That goes against Jesus’ teaching, “Do to others what you want them to do to you” (Luke 6:31), and against basic human fairness, “Don’t do to others what you wouldn’t want done to you.”  

But what about the martyrs we read about who died for their faith?  

We need to understand that some people who died for their faith were called to publicly preach and share Jesus’ kingdom. Others just had to live with their own private faith. The first group, if they were killed for proving that Jesus rose from the dead, were true martyrs. A martyr is someone who witnesses Jesus’ resurrection, and only those who saw Jesus after he rose can truly do that. If they didn’t see him, their testimony isn’t valid.
