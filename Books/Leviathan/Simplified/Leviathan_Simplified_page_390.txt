First, there are the words of Solomon: “Then the dust returns to dust, as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.” This might mean, if there’s no other text saying otherwise, that only God knows what happens to a person’s spirit after they die, not humans. Solomon also says, “All go to the same place; all are made of dust, and all return to dust again. Who knows if the spirit of a person goes up and the spirit of an animal goes down to the earth?” This means that no one knows except God. It’s common to say, “God knows what” or “God knows where” about things we don’t understand.

In Genesis, it says, “Enoch walked with God, and he was not, because God took him.” Hebrews explains this as Enoch being taken so he wouldn’t die because he pleased God. This shows that being taken by God like this happens only to those who please Him, not to everyone, and it depends on God’s grace, not just nature.

On the other hand, Solomon also says, “What happens to people happens to animals too; they both die the same way. They all have the same breath, so people are not better than animals; everything is meaningless.” This literal meaning shows there is no natural immortality of the soul. But this doesn’t contradict the idea of eternal life that God gives to those chosen by grace.

Solomon also says, “It’s better to have never been born than to live.” If everyone’s soul was naturally immortal, this would be a strange thing to say because having an immortal soul would be worse than having no soul at all.

He also says, “The living know they will die, but the dead don’t know anything.” This means naturally, before the resurrection of the body.

Another place that seems to support the soul living naturally forever is when Jesus says Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are alive. But this refers to God’s promise that they will rise again, not that they are actually living now. It’s like when God said Adam would die if he ate from the tree; Adam was considered dead by sentence from that moment but didn’t actually die for almost a thousand years.
