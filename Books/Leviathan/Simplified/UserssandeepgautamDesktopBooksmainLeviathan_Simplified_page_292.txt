According to this idea, a kingdom belongs to God. But since Moses didn’t have the right to lead the Israelites by inheriting it from Abraham, it seems the people only had to follow him as long as they believed God was really talking to him. So, even though they made a promise to God, Moses’ power depended on whether they thought he was holy, really talked to God, and performed real miracles. If they stopped believing that, they didn’t have to obey the laws he gave them, even if he said they came from God.

We need to think about why they had to obey him at all. It couldn’t just be because God told them to, since God didn’t speak to them directly—only through Moses. Jesus said about himself, “If I testify about myself, my testimony isn't true,” so it’s even less believable that Moses could prove his own right to rule. That means Moses’ power, like any king’s power, had to come from the people agreeing to follow him. And they did agree: after seeing thunder, lightning, trumpet sounds, and the mountain smoking, the people stepped back and said to Moses, “You talk to us, we will listen, but don’t let God talk to us directly or we will die.” This was their promise to obey Moses and follow whatever he said came from God.

Even though the kingdom was meant to be a priestly kingdom passed down to Aaron’s family, that only applied after Moses died. Anyone who sets up a government—whether a kingdom, a group of rulers, or a democracy—has to have full power while they’re building it. The Bible clearly says Moses had this power. First, because the people promised to obey Moses himself, not Aaron. Second, God told Moses to come near to Him alone, not Aaron or the others, showing Moses’ special authority.
