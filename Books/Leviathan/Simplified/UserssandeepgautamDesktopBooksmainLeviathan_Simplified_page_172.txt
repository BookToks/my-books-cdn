When it comes to understanding written laws, the person who writes a commentary about them is not the real interpreter. Commentaries often cause more arguments than the original text, so you end up needing more commentaries, and this goes on forever. Unless there is an official interpreter chosen by the ruler, judges have to interpret the laws themselves, just like they do with unwritten laws. Their decisions are for the case they are dealing with but don’t force other judges to decide the same way. Judges can make mistakes in interpreting laws, but a lower judge’s mistake doesn’t change the law, which is the ruler’s final decision.

People often talk about the difference between the letter and the meaning of the law. If the letter means just the exact words, that’s clear. Most words can be confusing or used in different ways, but the law only has one true meaning. If the letter means the literal meaning, then the letter and the real meaning of the law are the same. The literal meaning is what the lawmaker wanted the law to mean. The lawmaker is always assumed to want fairness. So, if the words don’t clearly support a fair decision, the judge should use natural law or wait for more guidance.

For example, a law says that if someone is forced out of their house, they should be put back in by force. If someone accidentally leaves their house empty and then is kept out by force, there’s no special law for this, but it should still count under the same law because the lawmaker wouldn’t want someone to have no solution. Another example is a law that says judges should decide based on evidence. If a man is wrongly accused of something the judge saw was done by someone else, the judge shouldn’t follow the letter of the law to punish the innocent. Instead, the judge should ask the ruler to appoint a different judge and act as a witness himself.
