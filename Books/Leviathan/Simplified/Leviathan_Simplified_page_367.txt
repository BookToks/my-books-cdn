Obedience is sometimes called charity and love because it means wanting to obey. Jesus teaches us that loving God and loving others is the same as following all the rules. Obedience is also called righteousness because it means wanting to do what’s right and follow the laws. It’s sometimes called repentance because turning away from sin is like choosing to obey again. So, anyone who truly wants to follow God’s commands, feels sorry for their mistakes, or loves God and others has all the obedience needed to be part of God’s kingdom. If God wanted perfect innocence, no one could be saved.

But what rules did God give us? Are all the laws given to the Jews by Moses really God’s commands? If yes, why don’t Christians have to follow them? If not, then what laws are God’s besides the laws of nature?

Jesus didn’t give new laws but advised us to follow the laws we already have. These are the laws of nature and the rules set by our leaders. In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus didn’t make new laws for the Jews but explained the laws they already had. So, God’s laws are really just the laws of nature. The main one is that we must keep our promises, which means obeying our government leaders because we agree to follow them together. This law from God means we should obey all the Bible’s rules only if our government has made them official laws. Otherwise, the Bible’s rules are just advice, and we can choose not to follow them without being unfair.

Now that we know what kind of obedience is needed for salvation and who we must obey, the next thing to think about is faith—who we believe in, why, and what beliefs are necessary to be saved. First, we can only believe someone if we know what they say. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and the prophets believed in God because He spoke to them in a supernatural way. The apostles and disciples who were with Jesus believed in Him personally.
