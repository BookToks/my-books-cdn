Another leftover from old pagan religions is the worship of images. This was not started by Moses in the Old Testament, nor by Jesus in the New Testament. It also wasn’t brought from other nations, but stayed around even after people began following Christ. Before Jesus taught, many people worshipped things they saw in their minds, which were caused by things outside but only existed in their brains. These are called ideas, idols, or phantasms. They were like pictures or dreams, not real gods.

This is why St. Paul said, “We know that an idol is nothing.” He didn’t mean that statues made of metal, stone, or wood were worthless, but that what people thought was a god in those statues was just made up in their minds. It wasn’t real and didn’t actually live or move. Worshiping these made-up things is called idolatry, which means rebelling against God.

God was the King of the Jews, and Moses and the high priests were His leaders. If people were allowed to pray to images, which are just copies of their own ideas, they wouldn’t rely on the true God or His leaders. Everyone would just do whatever they wanted, causing chaos and destruction. That’s why God’s first rule was that they should only worship the one true God, who talked to Moses and gave laws to keep them safe and peaceful. The second rule was that they should not make any images to worship, because that would be like putting another king in charge.

Some parts of the Bible seem to support having images to worship, like the cherubim over God’s Ark or the bronze serpent. Other parts talk about worshipping things related to God, like His footstool, or honoring holy objects. But before looking at those examples, it’s important to understand what worship means and what images and idols really are.
