If a ruler tries to take something by pretending to have power, no one can sue them for it. That’s because everything the ruler does is done with the permission of the people, so suing the ruler is like suing yourself.

If a king or ruling group promises freedom to some people but then can’t keep them safe, the promise doesn’t count unless the ruler gives up their power to someone else. If the ruler didn’t clearly give up power, it means they didn’t want to, and the promise was made without knowing it conflicts with their power. So, the ruler still has all the power needed to protect the people, like making laws, going to war, and collecting money.

People have to obey the ruler as long as the ruler can protect them. If the ruler can’t protect them, people have the natural right to protect themselves, and this right can’t be taken away by any agreement. The ruler’s power is like the soul of the country—if the power leaves, the people lose their direction.

People obey because they want protection. Even if a ruler is supposed to rule forever, in reality, they can be overthrown by war or ruined by fights inside the country.

If someone is captured in war and allowed to live only if they obey the winner, they can choose to accept and become the winner’s subject to survive. The same applies if they are held in a foreign country under the same rules.

But if a person is locked up and not trusted with freedom, they are not really bound to obey and can try to escape however they can.
