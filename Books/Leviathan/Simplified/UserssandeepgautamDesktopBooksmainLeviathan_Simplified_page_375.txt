When Jesus saw a rich man, He told him, “Sell everything you have, give the money to the poor, and come follow me.” This meant the man should trust Jesus, who is the true king. So, to follow the law and believe Jesus is the king is all you need to get eternal life.

St. Paul said, “The just shall live by faith,” meaning only those who are just, or good, will live by believing. So, faith and wanting to be good (which is called repentance) are all you need for eternal life. Jesus also said, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is near; repent and believe the good news that Christ has come.”

This means to be saved, you need to say sorry for your wrongs and believe Jesus is the Christ.

Since both faith and obedience (which is part of repentance) are needed for salvation, people argue about which one actually makes us right with God. But it’s not wrong to look at how each one helps.

First, if being righteous means doing perfect works, no one could be saved because everyone breaks God’s law. So, when we say people are made right by works, it really means the will to do good, which God accepts as if it were the actual work, whether the person is good or bad.

In this way, a person is called just or unjust based on their will, and this makes them “right” with God. This doesn’t mean they have fully obeyed the law or that their sins are gone, but that God accepts them as just.

Also, a person is made right when their effort to follow the law, even if not perfect, is accepted by God. God doesn’t accept just the effort, but He does accept it because of faith. So, faith makes the effort count.

Therefore, both faith and obedience are needed for salvation, but each is said to make us right with God in different ways.
