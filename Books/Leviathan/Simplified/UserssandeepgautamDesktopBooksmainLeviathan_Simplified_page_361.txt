Peter and the other Apostles are supposed to be judges of the world.

The mistake in the first argument is that it says every part of a country depends on each other like parts of a body. It’s true they stick together, but they really only depend on the leader, who is like the soul of the country. If the leader fails, the country breaks apart into chaos, and no one works together because there is no one to follow. This is like how a body breaks down without a soul to hold it together. So, you can’t say that regular people depend on the church leaders or that government officials depend on religious leaders. Both depend on the country’s leader, who should make laws that help people’s souls but isn’t controlled by anyone except God. This shows the first argument is tricky and tries to confuse people who don’t know the difference between how actions are connected and how people are in charge of each other. Every goal has certain ways to reach it, set by nature or God, but the power to make people follow these ways belongs to the country’s leader, because people promise to obey them.

The second argument says: “Every country is complete on its own and can tell other countries what to do if they are not under its control. It can even remove their leader and put someone else in charge if it needs to protect itself. So, a spiritual country (the church) can tell a political country to change its government, remove princes, and choose new ones if it needs to protect spiritual well-being.” It is true that a country can do whatever it needs to defend itself, and this has already been explained before.
