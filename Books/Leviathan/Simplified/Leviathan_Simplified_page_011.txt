Schools say that heavy things fall down because they want to rest and stay where they belong. They think these things have a desire and know what’s best for them, which is silly because things that aren’t alive can’t really want or know anything.

When something starts moving, it keeps moving forever unless something stops it. And if something does stop it, it doesn’t happen right away but slowly over time. Like when the wind stops blowing, the waves in the water keep moving for a while. The same happens inside us when we see or dream. Even after we close our eyes or the thing we saw is gone, we still remember a picture of it, but it’s not as clear. The Latins called this “imagination” because it comes from the image we see, but they use the word for all senses, which isn’t quite right. The Greeks called it “fancy,” meaning an appearance, which fits all senses better. So, imagination is just a weaker version of our senses, and it happens in people and many animals, whether they are awake or asleep.

When we’re awake, the weakening of our senses doesn’t mean the sense stops working; it just gets covered up, like the sun’s light hiding the stars. The stars still shine, but the sun’s light is stronger, so we don’t notice the stars during the day. The same happens with our senses: when many things are happening, we only notice the strongest one. When something disappears from our sight, we still remember it, but new things happening make that memory weaker, like a voice getting lost in loud noise. That’s why the longer the time after seeing or sensing something, the weaker the memory or imagination becomes. Our bodies keep changing, and the parts that sensed things get destroyed over time. So, time and distance have the same effect on us. Just like things far away look blurry and voices sound faint, our memories of past things get weaker. For example, after a long time, we forget many streets in cities we’ve seen or details of things that happened.
