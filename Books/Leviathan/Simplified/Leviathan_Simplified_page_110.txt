People do things because of what they believe, and controlling what people believe is how you control what they do, which helps keep peace and harmony.

Even though only the truth matters when it comes to beliefs, it’s still important to manage those beliefs so they don’t cause fights. A belief that causes trouble can’t be true, just like peace and harmony can’t go against nature. Sometimes, in a country where leaders don’t do their job well, wrong ideas become popular, and true ideas might upset people. But bringing in new truths quickly doesn’t cause peace to break, it just sometimes starts fights. People who are badly ruled and fight to protect or spread their beliefs are still at war. They don’t live in peace but in a kind of constant battle. So, the one in charge must decide what beliefs are allowed to keep peace and stop civil war.

The person in charge also has the power to set rules so everyone knows what things they can own and what actions they can do without others bothering them. This is called property. Before there was a ruler, everyone thought they had a right to everything, which caused fighting. Property is needed for peace and depends on the ruler’s power. These rules about property and what is right or wrong are called civil laws. Civil laws are the rules of each country, though the term usually refers to the old laws of Rome, which were very important long ago.

The ruler also has the right to judge and decide all arguments about the laws or facts. Without someone to settle disputes, people can’t protect themselves from being hurt by others. Laws about property would be useless, and everyone would have to defend themselves, which would lead to war. This would go against why countries exist in the first place.
