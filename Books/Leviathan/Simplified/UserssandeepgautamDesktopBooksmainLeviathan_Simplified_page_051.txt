What do these words mean: “The first cause does not necessarily make the second cause do anything, because the second causes are naturally below the first, and they might just help it to work”? These words come from the title of the sixth chapter in Suarez’s first book, called Of the Concourse, Motion, and Help of God. When people write whole books like this, aren’t they crazy, or just trying to confuse others?

Especially about transubstantiation; after certain words are said, those who believe say that things like whiteness, roundness, size, quality, and the fact that things can decay—all of which are not physical—leave the wafer and go into the body of Jesus. Don’t they make these “nesses,” “tudes,” and “ties” into spirits that live in his body? Because by spirits, they mean things that aren’t physical but can still move from one place to another. This kind of idea is really silly and can be seen as a type of madness. And all the times they stop arguing or writing like this, it’s just a clear break from their usual crazy ideas. That’s what I think about smart thinking and its mistakes.

There are two kinds of knowledge. One is knowing facts, and the other is knowing how one statement follows from another. Knowing facts is just using your senses and memory, and it’s full knowledge; like when we see something happen or remember it happening. This is the kind of knowledge a witness needs. The other kind is called science, and it depends on conditions; like when we know that if a shape is a circle, then any line through its center will split it into two equal parts. This is the kind of knowledge a philosopher, or someone who reasons, needs.

The record of knowing facts is called history, and there are two types: natural history, which is about facts or effects in nature that don’t depend on people’s choices—like the history of metals, plants, animals, and places; and civil history, which is about the choices and actions people make in societies.

Books that show how one statement proves another are called books of philosophy. There are many kinds, depending on the subject, and I have divided them in a table that follows.
