It can’t be said that someone who worships in a certain way is causing others to stumble or sin. Even if a person is very smart or educated and worships like that, other people can’t assume they agree with it. They might just be doing it because they are afraid, and it’s not really their choice but the choice of their leader.

Worshipping God in a special place, or facing an image or a certain spot while praying, doesn’t mean you are worshipping the place or the image itself. It means you recognize that place or image as holy. Holy means set apart for God, not that the place or image has some special power. This is not idolatry. For example, it wasn’t idolatry to worship God in front of the bronze serpent, or for the Jews to face the temple in Jerusalem when they prayed outside their country. Moses took off his shoes at the burning bush because that ground was holy, chosen by God to give the laws to Israel. It wasn’t holy by itself, but because God set it apart. Christians worship in churches that have been officially dedicated to God by their leaders.

But if someone worships God as if He lives inside an image or place, that is idolatry. Thinking that God, who is infinite, fits into a small image or spot is wrong. Those are just fake gods made up by people’s minds, and the Bible calls them lies and nothing. Also, worshipping an image or place to remind yourself of God is idolatry if that image or place was set up without permission from true church leaders. The commandment says, “You shall not make any carved images.” God told Moses to put up the bronze serpent, and that was allowed because God commanded it. But when Aaron and the people made the golden calf without God’s permission, it was idolatry. They worshipped it as God and made it for religious use without authority from God or Moses.
