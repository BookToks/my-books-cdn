Sometimes, in a government, there can be more than one main group in charge. For example, one group controls the money, another person makes decisions and gives orders, and a third group makes the laws. This can cause problems because they don’t always agree. Sometimes, good laws don’t get made, or the government doesn’t have enough money to work properly. Even though some people call this a mixed monarchy, it’s really like having three separate groups all acting like rulers instead of one united government.

In God’s kingdom, there can be three persons who are all one, but with people, who have different opinions, this can’t happen. So if the king represents the people, the general assembly also represents the people, and another group represents part of the people, they are not one ruler but three different rulers.

I’m not sure what illness in a person’s body matches this kind of problem in a government. But I once saw a man who had another man growing out of his side, with his own head, arms, chest, and stomach. If he had another man on the other side too, that would be a perfect example.

So far, I’ve talked about the biggest and most serious problems a government can have. There are other smaller problems worth mentioning. One is how hard it can be to get money for important needs, especially before a war. This happens because people believe their land and things belong only to them, not to the government. Because of this, the government, which knows what dangers are coming, tries to get money but people hold on tightly to their property. The government tries to avoid conflict for as long as possible, but when it can’t, it uses laws or force to get some money. This money is usually not enough, so the government has to keep fighting to get what it needs. If the government can’t manage this, the people either learn to cooperate or the whole country falls apart.
