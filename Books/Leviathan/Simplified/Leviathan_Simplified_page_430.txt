Is it because they often cause trouble in the government by supporting rebellion or unrest? Then they should be stopped, and the teachers punished, by the authority responsible for keeping peace; which is the government. Any power that church leaders take for themselves (where they are under the state), even if they say it comes from God, is actually just taking power they don’t have.

Cicero, a famous Roman, once talked about a judge named Cassius who had a way to decide criminal cases. If the witnesses didn’t give enough proof, he would ask the accusers, “Who benefits?” meaning, who gains something like money, honor, or happiness from the crime? This helps show who might have caused it. Using this idea, I want to look at who has kept people trapped with these religious ideas that go against peaceful society.

First, there’s the wrong idea that the current Church on earth is the kingdom of God (which means heaven or the promised land, not the kingdom of grace, which is just a promise of that land). Because of this belief, church leaders say they have the right to lead the Church, and since the Church and government are seen as one, they also claim the right to rule the country. This is how the Pope convinced people that disobeying him was the same as disobeying Christ, and that in any fight between the Pope and kings, people should ignore their rulers. This gave the Pope power over all Christian lands.

At first, church leaders had power only as teachers under Christian emperors in the Roman Empire, and the title Pontifex Maximus was an official role under the government. But after the Roman Empire broke up, they gave themselves a new title, the right of St. Peter, to keep their power and even grow it over Christian areas that were no longer part of the Empire.
