In Acts 6:3, it’s clear that even though the Apostles picked the seven men, the whole group of people actually chose them too. This is made even clearer in Acts 6:5, where it says everyone agreed with the choice.

In the Old Testament, only the tribe of Levi could be priests or hold other church jobs. The other tribes got land, but Levi did not. When the tribe of Joseph was split into Ephraim and Manasseh, there were still twelve tribes.

The Levites were given certain cities to live in, along with land nearby for their animals. But instead of land, they were given a tenth of the crops from the other tribes. The priests got a tenth of that tenth, plus part of the offerings and sacrifices.

God told Aaron, “You won’t get land or a share of the land like the others; I am your inheritance” (Numbers 18:20). Since God was their King at the time, He chose the Levites to serve Him, and He gave them the tithes and offerings as their support. This is what God meant when He said, “I am your inheritance.”

Because of this, the Levites were called clergy, which comes from a word meaning “inheritance” or “lot.” It doesn’t mean they were special heirs to God’s kingdom, just that God’s inheritance was how they were taken care of. Since God was King, and Moses, Aaron, and the other high priests worked for Him, the right to collect tithes and offerings was also supported by the government.

Even after the Israelites asked for a human king instead of God, the Levites still got their tithes because the kings didn’t take that away. The king controlled public money, and until the Captivity, the king was in charge. After the people returned from the Captivity, they still gave tithes to the priests as before. So, church life and money were controlled by the government at that time.
