Thirdly, what is a Christian Commonwealth?

Lastly, what is the Kingdom of Darkness?

About the first, people often say that wisdom comes not from reading books, but from learning about people. Because of this, some people who don’t really show true wisdom like to prove how much they know by judging others behind their backs.

But there is another saying, not understood much these days, that could help them really understand others if they tried. It is “Know yourself.” This was not meant to support bad behavior by people in power or to encourage rude behavior from those below them. Instead, it teaches us that if we look inside ourselves and think about how and why we feel hope, fear, or desire, we can understand what others feel in similar situations.

I mean the feelings themselves that are the same in everyone—like wanting something, being afraid, or hoping—not the exact things we want or fear. Those differ because of each person’s nature and life experience, and people hide their true feelings with lies or pretending. Only someone who truly understands hearts can read these feelings well.

Even though we can sometimes guess what people want by how they act, doing this without comparing it to how we feel can lead to mistakes. We might trust too much or not enough, depending on whether we ourselves are good or bad people.

But if one person studies another’s actions very carefully, it only helps him understand a few people. Someone who wants to lead a whole country must understand not just individuals but people in general. This is very hard, even harder than learning a language or science.

When I explain my own understanding clearly, the hard part for others will be to see if they feel the same inside themselves. This kind of truth can only be proven by looking inside oneself.
