That means God made him a living being. When it says, “all Scripture is given by inspiration from God” (II Timothy, 3:16), talking about the Old Testament, it means God guided the minds of the writers to write things that would help teach, correct, and guide people to live right.

But when St. Peter says, “Prophecy did not come by the will of man, but holy men spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit” (II Peter, 1:21), the Holy Spirit here means God’s voice in a dream or vision, which is different from inspiration. Also, when Jesus breathed on His disciples and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit,” His breath was a sign of the spiritual gifts He gave them, not the Spirit itself.

Even though it’s said that many people, including Jesus, were full of the Holy Spirit, this doesn’t mean they had God’s actual substance inside them. It means they had many gifts from God, like living a holy life or speaking in different languages, which they got either naturally or through effort. These gifts are always from God.

When God says, “I will pour out my Spirit on all people, and your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions” (Joel, 2:28), it doesn’t mean His Spirit is like water to be poured out. It means God promised to give people prophetic dreams and visions. Saying graces from God are “infused” is wrong because graces are qualities, not physical things you can pour into someone.

Similarly, saying that good or evil spirits enter people to make them prophesy or act crazy is not what Scripture means. The Spirit there means God’s power working in ways we don’t understand. The wind that filled the house when the Apostles were gathered on Pentecost (Acts, 2:2) is not the Holy Spirit itself, which is God. It’s a sign from God showing He was working in their hearts to give them the gifts they needed to do their work.
