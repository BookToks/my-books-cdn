Some systems are under the control of others; some are political, and some are private. Political systems (also called bodies politic and persons in law) are made by the official power of the government. Private systems are created by people on their own or by authority from someone outside. No power from a foreign government inside another country is public there; it’s always private.

Among private systems, some are legal and some are illegal. Legal ones are allowed by the government; all others are illegal.

Irregular systems don’t have a leader and just involve groups of people coming together. If the government doesn’t forbid them and they don’t have bad intentions (like people gathering for markets, shows, or other harmless reasons), they are legal. But if the purpose is bad or the group is large and unknown, they are illegal.

In political bodies, the power of the leader is always limited. The limits are set by the highest power, called the sovereign. Unlimited power means total control. The sovereign represents everyone in the country, so no one else can represent any part of the people unless the sovereign allows it. Giving full control to another group would mean giving up part of the government, which would harm the country’s peace and safety. The sovereign won’t do this unless it’s clearly stated, and if the words seem to say that but other signs say no, then it’s probably a mistake or misunderstanding.

The limits of the power given to a leader in a political body come from two things: their official orders from the sovereign and the laws of the country.

When a country is first created and independent, there’s no need for written orders because its leader’s power is only limited by natural law. But in smaller groups under the main government, there are many rules about what they can do, when, and where. These rules can’t be remembered without written orders, which must be official and sealed by the sovereign’s authority so they can be shown to the people.
