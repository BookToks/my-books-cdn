First, I will talk about how people think. I will look at single thoughts first, and then how they connect to each other. Each single thought is like a picture or idea of something we notice outside of us, called an object. This object affects our eyes, ears, and other body parts, and because it affects them in different ways, we get different pictures or ideas.

All of these come from what we call sense. There is no idea in a person’s mind that didn’t start from what the senses first picked up, either completely or partly. All other thoughts come from these original senses.

Knowing exactly how sense works in a natural way isn’t super important right now, and I have written about it a lot somewhere else.

But to keep things clear in this explanation, I will quickly explain it here. Sense happens because something outside, the object, pushes on the body part that works with that sense. Sometimes it pushes directly, like when we taste or touch things. Other times it pushes through something else, like when we see, hear, or smell.

This push travels through nerves and other parts of the body to the brain and heart. There, it causes a kind of push back or effort from the heart to push out. This effort feels like something outside of us, and that feeling is what we call sense.

For example, what the eye senses is light or color. The ear senses sound. The nose senses smell. The tongue senses taste. And the rest of the body senses things like heat, cold, hardness, or softness. All these things we can feel come from the object moving or pressing on our body parts in different ways.
