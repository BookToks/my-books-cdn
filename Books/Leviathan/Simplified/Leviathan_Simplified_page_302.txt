Back when the Jews had their own government, both the leaders and the people were waiting for the Messiah and the kingdom of God. They wouldn’t have expected this if their laws didn’t allow the Messiah to show who he really was when he came. Since Jesus didn’t break any laws, but instead taught and performed miracles to prove he was the Messiah, he wasn’t doing anything wrong. 

He said his kingdom would be in another world. Meanwhile, he told people to listen to their leaders and even told them to pay taxes to Caesar. He didn’t try to take charge or be a judge. So, how could what he said or did be a threat to their government? But God planned for Jesus to be a sacrifice to bring people back to Him, and He used the jealousy and ungratefulness of others to make this happen. 

This wasn’t against Caesar’s laws either. Even Pilate, the Roman governor, said Jesus did nothing wrong before he let the Jews have him crucified. Pilate put a sign on Jesus’ cross that said “King of the Jews,” not “pretender to be king,” and refused to change it, saying, “What I have written, I have written.” Jesus’ role as king wasn’t supposed to start until after his resurrection. 

When that time comes, Jesus will be king not only as God, which He already is everywhere because He’s all-powerful, but also specially as king of those who believe in Him through baptism. That’s why Jesus said his apostles would sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel, “When the Son of Man shall sit in the throne of his glory.” This means Jesus will rule in his human form then. 

He will come in glory with his angels and reward everyone based on what they have done. We can read about this in the Bible, like in Mark and Luke, where Jesus says he is giving his apostles a kingdom to rule with him. So, it’s clear that Jesus’ kingdom won’t start until he comes back in glory and makes his apostles judges over Israel.
