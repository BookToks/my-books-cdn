I want to add this to the Laws of Nature from Chapter 15: every person should try their best to protect the authority that keeps them safe during peace when there is a war. If someone says they have a natural right to protect themselves, they can’t also say they have the right to destroy the power that protects them. That would be a clear contradiction. Even though this idea comes from other laws already mentioned, it’s important to remind people of it now.

I’ve seen some English books recently that show people still don’t understand when a person has to obey a conqueror, what conquest really means, or why people have to follow the laws of the conqueror. So, to clear this up, I say a person becomes subject to a conqueror when they freely agree to be his subject, either by saying it or showing it clearly. When can someone agree like this? I explained it at the end of Chapter 21: if a person only owes loyalty as an ordinary subject to their old ruler, they can submit to the new power when their way of living is controlled by the enemy’s soldiers. That’s when they are no longer protected by their old ruler but by the enemy, and they pay for that protection. Since paying the enemy is unavoidable and considered legal, fully submitting to the enemy can’t be illegal. Also, those who submit only help the enemy a little, while those who refuse help the enemy a lot more, so submission is actually less helpful to the enemy than refusal.

But if someone has a special role as a soldier and owes more than just ordinary loyalty, they can’t submit to a new power while their old ruler still controls the land and supports them with food and shelter in the army. In this case, they still have protection and don’t have a right to switch sides.

But if that support ends, a soldier can look for protection wherever they think they’ll be safest and can lawfully submit to a new leader. That’s when it’s okay to do this. If they do, they must be loyal to their new leader because a legal agreement can’t be broken.
