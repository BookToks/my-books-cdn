Thoughts are like scouts that go out to find what we want, and they help keep our minds steady and quick. Having no desires is like being dead. Having weak feelings makes you dull. Having strong feelings for everything makes you confused and distracted. But having very strong feelings more than most people have is what people call madness.

There are almost as many kinds of madness as there are feelings. Sometimes, strong feelings come from a problem with the body, or damage to it. Sometimes, strong feelings hurt the body themselves. But in both cases, madness is the same kind of problem.

Madness comes from either too much pride or feeling very down.

Pride can make a person angry. When anger is too much, it becomes madness called rage or fury. For example, wanting revenge too much can hurt the body and turn into rage. Loving someone too much, mixed with jealousy, also turns into rage. Thinking too highly of yourself, like believing you are wise or special, can make you confused and dizzy. If you add envy to that, it turns into rage. Being very sure you are right, especially when others disagree, also causes rage.

Feeling very down makes a person scared for no reason. This madness is called melancholy and can show up in many ways, like staying alone in quiet places, acting superstitious, or being afraid of certain people or things. In short, strange and unusual behavior caused by strong feelings is called madness. There are many kinds of madness, and if someone wanted to study them, they could find a lot. If extreme feelings are madness, then all strong feelings that lead to bad things are different levels of madness.

For example, even if one person who thinks they are inspired doesnâ€™t act very crazy, when many of them get together, their anger is easy to see. What could be crazier than a big crowd yelling, hitting, and throwing stones at our best friends?
