When it comes to physics, which is understanding the reasons behind natural events, they don’t really explain anything—just use fancy words.

If you want to know why some things naturally fall down toward the earth and others go up, the Schools will tell you, following Aristotle, that things that fall are heavy, and that heaviness makes them go down. But if you ask what heaviness means, they say it’s a kind of effort to go toward the center of the earth. So basically, things fall or rise just because they do. Or they say the center of the earth is a resting place for heavy things, so they try to get there. That’s like saying stones and metals want to be at the center, like people want to rest, or that a piece of glass would feel safer on the ground than in a window.

If you want to know why the same thing looks bigger sometimes and smaller other times without changing its size, they say it’s because sometimes it’s “condensed” and sometimes “rarefied.” But what do those words really mean?

Condensed means the same stuff is somehow less in amount, and rarefied means it’s more. That’s like saying matter can have no exact size at first, and later get bigger or smaller, which doesn’t make sense. Size is just how much space something takes up, so it can’t just change like that without adding or losing something.

For the soul of a person, they say it is “poured in” when created. For sensing, they explain it as the presence of “appearances” of things: when these are seen, it’s sight; when heard, it’s hearing; when tasted, it’s taste; when smelled, it’s smell; and when touched, it’s feeling.

For why we decide to do something, called will, they say it’s just because people have the ability to want different things at different times. They make this ability the cause of our actions, which is like saying the reason people do good or bad things is just because they can choose to do them.
