It is true that God is the ruler of the whole earth; but He can also be the king of a special and chosen group of people. This is no more strange than a general who commands an entire army also having his own special group of soldiers. God rules the earth by His power, but He rules His chosen people by a special promise. I will talk more about God’s kingdom, both by nature and by promise, later.

Religion starts from simple ideas, like believing in a god and invisible supernatural powers. These ideas can never completely disappear from human nature. Because of this, new religions can always be created by people who are respected and want to make them.

All religions begin because many people believe in one person. They don’t just think this person is smart and wants them to be happy, but also that this person is holy and that God shows him special messages. So, when the leaders of a religion are doubted for their wisdom, honesty, or love, or cannot show proof of divine messages, people will naturally start to doubt and reject that religion unless the government forces them to stay loyal.

If the person who starts a religion asks people to believe things that contradict each other, it ruins their reputation for being wise. Both sides of a contradiction can’t be true, so asking people to believe both shows ignorance. This makes people doubt all the other things that person says come from God. A person might get messages from God about many things, but never anything that goes against natural reason.

If the leader is not honest—if they do or say things that show they don’t really believe what they ask others to believe—they lose trust. Such actions are called scandalous because they cause people to lose faith in the religion. Examples are being unfair, cruel, greedy, or living a life of too much luxury.
