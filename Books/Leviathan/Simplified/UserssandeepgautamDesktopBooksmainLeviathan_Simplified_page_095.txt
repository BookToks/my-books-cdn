So, the ninth law of nature says that everyone should see others as equals by nature. When someone breaks this rule, it’s called pride.

Because of this law, there’s another rule: when people agree to live peacefully, no one should keep a right for themselves that they wouldn’t want everyone else to have too. To live in peace, people need to give up some natural freedoms, like doing anything they want, but they must keep some rights, like controlling their own bodies, breathing air, using water, moving around, and other basic needs. If someone asks for something only for themselves but wouldn’t want others to have it, they break the rule of natural equality and go against the law of nature. People who follow this rule are modest, and those who break it are arrogant. The Greeks called breaking this rule pleonexia, which means wanting more than your fair share.

Also, if someone is trusted to judge between people, the law of nature says they must be fair to everyone. Without fairness, people would only solve problems by fighting.

So, if a judge is unfair, they stop people from trusting judges and arbitrators, and this breaks the fundamental law of nature and causes war.

Following this law, giving each person what is rightfully theirs, is called fairness or distributive justice. Breaking it, by favoring some people over others, is called bias.

From this, another rule comes: things that can’t be divided should be shared together if possible. If there’s enough of something, everyone should get their share. If not, it should be divided fairly based on how many people have rights to it. Otherwise, it’s unfair and goes against fairness.

But some things can’t be shared or divided at all. Then, the law of nature says fairness requires deciding who gets it by chance, like drawing lots, or by taking turns. This is the only fair way to decide.

There are two types of lots: arbitrary and natural. Arbitrary means the people involved agree on how to choose. Natural means it’s decided by birth order (called primogeniture by the Greeks, meaning given by lot) or by whoever takes it first.
