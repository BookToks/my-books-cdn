People often can’t tell the difference between one action done by many people and many actions done by a group. For example, they might mix up all the senators working together to kill Catiline with several senators each doing their own part in killing Caesar. Because of this, they sometimes think the whole group did something when really it was just many people acting separately, maybe influenced by one person.

When people don’t understand the reasons behind what’s right and fair, they tend to follow habits and examples instead. They might think something is wrong just because it has been punished before, or right because it was allowed before—kind of like how kids learn what’s good or bad by what their parents say. But unlike kids who stick to these rules, adults change their minds depending on what benefits them. They switch between following customs and using reason to justify whatever suits them best. This is why people keep arguing about what’s right and wrong, while things like math don’t cause the same fights, because math doesn’t affect anyone’s power or money.

For example, if someone tried to say that the three angles of a triangle equal the two angles of a square, and this idea went against the interests of those in power, they would probably try to stop people from learning it by banning books or other means.

People also don’t understand the deeper reasons behind events, so they blame the things they can see. That’s why when people are upset about paying taxes, they get angry at the tax collectors or officials, and join those who complain about the government. But when they go too far, they might end up attacking the top leaders too, either because they’re afraid of getting in trouble or embarrassed to ask for forgiveness.
