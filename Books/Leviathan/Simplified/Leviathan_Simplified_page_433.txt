Tenth, the church leaders get rich by teaching about purgatory, doing good works to be saved, and selling indulgences.

Eleventh, they use scary ideas about demons and exorcisms to make people fear their power.

Finally, the complicated ideas of Aristotle, the confusing language, and strange terms taught in universities (all controlled by the Pope) help hide these mistakes. They make people think fake philosophy is the true message of the Bible.

If that wasn’t enough, they also have other secret teachings that clearly help them take control over kings and rulers. These teachings help them keep power and get rich. So, looking at who benefits, we can say the Pope, the Roman church leaders, and anyone who supports this wrong teaching are the ones causing all this spiritual confusion. They try to make people believe the church on earth is God’s kingdom.

But the emperors and kings who ruled when these wrong ideas started spreading also share some blame. They let it happen because they didn’t see what was coming or understand the plans of these church leaders. Without their permission, these bad ideas wouldn’t have been allowed. They could have stopped it early on, but once people believed these church leaders, no one could fix it.

We have to wait for God’s help, who always stops the plans of those who lie. Sometimes God lets the bad guys grow stronger so people will finally see the truth. When people try to fight these church leaders too soon, it only makes the leaders stronger, like a fishing net breaking when too many fish struggle.
