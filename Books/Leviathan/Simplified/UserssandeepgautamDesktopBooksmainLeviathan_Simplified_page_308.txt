Jesus said, “As my Father sent me, I send you.” But Jesus was sent to convince the Jews to come back to God and to invite other people to accept God’s kingdom. He was not sent to rule like a king or act as God’s helper until the day of judgment.

The time between Jesus going up to heaven and the final resurrection is not a time when he is ruling. It is a time called regeneration, which means getting people ready for Jesus’ second and glorious coming on judgment day. Jesus said, “You who have followed me during this time will also sit on twelve thrones when the Son of Man sits in glory.” Paul said we should be ready with the gospel of peace. Jesus compared this work to fishing—not by forcing people, but by persuading them. He did not say his followers would be hunters who catch people by force, but fishers who bring people in gently. It’s also like yeast, planting seeds, or growing a tiny mustard seed—none of these use force. So, during this time, Jesus is not actually ruling. Instead, his followers share the good news and prepare people for his return, just like John the Baptist prepared people for Jesus’ first coming.

Also, Jesus’ followers are supposed to help people believe in him. Faith doesn’t come from being forced or told to believe. It comes from being sure or convinced by good reasons or things people already believe. So, Jesus’ followers don’t have the power to punish anyone for not believing or for disagreeing with them. If they have political power, then they can enforce laws, but not because they are Jesus’ ministers. Paul said clearly, “We have no control over your faith; we only help you be happy.” Another reason why Jesus’ followers don’t have the right to command others is because Jesus gave rulers, both Christians and non-Christians, the lawful authority to lead.
