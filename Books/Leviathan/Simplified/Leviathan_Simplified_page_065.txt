Not knowing how natural things work makes people believe in impossible stuff because they don’t know anything that proves it can’t be true.

People like to be listened to when they talk, so this makes them want to lie. So, just not knowing enough can make someone believe lies, tell lies, and sometimes even make up lies without meaning to hurt anyone.

Worrying about the future makes people want to understand why things happen, because knowing why helps them make better choices now.

Curiosity makes people look for the reason behind things, then the reason behind that reason, and so on, until they realize there must be a first cause that has no cause before it, which people call God. So, if you really think about why things happen, you’ll probably believe there’s one eternal God, even if you can’t fully imagine what God is like. It’s like a blind person who feels heat from a fire and knows the fire causes it but can’t picture what fire looks like. In the same way, people see the world and how it works and believe there’s a cause called God, even though they can’t picture Him in their minds.

People who don’t try to understand why things happen still get scared because they don’t know who or what controls good or bad things. So, they make up invisible powers to be afraid of and pray to when they’re in trouble or want to say thanks when things go well. Because of this, people have created tons of different gods from their imaginations. This fear of invisible things is what leads to what everyone calls religion, and when people worship or fear these powers in the wrong way, it’s called superstition.
