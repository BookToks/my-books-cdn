So Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were alive by promise when Christ spoke, but they don’t actually live until the resurrection. The story of Dives and Lazarus doesn’t go against this if we understand it as a parable.

There are other parts of the New Testament that seem to say the wicked have eternal life. It’s clear that everyone will rise for judgment. It also says many times they will go into “everlasting fire,” “everlasting punishment,” and that the “worm of conscience never dies.” All this is called “everlasting death,” which is usually taken to mean “everlasting life in suffering.” But I can’t find anywhere that says anyone will live in pain forever.

Also, it’s hard to believe that God, who is full of mercy and controls everything, would punish people forever with endless suffering. God gives people the power to choose good and repent, and without Him, we can’t do that. So we need to think about what “everlasting fire” and similar phrases really mean.

I have already shown that God’s kingdom through Christ starts on the day of judgment. On that day, faithful people will rise with glorious and spiritual bodies and live in His eternal kingdom. They won’t marry or eat and drink like before, but will live forever as themselves, without having children. The wicked will also rise to be punished for their sins. Those of the faithful still alive then will have their bodies changed to be spiritual and immortal.

But the bodies of the wicked, who belong to Satan’s kingdom, will not be glorious or spiritual like angels. They won’t live forever as individuals like the faithful do, or as Adam would have if he hadn’t sinned. There is no clear Bible verse to prove this, except for those about eternal punishment, which could be understood differently.
