So, names by themselves can’t really be used to prove anything. The same goes for metaphors and figures of speech, but those are less tricky because they admit they don’t always mean exactly what they say, unlike names.

When people reason, they are basically adding things up or taking things away in their minds. If they use words, they are connecting the meanings of parts to understand the whole, or figuring out one part by knowing the whole and another part. Even when people talk about multiplying or dividing, it’s really just adding or subtracting repeatedly.

These kinds of adding and subtracting don’t just work with numbers. They work with anything you can combine or separate. For example, math teachers add and subtract numbers, geometry teachers do this with shapes and sizes, logic teachers do it with words and ideas, politics writers combine agreements to figure out what people should do, and lawyers add laws and facts to decide what’s right or wrong. Basically, if you can add or subtract something, you can use reason with it. If you can’t, then reason doesn’t apply.

So, reason is basically like doing math with ideas. It means adding and subtracting the meanings of words that we all agree on to understand or explain our thoughts. When you do this in your head, you’re marking your thoughts; when you explain it to others, you’re showing your reasoning.

Just like in math, where beginners and even experts can make mistakes, people can also mess up when they reason about things. But reason itself is always correct, just like math is always true. The problem is that no one person or group of people can guarantee that their reasoning is right, just because many agree on it.
