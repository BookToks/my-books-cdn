Then Jesus spoke to St. Peter and said, “Simon, Simon, Satan wants to make you lose faith by tricking you with power now, but I have prayed for you so your faith won’t fail. When you turn back and understand that my kingdom is from another world, help your friends keep the same faith.” St. Peter replied, thinking he wouldn’t have any power here on earth anymore, “Lord, I’m ready to go with you, even to prison or death.” This shows that St. Peter wasn’t given power to rule on earth, and he was told to teach the other Apostles they wouldn’t have that power either. Also, Peter’s strong belief that Jesus will come again to take over at the end of time was for him only, not for all his followers after him, because we see later leaders acting like they have power now.

The second part is from Matthew 16:18, where Jesus says, “You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell won’t win against it.” This just means that the Church won’t be defeated because of Peter’s strong belief that Jesus is the Son of God, not that Peter gets special power.

The third part is from John 21:16-17, where Jesus tells Peter to “Feed my sheep.” This means Peter should teach others. If we think “sheep” means all the other Apostles too, then Peter had the highest teaching power, but only for the time when there were no Christian rulers with that power. I have already shown that Christian rulers are the top teachers in their own kingdoms because they are baptized. They don’t need extra ceremonies to prove it because their job gives them full power to teach what they want to their people. As I said before, rulers (called Leviathans) are the main teachers because of their role, and they must teach Christian beliefs. If they let others teach their people wrong things, they are responsible before God, because God will ask rulers how they taught their families and servants.
