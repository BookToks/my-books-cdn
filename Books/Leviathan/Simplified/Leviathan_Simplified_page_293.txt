In the Bible, it says that only Moses was allowed to go up to God. Aaron, the other priests, the seventy elders, and the people were not allowed to go up. This shows that Moses was the only one who stood for God to the Israelites. He was their only leader under God.

Later, it says that Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy elders went up and saw God. But this happened only after Moses had already been with God and brought God’s words to the people. The others went up as a special honor, not to lead. They were allowed to see God and live, but they did not bring any commands to the people.

God did not harm them when they saw Him, and they ate and drank, meaning they stayed alive. But it was always God who spoke to Moses, not to Aaron much. For example, Aaron made a golden calf, but Moses threw it into the fire. When Aaron and Miriam challenged Moses’ authority, God decided that Moses was the true leader.

Also, when some leaders named Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rebelled against Moses and Aaron, God punished them severely by swallowing them with the earth and burning the others. This showed that Moses alone had power over the people, both in government and religion. Only Moses talked directly with God and told the people what God wanted.

No one was allowed to come close to the mountain where God spoke with Moses. God told them to keep their distance, and anyone who touched the mountain would be put to death.
