People act based on what they believe, and controlling what people believe well leads to controlling their actions well, which brings peace and harmony.

Even though only the truth matters when it comes to beliefs, it's still important to manage those beliefs to keep peace. A belief that harms peace can't be true, just like peace and harmony can't go against nature. In a country where leaders and teachers are careless or bad at their job, wrong beliefs might become popular over time, and the true facts might upset people. But even when new truths come in suddenly and strongly, they don't break peace—they just sometimes start conflict. People who are so badly led that they fight to defend or spread their opinions are still at war. Their situation isn’t peace but just a break in fighting because they’re scared of each other, living like they're always ready for battle. So, the person in charge needs to be the judge of beliefs and ideas to keep peace and stop fights and civil war.

Seventh, the ruler has the full power to set the rules that tell everyone what things they can own and what actions they can do without being bothered by others. This is what people call property. Before there was a ruler, everyone had a right to everything, which caused war. So, property is needed for peace and depends on the ruler’s power; it’s done to keep public peace. These rules about property (what’s mine and yours) and about what is good, bad, allowed, or not allowed are called civil laws. These are the laws of each country. The term "civil law" today mostly means the old laws of Rome, since Rome was the center of many parts of the world and its laws were the civil laws there.

Eighth, the ruler also has the right to judge and decide all disputes about laws, whether civil or natural, or about facts. Without solving disputes, no one is protected from harm by others. Laws about property are useless, and everyone would still have the natural right to protect themselves by force, which leads to war and goes against the main reason countries are made.
