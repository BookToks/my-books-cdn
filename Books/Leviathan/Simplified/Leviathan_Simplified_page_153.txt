When we talk about the sovereign, or the Commonwealth they represent, we understand that they only act to keep peace and safety for everyone. So, when land is divided, it should be done for that same reason. If the sovereign divides land in a way that hurts peace and safety, it goes against what every person wants, because they trusted the sovereign to act wisely. That kind of division should be ignored by everyone.

It’s true that a king or a big group in charge might do things based on their own feelings, even if it goes against what’s right. This breaks trust and natural laws. But that doesn’t give people the right to fight against or openly criticize their leader, because by giving them power, people accept all their actions. We will talk later about when a leader’s orders are unfair or break natural law.

When land is divided, the Commonwealth itself can be thought of as owning some land, managed by its leader. This land could be enough to cover all costs needed to keep peace and protect everyone. That would be true if leaders didn’t have human weaknesses. But since people have flaws, trying to set aside public land or money for the Commonwealth often fails. It can even cause the government to break down and lead to chaos or war, especially if leaders are careless with money or start expensive wars.

Governments can’t live with a strict budget because their spending depends on outside events and the actions of other countries. So, the public money can only be limited by what emergencies or needs come up.

In England, when the Conqueror ruled, he kept some lands for himself, like forests for fun or to protect the woods, and he kept some rights over lands given to others. But these lands were for his personal use, not to run the government. Still, he and his successors taxed everyone’s land when they needed money. If the public lands and rights were supposed to support the government completely, it didn’t work because taxes were still needed, and the Crown’s income often got smaller or lost over time.
