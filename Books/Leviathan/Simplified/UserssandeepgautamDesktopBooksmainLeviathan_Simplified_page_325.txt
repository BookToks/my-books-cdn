When St. Paul wrote to the churches he had helped start, or when any other Apostle or follower of Christ wrote to those who had accepted Christ, people accepted their writings as true Christian teaching. But back then, it wasn’t the teacher’s power or authority that made people accept it; it was the faith of the listener. So, it wasn’t the Apostles who made their writings official rules, but each person who believed made them important for themselves.

The question here isn’t about what any Christian decided to follow or reject on their own, but about what rules they had to follow without unfairly breaking them. The New Testament can’t be a law in places where the government hasn’t made it a law. A law is a rule made by the person or group with the highest power, who can also punish people if they break the rules.

So, if someone offers rules that the government hasn’t made, those rules are just advice. People can choose to follow or ignore that advice without doing anything wrong. If those rules go against the government’s laws, people can’t follow them in real life without being unfair. They can believe in those ideas and wish they could follow them freely, but they can’t act on them if it breaks the law.

Faith is something inside you and can’t be controlled by anyone, but your words and actions can be judged. Since Jesus said his kingdom isn’t of this world and that he came to save, not to judge, he didn’t make new laws for us to follow here. He said he came to fulfill the Jewish law but not to get rid of it. Different nations have their own laws, and all people have natural laws to follow.

Jesus and his followers taught that following these laws was necessary to enter his eternal kingdom after death, which promises protection and everlasting life. Since Jesus and the Apostles didn’t give us new laws to follow on earth, but only teachings to prepare us for the next life, the books of the New Testament were not laws until the proper authorities made them so. Until then, they were just good advice to help sinners find the right path, which anyone could accept or ignore at their own risk without doing wrong.
