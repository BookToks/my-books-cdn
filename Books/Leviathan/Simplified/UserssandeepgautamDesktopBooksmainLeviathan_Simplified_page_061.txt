All people naturally want to live a happy and peaceful life. But they try to get this in different ways because everyone has different feelings and ideas about what will make them happy.

First, everyone always wants more power. This desire never stops until they die. This isn’t always because they want more fun or excitement, but because they want to make sure they can keep living well. That’s why kings, who have the most power, work hard to protect it with laws or wars. After that, some want to be famous for new victories, some want to relax and enjoy life, and others want to be admired for their skills or talents.

When people compete for money, respect, or control, it often leads to fights and wars. This is because one person tries to win by defeating or pushing away the others.

When people compete for praise, they often respect old traditions and people from the past.

People compete with those who are alive, not those who have died. They sometimes praise the dead more than they deserve to make themselves look better.

People who want comfort and pleasure usually agree to live under a common government. They do this because they trust the government more than their own hard work to keep them safe. Fear of death and injury also makes people want the protection of a government.

But people who are poor, tough, or want to be military leaders often cause wars and trouble. This is because the only way to get military honor is through war, and the only way to fix a bad situation might seem to be by starting a new fight.

People who want to learn and enjoy peaceful arts also prefer to live under a government. This is because they want free time and protection from others.

People who want praise try to do good things that impress those they respect. Wanting to be famous after death works the same way. Even though we won’t feel praise after we die, wanting a good reputation now gives us joy because we imagine how it will help us and our children in the future. Imagining pleasure feels just as real as feeling it.
