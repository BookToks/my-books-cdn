Is it because they cause trouble in the government by allowing rebellion or disobedience? If so, then they should be stopped, and the teachers punished by the government officials who are in charge of keeping peace. This is the civil authority. Any power that church leaders claim for themselves (in places where they have to follow the government), even if they say it comes from God, is actually taken without permission.

Cicero, a famous Roman, talked about a judge named Cassius who had a smart way of handling criminal cases. When the witnesses' stories weren’t enough, he would ask the accusers, "Who benefits?" meaning, who gains something from the crime? Usually, the person who benefits most is the one behind the act. Using this idea, I want to look at who benefits from the people being controlled for so long by these church teachings that go against peaceful society.

First, there’s a mistake in thinking that the current Church on earth is the kingdom of God (which is the place of glory or promise, not just the promise of grace). Because of this mistake, church leaders believe they have the right, as God’s representatives, to govern the Church. Since the Church and the government are seen as one, they think they should also run the government. This is how the Pope convinced many people that disobeying him was like disobeying Christ. In disputes between the Pope and kings, people would side with the Pope, which gave him control over all Christian lands.

At first, church leaders were only teachers of Christian beliefs under the Roman emperors, who ruled the empire. The Pope’s title, Pontifex Maximus, meant he was an official under the government. But after the Roman Empire broke apart, it was easy for the Pope to claim a new title—the right of St. Peter—not only to keep his power but also to control Christian areas that were no longer part of the Roman Empire.
