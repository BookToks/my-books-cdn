This matches the fifth Commandment.

Every ruler should make sure people learn about justice. Justice means not taking what belongs to others. So, people should be taught not to steal or hurt their neighbors by force or cheating, especially things that the ruler says belong to them.

The most important things a person owns are their own life and body. Next, most people care about their spouse and family. After that, they care about their money and way of living. So, people should be taught not to hurt each other’s bodies through revenge, not to disrespect marriage, and not to steal or cheat each other out of their belongings. They also need to understand that corrupt judges or dishonest witnesses make things unfair, which ruins justice. All these ideas are shown in the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth Commandments.

Finally, people should know that not only bad actions but also planning to do bad things, even if stopped by accident, is wrong. This is about having a bad intention, not just doing a bad act. This is what the tenth Commandment means, and it sums up the second group of Commandments. It all comes down to one rule: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” The first group of Commandments is about loving God, who was just made their king.

To teach people this properly, we need to find out why so many wrong ideas about peace and law have taken hold. For example, some people think they should decide right and wrong by their own feelings instead of the law. They believe it’s wrong to obey the government if they personally think the law is bad. They think their own money belongs only to them and the government has no say. Some even think it’s okay to kill rulers they call tyrants or that government power can be divided. These wrong ideas have been spread to people in this way.
