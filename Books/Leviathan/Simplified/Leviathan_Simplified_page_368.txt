But for people who never heard God the Father or Jesus Christ speak to them directly, it can’t be said that the person they believed in was really God. They believed the Apostles first, and then the pastors and teachers of the Church who told them about the stories in the Old and New Testament. So, since Jesus’ time, Christian faith has been based first on trusting their leaders, and then on accepting the Old and New Testament as the rule for faith. Only Christian rulers could decide that the Bible should be accepted this way, so they are the highest leaders and the only ones Christians listen to as if God is speaking through them—unless God speaks to someone in a special, supernatural way today.

But because many false teachers have appeared in the world, people have to check these teachers carefully, like St. John advises us to do, to see if they really come from God or not. Since checking teachings is the job of the highest leader, the person everyone without special revelation should believe is the highest leader in their country—the civil ruler.

There are many reasons why people believe Christian teachings: faith is a gift from God, and He gives it in different ways to different people. Usually, the main reason we believe anything about Christian faith is that we trust the Bible is God’s word. But why we believe the Bible is God’s word is debated a lot. People often ask not why we believe it, but how we know it, as if believing and knowing are the same thing. Some say they know it because the Church can’t be wrong, and others say they trust their own inner feelings. But neither side really proves their point. How can someone know the Church is always right unless they first believe the Bible is true? Or how can someone be sure their own feelings are correct, instead of just trusting what they were taught or assuming they have special gifts? Also, nothing in the Bible proves that the Church or any part of it is always right, especially not any one person.

So, it’s clear that Christians don’t really know for sure that the Bible is God’s word; they just believe it. And the way God usually helps people believe is through their teachers, which is natural. This is the important idea of St. Leviathan.
