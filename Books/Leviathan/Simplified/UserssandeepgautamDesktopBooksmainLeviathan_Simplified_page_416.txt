Reasoning comes after the ability to use speech, so it makes sense that some general truths were discovered through thinking as early as language itself. The native people of America had some good moral ideas and could do basic math with small numbers, but that doesn’t make them philosophers.

Just like there were small amounts of corn and wine growing wild before people knew how to use or grow them, there were also some true and useful ideas from the start because human reason naturally produces them. But at first, these ideas were few. People mostly lived by experience without any system or method, meaning knowledge wasn’t carefully developed or separated from wrong ideas and guesses.

One reason for this was that people didn’t have free time because they were busy finding food and protecting themselves from others. It wasn’t until big countries, or Commonwealths, were created that things changed. Free time is what allows philosophy to grow, and Commonwealths bring peace and free time. The first great and successful cities were where philosophy began.

The Gymnosophists in India, the Magi in Persia, and the Priests in Chaldaea and Egypt are known as the oldest philosophers, and those places had the oldest kingdoms. Philosophy didn’t start with the Greeks or other Western people, whose small city-states only had peace when they feared each other equally and didn’t have time to think about anything but each other. 

Finally, when war forced many small Greek cities to join into larger ones, seven men from different parts of Greece became known as wise. Some were famous for their moral and political ideas, and others for knowledge from the Chaldaeans and Egyptians, like astronomy and geometry. But at this time, there were still no formal schools of philosophy.
