Sometimes, people who lead public prayers in Christian churches are also called prophets. For example, prophets like Saul, who came down from the hill playing instruments and praising God loudly, were said to prophesy because they praised God in public. Miriam is called a prophetess for the same reason.

St. Paul says that men who pray or prophesy with their heads covered, and women who do so with their heads uncovered, are praising God with songs and psalms. Women could do this in church even if they weren't allowed to speak to the whole group. In this way, even poets from other religions who wrote hymns for their gods were called prophets because they honored their gods with poetry.

When prophecy means predicting the future, real prophets are people chosen by God to share what He tells them. But there are also fake prophets, who claim to predict things using spirits or superstitions. Many of these fakes get attention when one prediction seems right, even if they are wrong many times. Prophecy isn’t a skill or a regular job; it’s a special task given by God, usually to good people, but sometimes even to bad ones.

For example, the woman of Endor, who supposedly raised the spirit of Samuel to tell Saul he would die, was not a true prophetess. She didn’t really have the power to do that, and God didn’t tell her to do it. Instead, God allowed this trick to scare Saul and cause him to lose hope, which led to his defeat.
