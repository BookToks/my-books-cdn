This also helps us understand when people can be said to be truly defeated, and what it means to be conquered, and what power a conqueror really has. Submission includes all of this. Conquest isn’t just winning a fight; it means winning the right to control other people. 

So, someone who is killed is defeated but not conquered. Someone who is captured and put in prison is also defeated but not conquered because they are still an enemy and might escape. But if someone promises to obey the winner and keeps their life and freedom, then they are truly conquered and become subjects. The Romans used to say they had “pacified” a place, meaning they had conquered it. They meant the people promised to do what the Romans told them—that was real conquest.

This promise to obey can be clear or unspoken. For example, if someone hasn’t promised to obey openly because they don’t have much power, but they live under the conqueror’s protection openly, they are seen as submitting to the government. But if they live secretly, they can be treated like spies or enemies, and it’s fair to punish them even by death. Also, if someone is away when their country is conquered, they are not conquered or subject until they return and accept the new government. 

So, conquest means winning the right to rule by victory, and this right comes from the people agreeing to obey the winner, promising to follow their rules to keep their life and freedom.

In Chapter 29, I explained one reason why governments can fail: they don’t have total power to make laws. Without this, rulers struggle to enforce justice firmly. Another reason I didn’t mention there is that rulers often try to justify their power by the war that got them there. For example, kings of England might say their right to rule depends on William the Conqueror’s victory and their family line from him. But if that were true, then people’s obedience would depend only on whether the original war was “good.” This idea actually encourages rebellions whenever someone wants to challenge the rulers, making their control weaker.
