A third difference between people is that no one can claim the right to give advice to someone else just because they want to gain something for themselves. Asking for the right to counsel someone else usually means wanting to know their plans or get some benefit, which is something everyone naturally wants.

This is also part of what advice is: if you ask for advice, you can’t fairly blame or punish the person giving it. When you ask someone for advice, you allow them to share their honest opinion. So, if someone gives advice to their leader (like a king or a group) when asked, they can’t be punished for it, even if most people don’t agree, as long as it relates to the issue being discussed. If the group’s opinion was already clear before the discussion ended, they wouldn’t need to ask for advice. The person asking for advice is responsible for it, so they can’t punish it, and if the leader can’t punish it, no one else can. But if someone gives advice to break the law, whether they mean to or just don’t know better, the government can punish them because not knowing the law is not an excuse.

Exhortation and dehortation are types of advice where the person really wants their advice to be followed. To put it simply, it’s advice that is strongly pushed. Someone who exhorts encourages action without fully explaining all the reasons or strict logic; they just want the person to do something. Someone who dehorts tries to stop the person from doing it. They use feelings and common opinions in their speech, and use stories, comparisons, and examples to convince people their advice is useful, honorable, or fair.

From this, we can learn that exhortation and dehortation are aimed at helping the person giving the advice, not the one receiving it. This goes against what a proper adviser should do. A true adviser should care about helping the person they are advising, not themselves.
