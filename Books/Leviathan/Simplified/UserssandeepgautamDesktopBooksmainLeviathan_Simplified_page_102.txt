The second kind is someone who agrees to do something only if another person doesn’t do it first. This means they promise to act, but only if the other person fails to do their part by a certain time.

People who do this are usually called sureties. In Latin, they are known as fidejussores and sponsores.

Specifically, if it’s about paying a debt, they are called praedes. And if it’s about showing up in court or before a judge, they are called vades.
