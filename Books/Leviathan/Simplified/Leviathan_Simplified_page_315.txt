But in the same chapter, the decision in such a case is clearly said to belong to the group: “But now I have written to you not to hang out with anyone who is called a brother but is a sinner,” etc., “don’t even eat with that person. Why should I judge those outside? Don’t you judge those inside?” The punishment that kicked someone out of the Church was given by the Apostle or pastor; but the group of Christians living in the same city judged if the person really deserved it, like in Corinth.

This power to kick people out of God’s kingdom is called excommunication. To excommunicate means to throw someone out of the synagogue, which was the place for worship. This word comes from Jewish traditions where people who were seen as dangerous or unclean, like lepers, were separated from the rest until a priest said they were clean again.

At first, excommunication didn’t have the power of the government behind it. Its main effect was that people who were not kicked out had to avoid those who were. They didn’t just treat excommunicated people like regular outsiders or non-Christians because they could eat and drink with those outsiders. But with excommunicated people, they couldn’t do that. St. Paul said before that they should not “hang out with sinners,” but since that would mean leaving the whole world, he limited it to those sinners who were part of the Christian group. He said they should not even eat with such a person. This is like when Jesus said, “Treat them like a non-Jew or a tax collector.” Tax collectors were hated by the Jews because they collected money for the government and were seen as sinners. When Jesus accepted an invitation from Zacchaeus, a tax collector, people criticized him for it. So, when Jesus said to treat someone like a non-Jew and a tax collector, he meant not to eat with someone who was excommunicated.
