The Church of Rome copies old traditions in their special holidays. They had their wild parties called bacchanalia, and we have our wakes, which are similar. They had saturnalia, and we have carnivals and the freedom servants get on Shrove Tuesday. They had a parade for Priapus, and we have our Maypole celebrations with dancing, which is a kind of worship. They had a procession called Ambarvalia, and we have a walk around the fields during Rogation week.

I don’t think these are the only ceremonies left in the Church from when the Gentiles first became Christians, but these are the ones I can think of now. If someone studied the old religious customs of the Greeks and Romans carefully, they would probably find many more old pagan traditions that the leaders of the Roman Church, either by carelessness or on purpose, have mixed with Christianity. Over time, this mix will cause problems.

Philosophy means learning by thinking about how things are made and how they work, trying to understand their causes and effects. This helps us create things that people need, as much as materials and human ability allow. For example, a mathematician studies shapes, finds their properties, and then uses those properties to solve problems like measuring land or water. An astronomer studies the sun and stars to understand why we have day and night and different seasons, which helps us keep track of time. Other sciences work similarly.

By this idea, we should not include simple experience as part of philosophy. Experience is the knowledge we get by living and remembering what happens, and it’s not learned by thinking things through. Even animals have experience. But experience can be tricky because missing small details can change what happens, even if someone is very careful. True reasoning always leads to general, unchanging truths.

We should also not call false ideas philosophy. If someone reasons correctly and understands the words, they can’t end up with a wrong conclusion. Philosophy doesn’t include things known by supernatural revelation because those come without reasoning. It also doesn’t include knowledge taken from books without reasoning from cause to effect or effect to cause; that is faith, not knowledge.
