Things that can’t be shared or divided should belong to the person who got them first, and sometimes to the oldest child, like when decided by chance.

It’s also a natural rule that people who try to make peace should be allowed to travel safely. The law wants peace, so it allows people to step in and help, and those helpers should be protected.

Even if people want to follow these rules, there can still be arguments about what someone did. First, whether they did it or not, and second, if what they did was against the law or not. The first is called a question of fact, the second a question of right. Unless the people arguing agree to accept someone else’s decision, they won’t have peace. This person who decides is called an arbitrator. So, natural law says that people in a fight should agree to let an arbitrator judge.

Since everyone usually does things to help themselves, no one should judge their own case. Even if they are fair, if one person judges, the other should too. Otherwise, the argument stays, which is against natural law.

Also, no one should be an arbitrator if they would gain more money, honor, or fun from one side winning. That would be like taking a bribe, and no one should have to trust them. This also keeps the argument going, which breaks natural law.

When the argument is about facts, and the judge can’t decide between two sides, they should listen to a third or more people. If not, the problem stays unsolved and might end in fighting, which is against natural law.

These natural laws are about keeping peace and helping people live together. There are other things like drinking too much and being reckless that are also against natural law but don’t need to be talked about here.
