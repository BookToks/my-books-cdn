Jesus said, “As my Father sent me, I send you.” But Jesus was sent to convince the Jews to come back to God and to invite others to join God’s kingdom. He was not sent to rule like a king or act as his Father’s boss until the day of judgment.

The time between Jesus going to heaven and the final resurrection is not about ruling but about getting people ready for Jesus’ return on the day of judgment. Jesus said, “You who have followed me during this time will also sit on twelve thrones when the Son of Man comes in glory.” Paul also talked about being ready with the “gospel of peace.” Jesus compared this time to fishing—not catching people by force, but by convincing them. He called his followers fishers of men, not hunters.

This time is also compared to things like leaven, planting seeds, and a tiny mustard seed growing big. All these show that force is not used, so Jesus is not actually ruling during this time. The job of Jesus’ followers is to spread the message of Christ and get people ready for his return, just like John the Baptist prepared people for Jesus’ first coming.

Also, Jesus’ followers are supposed to help people believe in him. But faith doesn’t come from forcing people or making rules; it comes from good reasons and what people already believe. So, Jesus’ followers don’t have the right to punish anyone for not believing or for disagreeing with them. If they have political power, they can enforce laws, but not because of their role as Jesus’ followers. Paul said clearly, “We don’t control your faith; we just help you find joy.”

Another point is that Jesus gave lawful authority to all rulers, whether they believe in him or not.
