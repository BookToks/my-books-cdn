This appearance was not just something imagined, but a voice. This shows that an angel means nothing more than God Himself, who made Hagar hear a special voice from heaven. Or it could just mean a supernatural voice that shows God was really there.

So why can’t the angels that showed up to Lot, and were called men, be understood as images of men created in the mind? Lot talked to them as if they were just one person, and he called one of them "my Lord," meaning God. Just like the angel was understood as a voice before, these angels could be imagined figures too.

When the angel called to Abraham from heaven to stop him from killing Isaac, it wasn’t a visible figure, but a voice. Still, it was called a messenger or angel of God because it shared God’s will in a supernatural way. This idea avoids thinking about real ghosts sticking around.

The angels Jacob saw on the ladder to heaven were part of a dream during his sleep. So they were just imaginary, but because they were supernatural and showed God’s presence, it’s okay to call them angels. The same goes when Jacob said, “The angel of the Lord appeared to me in my sleep.” That was just a dream, but that angel was God Himself, because the angel said, “I am the God of Bethel.”

Also, the angel that led the Israelite army to the Red Sea, then came behind them, was actually the Lord Himself. He didn’t look like a person but appeared as a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. This pillar was the angel or sign promised to Moses to guide the army. It even stayed at the tabernacle’s door and talked to Moses.

Here, you see that movement and speech, which people usually think angels have, were given to a cloud. The cloud showed God’s presence and was just as much an angel as if it looked like a beautiful person or had wings, which is how people often imagine angels wrongly.

What makes something an angel is not how it looks, but what it does. Angels are signs of God’s presence in supernatural events. For example, when Moses asked God to go with the army as before the golden calf was made, God didn’t say, “I will go” or “I will send an angel.” Instead, God said, “My presence shall go with you.”
