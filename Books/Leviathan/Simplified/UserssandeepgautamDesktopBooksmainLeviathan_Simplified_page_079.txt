Even though there has never been a time when individual people were fighting each other, kings and rulers have always been jealous and ready to fight. They act like gladiators, always watching and pointing weapons at each other. This means they have forts, soldiers, and guns at their borders, and spies watching their neighbors. This is like being in a constant state of war. But because of this, their people work hard, so it doesn’t cause the same kind of problems that happen when individuals are free to do whatever they want.

In a situation where everyone is fighting everyone else, nothing is wrong or unfair. Ideas of right and wrong, justice and injustice, don’t exist there. Without a common power, there are no laws, and without laws, there’s no injustice. In war, being strong and sneaky are the most important skills. Justice isn’t something that belongs to the body or mind alone. If it did, a person alone in the world would still have it, just like senses or feelings. Justice only exists between people living together, not when someone is all alone. Also, in this situation, no one owns anything for sure; everything belongs to whoever can take it and keep it. This is the bad place people are naturally in, but there’s a chance to get out of it, partly because of feelings and partly because of reason.

The feelings that make people want peace are: fear of dying; wanting things needed for a comfortable life; and hope that by working hard, they can get those things. Reason helps people come up with fair rules to make peace and agree with each other. These rules are called the laws of nature, which I’ll explain more about in the next chapters.

The right of nature, or jus naturale, is the freedom each person has to use their own power in any way they want to protect their life. That means doing anything they think is the best way to stay alive.

Liberty means having no outside obstacles stopping you. These obstacles might take away some of your power to do what you want, but they can’t stop you from using the power you still have, based on what your mind and reason tell you.
