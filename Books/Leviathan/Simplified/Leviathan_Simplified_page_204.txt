We can compare this sickness to a fever where parts of the body get blocked or frozen, stopping blood from flowing properly. At first, this causes the body to shake and feel cold. Then, the heart works hard to push the blood through. It tries to stay alive by using anything that cools it down for a while. If the body is strong, it can break through the blockage and sweat out the poison. But if it’s too weak, the person dies.

Sometimes, a country can have a problem like a disease called pleurisy. This happens when too much money from the country’s treasury ends up in the hands of just a few people because of monopolies or unfair deals. This is like how blood gathers in the chest and causes pain and fever.

Also, when a powerful person becomes very popular, it can be dangerous unless the country knows they are loyal. People might stop following the laws and start following this person without really knowing what they want. This is more risky in a government run by the people than in a kingdom because a big army can pretend to represent everyone. This is how Julius Caesar took control by winning the army’s support and then ruling both the people and the government. This kind of behavior is like rebellion and can be compared to witchcraft.

Another problem for a country is when a city gets too big and can support a large army on its own. Also, having many smaller groups inside the country, like little governments inside a bigger one, can cause trouble. On top of that, people who argue too much against strong leadership, using false ideas, can mess with the country’s laws and cause problems, like tiny worms that bother the body.
