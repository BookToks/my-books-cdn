People only believed what the Apostles taught. The Apostles only said that Jesus was the Christ, meaning the King who would save them and rule forever in the world to come. They also said that Jesus was not dead, but had risen from the dead, gone up to heaven, and would come back one day to judge the world. Everyone would be judged and rewarded based on what they did.

None of the Apostles said that they, or any other Apostle, were the only ones who could understand the Scriptures perfectly. Understanding the laws belongs to those who run a kingdom, but the Apostles did not have a kingdom yet. They prayed, “Let your kingdom come,” and told their followers to obey their current rulers. The New Testament was not all put together in one book yet. Each Gospel writer explained his own Gospel, and each Apostle explained his own letter. Jesus himself told the Jews, “Search the Scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life, and they testify about me.” If Jesus did not want them to understand the Scriptures for themselves, he would have explained everything or told the priests to do it.

When there was a problem, the Apostles and church leaders met to decide what should be taught and how to explain the Scriptures to people. But they did not stop people from reading and thinking about the Scriptures on their own. The Apostles sent letters and writings to the churches to teach them, which would be useless if the people were not allowed to think about what these writings meant. This way of understanding continued until there were pastors who could officially explain the Scriptures in a way that everyone accepted. But this could only happen when kings were also pastors or pastors were also kings.

There are two ways a writing can be called canonical. A canon means a rule, which is a guide for how to act. Rules given by a teacher to a student or a friend to a friend are still rules, even if the person doesn’t have to follow them. But when rules come from someone you must obey, they become laws. So, the question is about who has the power to make the Scriptures, which guide Christian faith, into laws.
