If everyone has their own private opinions, the country will be full of fights, and no one will want to obey the leader more than they feel like it.

People often say that faith and holiness don’t come from studying or thinking, but from some kind of special, supernatural inspiration. If that were true, then why would anyone need to explain their faith? Why wouldn’t every Christian be a prophet? Why would anyone follow the country’s laws instead of their own feelings? This leads to the problem of letting private people decide what’s right or wrong based on their own supposed special inspiration, which would break down all government.

Faith comes from hearing and learning, through situations that bring us to those who teach us. These situations are planned by God, but they are natural, not supernatural, and often too many to notice. Faith and holiness don’t happen very often, but they aren’t miracles. They come from education, discipline, correction, and other natural ways God uses for those He chooses, at the right time. These wrong ideas, which hurt peace and government, mostly come from uneducated religious people who twist the Bible to make people think that holiness and reason can’t go together.

Another wrong idea is that the person in charge has to follow the country’s laws. It’s true that leaders must follow natural laws because they come from God and can’t be changed. But leaders don’t have to follow laws made by the country itself. To follow laws means to obey the country, which means to obey the leader. So the leader obeying laws made by themselves isn’t really being controlled—it’s freedom from laws. This mistake puts laws above the leader, making judges more powerful and able to punish the leader. That would create a new leader over the old one, then someone to punish that new leader, and so on forever, destroying the government.
