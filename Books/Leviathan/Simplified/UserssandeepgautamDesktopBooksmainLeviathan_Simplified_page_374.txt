There is nothing here that goes against the rest of the Holy Scripture, and there is no sign of the fire of purgatory.

But someone might ask if it is just as important for salvation to believe that God created the world, that Jesus Christ rose from the dead, and that everyone else will rise again on the last day, as it is to believe that Jesus is the Christ. My answer is yes, these things are important too. But they are all part of believing that Jesus is the Christ, and you can figure them out from that belief, even if it’s a bit hard.

For example, anyone who believes Jesus is the Son of God knows that the Israelites worship the all-powerful Creator of everything. Also, how can someone believe Jesus is a king who will reign forever if they don’t believe he came back to life? A dead person can’t be a king.

In short, if someone believes the main idea that Jesus is the Christ, they also believe everything that follows from that, even if they don’t fully understand it. So, believing this one thing is enough faith to get forgiveness for sins and enter heaven.

Now, I’ve shown that all the obedience needed for salvation is really just the desire to follow God’s law, which means repentance. And all the faith needed is believing that Jesus is the Christ. I will show some parts of the Gospel that prove that these two things together are all we need for salvation.

On the day of Pentecost, right after Jesus went up to heaven, the people asked St. Peter and the other Apostles, “What should we do?” (Acts 2:37) St. Peter answered, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, for the forgiveness of your sins. Then you will receive the Holy Spirit” (Acts 2:38). So, repentance and baptism, which means believing Jesus is the Christ, are all that is needed for salvation.

Also, when a ruler asked Jesus, “What must I do to have eternal life?” (Luke 18:18), Jesus told him to follow the commandments, like not committing adultery, not killing, not stealing, not lying, and to honor your parents (Luke 18:19-20).
