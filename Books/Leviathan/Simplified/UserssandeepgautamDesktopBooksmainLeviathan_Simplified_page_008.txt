Thirdly, what is a Christian Commonwealth?

Lastly, what is the Kingdom of Darkness?

About the first, there is a saying people use a lot lately: wisdom comes not from reading books, but from understanding people. Because of this, some people who can’t really prove they are wise enjoy showing off what they think they know about others by talking badly about them behind their backs.

But there is another saying, not understood much these days, that could help people truly understand each other if they try. It is "Nosce teipsum," which means "Know yourself." This wasn’t meant to support rude behavior from powerful people or encourage disrespect from those with less power. Instead, it teaches us that because all humans have similar feelings like desire, fear, and hope, if someone looks closely at their own thoughts and feelings, they can understand what others feel in similar situations.

I mean, people share the same kinds of feelings, but their reasons for those feelings are different because of their unique makeup and life experiences. These differences, along with lies and false ideas, make people's true feelings hard to read unless someone is very good at understanding hearts.

Sometimes, we can guess what people want by what they do. But if we don’t compare their actions with how we would act, and think about all the different reasons behind things, we might misunderstand them. This happens because the person trying to understand might be good or bad themselves.

Even if someone perfectly understands another person’s actions, it only helps with a few people they know. A leader who has to guide a whole nation must understand all people, not just one person. This is really hard—harder than learning any language or science.

But when I explain how I understand people clearly and in order, anyone else just has to check if they feel the same inside themselves. This kind of understanding can’t be proven any other way.
