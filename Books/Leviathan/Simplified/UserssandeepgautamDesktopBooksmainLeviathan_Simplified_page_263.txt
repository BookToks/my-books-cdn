There is one way God showed He was present: through visions or appearances. For example, God’s message came to Abraham in a vision, which means God sent a sign or messenger to speak to him. The Lord appeared to Abraham as three angels, to Abimelech in a dream, to Lot as two angels, and to Hagar as one angel. God also spoke to Abraham with a voice from heaven, to Isaac in a dream, and to Jacob in a dream where he saw a ladder. God appeared to Jacob again with angels, and to Moses as a flame of fire in a bush.  

After Moses, God usually spoke to people through visions or dreams, like to Gideon, Samuel, Elijah, Elisha, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and many other prophets. In the New Testament, God also appeared this way to Joseph, St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. John during the Apocalypse.  

Only Moses got to hear God speak in a special way on Mount Sinai and in the Tabernacle, and the high priest did too in the Temple. Moses and the high priests were closer to God than other prophets. God said He spoke to other prophets through dreams and visions, but to Moses, He spoke “mouth to mouth,” like a person talking to a friend. God even said Moses saw Him clearly, not in riddles.  

Even this special talking with Moses was through an angel or angels, so it was still a kind of vision, but clearer than what other prophets got. God says if there is a prophet or dreamer among people, they will get messages through dreams or visions. He also said that sons and daughters will prophesy, old people will dream dreams, and young people will see visions.
