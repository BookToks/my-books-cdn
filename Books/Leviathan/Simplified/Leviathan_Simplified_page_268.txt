Before the time of the Captivity, most prophets were liars. God told Jeremiah that these prophets were lying in His name. He said, “I didn’t send them, and I never told them to speak. They give you false visions and lies from their own hearts.” Because of this, God warned people through Jeremiah not to listen to these false prophets. He said, “Don’t pay attention to what these prophets say. They only make you confused and speak things that come from their own minds, not from me.”

Back then, there were many arguments among the prophets. Some even argued with each other, like when Micaiah questioned the other 400 prophets. They often denied each other’s words, just like in Jeremiah’s time. Even today, spiritual prophets argue with each other. So, everyone must use their own common sense to figure out which prophecies are true or false. God gave us rules to help us know the difference.

In the Old Testament, one rule was that true prophets taught the same things as Moses, the main prophet. Another rule was that true prophets could correctly predict what God would do, showing miraculous power. In the New Testament, there was one main rule: true prophets always taught that Jesus is the Christ, the promised King of the Jews.

Anyone who denied that Jesus is the Christ was a false prophet, no matter what miracles they might do. But anyone who taught this was a true prophet. St. John explained how to tell if a spirit is from God. He said, “Every spirit that says Jesus Christ came in the flesh is from God.” That means they are true prophets, even if they are not perfect people. God sometimes spoke through prophets He didn’t fully accept, like Balaam or the Witch of Endor.

John also said, “Every spirit that does not say Jesus Christ came in the flesh is not from God. This is the spirit of Antichrist.” So the rule is clear: a true prophet teaches that the Messiah has already come as Jesus, but a false prophet denies this and waits for a fake Messiah, who is called the Antichrist.
