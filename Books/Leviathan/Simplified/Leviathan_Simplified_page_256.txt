When we say “Hallowed be thy name,” we are praying to God to help us follow the first Commandment, which says we should have no other gods but Him.

People belong to God’s special group, but the Jews were a holy nation because they made a special agreement with God.

The word “profane” usually means something common or ordinary in the Bible. So, holy and proper mean something set apart for God. Sometimes, people who live very godly lives are also called holy because they focus only on God and give up worldly things. Things made holy by God are called sanctified, like the seventh day in the fourth Commandment, or people chosen in the New Testament who receive the spirit of godliness. Things made holy by people’s dedication for God’s use are called sacred or consecrated, like temples, places of worship, tools, priests, and offerings.

There are different levels of holiness. Some things set apart for God’s service can be set apart again for even more special service. The whole nation of Israel was holy to God, but the tribe of Levi was even holier. Among the Levites, the priests were more holy, and among the priests, the high priest was the most holy. The land of Judea was called the Holy Land, the Holy City was even more holy, the Temple was more holy than the city, and the most holy part was the special inner room of the Temple.

A sacrament is when something visible is set apart from common use and dedicated to God’s service. It is a sign that shows we belong to God’s kingdom or reminds us of that. In the Old Testament, circumcision was the sign of joining God’s people; in the New Testament, baptism is the sign.

In the Old Testament, people remembered this by eating the Paschal Lamb at a special time every year, reminding them of how God saved them from slavery in Egypt. In the New Testament, we remember by celebrating the Lord’s Supper, which reminds us of how Jesus saved us from sin by dying on the cross.
