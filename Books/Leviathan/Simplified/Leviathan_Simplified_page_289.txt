Sometimes, the word "Church" means the Christians living in one person’s house, like when it says, “Greet the Church that meets in his house.” Other times, it means only the chosen people, like when it talks about a perfect and holy Church that will come in the future.

Sometimes, "Church" means a group of people who say they follow Christianity, whether they really do or not. For example, when it says, “Tell it to the Church, and if they don’t listen, treat them like a stranger.” In this last meaning, the Church is treated like one person who can make decisions, give commands, and have authority.

But without permission from the whole group, any action done by some people is just the action of those people, not the whole Church. Also, people who aren’t there or don’t agree can’t be counted as part of the Church’s decision.

So, a Church is a group of people who say they are Christians and follow one leader, who has the power to call them together. They shouldn’t meet without that leader’s permission. In any country, gatherings without government approval are illegal, so Churches meeting without permission are also illegal.

Because there is no one ruler over all countries, there is no universal Church that all Christians must obey. Christians belong to different countries, and they follow the rules of their own country, not anyone else’s. So, a Church that can make decisions and judge people is really just a government made up of Christians.

People talk about “temporal” (worldly) and “spiritual” power to confuse people about who should be in charge. It’s true that after death, faithful people will be spiritual and eternal, but in this life, their bodies are physical and mortal.
