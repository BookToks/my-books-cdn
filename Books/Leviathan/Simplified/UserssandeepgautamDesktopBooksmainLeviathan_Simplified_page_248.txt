(Exodus, 33:14) There are too many places in the Old Testament that mention angels to list them all here. So, to understand them all at once, I say that in the parts of the Old Testament that the Church of England accepts as true, there is no proof of any spirit or angel that is permanent and has no physical form. Instead, angels can be understood as having parts, like something that takes up space. This means one part can be in one place, and another part nearby.

In short, angels are not just spirits without bodies. In every case, the word "angel" can mean "messenger." For example, John the Baptist is called an angel, and Christ is called the Angel of the Covenant. Also, things like the dove and the fiery tongues, which showed God’s special presence, could be called angels too.

In the book of Daniel, two angels are named: Gabriel and Michael. But the text shows that Michael actually means Christ, not as an angel but as a leader or prince (Daniel 12:1). Gabriel was probably just a vision or dream, like other supernatural images shown to holy people. It seemed to Daniel that two holy men were talking, and one said, “Gabriel, let us help this man understand his vision.” God doesn’t need to name his heavenly servants because names help humans remember better.

In the New Testament, there is no proof that angels are permanent and without bodies, except when the word is used for people God sends as messengers or helpers. We can tell angels are permanent from Jesus’ words where he says to the wicked on the last day, “Go away into the everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels” (Matthew 25:41). This shows that evil angels last forever unless we think the Devil and his angels mean the enemies of the Church. But this idea doesn’t match with the idea that angels have no physical form because eternal fire wouldn’t hurt things without bodies.

So, angels are not proven to be without bodies. Similarly, when St. Paul says, “Do you not know that we will judge the angels?” it also supports this idea.
