But how God spoke to them is not clear. Saying that when Moses went up Mount Sinai it was just a dream or vision, like other prophets had, is wrong because God made Moses different from other prophets (Numbers 12:6-8). Saying God spoke or showed Himself exactly as He is would go against the fact that God is infinite, invisible, and beyond understanding. Saying God spoke through inspiration or the Holy Spirit, which means God Himself, would make Moses equal to Christ, who alone fully has God’s nature in human form (Colossians 2:9). And saying God spoke through the Holy Spirit as gifts or graces would mean nothing supernatural happened. God guides people to be good and truthful through teaching, examples, and normal situations.

Since these ways don’t fit how God spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, they also don’t fit how He spoke to the high priests from the mercy-seat. So, how God spoke to the main prophets in the Old Testament, whose job was to ask Him, is not something we can really understand. In the New Testament, the only main prophet was Jesus, who was both God speaking and the prophet He spoke to.

For lesser prophets who kept their calling, there is no proof God spoke to them in a supernatural way. Instead, God naturally moves people toward being good, faithful, and righteous, just like He does with all other Christians. This happens through teaching, training, and chances to do good. We call this the work of the Holy Spirit, or Holy Ghost, because no good feeling comes without God’s work. But these actions are not always supernatural. So when a prophet is said to speak “in the spirit” or “by the Spirit of God,” it means they speak following God’s will, as shown by the highest prophet. Most of the time, “spirit” just means a person’s mind, intention, or attitude.

In Moses’ time, there were seventy men besides him who prophesied in the Israelite camp. How God spoke to them is explained in Numbers 11:25: “The Lord came down in a cloud, spoke to Moses, and took some of the spirit on him and gave it to the seventy elders.”
