But even if God, because of the prayers of believers, brings some people who never heard about Christ to Him—and those people can’t be blamed for rejecting Christ—this doesn’t prove that purgatory exists. Coming back to life from death is one thing; coming back from purgatory to life is different because it means going from a life of suffering to a life of happiness.

A fourth example is from Matthew 5:25: “Make peace with your enemy quickly while you are with him on the way, or else your enemy will hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you will be thrown into prison. You won’t get out until you have paid every last penny.” In this story, the sinner is like the offender; the enemy and the judge are God; the way is this life; the prison is the grave; and the officer is death. The sinner won’t rise to eternal life but to a second death unless they have paid all their debt, or Christ pays it through His suffering, which covers all sins, big or small.

The fifth example is from Matthew 5:22: “Anyone who is angry with their brother without a good reason will be judged guilty. Anyone who calls their brother ‘Raca’ will be guilty before the council. But anyone who says ‘You fool’ will be guilty of hellfire.” From this, some people think there are three kinds of sins and punishments, and only the last sin is punished by hellfire. So they believe that lesser sins are punished in purgatory after death. But there’s no real proof for this idea in any explanation so far. Will there really be different courts after death, like the Jewish courts in Jesus’ time? Isn’t all judgment supposed to belong to Christ and His Apostles?

To understand this passage, we need to look at the sentences before and after it together. Jesus was explaining the Law of Moses, which the Jews thought was followed as long as they didn’t break the exact words, even if they broke the real meaning. For example, they thought the sixth Commandment was only broken by killing someone, and the seventh only by sleeping with someone who wasn’t their wife. But Jesus told them that even being angry at your brother without a good reason is like murder.
