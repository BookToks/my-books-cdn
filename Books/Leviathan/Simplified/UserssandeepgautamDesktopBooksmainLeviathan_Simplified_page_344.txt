Monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy show us three kinds of rulers, but they are not about church leaders. They are like three kinds of family heads, not teachers for children.

So, the second point about the best way to run the Church doesn’t really tell us about the Pope’s power outside his own lands. In other places, if the Pope has any power, it's more like a teacher's power, not like a family head’s power.

The third point is that St. Peter was the leader of the Church. The main proof is a verse from St. Matthew: “You are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church,” and “I will give you the keys of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” But looking closely, this just shows that the Church is built on one main belief—the one Peter said for all the Apostles that made Jesus say those words.

To understand this better, remember that Jesus, John the Baptist, and the Apostles only taught one main belief: “He is the Christ.” All other beliefs come from this one. John started by preaching, “The kingdom of God is near.” Then Jesus said the same thing. When Jesus sent the twelve Apostles to preach, they only taught this main belief. This was the foundation of the Church’s faith.

Later, Jesus asked all the Apostles, not just Peter, who people said he was. They said some thought he was John the Baptist, others Elijah, Jeremiah, or a prophet. Then Jesus asked all of them, “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered for all, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” This is the foundation of the Church’s faith. Jesus used this to say, “on this rock, I will build my Church.” So, the “rock” means the main belief of the Church.

But some people ask, why did Jesus say, “You are Peter”? If the original meaning of the words was strict, the reason would have been clear.
