A long time ago, in the Jewish Church, there were many false prophets who wanted to be popular by pretending to have special dreams and visions. In the same way, false teachers have always been in the Church of Christ. They try to become famous by teaching strange and wrong ideas, and they use this popularity to control people for their own benefit.

Sometimes, it can be hard to obey both God and the government. But for those who know what is really important to get into God’s kingdom, this isn’t a big problem. If the government’s rules don’t make you lose your chance at eternal life, then not following them is wrong. The Bible says servants should obey their masters, and children should obey their parents. Jesus also said that people should listen to the teachers of the law and do what they say.

However, if the government’s rules make you do something that would make you lose your soul forever, it would be crazy to obey them. Jesus taught us not to be afraid of people who can only hurt our bodies but not our souls. So, everyone needs to learn the difference between what is really necessary for salvation and what is not.

To be saved, you only need two things: faith in Christ and obeying God’s laws. If we were perfect at obeying God’s laws, that would be enough. But since everyone has sinned—starting with Adam and continuing with our own mistakes—we need not only to obey God from now on, but also to have our past sins forgiven. This forgiveness comes because we believe in Christ.

Nothing else is needed for salvation. The kingdom of heaven is closed only to sinners, which means those who disobey God’s law. But if they repent and believe in the important parts of Christian faith, the kingdom is open to them.

God wants us to seriously try to obey Him. He accepts our effort to do His will, even if we can’t do everything perfectly. This effort to obey is very important and is called by many names that show how serious it is.
