When we say “captivity of our understanding,” it doesn’t mean just believing whatever someone else says. It means choosing to obey when it’s the right thing to do. Our senses, memory, understanding, reason, and opinions don’t change just because we want them to. They depend on what we see, hear, and think about. So, they aren’t controlled by our will; instead, our will depends on them. We “capture” our understanding and reason when we stop arguing, when we follow orders from the right authority, and when we live by those rules. In short, it means trusting and having faith in the person speaking, even if our mind can’t fully understand their words.

When God speaks to people, it happens either directly or through another person to whom He already spoke directly. How God speaks directly to someone is something only that person can truly understand. If someone says God spoke to them in a supernatural way, and I don’t believe it, it’s hard for them to prove that I should believe it. If that person is my leader, I might have to obey them and not say I don’t believe, but I won’t think differently unless my reason tells me to. If someone without that authority claims the same, there’s no reason to believe or obey them.

Saying God spoke to someone through the Bible means God spoke through prophets, apostles, or the Church, just like He speaks to all Christians. Saying God spoke in a dream just means the person dreamed it. Dreams mostly come from natural causes, like what we’ve thought about before. People who say this often believe they deserve special messages because they think they are really good or special, but that’s usually just pride or false ideas. Saying someone saw a vision or heard a voice usually means they were half asleep and confused their dream for reality. Saying someone speaks by supernatural inspiration often just means they really want to speak or have a strong opinion of themselves, but they can’t give a good natural reason for it.
