When I think about it, I don’t often dream about the same people, places, or things that I do when I’m awake. I also don’t remember long, clear thoughts when I dream like I do when I’m awake. When I’m awake, I notice how strange dreams are, but when I’m dreaming, I don’t realize how weird my dreams are. Because of this, I’m sure that when I’m awake, I’m not dreaming, even though when I dream, I usually think I’m awake.

Dreams happen because something inside our bodies is not quite right. Different problems inside the body cause different kinds of dreams. For example, lying in the cold can cause scary dreams because the brain and body parts send signals back and forth. Just like when we’re angry and some parts of our body get hot while awake, the same parts can get too hot during sleep and make us imagine enemies.

Similarly, being kind or feeling desire when awake heats up other parts of the body. When these parts get too hot during sleep, they make us dream about kindness. So, our dreams are kind of the opposite of what we think about when we’re awake, starting from different places inside us.

It’s hardest to tell if we’re dreaming or awake when we don’t realize we’ve fallen asleep. This can happen easily if someone is full of fear or worried, especially if they fall asleep without going to bed properly, like nodding off in a chair. If someone tries hard to fall asleep and then has a strange or wild thought, it’s easy to know it’s just a dream.

There’s a story about Marcus Brutus, a man who was close to Julius Caesar but later killed him. The night before a big battle, he saw a scary figure that many people call a vision. But thinking about it, it was probably just a short dream. He was sitting in his tent, worried and tired, so it made sense for him to dream about what scared him the most. As he slowly woke up, the scary figure faded away. Since he wasn’t sure if he had been asleep, he didn’t know it was a dream and thought it was a real vision.
