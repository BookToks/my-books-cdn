A lot of people become one person when they are represented by one man or one person, but only if every single person agrees to it. It’s the person who represents them that makes them one, not the people themselves. The representative is the one who acts as that single person, and unity can’t happen any other way when there are many people.

Since a group is naturally many people, not one, they can only be understood as one through what their representative says or does in their name. Each person gives their representative the power to act for them, and everyone agrees to everything the representative does, but only if they give him full authority. If they limit what the representative can do, then he only does what they allow.

If the representative is a group of many people, the opinion of the larger number counts as the opinion of the whole group. For example, if the smaller group says yes but the bigger group says no, the no’s outnumber the yes’s. So, the group’s decision is no because the bigger side wins.

When the representative group has an even number of people, and they split equally, the group often can’t make a decision. But sometimes, an equal split can decide things, like in judging someone. If the votes are equal, not saying guilty means innocent, but not saying innocent doesn’t mean guilty.

When deciding on something, if the votes are tied, not making a decision is the same as choosing to wait. 

If the number of people is odd, like three or more, and each person can stop the others by saying no, this group can’t really represent everyone. Because people have different opinions, this kind of group often can’t make decisions, especially in important situations like war.

There are two kinds of people who act for others. The first kind is the one who simply owns or accepts the actions of another person.
