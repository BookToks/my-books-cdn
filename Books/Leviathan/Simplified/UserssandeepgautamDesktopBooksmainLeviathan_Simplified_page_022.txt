So, when something happens in one specific case, we start to think of it as a rule that works everywhere. This helps us stop thinking about every little detail of time and place, except the first time, and makes what was true here and now true all the time and everywhere.

Using words to keep track of our thoughts is really clear when it comes to numbers. Someone who can’t remember the order of number words like one, two, and three might notice the clock ticking and say “one, one, one,” but they wouldn’t know what time it is. There was a time when people didn’t have number words and used their fingers to count things. That’s why most languages have number words only up to ten, or sometimes five, and then start over. If someone can say numbers out of order, they get confused and won’t know when they’re done counting. Without words, we can’t really do math or measure things like speed and force, which are important for life.

When we put two names together to make a statement, like “A man is a living creature,” or “If he is a man, he is a living creature,” this statement is true if the second name means everything the first one does. If not, it’s false. Truth and falsehood only exist in speech, not in things themselves. Where there’s no speech, there’s no truth or falsehood.

People can make mistakes by expecting something that won’t happen, or by guessing something that isn’t true, but that doesn’t mean they are lying.

Since truth depends on using names correctly in our statements, anyone who wants to be really sure about the truth needs to remember exactly what each name means and use them in the right order. Otherwise, they’ll get stuck in confusing words, like a bird caught in sticky twigs—the more they struggle, the worse it gets. That’s why in geometry (the only science God has given us so far), people start by clearly defining their words at the beginning.

This shows how important it is for anyone who wants real knowledge to study the definitions made by earlier thinkers, and either fix them if they are careless or make their own.
