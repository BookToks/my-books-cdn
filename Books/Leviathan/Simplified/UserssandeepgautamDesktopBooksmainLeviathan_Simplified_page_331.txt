The Apostles Matthias, Paul, and Barnabas were not chosen by Jesus himself, but by the Church, which means the group of Christians. Matthias was picked by the church in Jerusalem, and Paul and Barnabas were chosen by the church in Antioch. In the same way, the elders and pastors in other cities were elected by the churches in those places.

To understand this better, let's look at how St. Paul chose elders in the cities where he had brought people to Christianity, right after he and Barnabas became apostles. The Bible says, “they ordained elders in every church” (Acts 14:23). At first, you might think that Paul and Barnabas picked these elders themselves. But if we check the original words, it shows that the elders were actually chosen and approved by the Christian community in each city. 

Back then, cities picked their leaders by voting, and people showed their vote by raising their hands. So, choosing an officer meant gathering the people to vote, either by raised hands, voices, or even by dropping small objects like stones or beans into marked containers. Different cities had different ways to do this. 

This means the church members voted to choose their elders. The apostles’ job was to lead the meeting, announce who was chosen, and bless them, which is called consecration. The leaders of these meetings, like elders or those who took over when apostles were not around, were called “proestetes” in Greek or “antistites” in Latin. These words mean the main person in charge of the meeting, who counted votes, announced results, and if there was a tie, made the final decision by adding their own vote.

Because all churches picked their elders this way, when the Bible says, “For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest constitute elders in every city,” (Titus 1:5), it means the same thing. The person in charge should gather the faithful, and the elders should be chosen by voting with the group.
