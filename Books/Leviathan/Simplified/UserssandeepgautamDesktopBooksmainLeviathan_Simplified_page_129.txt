Liberty, or freedom, means not having anything outside of you stopping you from moving. This idea applies not just to people who can think, but also to animals and even things that don’t think. For example, if something is tied up or stuck inside a small space because of something outside it, we say it doesn’t have freedom to move around. Like animals locked in cages or water held back by walls—it can’t spread out like it wants to because something is blocking it. But if something can’t move because of what it is inside, like a rock lying still or a sick person stuck in bed, we don’t say it lacks freedom, but that it lacks the ability to move.

A free person is someone who can do what they want, as long as they have the strength and smarts to do it, without being stopped. When we use words like "free" or "liberty" about things that don’t move, it doesn’t really make sense. For example, when we say a road is free, we mean the people walking on it can move without being stopped, not the road itself. When we say a gift is free, it doesn’t mean the gift has freedom, but that the person giving it wasn’t forced to do so. When we say someone speaks freely, it means no law made them say something else. And when we talk about "free will," it really means the person isn’t stopped by anything from doing what they want.

Fear and freedom can exist together. For example, if someone throws their stuff into the sea because they’re afraid the ship will sink, they are still choosing to do it freely and can decide not to if they want. Or someone might pay a debt because they fear going to jail, but since nothing is physically stopping them from not paying, they are still acting freely.
