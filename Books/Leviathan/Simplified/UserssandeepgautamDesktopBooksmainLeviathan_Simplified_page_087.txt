Accusations made because of torture shouldn’t be trusted as real evidence. Torture is only used to guess or get a clue for finding the truth. When someone confesses under torture, they do it to make their own suffering easier, not to help the people torturing them. So, these confessions shouldn’t be trusted as solid proof. Whether they tell the truth or lie, they do it to save their own life.

Words alone aren’t strong enough to make people keep their promises. There are only two ways to make sure people stick to their word. One is fear of what will happen if they break their promise. The other is pride or wanting to look good by keeping their word. But pride like that is rare, especially for people who want money, power, or pleasure—which is most people. So, fear is the main thing that makes people keep promises. There are two big kinds of fear: fear of invisible spirits (like gods) and fear of other people who can punish them. Even though spirits are more powerful, people usually fear other humans more.

Fear of spirits is part of every person’s religion and existed before society was formed. Fear of other people didn’t exist enough to keep promises before society started, because people couldn’t tell who was more powerful except by fighting. So, before society or during war when society breaks down, nothing can keep a peace agreement except fear of the invisible power that everyone worships as God and fears as a punisher of lies. So, when two people have no government above them, the best they can do is make each other swear by the God they fear. An oath is a special kind of promise where the person says that if they break their promise, they give up God's mercy or ask God to punish them. For example, the old way was like saying, "Let Jupiter kill me if I lie," and now we say, "I will do this, so help me God." People use their religious ceremonies to make breaking a promise feel even more serious.

This shows that an oath made in any other way than the one the person believes in is useless and not really an oath. Also, people only swear by what they believe is God.
