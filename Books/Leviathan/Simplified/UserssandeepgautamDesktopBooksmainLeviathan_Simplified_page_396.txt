The builders are the pastors, and the foundation is that Jesus is the Christ. The stubble and hay are wrong ideas people get because they don’t understand or make mistakes. The gold, silver, and precious stones are the true teachings, and refining or purging means giving up their mistakes. None of this supports the idea of burning souls that don’t have bodies.

A third point is about I Corinthians 15:29, which talks about baptism for the dead. Some people think this means prayers for the dead help, and from that, that purgatory exists. But both ideas are wrong. The word baptism here is understood by some as a metaphor for doing penance, like fasting, praying, and giving to the poor. So, baptism for the dead is like praying for them. But this is just a metaphor that doesn’t appear anywhere else in the Bible or in normal language. Also, praying, fasting, and giving don’t really compare to being dipped, which is what baptism means.

The word baptism is also used to mean being dipped in your own blood, like Jesus on the cross or the apostles who died for their faith. It’s hard to say that prayer or fasting is like dipping. In Matthew 3:11, baptism is linked to purging with fire, which might sound like purgatory. But this fire is the same fire talked about by the prophet Zechariah and the apostles Peter and Paul. They talk about a fire that tests faith on the day of judgment or when Christ returns. So, the fire in Matthew can be understood as that same fire, and there’s no need to think it means purgatory.

Another way to understand baptism for the dead is what I said before, which some think is more likely. From this, they believe praying for the dead is useful. If after resurrection people who didn’t know or believe in Christ can join his kingdom, then it makes sense for friends to pray for them after death until they rise again.
