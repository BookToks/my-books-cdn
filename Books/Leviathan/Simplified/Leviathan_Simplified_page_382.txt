In places where the Pope’s church has full power, Jews, Turks, and non-Christians are allowed to practice their religions as long as they don’t break the laws. But if a Christian, even a visitor, is not part of the Pope’s church, it’s a serious crime because the Pope claims all Christians belong to him. Otherwise, it would be just as wrong to punish a Christian visitor for their own religion as it would be to punish a non-believer. Actually, it might be worse, since those who aren’t against Christ are considered with him.

In every Christian country, some people are allowed to avoid paying taxes and don’t have to go to regular courts because of church laws. These include priests, monks, and friars. In many places, there are so many of them that, if needed, they could form an army to fight for the Church against kings or other rulers.

Another problem is how people misuse the idea of consecration. In the Bible, to consecrate means to set someone or something apart for God, making it holy and only for God’s use. It doesn’t mean the thing itself changes, just that it’s used differently, for God’s work. But some people claim consecration actually changes the nature of the thing, which is not what the Bible says. This isn’t a real miracle but more like a magic trick or spell, trying to make people believe something impossible.

For example, when a priest blesses bread and wine at Communion, the bread and wine are supposed to remind people of Jesus’s sacrifice. But some priests say the bread actually turns into Jesus’s body and the wine into his blood. However, to anyone’s senses, the bread and wine look and taste the same as before.
