Some people are chosen to be leaders. For example, a group of men might be put in charge of running a province. They make decisions by voting, and most votes win. This group has limited power given to them by someone higher up.

A province means a place or area that someone is responsible for. If one country has different regions with different laws or far apart, each area might be run by different people. The places where the main ruler doesn’t live but still controls are called provinces.

It’s rare for a province to be run by a group of people who live there. The Romans, who controlled many provinces, always picked one leader like a governor, not a group assembly like in the city of Rome. 

Similarly, when England sent groups to start colonies in places like Virginia, the government was controlled by assemblies in London. But those assemblies didn’t give power to any local group in the colonies. Instead, each colony had one governor. People usually want to be part of the government if they can be there. But if they can’t be present, they prefer to trust one leader rather than a group. This is like rich people who don’t want to manage everything themselves and prefer to trust one helper instead of a group.

Still, if a province or colony is run by a group, any debt or illegal decisions made by that group only count for the people who agreed, not those who disagreed or weren’t there. Also, a group controlling a colony from outside can’t control or take anything from people in the colony when they are outside the colony because they don’t have power there. They have to follow the laws of the place they are in. Even if the group can punish their own members who break rules, they can’t do this outside the colony.
