In the third book, he talks about whether the Pope is the Antichrist. For me, I don’t see any proof that the Pope is the Antichrist in the way the Bible uses the word. Also, I won’t use the idea of Antichrist to argue against the power the Pope has or had in different countries.

It’s clear that the prophets in the Old Testament said a Messiah, or Christ, would come to bring back God’s kingdom to the people. The Jews were waiting for this because they had rejected God’s rule when they asked for a king like other nations during Samuel’s time. Because they expected this, many fake Messiahs tricked people by doing fake miracles, living fake lives, or giving convincing speeches.

Jesus and his followers warned people about these fake prophets and false Christs. False Christs are people who say they are the Christ but aren’t. These false Christs are also called Antichrists. For example, when there were two Popes picked at the same time, one called the other a false Pope, or Antipope.

The word Antichrist has two main meanings: one, someone who says Jesus is not the Christ; and two, someone who says they are the Christ. The first meaning comes from St. John, who said that anyone who doesn’t believe Jesus came in the flesh is not from God and is the spirit of Antichrist. The second meaning comes from Jesus, who said many people would come claiming to be Christ, but we shouldn’t believe them.

So, an Antichrist is a false Christ—someone pretending to be Christ. Because of these two meanings, an Antichrist is against the true Jesus Christ. There are many Antichrists, but there is also one special Antichrist, a definite person.

Since the Pope doesn’t say he is Christ and doesn’t deny that Jesus is Christ, I don’t see why he would be called the Antichrist. The word Antichrist means someone who pretends to be Christ himself, not just his representative. There are also signs about when this special Antichrist will come, like the terrible destroyer called Leviathan mentioned by Daniel.
