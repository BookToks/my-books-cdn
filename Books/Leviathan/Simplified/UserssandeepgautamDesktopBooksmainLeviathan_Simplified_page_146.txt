But if someone whose personal business is being talked about and judged in a group tries to make as many friends as possible, it’s not unfair, because that person isn’t part of the group deciding. Even if they pay for those friends, unless there’s a law against it, it’s still not unfair.

Sometimes, because of how people act, you can’t get justice without money, and everyone thinks their own case is fair until it’s heard and judged.

In all countries, if a private person has more servants than they actually need for their work or property, that’s a problem and not allowed. Since the country protects them, they don’t need their own private army. In places not fully civilized, some big families have fought each other with their own forces, but it’s clear they were wrong or they didn’t have a proper country.

Just like groups based on family, groups based on religion—like Catholics or Protestants—or politics—like the rich and the common people in old Rome, or the rulers and the people in old Greece—are wrong because they disturb peace and take power away from the government.

When lots of people gather together, whether it’s okay or not depends on why they meet and how many show up. If the reason is good and clear, like meeting at church or a public event with normal crowds, it’s fine. But if the crowd is really big and there’s no clear reason, anyone there who can’t explain why they are is probably involved in something illegal and chaotic. It might be okay for a thousand people to sign a petition to a judge, but if all thousand show up to give it, that’s a wild crowd—just one or two people are enough for that. The problem isn’t the number itself, but whether the officials can control the crowd and keep order.

When a big group gathers to accuse someone, that’s an illegal riot because they could have just sent one or two people to the judge. For example, in Ephesus, Demetrius and many others brought two of Paul’s friends before the judge, shouting together, “Great is Diana of the Ephesians!” They wanted justice because Paul was teaching things that hurt their religion and business.
