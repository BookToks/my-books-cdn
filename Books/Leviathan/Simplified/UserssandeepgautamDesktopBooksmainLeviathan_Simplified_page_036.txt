Fear without knowing why or what causes panic or terror. This is called panic because of stories that say Pan caused it. But actually, when someone is scared, they usually first understand what caused it. Then others run away too, just because they see others doing it, thinking someone else knows the reason. That’s why panic usually happens only in groups of people.

Joy comes from seeing something new or amazing. This kind of happiness is special to humans because it makes us want to learn more about the cause.

Joy from thinking about your own power or ability is called glorying. If this feeling comes from knowing what you’ve really done before, it’s called confidence. But if it comes from others praising you or just thinking you’re great without proof, it’s called vainglory. Vainglory is called “vain” because real confidence leads to action, but just thinking you’re powerful doesn’t.

Grief, or sadness, comes from feeling like you don’t have power and is called dejection of mind.

Vainglory, where people pretend or think they have skills they don’t really have, is common in young people. It’s often encouraged by stories about brave heroes and usually gets better as people grow older and gain experience.

Sudden glory is the feeling that makes people laugh. It happens when someone suddenly does something that makes them happy, or when they see someone else’s fault and feel better about themselves by comparison. People who laugh a lot at others’ mistakes usually don’t feel very confident themselves. Big-hearted people try to help others instead of making fun of them and compare themselves only with the best.

On the other hand, sudden sadness makes people cry. This happens when someone suddenly loses a big hope or something they depended on. Women and children, who often depend on outside help, feel this the most.

So, some people cry because they lose friends, others because friends are unkind, and some because they stop wanting revenge after making peace. But both laughing and crying happen suddenly, and over time, people usually stop reacting that way.
