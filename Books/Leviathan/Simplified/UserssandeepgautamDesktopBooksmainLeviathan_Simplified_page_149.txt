People who have the power to make legal decisions are called public ministers. When they sit in court, they represent the ruler’s authority, and their decisions are like the ruler’s decisions. This is because all judging power comes from the ruler. So, all other judges work for the ruler or those who have the ruler’s power. 

There are two types of disputes: about facts and about the law. Judges make decisions about facts or about the law. Sometimes, in one case, you may have two judges—one judging the facts and the other judging the law.

Sometimes, the person being judged and the judge might disagree. Since both are under the ruler’s power, a fair solution is for people both sides agree on to judge the case. No one should judge their own problem. The ruler is already accepted by both sides as the final judge. So, the ruler either decides the case or chooses a judge both sides agree on. 

This agreement happens in different ways. First, if the person being judged thinks some judges are biased, they can reject those judges. The judges left are the ones they agree on. Second, if they appeal to another judge, they can’t appeal any further because that judge is their choice. Third, if they appeal to the ruler, the ruler’s decision is final because the person is judged by their own judge—that is, the ruler.

Thinking about how fair and smart judging works, I have to say the courts in England are very well set up. There are courts for cases between regular people, called “common pleas,” and courts for cases where the ruler is the one complaining, called “public pleas” or “pleas of the crown.” 

In the past, there were two groups of people: lords and commons. The lords had a special right that only other lords could judge them in serious crimes. This was seen as a favor because the lords got to choose their own judges.
