Second, don't be ungrateful. All power from rulers comes from the agreement of the people they rule, so as long as people follow the rules, they should be protected. Punishing innocent people is giving evil for good, which is wrong.

Third, the law demands fairness, which means justice should be equal for everyone. Punishing innocent people does not follow this rule.

Hurting innocent people who are not part of the country can be okay if it's for the good of the country and doesn’t break any agreements. People outside the country are either enemies or no longer part of it because of past agreements. It’s okay to fight enemies to protect the country. In war, winners don’t always care if someone was innocent or guilty before; they only think about their own people’s safety. This is why when people inside the country openly reject its authority, punishment can be passed down to their children and grandchildren, even if those future generations are innocent. This happens because rejecting authority is like starting a new war, called rebellion, so those people are treated as enemies, not citizens.

Rewards come in two ways: gifts or contracts. If it’s a contract, like a salary or wages, it means payment for work done or promised. If it’s a gift, it’s given freely to encourage people to help. When the leader gives a salary for a public job, the person getting paid must do their job properly. If not paid, they only owe respect and should try to repay in some way. People aren’t required by natural law or the country’s rules to leave their private work to serve the public without payment, unless no one else can do the job. The leader can use everyone’s abilities, but even a common soldier can demand their wages for fighting.
