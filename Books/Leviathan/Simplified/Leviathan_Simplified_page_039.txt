I don’t find any other way to show feelings like anger or hate. Swearing and cursing don’t really count as real speech; they’re just things people say out of habit.

These kinds of words show what we’re feeling on purpose, but they don’t always mean what they seem to because people can say them even if they don’t really feel that way. The best way to tell how someone feels is by looking at their face, body movements, actions, and goals, especially if we already know them.

When people think about what to do, their wants and dislikes come from imagining the good or bad results of their choices. The outcome depends on how well they can predict a long chain of events, which is hard for most people. If the good things they imagine are more than the bad, they think the choice is good. If the bad things are more, the choice seems bad. People who have experience or reason and can see the results clearly make the best decisions and can give the best advice to others.

Always getting what you want over time, or having good luck, is what people call happiness in life. True peace of mind doesn’t last forever while we are alive because life is always changing, and we always want or fear something, just like we always feel things. The kind of happiness God gives to people who truly honor Him is something we won’t understand until we experience it. It’s like the hard-to-understand idea called the “beatific vision.”

When people talk about how good something is, they use praise. When they talk about how powerful or great something is, they use words that make it sound bigger. The way the Greeks showed someone’s happiness or blessedness is called “macarism,” but we don’t have a word for that in English. That’s enough for now about feelings and passions.
