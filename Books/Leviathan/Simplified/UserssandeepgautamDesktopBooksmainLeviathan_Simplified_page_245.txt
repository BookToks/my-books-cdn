Leviathan/245

When it says, “And Jesus full of the Holy Ghost” (Luke 4:1), or as Matthew 4:1 and Mark 1:12 say, “of the Holy Spirit,” it can mean that Jesus was very eager and ready to do the work God sent him to do. But to think it means Jesus was filled with a ghost is wrong, because Jesus is God Himself. Saying He was filled with God doesn’t make sense.

I won’t go into why we translate the word “spirits” as “ghosts,” which doesn’t really mean anything real, just something made up in people’s minds. The word “spirit” here doesn’t mean a ghost, but either a real thing or a special kind of power or feeling inside the mind or body.

Jesus’ followers thought he was a spirit when they saw him walking on water (Matthew 14:26 and Mark 6:49). They meant he looked like a body made of air, not a fake image. They all saw him, which means it wasn’t just a trick of their minds, because people don’t share the same hallucination. They meant a real body.

In the same way, when the apostles thought Jesus was a spirit (Luke 24:3,7), or when Peter was freed from prison and no one believed it until a girl said he was at the door, they said it was his angel (Acts 12:15). This means they thought of angels as real, physical beings, not just made-up images. Both Jews and Gentiles believed these kinds of appearances were real, not just fantasies. Jews called them spirits or angels, and Greeks called them demons.

Some of these appearances could be real and physical—subtle bodies that God made using His power. God uses these beings as messengers, or angels, to share His will and act in special ways. When God makes them, they are real bodies with size and take up space. They can move around, which is something only bodies can do. So, these are not ghosts without bodies, not invisible things that are nowhere.

But if you think of “bodies” as only things we can see or touch, then spirits are still real but invisible and very thin. They still have size like normal bodies, just much more subtle.
