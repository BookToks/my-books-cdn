To finish, I don’t see anything in this whole discussion, or in what I wrote before in Latin on the same topic, that goes against God’s word, good behavior, or peace in society. So, I think it could be useful to print it and teach it at universities, if they agree. 

Since universities are the main places where people learn about how to live and behave, and preachers and leaders get their ideas from there to share with others, it’s really important that what they teach is pure and free from bad influences or lies. If that happens, most people will understand their responsibilities better and won’t be easily tricked by a few unhappy people trying to cause trouble. Also, the government won’t need to spend too much on a big army, only enough to protect the country from outside threats.

So, I have finished my discussion about how civil and church governments should work, based on the problems of our time. I wrote it fairly, without picking sides, and just to show how protection and obedience are connected. Human nature and both natural and divine laws say this connection must be respected. 

Even though it’s hard for ideas like this to be accepted when governments are changing—because people are angry about the old system ending and don’t trust the new one—I don’t think this will be rejected now by experts or anyone who wants peace to continue. With that hope, I will go back to my study of natural bodies; if I stay healthy and finish it, I hope people will like the new ideas there just as much as they might dislike the ideas in this work. Truth that doesn’t harm anyone’s benefit or happiness is welcome to all.

The End
