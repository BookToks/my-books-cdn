There are four main types of names.

First, a thing can be named based on its matter or body; like living, feeling, thinking, hot, cold, moving, or still. When we use these words, we understand them as names of matter or body.

Second, a thing can be named based on some quality or accident it has; like being moved, being long, or being hot. From the name of the thing, we change it a little to make a name for that quality. For example, from living, we get life; from moved, motion; from hot, heat; and from long, length. These are called abstract names because they come from the qualities of matter, not from the matter itself.

Third, we name things based on how we experience them with our own bodies. For example, when we see something, we don’t name the thing itself but the sight, the color, or the image in our mind. When we hear something, we name the sound or hearing, which is how we understand it through our ears. These names are based on our own ideas or imagination.

Fourth, we name names and speeches themselves. Words like general, universal, special, and equivocal are names of names. Words like affirmation, question, command, story, argument, sermon, and speech are names of types of speech. This covers all the positive names that we use to mark things in nature, things we can imagine, their qualities, or words and speech.

There are also negative names. These show that a word is not the name of the thing being talked about. For example, words like nothing, no man, infinite, unspeakable, or "three lacks four" don’t name real things but help us think clearly and avoid wrong names.

All other names are just meaningless sounds. These are of two kinds.

One kind is new names whose meanings haven’t been clearly explained yet. Many such names have been made up by scholars and confusing philosophers.
