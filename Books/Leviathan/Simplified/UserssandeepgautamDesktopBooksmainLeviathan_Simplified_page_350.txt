This reason is not valid unless someone can show when and where Christ told people to obey a Pope or even cared about a Pope. Even if everything given to St. Peter was also given to the Pope, the Bible does not say anyone must obey the Pope if his orders go against those of their rightful ruler.

Also, neither the Church nor the Pope has said that the Pope is the civil leader of all Christians in the world. So, not all Christians have to accept his authority over laws and behavior. Civil leadership and the power to decide right and wrong in behavior are the same thing. The people who make civil laws decide what is right or wrong, because what makes actions right or wrong is following the laws of the ruler. So, when the Pope claims power over behavior, he is telling people to disobey their civil rulers, which is wrong and goes against many teachings from Jesus and his Apostles in the Bible.

To try to prove the Pope can make laws, he uses some Bible verses. First, from Deuteronomy 17:12, it says, "The man who disobeys the priest or judge shall die." But we need to remember that the high priest was also the civil ruler under God, and all judges were appointed by him. So this verse really means, "Anyone who disobeys the current civil ruler or his officers will be punished," which supports civil authority, not the Pope’s universal power.

Second, he uses Matthew 16, where Jesus says, "What you bind on earth…" and says this means the Pope can make laws like the Scribes and Pharisees did. But this actually supports the power of civil rulers because the Scribes and Pharisees were leaders under Moses, who was the real ruler under God. Jesus told people to obey their laws but not to copy their bad behavior.
