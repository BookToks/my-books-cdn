This is the basis of the power to punish that every government uses. People don’t give the ruler this power directly; instead, when they give up some of their own rights, they make the ruler stronger to use their own power in the way they think is best to protect everyone. So, this power isn’t given to the ruler, but left to them alone, except for the limits set by natural law, just like in a state of nature where everyone is against everyone else.

From the meaning of punishment, I understand a few things. First, private people taking revenge or hurting others can’t be called punishment because it doesn’t come from public authority.

Second, being ignored or not liked by the public isn’t punishment because no new harm is done; the person just stays in the same situation as before.

Third, if public authority causes harm without first officially judging the person guilty, it isn’t punishment but an act of hostility. Punishment should only happen after a public decision that someone broke the law.

Fourth, if power is taken illegally and judges without real authority punish someone, that isn’t punishment but an act of hostility. This is because such power doesn’t come from the rightful ruler and isn’t official.

Fifth, if harm is done without trying to correct the wrongdoer or warn others to follow the law, it isn’t punishment but hostility. Without this goal, causing harm isn’t called punishment.

Sixth, some harmful results happen naturally, like when someone attacking another person gets hurt or sick because of their own bad actions. Even though God might see this as punishment, it isn’t called punishment by humans because it isn’t done by human authority.

Seventh, if the harm done is less than the pleasure or benefit gained from the crime, it isn’t really punishment but more like paying a price for the crime. Punishment’s real purpose is to make people follow the law, and if the harm is too small, it won’t work and might even encourage more crime.
