Proud men who think they are enough just because others praise them or because something similar worked before often jump into things without really knowing themselves. When danger or problems come, they try to back off if they can. They don’t see a safe way out, so they risk their reputation, which can be fixed with an excuse, rather than their lives, which can’t be fixed.

People who think they are really smart about running things often want power. Without a public job or position, their smartness doesn’t get noticed. That’s why good speakers often want power; talking well seems like being smart, both to themselves and others.

Being scared or weak-minded makes people unsure and miss chances to act. If after thinking for a long time it’s still not clear what to do, it means the reasons for doing one thing or another aren’t very different. So, not deciding then means losing the chance because of worrying about small things, which shows weakness.

Saving money is good for poor people, but it can make someone bad at doing things that need a lot of people working together. That’s because rewards help keep people motivated and strong.

Talking well and giving compliments makes people trust those who do it. Talking well seems smart, and compliments seem kind.

If someone is also known for being good in the military, people will trust and follow them. The first two qualities make people careful around them, and the last one makes them careful about others.

Not knowing science or causes forces people to rely on others’ advice and authority. If you don’t trust yourself, you have to trust someone you think is smarter and won’t lie to you.

Not understanding what words mean makes people believe not only things they don’t know are true but also mistakes and nonsense from those they trust. Without really understanding words, you can’t spot errors or nonsense.

Because of this, people call the same thing by different names based on their feelings. For example, those who like a private opinion call it just an opinion, but those who don’t like it call it heresy. Yet, heresy just means a private opinion, but with more anger behind it.
