To prove that believing “Jesus is the Christ” is all the faith needed for salvation, my first point comes from the stories told by the gospel writers. Their goal was to show that one thing is true: Jesus is the Christ.

St. Matthew’s Gospel tells us that Jesus came from King David’s family and was born to a virgin, which are signs of the true Christ. The wise men came to worship him as King of the Jews, and King Herod wanted to kill him for the same reason. John the Baptist announced him, and Jesus and his Apostles taught that he was the promised King. He taught with authority, not like ordinary teachers, healed people by just speaking, and did many miracles that were predicted to prove he was the Christ. When Jesus entered Jerusalem, people called him King. He warned them to be careful of anyone else claiming to be the Christ. Jesus was arrested, accused, and put to death for saying he was King. The sign on his cross said, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.” All these things point to one main idea: people should believe Jesus is the Christ. This was the main purpose of St. Matthew’s Gospel. The other gospel writers had the same goal. St. John even says clearly, “These things are written so you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.”

My second point comes from what the Apostles preached, both when Jesus was alive and after he went to heaven. While Jesus was alive, the Apostles were sent to tell people about God’s kingdom. They were told only to say, “The kingdom of heaven is near,” meaning Jesus is the Messiah, the Christ, the coming King. After Jesus went to heaven, the Apostles kept preaching the same message. The book of Acts says that some people complained to city leaders because the Apostles were saying there is another king, Jesus. Paul, one of the Apostles, often talked with people for days, explaining from the Scriptures that Christ had to suffer, die, and rise again, and that Jesus is the Christ.
