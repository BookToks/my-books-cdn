27) Someone will stand in the holy place, and there will be a terrible time unlike anything the world has ever seen, so bad that if it lasted too long, no one could survive. But for the sake of God’s chosen people, those days will be made shorter. However, this terrible time hasn’t happened yet. Right after it, the sun and moon will go dark, stars will fall, the sky will shake, and our Savior will come back in glory on the clouds. So, the Antichrist has not come yet, even though many Popes have come and gone. It’s true that the Pope tries to make laws for all Christian kings and countries, taking power in this world that Christ didn’t take for himself. But the Pope doesn’t do this like Christ did, only in Christ’s name, so this isn’t the Antichrist.

In the fourth book, to prove that the Pope is the highest judge in all faith and behavior matters—which means he would be the absolute ruler of all Christians—three points are made: first, that his decisions are always right; second, that he can make real laws and punish people who don’t follow them; third, that Jesus gave all church authority to the Pope of Rome.

To prove that the Pope’s decisions are always right, the book uses the Bible. It points to Luke 22:31, where Jesus says, “Simon, Simon, Satan wants to test you like wheat, but I have prayed that your faith won’t fail; and when you turn back, strengthen your brothers.” According to Bellarmine’s explanation, this means Jesus gave Peter two powers: one, that Peter’s faith and the faith of his successors would never fail; two, that neither Peter nor his successors would ever make a wrong decision about faith or behavior, or go against previous Popes. This is a very stretched and strange way to understand it. But anyone who reads that chapter carefully will see it actually argues against the Pope’s authority.

At that time, priests and scribes wanted to kill Jesus at the Passover, and Judas was ready to betray him. When the day came, Jesus celebrated the Passover with his disciples and said he wouldn’t celebrate it again until God’s kingdom came. He also told them someone would betray him. They asked who it would be. They also argued about who would be the greatest when Jesus became king. Jesus told them that kings rule over their people and are called by a Hebrew word meaning generous, but He wouldn’t be like that with them. Instead, they had to serve each other. He said He was giving them a kingdom, but it was the kind His Father gave Him—a kingdom He would earn by dying and wouldn’t fully have until His second coming. Then they would eat and drink with Him and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
