After the Athenians defeated the Persian armies, they became the rulers of the sea. This gave them control over all the islands and coastal cities in both Asia and Europe. Because of this, they became rich. People who didn’t have work, either at home or abroad, mostly spent their time either sharing news, as St. Luke says, “telling and hearing news,” or talking about philosophy in public with the young people of the city.

Every teacher had a special place to teach. Plato taught in some public gardens called the Academia, named after a man named Academus. Aristotle taught near the temple of Pan, in a place called the Lyceum. Others taught in the Stoa, which was a covered walkway where merchants brought their goods. Some taught in other spots wherever they could gather young people to listen. This is what Carneades did when he was in Rome as an ambassador, which made Cato want the Senate to send him away quickly because he was worried Carneades might influence the young people too much with his speeches.

Because of this, the places where they taught and debated were called “schola,” which means leisure, and their discussions were called “diatribae,” meaning passing the time. The philosophers were named after their schools too. Followers of Plato were called Academics. Followers of Aristotle were called Peripatetics, because he taught while walking around. Those who followed Zeno were called Stoics, named after the Stoa. It’s like if people today were named after the spots they hang out, like More-fields or Paul’s Church.

This habit became very popular and eventually spread across Europe and much of Africa. Schools for lectures and debates were set up and supported by almost every community.

The Jews also had schools before and after Jesus’s time, but theirs were focused on their religious laws. These places were called synagogues, meaning gatherings of people. Every Sabbath, the law was read, explained, and discussed there. So, they were very similar to public schools, just with a different name. Synagogues were not only in Jerusalem but also in many cities where Jewish people lived. For example, there was one in Damascus where Paul went to persecute, and others in Antioch, Iconium, and Thessalonica where he debated. There was also a synagogue for Libertines, Cyrenians, Alexandrians, Cilicians, and Jews from Asia in Jerusalem. They were the ones who argued with St. Paul.
