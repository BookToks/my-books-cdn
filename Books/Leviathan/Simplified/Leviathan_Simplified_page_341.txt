It’s natural to use your hands to show something important, so people can see it clearly, rather than just telling them about it with words, especially when it comes to serving God.

This ceremony wasn’t new during Jesus’ time. For example, Jairus, whose daughter was sick, asked Jesus not just to heal her, but to lay his hands on her to make her better. People also brought little children to Jesus so he could put his hands on them and pray.

Long ago, the Apostles and church leaders laid their hands on people they made pastors, while praying that they would receive the Holy Spirit. Sometimes they did this more than once when there was a new reason, but the goal was always the same: to officially choose someone as a pastor or send them on a special mission. For example, the Apostles prayed and laid hands on seven deacons not to give them the Holy Spirit (because they already had it), but to officially give them that job.

After Philip the Deacon helped some people in Samaria become believers, Peter and John laid hands on those people, and they received the Holy Spirit. Not only Apostles but also church leaders had this power. St. Paul told Timothy not to lay hands on someone too quickly, meaning don’t make someone a pastor without thinking carefully. The whole group of leaders laid hands on Timothy, but probably just a few did it for the group, maybe even Paul himself.

Paul also said to Timothy, “Stir up the gift of God in you by the laying on of my hands.” Here, the Holy Spirit means the special abilities needed to be a pastor, not the third person of the Trinity. Paul had hands laid on him twice: once by Ananias when he became a Christian, and again at Antioch when he was sent out to preach.

So, this ceremony of laying on hands was used to officially give someone the power to be a pastor. But if someone already had the ability to teach and baptize because they were a Christian, baptism alone was enough, and laying on of hands wasn’t needed.
