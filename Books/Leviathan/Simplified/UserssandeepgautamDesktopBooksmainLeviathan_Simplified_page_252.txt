Even though God isn’t called “King” yet, and Abraham and his family don’t have a “kingdom” yet, it’s still the same idea. It means God has a special rule over Abraham’s descendants. When Moses made the same agreement with the people at Mount Sinai, it was called God’s special kingdom over the Jewish people. St. Paul says Abraham is the father of those who believe and stay loyal to God. This loyalty was shown first through circumcision, and later through baptism in the New Covenant.

At Mount Sinai, God told Moses to tell the people, “If you obey me and keep my agreement, you will be my special people, because I own the whole earth. You will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” Different Bible versions translate “special people” in different ways, like “a special treasure” or “the most precious jewel,” but the best meaning is “a special group set apart.” St. Paul explains this by saying that Jesus gave Himself to make us a special people for God. The original Greek word means something extra or special, not ordinary or common.

God also explains why they are special by saying, “The whole earth belongs to me.” That means God owns all nations because He has power, but the Jewish people belong to Him in a special way because they agreed to be His people. This kind of relationship is different from the usual way God owns everything.

God also says again, “You will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” This means the people have a royal priesthood, which is a special and important group chosen by God.
