Some rights are things a person can never give up or give away, no matter what words or signs they use.

First, a person can’t give up the right to fight back if someone tries to hurt or kill them because no one would do that to help themselves. The same goes for being hurt, chained, or locked up. There’s no good that comes from just putting up with that, and it’s hard to know if someone using violence wants to kill you or not. Also, the whole point of giving up rights is to keep yourself safe and alive. So, if someone seems to give up that right by words or actions, it probably means they don’t really understand what those words or actions mean.

When people agree to give each other rights, that’s called a contract.

There’s a difference between giving someone the right to something and giving them the actual thing itself.

Sometimes the thing and the right to it are given at the same time, like when you buy something with cash or trade goods or land. Other times, the thing is given later.

Sometimes one person gives their part of the deal first and trusts the other person to do their part later. That kind of contract is called a pact or covenant. Or both people might agree to do their parts later. When someone promises to do something in the future and is trusted to do it, that’s called keeping a promise or faith. If they don’t do it on purpose, that’s breaking faith.

If one person gives something hoping to get friendship, help, a good reputation, feel better, or get a reward in heaven, that’s not a contract. It’s called a gift or grace.

Contracts can be shown clearly by words or actions. Clear words are either about now or the past, like “I give,” “I have given,” or about the future, like “I will give.” Words about the future are called promises.
