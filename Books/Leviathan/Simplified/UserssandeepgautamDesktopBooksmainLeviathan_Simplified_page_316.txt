When it comes to keeping people out of their synagogues or meeting places, they couldn’t do it unless the owner of the place allowed it, no matter if the owner was Christian or not. Since all places were under the control of the government, anyone, whether they were excommunicated or never baptized, could enter if they had permission from the authorities. For example, Paul went into synagogues in Damascus before he became a Christian to arrest Christians, because he had permission from the high priest (Acts 9:2).

This shows that if a Christian stopped believing in a place where the government didn’t support the Church, excommunication didn’t really hurt them or scare them. It didn’t scare them because they didn’t believe, and it didn’t hurt them because they could still be accepted by the world. Also, in the afterlife, they wouldn’t be worse off than people who never believed. Actually, it hurt the Church more, because the people they kicked out would cause more trouble.

So, excommunication only worked on people who believed that Jesus would come back to judge everyone and wouldn’t let those with unconfessed sins into his kingdom. That’s why St. Paul called excommunication giving someone over to Satan. Without Jesus’ kingdom, all other kingdoms belong to Satan after judgment. The faithful were afraid of this while they were excommunicated because it meant their sins weren’t forgiven. This means that before Christianity was supported by the government, excommunication was used just to correct bad behavior, not wrong beliefs. It was a punishment that only made sense to those who believed Jesus would return to judge the world, and those people just needed to live good lives to be saved.

Excommunication could happen because of injustice. For example, if your brother sins against you, first talk to him privately, then with witnesses, and finally tell the Church. If he still doesn’t listen, treat him like a stranger or an outsider (Matthew 18:15-17). It could also happen because of a bad lifestyle, like if someone called a brother is a sinner, greedy, worships idols, drinks too much, or cheats others. With people like that, you shouldn’t even eat with them.
