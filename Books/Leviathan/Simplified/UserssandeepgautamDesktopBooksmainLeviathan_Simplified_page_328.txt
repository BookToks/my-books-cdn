The first meeting that decided which books should be in the Bible we have now is lost. There was a list of these books made by Clemens, the first bishop of Rome after St. Peter, but people aren’t sure about it. Even though it lists the right books, it talks about clergy (church leaders) and laity (regular people) in a way that wasn’t common back then, close to St. Peter’s time. 

The first council that still exists and talked about which books should be in the Bible was the one at Laodicea. Rule 59 says only certain books can be read in church, but this rule was only for church leaders, not for every Christian.

In the time of the Apostles, church leaders had different jobs. Some were magisterial, meaning they preached the gospel, helped with sacraments, and taught new believers. Others were ministerial, like deacons, who took care of the church’s everyday needs using money given by the followers.

Among the magisterial leaders, the main ones were the Apostles. There were twelve at first, chosen by Jesus himself. Their job was to preach, teach, baptize, and also to be witnesses of Jesus’ resurrection. This was the key thing that made Apostles different from other church leaders: they had to have seen Jesus after he rose from the dead or known him personally before, so they could prove he was truly divine.

When they needed to replace Judas Iscariot, Peter said that the new Apostle had to be someone who had been with them the whole time Jesus was alive, from John the Baptist’s baptism until Jesus’ ascension. This was important because an Apostle had to have been a close witness to Jesus during his life on Earth.
