The darkest part of Satan’s kingdom is where the Church of God isn’t present—that means among people who don’t believe in Jesus Christ. But we can’t say that the Church has all the light it needs to do the work God wants us to do.

Why is it that in Christianity, almost since the time of the Apostles, there has been so much fighting, both between countries and within them? Why do people trip over small problems in their own lives or get jealous of others? Why do people follow so many different paths even though they’re all trying to reach the same goal of happiness? If it’s not total darkness among us, it’s at least very foggy. So, we are still in the dark.

The enemy has come during our ignorance and planted spiritual mistakes. First, by twisting and hiding the true meaning of the Scriptures, because we make mistakes when we don’t understand the Bible.

Second, by bringing in ideas from old pagan stories about demons, which are just made-up things like ghosts and fairies, not real beings. Third, by mixing the Bible with leftover parts of old religions and wrong Greek philosophies, especially those from Aristotle. Fourth, by adding false or unclear traditions and made-up history. Because of all this, we make mistakes by listening to people who lie with fake spirits and false teachings, as the Bible warns in 1 Timothy 4:1-2. I will talk a little about the first problem—people abusing Scripture—in this chapter.

The biggest problem with how people misuse the Bible is when they say the kingdom of God means the current Church or all Christians alive today, or those who will rise again later. But the kingdom of God started with Moses and was only for the Jewish people, who were called God’s special people. It ended when they chose Saul as king and refused to be ruled by God directly, which God agreed to, as I explained before in chapter thirty-five.
