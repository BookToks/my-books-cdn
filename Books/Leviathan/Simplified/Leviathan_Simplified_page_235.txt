The events mentioned in Joshua happened long before the books were actually written. There are many examples like this in Joshua, Judges, and Ruth. For instance, Judges 18:30 says that Jonathan and his sons were priests until the land was taken captive, which shows the book was written after that happened.

The Books of Samuel were also written after the events took place. For example, in I Samuel, David made a rule about sharing spoils that still applied "to this day," meaning the book was written later. Also, when David named a place Perez-uzzah after a specific event, the book says that name is still used "to this day," proving the writing happened long after David’s time.

The Books of Kings and Chronicles mention things that lasted until the writer’s own time. Since the stories go up to the Babylonian captivity, these books were written after that. They also refer to other records and prophets, showing that the events happened earlier than when the books were written.

The Books of Esdras and Nehemiah were written after the people returned from captivity because they talk about rebuilding Jerusalem and renewing their laws.

Queen Esther’s story is set during the captivity, so the writer lived during or after that time.

The Book of Job doesn’t say when it was written, and although it shows that Job was a real person, there’s no clear time given in the book itself.
