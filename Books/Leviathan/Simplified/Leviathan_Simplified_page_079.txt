Even though individual people have never been in a constant state of war against each other, kings and rulers have always been jealous and ready to fight because they want to stay independent. They watch each other closely, like gladiators ready to fight, with forts, soldiers, and weapons on their borders, and spies spying on their neighbors. This is like being in a state of war. But because this keeps their people working and producing, it doesn’t cause the kind of suffering that happens when regular people are free to do whatever they want.

In a situation where everyone is fighting against everyone else, nothing is unfair or wrong. Ideas like right and wrong, justice and injustice don’t exist. Without a common power to make laws, there is no law, and without law, there is no injustice. In war, being strong and sneaky are the most important things. Justice and injustice aren’t part of a person’s body or mind. If they were, a person alone in the world could be just or unjust, but they aren’t. These ideas only make sense when people live together in a society, not when they are alone. Also, in this kind of condition, no one owns anything for sure; everything belongs to whoever can grab it and keep it. This is the bad condition humans naturally live in, but there is a chance to get out of it, partly because of feelings and partly because of reason.

The feelings that push people toward peace are fear of death, wanting things needed for a comfortable life, and hoping to get those things by working. Reason helps people agree on fair rules to keep peace. These rules are called the laws of nature, which I will explain more in the next chapters.

The natural right, which some call jus naturale, means that everyone has the freedom to use their own power however they want to protect their own life. This means doing anything they think is the best way to survive.

Liberty means not having outside things stopping you. Sometimes outside things can take away some of a person’s power to do what they want, but they can’t stop a person from using the power they still have, based on their own judgement and reason.
