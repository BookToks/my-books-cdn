Many people have noticed the idea of religion. Some of them tried to take care of it, shape it into rules, and add their own ideas about what might cause future events. They believed this would help them control others and get more power for themselves.

Religion only appears in humans, not in animals or other living things. This is because humans have a special quality or ability that others don’t.

First, humans like to ask why things happen. Everyone is curious about what causes their good or bad luck.

Second, when humans see something start, they also think about what caused it to start at that exact time, not earlier or later.

Third, animals only care about food, comfort, and desires because they don’t really think about the future. But humans notice how one event leads to another. They remember what happened before and after. When they don’t know the real reasons for things, they make up causes or trust what others say, especially those they think are wiser.

The first two points make people worried. Since everything has a cause, and they want to avoid bad things and get good things, people are always anxious about the future. This is especially true for those who try too hard to prepare.

Like Prometheus, a wise man from a story, who was tied to a mountain and had an eagle eat his liver every day, people who worry too much about the future feel scared all the time. Their fear of death, poverty, or problems never stops, except when they sleep.
