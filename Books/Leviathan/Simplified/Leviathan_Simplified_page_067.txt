People have always been scared of things they don’t understand, like being in the dark without knowing what’s causing their problems. When they can’t see anything, they blame some invisible power. That’s probably why old poets said gods were made because of human fear. This is true when talking about many gods from different religions.

But believing in one God who is eternal, unlimited, and all-powerful comes more from people wanting to understand how the world works, not just from being scared of what might happen. If someone thinks deeply about how things happen, they will realize there must be one First Mover, or a first cause of everything. This is what people mean by God. This idea comes from thinking about causes, not just worrying about their future. Worrying too much can make people afraid and stop them from trying to understand the world, which leads to making up many gods.

When people thought about what these invisible powers might be made of, they could only imagine something like the human soul. They thought the soul was like what appears in dreams or reflections in a mirror—things that seem real but aren’t actually there. Because people didn’t know these were just imaginary, they called them ghosts. The Romans called them images or shadows and thought they were spirits, like thin air bodies, that could appear and disappear.

However, the idea that these spirits don’t have a body or material form couldn’t come naturally to people. Even if they put together words like “spirit” and “incorporeal” (meaning without a body), they couldn’t really imagine what that means. So, people who believe in one unlimited and eternal God usually say He is beyond human understanding. They don’t try to explain God as a spirit without a body because that would be confusing. Instead, they use such words respectfully to honor God, showing He is very different from visible, physical things.
