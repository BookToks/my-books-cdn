Reasoning came after people started speaking, so it makes sense that some basic truths were discovered by thinking a long time ago, almost as soon as language began. The native people of America had some good moral ideas and could do simple math like adding and dividing small numbers, but that didn’t make them philosophers.

Just like how small amounts of corn and grapes grew wild before people knew they could eat or grow them, there were a few true and useful ideas from the start because human reason naturally creates them. But these ideas were few, and people mostly learned from direct experience. There was no system for learning, no way to grow knowledge separately from mistakes and guesses.

This happened because people were busy finding food and protecting themselves, so they didn’t have time to think deeply. Only when big governments were formed did people have the free time needed for philosophy. Free time is what helps people think deeply, and governments bring peace and free time. The first big and successful cities were where philosophy started.

The oldest known philosophers were the Gymnosophists in India, the Magi in Persia, and the priests in Chaldaea and Egypt, which were some of the oldest kingdoms. Philosophy didn’t start with the Greeks or other Western people, whose small city-states were often at war and only focused on each other. Later, when war combined many Greek cities into larger ones, seven men from different parts of Greece became known as wise. Some shared ideas about morals and politics, and others studied astronomy and geometry from Chaldaea and Egypt. But at that time, there were still no formal schools of philosophy.
