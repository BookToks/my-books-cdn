Fairies don’t get married, but there are some incubi among them that have relationships with real people. Priests don’t marry either.

Religious leaders take the best things from the land because ignorant people, who respect them a lot, give them donations and tithes. This is like the story of fairies, who sneak into dairies and take the cream off the milk.

The story doesn’t say what kind of money fairies use. But religious leaders accept the same money we use. When they pay for things, it’s usually with ceremonies like canonizations, indulgences, and masses.

There are some similarities between the pope’s power and the fairy kingdom. Just like fairies only exist in the imaginations of people who believe old stories, the pope’s spiritual power outside his own country is only because people are afraid of being excommunicated, based on fake miracles, old stories, and wrong interpretations of the Bible.

That’s why it wasn’t hard for King Henry the Eighth or Queen Elizabeth to get rid of this power. But who knows, this spirit of Rome might come back, or even worse spirits could take over. It’s not just the Roman church that thinks the kingdom of God is part of this world and has power separate from the government. This is all I wanted to say about politics. After I finish reviewing it, I will share it openly with my country.

When you think about how different parts of the mind and feelings can conflict, some people say it’s impossible for one person to be good at all kinds of social duties. Being strict can make people harsh and unwilling to forgive others’ mistakes, while being quick to imagine things can make it hard to clearly know what’s right and wrong.
