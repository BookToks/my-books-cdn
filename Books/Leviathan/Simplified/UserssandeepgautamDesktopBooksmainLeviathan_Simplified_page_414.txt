We can notice that the Pope is only considered more important than other bishops in places where he is also the civil ruler. This happens when an emperor, who has civil power, chooses the Pope to be the main religious leader for his Christian people.

Carrying pictures or statues in a parade is an old tradition from the Greeks and Romans. They used to carry their idols in special carts called thensa or vehiculum Deorum. The statue was placed in a frame called a ferculum.

What they called pompa is what we now call a procession. For example, Julius Caesar was honored with a sacred chariot and shrine during the Circaean games. This was like being carried around as a god, similar to how popes today are carried by Swiss guards under a canopy.

These processions often included carrying burning torches and candles in front of the gods' images, both for Greeks and Romans. Later, Roman emperors got the same honors. For instance, Caligula was carried from Misenum to Rome with altars, sacrifices, and burning torches along the way. Caracalla was welcomed in Alexandria with incense, flowers, and torches. Over time, regular people started honoring their bishops in a similar way, with candles and images of Jesus and the saints inside the church. This use of wax candles was even approved by some old church councils.

The pagans also had their own version of holy water, called aqua lustralis.
