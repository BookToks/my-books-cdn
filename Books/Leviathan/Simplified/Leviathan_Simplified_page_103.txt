The main reason people choose to live under rules and governments is because they want to protect themselves and live happier lives. People naturally want freedom and power, but without rules, they would be stuck in constant fighting and war.

Natural laws like fairness, kindness, and justice don’t always match how people really feel inside. People often want to be biased, proud, or get revenge instead.

Promises or agreements don’t mean much unless there is a strong power to enforce them. So, if there is no government or it’s too weak to keep people safe, everyone will try to protect themselves by any means.

In the past, when people lived in small groups or families, stealing from others was common and even respected if done well, as long as they didn’t kill or destroy tools people needed to live.

Just like small families did before, today cities and countries are like big families trying to protect themselves. They often try to take over or weaken their neighbors because they are scared of being attacked, and history remembers them as brave for doing this.
