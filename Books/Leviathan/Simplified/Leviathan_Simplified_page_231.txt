He said, “There will be false Christs and false prophets who will do amazing miracles, even trying to trick God’s chosen people.” This means false prophets might perform miracles, but we shouldn’t believe their teachings as if they were God’s words.

St. Paul also told the Galatians that if anyone, even himself or an angel, teaches a different message than the one he preached, they should be rejected. That message was that Christ is King. So, anyone preaching against Christ’s power is going against Paul’s words.

Miracles alone don’t prove someone is telling God’s truth if they don’t teach what God has established. And teaching the true message without showing miracles isn’t enough to prove that the person is a real prophet. For example, Deuteronomy says if a prophet’s prediction doesn’t happen, then that prophet isn’t from God but just proud.

But someone might ask, how do we know if a prophecy will come true if it’s about something far in the future or someday later? In that case, this test isn’t helpful. So, miracles that make us believe a prophet should be backed up by something happening soon after.

This shows that both teaching God’s true religion and performing a present miracle together are the only ways the Bible says we can recognize a true prophet or direct revelation. One alone isn’t enough to make us believe.

Since miracles don’t happen anymore, we don’t have any clear signs to trust the supposed revelations or inspirations of private individuals. We only need to listen to teachings that agree with the Holy Scriptures. Since Jesus’ time, the Scriptures replace all other prophecies. With careful study and reasoning, we can understand what God wants from us without needing strange or supernatural experiences.
