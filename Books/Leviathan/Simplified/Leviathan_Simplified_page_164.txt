4. Natural law and civil law are connected and cover the same things. Natural laws are about fairness, justice, thankfulness, and other good qualities that help people live peacefully and follow rules. But these aren’t really laws until a government is set up. Once a government exists, these rules become actual laws because the government tells people to follow them.

To decide what is fair and just, and to make sure people follow these rules, the government needs to make official laws and punish people who break them. These official laws are part of civil law. So, natural law is part of civil law in every country.

Also, civil law follows natural law. For example, justice means keeping promises and giving people what they deserve. This idea comes from natural law. People agree to obey civil laws when they join a country, either by choosing a leader together or by being forced to obey for their safety. So, following civil law is also part of natural law.

Civil law and natural law are not completely different; they are just different parts of the same law. Civil law is written down, while natural law is not. Civil law can limit a person’s natural freedom, and the point of laws is to limit freedom so people don’t harm each other. Laws help people live peacefully and work together against common threats.

5. If the ruler of one country takes control of another group of people who had their own laws before, but then keeps using those old laws, those laws now belong to the new ruler’s government, not the old one. The person who makes the laws is the one who has power over them now, not the person who made them first.

If a country has different regions with different customs called laws, those customs are not just old habits. They were once official laws made by past rulers and are still laws because of the current ruler’s power, not just because they have been around for a long time.
