Taking from a poor person is worse than taking from a rich person because it hurts the poor person more.

Doing a crime during a time or place meant for worship is worse than doing it at other times or places because it shows more disrespect for the law.

There are many other examples of how crimes can be more or less serious, but with these examples, anyone can understand how to judge the seriousness of other crimes.

Also, most crimes harm not just individuals but the whole community. When a crime is accused by the community or government, it's called a public crime. When a private person accuses someone, it's a private crime. For example, if a private person accuses someone of murder, it’s a private case; if the government accuses them, it’s a public case.

Punishment is something bad given by the government to a person who breaks the law, to make people want to follow the rules better.

Before explaining more, there’s an important question: where does the right to punish come from? Before, no one was supposed to agree to let others use violence on them. When people create a government, they give up the right to fight for others but not to defend themselves. They agree to help the government punish others, but not to punish on their own. Agreeing to help punish only makes sense if the person punishing has the right to do it themselves. So, the government’s right to punish doesn’t come from people giving it to them. Before governments existed, everyone had the right to do whatever they thought was needed to protect themselves, even if it meant hurting or killing others.
