There are different types of governments depending on who has the highest power, or the person who speaks for everyone. This power can belong to one person or a group of people. If it’s a group, it can be either everyone or just some chosen people. So, there are only three kinds of government.

If one person has the power, it’s called a monarchy. If everyone who wants to join has power, it’s a democracy. If only a few chosen people have power, it’s called an aristocracy. There can’t be any other kind because power can’t be split up.

Sometimes, governments are called by other names like tyranny or oligarchy. But these names just mean people don’t like how the government works. People unhappy with a monarchy call it tyranny. Those unhappy with an aristocracy call it oligarchy. People upset with a democracy call it anarchy, which actually means no government at all. Nobody thinks no government is a real kind of government. So, the type of government doesn’t change just because people like it or not.

People who are free can choose to give power to one person or a group to represent them. They can agree to follow a king just like they can agree to follow a group. But once a government is set up, there can’t be two leaders with the same power. If there were, they would fight each other and split the power, which causes trouble and war. That’s the opposite of what a government is supposed to do, which is keep peace.
