Not knowing how natural things work makes people believe in impossible stuff, because they don’t know anything that says it can’t be true.

Also, people like to be listened to when they’re with others, so this makes them more likely to lie. So, just not knowing things can make someone both believe lies and tell lies, and sometimes even make up lies.

Worrying about the future makes people want to understand why things happen. Knowing the reasons helps them make better choices now.

Curiosity, or wanting to know why things happen, makes a person look for the cause of something, then the cause of that cause, and so on. Eventually, they have to think that there is a cause that doesn’t have a cause before it, and that cause is eternal. People call that God. So, if someone really tries to understand natural causes, they will likely believe in one eternal God, even if they can’t clearly imagine what God is like. It’s like a blind person who feels heat from a fire and knows there is something called fire causing it, but can’t picture what fire looks like. In the same way, by looking at the world and how well it works, a person can believe there is a cause called God, but still not have a clear idea or image of God.

People who don’t think much about why things happen often feel scared because they don’t know what has the power to help or hurt them. This fear makes them imagine invisible powers and be afraid of their own ideas. When they are in trouble, they ask these imaginary powers for help, and when something good happens, they thank them. They create gods from their own imagination. Because of this, people have made many different kinds of gods. This fear of invisible things is the natural start of what everyone calls religion, and when people worship or fear those powers in the wrong way, it’s called superstition.
