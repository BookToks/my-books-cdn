God showed He was there in different ways, mostly through visions or dreams. For example, God spoke to Abraham in a vision, which means He sent a message through a special appearance. Sometimes God showed up as angels to talk to people like Abraham, Lot, and Hagar. He also spoke to Isaac and Jacob in dreams during the night.

Moses saw God in a special way when God appeared as a burning bush. After Moses, God usually spoke to people through dreams or visions, like He did with prophets such as Gideon, Samuel, and Isaiah. In the New Testament, God also used dreams and visions to talk to people like Joseph, Peter, Paul, and John.

But Moses was different. God talked to Moses like a close friend, face to face, not just through visions or dreams. This was special because Moses was very important to God. Even though God spoke to Moses clearly, it was still through angels acting as messengers. Other prophets got messages through dreams and visions.

God said that if someone is a prophet, He will talk to them through visions or dreams. People of all ages might receive messages this wayâ€”old people through dreams, young people through visions, and others by prophesying.
