About how Jesus and his Apostles were supported, we only know that they had a purse carried by Judas Iscariot. Some Apostles, like the fishermen, still worked at their jobs sometimes. When Jesus sent the twelve Apostles to preach, he told them not to bring gold, silver, or copper coins, because “the worker deserves to be paid” (Matthew 10:9-10). This probably means they were taken care of in a way that matched their work.

Their job was to give freely since they had received freely (Matthew 10:8). The people who believed the good news about the coming of the Messiah helped support them. Also, people Jesus healed gave money out of thanks. For example, some women who were healed, like Mary Magdalene, Joanna (the wife of Herod’s steward), and Susanna, gave money to help Jesus and his followers (Luke 8:2-3).

After Jesus went to heaven, Christians in each city shared their money and possessions. They gave these freely to the Apostles, not because they had to (Acts 4:34-35). Peter even told Ananias that the land he sold was still his to do with as he wanted, showing that no one was forced to give. 

Just like in the Apostles’ time, for a long time after until Emperor Constantine, the support for church leaders like bishops and pastors came only from the voluntary gifts of believers. There were no tithes yet. But during Constantine’s time, Christians loved their pastors so much that, as the historian Ammianus Marcellinus says, bishops argued fiercely over their positions because their followers, especially women, gave so much that the bishops lived in luxury, rode in fancy coaches, and wore expensive clothes.

Some might ask if pastors had to live only on gifts or charity. St. Paul said, “Who goes to war at their own expense? Or who feeds a flock without eating some of the milk?” (1 Corinthians 9:7). He also said that those who serve in holy things get to share in the offerings made at the temple, meaning they deserve support for their work.
