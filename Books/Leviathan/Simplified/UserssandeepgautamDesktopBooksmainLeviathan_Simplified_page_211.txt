Some people work hard at their jobs because they have to or because they want money. Others spend their time enjoying life and being lazy. These two groups make up most of the people in the world. Because they don’t think deeply about important truths, especially about what is fair and right, they mostly learn about their duties from religious leaders in church or from neighbors who talk confidently about law and right and wrong.

The religious leaders and others who seem smart get their knowledge from universities, law schools, or books written by experts from those places. So, it’s clear that teaching the people depends completely on how well young people are taught at universities. Some might ask, “Aren’t the universities in England smart enough already?” or “Are you going to teach the universities?”

These are tough questions. But about the first one, I can say this: before the later part of King Henry the Eighth’s reign, universities mostly supported the Pope’s power over the government. Many preachers and lawyers educated there spoke against the king’s authority. This shows that even if the universities didn’t create those wrong ideas, they didn’t teach the right ones well enough. Because of this, it’s not surprising if they still hold on to old ideas that go against the government. About the second question, I won’t say yes or no. Anyone who sees what I’m doing can probably guess what I think.

The safety of the people needs the rulers to make sure justice is fair for everyone. This means rich and powerful people should be treated the same as poor and unknown people when they are hurt or wronged. The big and powerful shouldn’t get away with bad actions just because of their status. This fairness, called equity, is part of natural law, and even rulers must follow it just like everyone else. Breaking the law harms the whole community, but some crimes also hurt individual people.
