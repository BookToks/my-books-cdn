No one was allowed to enter the most sacred place in the temple, called the sanctum sanctorum. This meant that only the high priest could ask God directly about His will, not regular people. The English Bible translation says “a kingdom of priests,” but this probably means one high priest after another, not a group of priests. Only the high priest was supposed to tell the people what God wanted. No group of priests was allowed inside the sacred area.

Also, the title “a holy nation” means that this nation belonged to God in a special way, not just like everyone else on earth. While all the earth belongs to God, only certain people, like the Jewish nation, were set apart for His special service.

So, it’s clear from this that the kingdom of God was really a government or commonwealth. It was set up with the agreement of the people who would follow it. This government helped control how people acted toward God, toward each other, and toward other nations in peace and war. In this kingdom, God was the king, and after Moses died, the high priest was His main representative or leader.

Many other parts of the Bible show the same idea. For example, when the leaders of Israel were unhappy with Samuel’s sons and asked for a human king, Samuel prayed to God. God told him to listen to the people, but also said, “They haven’t rejected you, they’ve rejected me as their king” (1 Samuel 8:7). This shows that God was their real king, and Samuel only passed on God’s decisions.

Also, Samuel said, “When you saw Nahash, king of the Ammonites, coming against you, you said, ‘We want a king to rule us,’ even though the Lord your God was your king” (1 Samuel 12:12). This proves that God was the true king who ruled their government.

After the Israelites turned away from God, the prophets said He would come back to rule again. For example, Isaiah said, “Then the moon will be confused, and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts rules on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem.”
