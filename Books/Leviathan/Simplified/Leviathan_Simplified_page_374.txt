There is nothing here that goes against the rest of the Bible, or any hint about the fire of purgatory.

But someone might ask if it’s just as important for salvation to believe that God made the world, that Jesus rose from the dead, and that everyone else will rise again on the last day, as it is to believe that Jesus is the Christ. I say yes, those things are important too, and many other beliefs are important as well. But all of these are part of this one main belief and can be figured out from it, even if it’s not always easy.

For example, anyone who believes Jesus is the Son of God, and that the Israelites believed in the all-powerful Creator, also believes that God created everything. Or how can someone believe Jesus is the eternal king without believing he rose from the dead? A dead person can’t be king. So, if you believe the main idea that Jesus is the Christ, you also believe everything that comes from that, even if you don’t fully understand it.

Because of this, just believing this one thing is enough faith to get forgiveness for sins for those who are truly sorry, and it will bring them into heaven.

Now that I have shown that all the obedience needed for salvation is wanting to follow God’s law, which means being truly sorry for your sins, and that all the faith needed is believing that Jesus is the Christ, I will share some parts of the Gospel that prove all you need for salvation is both of these together.

When Peter preached on the day of Pentecost, right after Jesus went to heaven, people asked him and the other apostles, “What should we do?” Peter said, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, so your sins will be forgiven. Then you will receive the Holy Spirit.” So, repentance and baptism, which means believing Jesus is the Christ, is all that is needed for salvation.

Also, when a ruler asked Jesus, “What must I do to have eternal life?” Jesus told him to follow the commandments: Don’t commit adultery, don’t kill, don’t steal, don’t lie, and honor your parents.
