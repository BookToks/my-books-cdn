We don’t just dislike things that have hurt us before, but also things that might hurt us, even if we’re not sure.

If there are things we don’t want or hate, but also don’t care about, we say we "contemn" them. Contempt means our heart just doesn’t react to those things because it’s focused on other, stronger feelings or because we haven’t experienced them enough.

Since our bodies and minds keep changing, it’s impossible for the same things to always make us want or avoid them in the same way. Also, not everyone wants the same things or feels the same about them.

Whatever someone wants or desires, they call that good. Whatever they hate or avoid, they call evil. And things they don’t care about, they call worthless or ugly. These words—good, evil, and worthless—depend on the person using them. There’s no absolute rule for what is good or evil. In a society, these rules come from the person or group in charge, or from a judge that everyone agrees on.

In Latin, there are two words close to good and evil: "pulchrum" and "turpe." Pulchrum means something that looks like it will be good, and turpe means something that looks like it will be bad.

In English, we don’t have exact words like that. Instead, for pulchrum, we say fair, beautiful, handsome, honorable, or nice, depending on the situation. For turpe, we say ugly, nasty, or gross. These words describe how something looks or feels like it will be good or bad.

So, there are three kinds of good: good as a promise (pulchrum), good as the actual result (delightful), and good as the way to get there (useful). There are also three kinds of evil: evil as a promise (turpe), evil as the result (unpleasant), and evil as the way to get there (harmful).

When we sense things, what’s really happening inside us is just motion caused by things outside. For example, what we see is really light and color, what we hear is sound, and what we smell is odor.
