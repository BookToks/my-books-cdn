Just like a child needs a teacher or a guardian to keep them safe and in charge, big countries also need special leaders called dictators or protectors when things get really dangerous. These leaders act like temporary kings who get all the power for a short time. But often, when their time is up, they lose their power more often than young kings lose theirs to their guardians or tutors.

There are basically three types of government: monarchy, where one person is in charge; democracy, where everyone shares the power; and aristocracy, where a special group of people has the power. But if you look at real countries, it’s not always easy to fit them into just these three groups. Sometimes governments mix these types. For example, in elective kingdoms, kings get power only for a while, or in some kingdoms, the king’s power is limited. Even though these are different, most people still call them monarchies. Also, if a democracy or aristocracy takes over another land and rules it through a leader, that land isn’t really a democracy or aristocracy by itself but is ruled like a monarchy.

Now, about elective kings who only have power for their life or a set time, like the dictators in ancient Rome. If the king can pick who comes after him, then the kingdom is actually hereditary, not elective. But if he can’t choose his successor, then someone else or a group must pick a new king after he dies. If no one can pick a new leader, then the country falls apart and goes back to fighting. If it’s clear who can choose the next ruler, it means they had the real power all along. But if no one can choose the next ruler after the first king dies, then that king must make sure to pick a successor to stop the country from falling into chaos and war.
