Not all actions are signs by nature. Some actions naturally show honor, while others show disrespect. People feel ashamed to do disrespectful things around those they respect. Because of this, disrespectful actions can’t be part of religious worship by human decision. On the other hand, good behavior like being decent, modest, and humble is always part of worship. 

There are many actions that don’t mean anything special on their own. But if the government decides that some of these actions should be used publicly as signs of honor or part of worship, then everyone must accept and use them that way. The saying in the Bible, “It is better to obey God than man,” applies only in God’s kingdom by agreement, not by nature.

Now, about God’s natural kingdom and laws, I’ll briefly explain natural punishments. Every action a person takes starts a long chain of events, and no one can see how it will all end. This chain includes both good and bad things. So, if someone does something for fun, they must be ready to face any pain that comes with it. These pains are natural punishments for actions that cause more harm than good.

Because of this, being careless with your health leads to sickness; being reckless leads to accidents; being unfair causes enemies to attack; being proud leads to downfall; being a coward results in being oppressed; weak leaders face rebellion; and rebellion leads to violence. Since punishments follow breaking laws, natural punishments follow breaking the laws of nature. They happen naturally, not just by chance.

So far, I have talked about the nature and rights of rulers and the duties of the people, based on natural reason. But since most of the world, especially in the West, follows ideas from Rome and Athens, and because being a ruler requires deep moral knowledge, I sometimes feel my work is useless. Even Plato thought it’s impossible to stop government problems and civil wars until rulers become philosophers.

However, I remind myself that knowing natural justice is the only knowledge rulers really need. They don’t have to study math like Plato said, except to encourage people to learn it. Also, no philosopher has yet fully organized or clearly proven all moral ideas about how people should govern and obey. This gives me hope that someday a ruler will read my writing carefully and fairly, without bias, and use their full power to support teaching it. Then, these ideas will move from theory to real life.
