This double monopoly hurts both the people at home and foreigners. At home, because only they can export goods, they set any price they want on farming and handmade products. Also, because only they can import things, they set any price they want on all foreign goods that people need. Both of these are bad for the people. 

On the other hand, by being the only ones who sell native goods abroad and buy foreign goods, they make prices higher for those selling and lower for those buying, which is bad for foreigners. When only one group sells, the goods become more expensive, and when only one group buys, the goods become cheaper. So, these groups act like monopolies. They could be good for the country if they worked together in foreign markets but allowed everyone to buy and sell freely at home.

The goal of these merchant groups isn’t to help everyone equally, but to make money for each member. So, it makes sense that each person should know what’s going on with their own investment. This means everyone should be part of meetings where decisions are made and know about the group’s money. The group’s representative should be a meeting where all members can come if they want.

If the merchant group owes money to someone outside the group because of a decision made by their meeting, every member is responsible for the whole debt. Outsiders don’t care about the group’s internal rules; they see every member as responsible until the debt is paid by one person, which then frees the others. But if the debt is to someone inside the group, that person can only ask for money from the group’s shared funds.

If the government taxes the group, it’s understood that every member pays according to how much they invested because the only shared money is from their individual investments.

If a fine is given to the group for doing something illegal, only those who voted for or helped with the action are responsible. The others are not guilty of any crime just because they are part of the group, as long as the group itself was set up by the government.
