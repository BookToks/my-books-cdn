If a person or group with the highest power gives up any right that’s important to their control, and this causes the people to have freedoms that don’t fit with that power, it’s a problem. If someone refuses to follow orders that go against the freedoms they were given, it’s still wrong and against their duty. This is because the power was created with the people’s agreement and for their protection, and any freedoms that don’t fit with it were given by mistake. But if someone not only disobeys but also fights against a public official doing their job, that’s a crime, because they could have solved it peacefully by complaining.

Crimes are judged in different ways. First, by how bad the cause is. Second, by how much others might copy it. Third, by how much harm it causes. And fourth, by when, where, and who is involved.

Doing the same illegal thing is worse if a person thinks they are strong, rich, or have friends to protect them from the law. This is worse than if they do it hoping they won’t get caught or that they can run away. Thinking you won’t get punished because of your power leads to ignoring all laws. But if someone runs away because they are scared, they usually follow the law better later. Doing a crime knowing it’s wrong is worse than doing it by mistake. Someone who knows it’s wrong but still does it relies on their power and might do it again. Someone who makes a mistake but learns from it follows the law better.

If someone’s mistake comes from trusting a teacher or a legal expert who has official power, they are less guilty than someone who just follows their own ideas stubbornly. What an official teacher says is like the law until that same official says otherwise. In crimes that don’t reject the highest power or break clear laws, this kind of mistake is excused. But someone who acts based on their own judgment must face the results, whether their judgment is right or wrong.
