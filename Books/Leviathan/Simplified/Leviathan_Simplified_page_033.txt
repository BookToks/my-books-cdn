We don’t just dislike things that have hurt us before, but also things we aren’t sure if they will hurt us or not.

Things we don’t want or hate are called contemptible. Contempt means our heart just stays still or refuses to react to those things, either because we are already focused on something else or because we don’t have experience with them.

Since our bodies are always changing, it’s impossible for the same things to always make us want or dislike them in the same way. Even more, not everyone wants the same things.

Whatever someone wants, they call good. Whatever they hate or avoid, they call evil. And things they don’t care about, they call worthless or unimportant. Words like good, evil, and worthless always depend on the person using them. There is no absolute good or evil in things themselves. Without a group or government, these ideas come from each person. In a group, they come from the person in charge or a judge everyone agrees on.

In Latin, there are two words close to good and evil but not exactly the same: pulchrum and turpe. Pulchrum means something that looks like it will be good. Turpe means something that looks like it will be bad.

In English, we don’t have exact words like these. For pulchrum, we say fair, beautiful, handsome, honorable, or nice, depending on the situation. For turpe, we say foul, ugly, nasty, or gross. These words show how something looks like it will be good or bad.

So, there are three kinds of good: good that looks promising (pulchrum), good that actually happens and feels nice (delightful), and good that helps us (useful). There are also three kinds of bad: bad that looks bad (turpe), bad that actually happens and causes trouble (unpleasant), and bad that doesn’t help or harms us.

When we sense things, what’s really happening inside us is just motion caused by outside things. For example, we see light and color, hear sound, and smell odors.
