Second, a king can ask for advice from anyone he wants, whenever and wherever he wants. He can talk to experts about what he’s thinking, no matter who they are, and as secretly as he wants. But when a big group needs advice, only certain people who have the right to be there can speak. Most of these people know more about making money than about real knowledge. They give long speeches that can make people want to act but don’t really help guide their actions. Also, because the group is so big, they can’t keep their advice secret.

Third, a king’s decisions only change because people naturally change their minds. But in a big group, decisions can change not just because people change their minds, but also because some who agree might not show up, or a few people who disagree might come and undo what was decided before.

Fourth, a king can’t argue with himself out of jealousy or selfishness, but a big group can argue so much they might even start a civil war.

Fifth, in a monarchy, there is a problem: one person can take away everything from someone else just to make a favorite richer. This is a big problem and can’t be avoided. But the same thing can happen in a big group because they have the same power. They can also be tricked by smooth talkers, just like kings can be tricked by flatterers. The favorites in a king’s court are few and usually family, but in a big group, there are many favorites and many more family members. Also, a king’s favorite can help friends and hurt enemies, but the favorites in a big group have the power to hurt a lot but can’t help much.
