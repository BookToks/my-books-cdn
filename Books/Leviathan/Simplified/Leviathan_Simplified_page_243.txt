The meaning of those words is best understood by a similar story. At the beginning, when the earth was covered with water, God wanted to lower the water and show the dry land again. He used words like, “I will bring my Spirit upon the earth, and the waters shall go down.” Here, the Spirit means a wind (which is air moving), and it’s called the Spirit of God because it was God’s doing.

Pharaoh called Joseph’s wisdom the Spirit of God. Joseph told Pharaoh to find a smart and careful man to help rule Egypt. Pharaoh said, “Can we find someone as smart as this, who has the Spirit of God?” (Genesis 41:38) In Exodus 28:3, God says, “You will talk to all the wise people I have filled with the Spirit of wisdom to make Aaron’s clothes and make him holy.” Even special skills, like making clothes, were seen as gifts from God’s Spirit. This idea appears again in Exodus and Isaiah, where the Spirit of the Lord gives wisdom, understanding, advice, courage, and respect for God. It doesn’t mean many spirits, but many special gifts God gives.

In the Book of Judges, having strong passion and courage to protect God’s people is called the Spirit of God. This happened when Othniel, Gideon, Jephtha, and Samson saved the people from slavery (Judges 3:10, 6:34, 11:29, 13:25, 14:6, 19). When Saul heard about the Ammonites being cruel to the people of Jabesh Gilead, “The Spirit of God came on Saul, and he became very angry” (1 Samuel 11:6). This didn’t mean a ghost but a strong desire to punish the Ammonites. Also, when the Spirit of God came on Saul while he was with the prophets singing to God (1 Samuel 19:20), it meant he suddenly felt excited to join them in worship, not that a ghost took over him.

The false prophet Zedekiah asked Micaiah, “How did the Spirit of the Lord leave me to speak to you?”
