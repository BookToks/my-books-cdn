Usually, proud people who aren’t also scared easily get angry. They are more likely to think normal talking is rude or disrespectful. Anger can cause many problems and bad actions.

Feelings like hate, desire, wanting power, and greed often lead to crimes. Everyone knows this from experience. These feelings are natural in people and animals, and stopping their effects needs either strong thinking or strict punishment.

When people hate something, they are always bothered by it. So, they either have to be very patient all the time or get rid of what bothers them. Being patient is hard, and getting rid of the problem often means breaking the law. Ambition and greed are feelings that are always there and pushing people, but reason doesn’t always stop them. So, when people think they won’t get caught, they act on these feelings. Lust may not last long, but it is very strong and can make people ignore small or unsure punishments.

Fear is the feeling that makes people least likely to break the law. Except for some brave people, fear is usually the only thing that stops people from doing illegal things, even if they might get something good from breaking the law. But sometimes, fear can still cause crimes.

Not all fears make a crime okay. Only fear of real physical harm, which can only be avoided by acting, is acceptable. For example, if someone attacks you and you fear you might die, and the only way to survive is to hurt the attacker, then hurting or even killing them is not a crime. This is because when people created laws, they didn’t expect you to give up defending your life if help isn’t there in time. But killing someone just because you think they might try to kill you later, and you have time to get help from the law, is a crime. Also, if someone insults you or does small harms that the law doesn’t punish, and you are scared to be disrespected more if you don’t get revenge, breaking the law to protect yourself through fear of future attacks is still wrong.
