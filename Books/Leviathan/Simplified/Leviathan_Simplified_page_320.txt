The men Paul wanted to convince that Jesus was the Messiah and had risen from the dead were Jews. They already believed the Scriptures were God’s word. Some of them believed Paul’s message, but some did not.

Why did they believe the Scriptures but not all agree with Paul’s explanation? It’s because Paul didn’t come with official permission to command them. Instead, he tried to persuade them. To do this, he could have shown miracles like Moses did or explained the Scriptures to prove his point.

When someone uses the Scriptures to explain something, the listeners have to decide for themselves if the explanation makes sense. If these Jews were not the ones judging Paul’s words, then who was? If Paul had all the authority, he wouldn’t need to quote Scripture. He would just say, “I’m the interpreter sent by Christ.” But since there was no one official in charge, everyone could believe or not believe what he said based on how it sounded to them.

Usually, Jews were supposed to accept the decisions of their priests and judges when there were hard questions about the Scriptures. But this applied only to Jews who hadn’t yet accepted Christ.

For non-Jews who didn’t believe the Scriptures, the Apostles didn’t try to prove things using the Bible. Instead, they argued against their idols and shared stories about Jesus’ life and resurrection to convince them. So, no one was forced to accept anyone’s interpretation of Scripture unless they already believed.

Now, let’s think about what happened when people actually became followers of Christ and if that created any new rules about who should be listened to.
