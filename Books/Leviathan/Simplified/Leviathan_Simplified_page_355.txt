You can’t use the Bible to prove that the Pope’s rules are laws unless he also has political power.

The last thing he wants to prove is that Jesus gave church authority only to the Pope.

Here, he’s not talking about who is more powerful, the Pope or Christian kings, but about the Pope versus other bishops. First, he agrees that bishops have authority from God in general. He uses St. Paul’s words from Ephesians 4:11, where Paul says Jesus gave different gifts to people like apostles, prophets, pastors, and teachers. This shows they have authority from God, but the writer doesn’t believe they get it directly from God—they get it through the Pope.

But if someone can have authority from God but not directly, then what kind of authority in a Christian country isn’t also from God? Christian kings get their power directly from God, and the officials under them do their jobs because God allows it. So what they do is no less from God than what bishops do because the Pope gave them authority. All real power comes from God—directly to the leader and through that leader to others. So, either every police officer has God’s authority, or no bishop has it except the Pope.

But arguing whether Jesus gave authority only to the Pope or also to other bishops, without thinking about where the Pope has political power, is pointless. Where the Pope isn’t the ruler, he has no real authority. Authority means having the power to hear and decide disputes between people. Only someone who can make laws and enforce them with justice—that is, the political ruler—can have this power.

So when the writer talks about Jesus choosing twelve apostles in Luke 6, he shows Jesus picked them and gave them power to teach, but not to judge disputes between people. Jesus refused this power himself, saying, “Who made me a judge or divider among you?”
