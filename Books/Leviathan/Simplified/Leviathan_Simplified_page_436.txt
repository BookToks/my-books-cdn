If a person thinks about where this big church power came from, they will see that the pope’s power is like the ghost of the old Roman Empire, sitting crowned on its grave. That’s because the papacy suddenly appeared after that old pagan empire fell.

They also use Latin in their churches and official acts. Latin is a dead language that no country really speaks now, so it’s like the ghost of the old Roman language.

Fairies in any country have one king, called King Oberon by some poets, but the Bible calls him Beelzebub, the prince of demons. Church leaders also have one king, the Pope, no matter where they live.

Church leaders are spiritual people, kind of like ghostly fathers. Fairies are spirits and ghosts too. Both fairies and ghosts live in dark, quiet places like graveyards. Church leaders spend their time in mysterious places like monasteries, churches, and churchyards.

Church leaders have big cathedrals that, by using holy water and special prayers called exorcisms, make towns important centers of power. Fairies have magical castles and giant ghosts that rule the areas nearby.

Fairies can’t be caught or made to answer for the harm they do. Church leaders also avoid civil courts and don’t have to answer for their actions.

Church leaders take away young men’s ability to think for themselves using tricky ideas made from philosophy, miracles, traditions, and twisted parts of the Bible, so these young men only do what the leaders tell them. Fairies are said to take children from their cradles and turn them into fools, called elves, who like to cause trouble.

No one knows exactly where fairies make their magic. But the places where church leaders work are well known: universities that follow the pope’s rules.

When fairies are angry with someone, they send elves to pinch them. When church leaders are angry with a government, they create superstitious followers who cause trouble by preaching rebellion, or one prince tricks another to cause problems.
