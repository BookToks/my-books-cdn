The Prophet agreed and told Naaman, "Go in peace." Naaman believed deep down, but when he bowed before the idol Rimmon, he was acting like he didn’t believe in the true God, even if he didn’t say it out loud. But what about Jesus’ words: "Whoever denies me before people, I will deny before my Father in heaven"? We can say that if someone like Naaman is forced by his ruler to do something, and he does it just because of the law, not because he wants to, then it’s really the ruler’s action, not his. So, the person isn’t really denying Christ, but the ruler and the law are.

If someone thinks this idea goes against real Christianity, I ask them: imagine a person who secretly follows another religion but lives in a Christian country. If their ruler tells them they must go to Christian worship or else face death, should that person die rather than obey? If they say yes, then anyone could disobey their rulers over religion, no matter what religion it is. But if they say no, then they are okay with obeying rulers in some cases but not others, which isn’t fair or right. This goes against Jesus’ teaching: "Treat others how you want to be treated," and also against natural law, which says, "Don’t do to others what you wouldn’t want done to you."

So, what about all the martyrs in church history who died for their faith? We need to understand who they were. Some were called to preach and openly share the message of Christ’s kingdom. Others were just asked about their own faith. The first group, if they died for proving that Jesus rose from the dead, were true martyrs. A martyr is someone who witnesses the resurrection of Jesus, and only those who actually saw Jesus after he rose can truly be witnesses. If they didn’t see him, their testimony doesn’t count.
