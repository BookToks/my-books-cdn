The flaming sword at the entrance to Paradise stops people from reaching the tree of life, but it doesn’t stop them from having eternal life. God took away eternal life because of sin, but the sword doesn’t bring that back or make people need Christ’s sacrifice to get it again. So, not only good and faithful people but also bad people and those who don’t believe will live forever without dying, and won’t face a second, eternal death. Some say that "second and everlasting death" means a kind of eternal life in pain, but that idea is only used here and nowhere else.

This idea comes from some confusing parts of the New Testament, but when you look at the whole Bible, these parts clearly mean something different and aren’t needed to believe in Christianity. If when a person dies, only their body is left, can’t God, who made life from dust and clay with just His word, easily bring a dead body back to life forever or make it die again if He wants?

In the Bible, the word "soul" always means life or a living creature, and body plus soul means a living body. On the fifth day of creation, God said, “Let the waters produce living creatures,” and made whales and other creatures with life. He made man from dust and breathed life into him, making him a living being. After Noah, God said He wouldn’t destroy every living creature again. Also, the Bible says, “Don’t eat blood, because the blood is the soul,” meaning life. If the soul were a separate, invisible thing apart from the body, this would apply to all creatures, not just humans.

But the souls of faithful people are kept alive in their bodies by God’s special grace from the resurrection forever, which I have already explained well in Chapter 38. When the New Testament talks about people being thrown into hell “body and soul,” it just means their body and life—they will be thrown alive into the eternal fire of Gehenna.
