Thirdly, because of this, people should know how wrong it is to speak badly about the ruler, whether it is one person or a group of people. They should not argue against the ruler’s power or use their name disrespectfully. Doing so can make the ruler lose respect from the people, and when people stop obeying, it can harm the safety of the country. The third Commandment is a bit like this idea.

Fourthly, since people can’t learn this on their own, or even remember it after it’s taught, and after some time don’t even know who is in charge, it’s important to set aside special times for learning. At these times, people can gather to hear those chosen to teach them. After praying and praising God, who is the highest ruler, they should be reminded of their duties and hear the laws that affect everyone. The Jews had a special day every seventh day called the Sabbath for this. On the Sabbath, they read and explained the law and remembered that God was their king. God made the world in six days and rested on the seventh, and by resting themselves on that day, the Jews showed God was their king who saved them from hard slavery. This day was also a time for them to enjoy themselves in a proper way. The first part of the Commandments focuses on God’s total power, not just as God but as their king. This helps rulers who have power given to them by the people understand what they should teach their subjects.

Also, since teaching children starts with their parents, children must obey their parents while they are being raised. Later, to show thanks, they should also respect their parents openly. Children should learn that at first, their father was also their ruler, with power over life and death. When families created governments, fathers gave up this total power, but they were never meant to lose the respect they deserve for raising their children. Giving up this power wasn’t needed to create a government, and it wouldn’t make sense for anyone to want children or take care of them if they got no respect in return.
