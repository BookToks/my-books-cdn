When taxes are put on things people buy, everyone pays the same amount for what they use. This way, the government doesn’t lose money because some people spend a lot on luxuries.

Sometimes, people can’t work because of accidents or other reasons. These people shouldn’t have to rely on others' kindness to survive. Instead, the government should take care of them as much as they need to live. Just like it’s unkind for a person to ignore someone who can’t help themselves, it’s also wrong for the government to leave them to chance.

For those who are healthy and strong, it’s different. They should be made to work. To make sure everyone can find a job, there should be laws that support all kinds of work like farming, fishing, sailing, and making things. If there are too many poor but able people, they should move to places where not many people live yet. But they shouldn’t take over or harm the people already there. Instead, everyone should live closer together and work their land carefully to get food. If the world becomes too crowded, the last option is war, which gives people a chance to live through winning or die.

It’s the government’s job to make good laws. But what is a good law? A good law isn’t just a fair law, because no law can be unfair. Laws are made by the government, and everyone agrees to follow them. If everyone agrees, no one can say the law is unfair. Making laws is like playing a game: whatever all the players agree on is fair for everyone. A good law is one that is needed, helps the people, and is easy to understand.

Laws aren’t there to stop people from doing everything they want. Instead, they help keep people from hurting themselves by acting too fast or without thinking. Laws are like fences on a path: they don’t stop you from walking, they just keep you on the right way. So, laws that aren’t needed or don’t have a real purpose aren’t good laws. Sometimes laws might seem to help only the government and not the people, but that’s not true. The government and the people’s well-being are linked and can’t be separated.
