4. The law of nature and the civil law are connected and cover the same things. Natural laws are about fairness, justice, thankfulness, and other good morals. In a state of nature (like before any government), these aren’t really laws but qualities that help people live peacefully and follow rules. When a government is set up, these qualities become actual laws because the government tells people to obey them. To decide what is fair and just and to make people follow these rules, a government needs to set rules and punishments. These rules are part of civil law. So, natural law is part of civil law in all countries.

Also, civil law follows natural law. For example, justice means keeping promises and giving people what is theirs, which comes from natural law. When people agree to follow civil law, either by choosing leaders or by being forced to obey for safety, obeying civil law becomes part of natural law too. Civil and natural laws are not totally different, but parts of the same system. Civil law is written down, while natural law is not. The natural freedom people have can be limited by civil law to keep peace. Laws exist to control people’s freedom so they don’t harm each other, but instead help each other and work together against common enemies.

5. If the ruler of one country takes over another group of people who had their own laws, and then keeps using those old laws, those laws become the civil laws of the new ruler, not the old country. This is because the person who makes the laws official now is the real lawmaker. When a country has many provinces with different local laws, called customs, those customs aren’t just old traditions but were once official laws made by past rulers. Now, those customs are laws because the current ruler accepts them, not just because they’ve been around a long time.
