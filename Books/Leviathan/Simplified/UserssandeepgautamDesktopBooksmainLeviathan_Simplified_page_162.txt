Sometimes, when lots of people see the same thing, they all have different opinions and want what’s best for themselves. Even if they try to look at things carefully, they usually only focus on what benefits them. That’s why big groups or countries don’t stay united just by talking openly. They either stay together because of a common enemy, because they respect a strong leader, because a few people secretly control things, or because different groups are afraid of each other.

Small countries, whether they are ruled by the people or by a king, can only last as long as their powerful neighbors don’t feel jealous or want to take over.

When I talk about civil laws, I mean rules that everyone has to follow just because they are part of any country or society, not just a specific one. Knowing the specific laws of a country is for people who study those laws, but understanding civil law in general is for anyone. The old Roman law was called civil law because “civitas” means a community or country. Some places still use parts of Roman law and call it civil law to separate it from their own laws. But I’m not here to talk about laws in different places; I want to explain what law is in general, like famous thinkers Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero did, without being legal experts.

First, it’s clear that law is not advice, but a command. It’s not just anyone telling anyone else what to do, but a command from someone who has the right to be obeyed. Civil law is just the command from the community or country itself.

So, I define civil law like this: civil law is the set of rules that the country orders every person to follow, either by speaking, writing, or other clear ways, to decide what is right and wrong. In other words, it shows what is allowed and what is not.

This definition is easy to understand right from the start.
