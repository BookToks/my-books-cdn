Second, if the decisions made by the council were actually laws, then disobeying them would be a sin. But we don’t read anywhere that people who didn’t follow Christ’s teachings sinned because of that. Instead, it says they died in their sins, meaning their past sins were not forgiven. Those sins were against natural laws and the civil laws of the state, which every Christian had agreed to follow.

So, the rules the Apostles gave to new believers were not laws but conditions for those who wanted to be saved. People could choose to accept or refuse these conditions, without committing a new sin. However, if they refused, they risked being punished and excluded from God’s kingdom because of their past sins. That’s why St. John says God’s anger remains on unbelievers, not that it will come upon them later—they are already condemned because of their unbelief. Faith helps to forgive sins, and not believing keeps those sins.

Some might ask, if people don’t have to follow the council’s decisions, why did the Apostles and church leaders meet to agree on what to teach about faith and behavior? The answer is that the Apostles and elders had to teach what they agreed on as long as no earlier law said otherwise. But they couldn’t force all Christians to follow their teachings unless they had political power, which only civil rulers have. Even though God rules the world, we don’t have to accept every rule anyone says comes from God, especially if it goes against civil law, which God also commands us to obey.

Since the council’s decisions were advice, not laws, the same applies to later church councils or leaders who met without government authority. The New Testament books are perfect guides for Christian life, but they can only become laws if kings or rulers officially make them so.
