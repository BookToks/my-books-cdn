He sent them to people who didn’t believe; “I send you,” he said, “like sheep among wolves,” not like sheep with other sheep.

The instructions they were given in the gospel didn’t give them any control over the church.

First, the twelve Apostles were sent “to the lost sheep of Israel” and told to preach “that God’s kingdom was near.” Preaching here means announcing something important, like a town crier telling people about a new king. But a crier can’t boss people around.

The seventy Disciples were sent out as workers, not as bosses of the harvest. They were told to say, “God’s kingdom is coming soon.” This kingdom means the kingdom of glory, not just grace. They were also told to warn cities that didn’t welcome them that it would be worse for those cities later, even worse than Sodom. Jesus told his Disciples who wanted to be the most important that their job was to serve others, just like He came to serve, not to be served. So, preachers don’t have boss power but serve others. Jesus said, “Don’t call yourselves masters, because only Christ is your master.”

Another part of their job was to “teach all nations,” or as in Mark, “Go into the whole world and preach the gospel to everyone.” Teaching and preaching are the same. When announcing a new king, you have to explain why he has the right to be king, so people will accept him. Like Paul did in Thessalonica, when he talked with the Jews for three days, explaining from the Scriptures that Christ had to suffer, rise from the dead, and that Jesus is the Christ. Teaching from the Old Testament that Jesus is the risen King doesn’t mean people have to disobey their current leaders. Instead, they should wait patiently and faithfully for Christ’s return while obeying the rulers they have now.

Another part of their job was to baptize people in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
