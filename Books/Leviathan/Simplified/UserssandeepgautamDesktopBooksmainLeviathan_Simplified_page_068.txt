Next, about how people think these invisible forces cause things to happen. Most people don’t really understand what “causing” means. They just guess based on what they’ve seen happen before. They notice that one thing happens after another but don’t see any real connection between them. So, they expect the same things to happen again because they happened before. They believe good or bad luck comes from things that actually have nothing to do with it. For example, the Athenians wanted another hero like Phormio for their war, and the Pompeians wanted another Scipio for their fight in Africa. People have done this many times on different occasions. They also think their luck comes from a certain person watching, a lucky or unlucky place, or even words said, especially if God’s name is mentioned. They believe these words have magic power, like witches’ spells, and can do impossible things like turning a stone into bread or bread into a person.

Third, when it comes to worshipping these invisible powers, people naturally treat them like they would treat other people. They give gifts, ask for help, say thanks, act respectfully, plan what to say, and even swear promises by calling on these powers. Beyond this, reason doesn’t suggest much else. People either stop there or follow more rituals based on what they think smarter people believe.

Finally, about how these invisible powers tell people what will happen in the future, especially about their luck or success, people don’t really know. They guess the future based on the past. After one or two times something happens, they think it will always happen that way. They also trust predictions from certain people they believe are good at guessing the future.
