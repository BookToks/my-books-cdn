We have talked about how God's power comes from nature. Now, we need to think about what God’s laws are, or what natural reason tells us to do. These laws are about how people should treat each other and how we should respect God.

The first laws are about how people should behave toward one another. These include fairness, justice, mercy, humility, and other good qualities. Next, we need to think about what natural reason tells us about honoring and worshiping God, without needing any special messages from God.

Honoring someone means thinking highly of their power and goodness. So, to honor God means to believe He is as powerful and good as possible. When we show this honor through words and actions, that is called worship. The Latin word "cultus" means the effort a person puts into something to get something good from it.

There are two kinds of things we work on. Some things belong to us, and when we work on them, we naturally get benefits, like farming the land or teaching children. Other things don’t belong to us, like other people’s wills. To get their favor, we don’t use force but try to please them with good deeds, praise, and respect. This is true worship: trying to win favor by showing respect and kindness. For example, "cultus Dei" means worshiping God.

When we honor God inside our minds, it creates three feelings: love, which is about His goodness; and hope and fear, which are about His power. These feelings lead to three kinds of worship outside ourselves: praise, magnifying, and blessing. Praise is about God’s goodness, while magnifying and blessing are about His power and the happiness that comes from it. We show praise and magnifying through words and actions: saying someone is good or great, thanking them for their kindness, and obeying their power. We can only express the happiness we wish for someone with words.
