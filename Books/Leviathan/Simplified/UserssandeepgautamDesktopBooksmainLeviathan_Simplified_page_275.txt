(Deuteronomy 18:22) If someone says something will happen and it does, then no one should argue against it. The same goes if we haven’t seen a miracle ourselves but only heard about it—we should ask the official Church leader how much we should believe those stories. This is especially true for people living under Christian rulers today.

I don’t know anyone now who has actually seen a real miracle done by magic, words, or prayer that even an average person would think is supernatural. The real question isn’t whether what we see is a miracle, or if the miracle we hear about is real and not made up, but whether the story is true or false. We shouldn’t decide this just by our own thoughts or feelings, but by the judgment of the highest leader appointed by God. In fact, if we’ve given that leader the power to keep peace and protect us, we have already agreed to let them judge this.

Each person can believe or not believe in their heart about miracles based on whether they think believing them helps or harms people who say they happened. But when it comes to publicly confessing that belief, personal ideas must follow the official judgment—that is, the decision of God’s representative. Who exactly this representative is will be explained later.

The survival of society depends on justice, and justice depends on the power of life and death, along with other rewards and punishments given by those in charge. A country can’t survive if anyone except the ruler has power to give bigger rewards than life or punishments worse than death.

Since eternal life is a greater reward than just living now, and eternal punishment is worse than death, everyone who wants to avoid chaos and war by obeying authority should think carefully about what the Bible means by eternal life and eternal punishment. They should understand for what wrongs, and against whom, people are punished forever, and for what actions they earn eternal life.
