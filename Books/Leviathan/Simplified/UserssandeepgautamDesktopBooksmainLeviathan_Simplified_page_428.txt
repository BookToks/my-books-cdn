For a private person, without the permission of the government, to interpret the law based on their own ideas is a mistake in politics. But this mistake doesn’t come from Aristotle or any other old philosophers.

None of them say that the power to make laws doesn’t include the power to explain them when needed. And aren’t the Scriptures, wherever they are law, made official laws by the government and part of civil law?

It’s the same when anyone other than the ruler tries to limit a power the government hasn’t limited. For example, when some people say only a certain group can preach the gospel, even though the laws don’t say that. If the state allows me to preach or teach—that is, if it doesn’t forbid me—no one else can stop me. If I’m among people in America who worship idols, and I’m a Christian but not officially part of the church, should I think it’s wrong to preach about Jesus until I get permission from Rome? Or after I preach, shouldn’t I answer their questions and explain the Scriptures? But some might say that for preaching or giving sacraments, you need special permission, which is true. But it’s also true that if no law forbids something, you don’t need permission for it. So, stopping people from doing things the government hasn’t forbidden is taking away their legal freedom, which goes against how civil government should work.

More examples of useless philosophy mixed with religion by church scholars could be given, but others can find them if they want. I’ll just add that most writings by church scholars are just long chains of strange, complicated words or words used differently than usual Latin. These would confuse even the great Roman writers like Cicero and Varro. If anyone wants proof, as I said before, they should try to translate a church scholar’s work into modern languages like French or English. If it can’t be made clear in these languages, it wasn’t clear in Latin either. This confusing language doesn’t just hide the truth but also makes people think they understand it, so they stop looking for the real truth.
