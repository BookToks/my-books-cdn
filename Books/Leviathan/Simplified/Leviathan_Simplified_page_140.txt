No one has to pay back a debt except the person in charge. This is because the lender doesn’t know about the group or its rules and only sees the person who agreed to borrow the money as responsible. So, if the person in charge borrows money, they have to pay it back either from the group’s funds or, if there’s no money, from their own money.

If the person in charge owes money because of a contract or a fine, it’s the same situation.

But if the person in charge is a group of people, and the debt is owed to someone outside the group, only those who agreed to borrow the money or made the contract are responsible. Everyone who voted yes on borrowing the money promised to pay it back. Even if one person pays it all, the others are still responsible until it’s fully paid.

If the debt is owed to someone inside the group, the whole group has to pay from their shared money if they have any. If a person votes to borrow money, they also agree it must be paid back. If they vote no or don’t vote but still lend money, they go against their own vote and become both the borrower and lender. This means they can only get paid from the group’s money, not from any one person. If the group has no money, they can’t complain because they chose to lend money knowing the risks.

This shows that in smaller groups under a higher power, it’s sometimes okay and smart for someone to openly disagree with the group’s decisions and make sure their disagreement is recorded. Otherwise, they might have to pay debts or take blame for things they didn’t agree to. But in a group with full power, this freedom doesn’t exist because disagreeing means denying the group’s authority. Also, when the group makes a command, it’s as if everyone has agreed to it, so they are responsible for following it.

There are many kinds of groups, different in what they do, when and where they meet, and how many people they include.
