The presbytery has claimed the right to kick out their own kings and be the top leaders in religion where their church system exists. This is a big challenge, almost like how the Pope claims power everywhere.

Jesus said, “I tell you, some of you standing here won’t die until you see God’s kingdom come with power.” (Mark 9:1) If we take this literally, it means either some people there were still alive, or God’s kingdom is already here now.

There’s another tricky part: after Jesus rose from the dead but before He went to heaven, the disciples asked Him, “Are you going to restore the kingdom to Israel now?” He said, “It’s not for you to know the times or dates. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes, and you will be my witnesses everywhere.” (Acts 1:6) This means His kingdom wasn’t here yet, and no one knows when it will come. Instead, the Holy Spirit will help them tell everyone about Jesus so people can believe and look forward to eternal life when He returns.

So how does this fit with Jesus’ kingdom coming at His resurrection? St. Paul says people turned from idols to serve the true God and wait for His Son to come from heaven (1 Thessalonians 1:9-10). If the kingdom was already here, they wouldn’t need to wait. Also, if the kingdom started when Jesus rose, why do Christians still pray, “Let your kingdom come”? It shows that Mark’s words shouldn’t be taken exactly as they sound. Jesus said some standing there wouldn’t die before seeing God’s kingdom. If the kingdom came when Jesus rose, why say some and not all? They all lived past the resurrection.

For those wanting a strict meaning of this, they should also think about similar words Jesus said to Peter first.
