Sixth, when we pray, give thanks, or offer gifts and sacrifices, it makes sense that these should be the best and most meaningful we can give. For example, prayers and thanks should be said with thoughtful and beautiful words, not quickly or carelessly, because that shows more respect to God. That’s why it was silly for some people in the past to worship statues as gods, but it made sense that they did it with poems and music, using their voices and instruments. Also, the animals and gifts they gave in sacrifices, and the way they acted while worshipping, showed respect and remembered the good things they had received, which is reasonable because it’s meant to honor God.

Seventh, reason tells us to worship God not only alone and quietly but also especially in public, where others can see. This is important because encouraging others to honor God is one of the best ways to show respect.

Finally, following God’s laws, or the laws of nature, is the greatest way to worship Him. Obedience is more pleasing to God than sacrifices, and ignoring His rules is the worst kind of disrespect. These are the basic rules of worship that natural reason tells individuals.

Since a country is like one big person, it should also give God one kind of worship. This happens when the government makes sure that people worship publicly in a uniform way. Public worship means everyone does the same kind of worship together. If different religions allow many kinds of worship, then there is no true public worship, and the country doesn’t really have one religion.

Because words, and the qualities of God, get their meaning from what people agree on, the qualities that show honor to God are the ones people mean to honor Him with. Whatever individuals can do by natural reason, the country can do by laws made by those in power. Since a country’s laws come from its leaders, the qualities that the leaders decide should show honor to God must be accepted and used by everyone in public worship.
