In places where the Pope has full religious power, Jews, Turks, and Gentiles are allowed to practice their religion as long as they don’t break the laws. But if a Christian, even if they are from another country, is not part of the Roman religion, it is considered a serious crime because the Pope claims all Christians belong to him. Otherwise, it would be as wrong to punish a Christian for following their own religion as it is to punish a non-Christian.

Because of this, in every Christian country, some people are protected by church laws and don’t have to pay taxes or follow civil courts. This includes priests, monks, and friars, who in some places are so many that they could form an army if needed to fight for the Church.

Another problem with how people use the Bible is that they confuse consecration with magic or spells. To consecrate means to set something apart for God’s use, making it holy and only for God’s servants. It doesn’t mean the thing itself changes, just how it is used. If someone says the thing itself changes, that’s either a miracle or just a useless magic trick.

For example, when a priest says the bread and wine in Communion are the body and blood of Christ, he is actually setting them apart to remind people of Jesus’s sacrifice. But if he claims the bread truly changes into Jesus’s body, even though it looks and feels the same, that is not true consecration but a kind of magic trick.
