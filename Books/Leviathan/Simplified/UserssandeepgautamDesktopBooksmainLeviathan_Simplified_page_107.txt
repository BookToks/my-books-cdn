A commonwealth is made when a group of people agree and promise each other that whoever gets chosen by most of them to represent everyone will have the power to act and decide for all of them. Everyone, whether they voted for that person or not, agrees to accept the decisions and actions of that representative as if they were their own. This is so they can live peacefully and be safe from others.

All the rights and powers of the person or group given this authority come from the agreement made by the people.

First, because they made this promise, they can’t be forced to do anything that goes against it. Also, once they have agreed to have one leader or group in charge, they can’t make a new promise to obey someone else without the first leader’s permission. So, people who live under a king can’t just get rid of the king and go back to chaos or pick a new leader without the king’s okay. Everyone is linked together in this promise, so if one person disagrees, it would break the whole agreement, which isn’t fair. If they remove their leader, they take away what belongs to him, which is also unfair.

If someone tries to remove the leader and gets punished or killed for it, they brought it on themselves because they agreed to accept whatever the leader decides. It’s wrong to do something that can get you punished by the leader’s power. Some people claim they don’t have to obey because they made a new promise with God, not with people. But this is also wrong because you can only make an agreement with God through someone who represents God’s authority, like the leader. Saying you made a promise directly with God to disobey the leader is a lie, and even those people know deep down it’s not true. This kind of claim is not only unfair but also cowardly and dishonorable.
