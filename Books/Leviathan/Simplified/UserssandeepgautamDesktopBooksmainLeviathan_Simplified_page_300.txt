The suffering of Jesus Christ is shown here clearly, like the story of Isaac in the Old Testament or other examples from that time. Jesus was both the goat that was sacrificed and the scapegoat. The Bible says, “He was oppressed and treated badly; he didn’t say a word; he was like a lamb being led to be killed, and like a sheep that is quiet before its wool is cut” (Isaiah 53:7). This shows Jesus as the sacrificed goat. It also says, “He carried our pain and sadness” (Isaiah 53:4), and “The Lord put the sins of everyone on him” (Isaiah 53:6), which shows he was the scapegoat. It also says, “He was taken away from the living because of the wrongs of my people” (Isaiah 53:8), again showing him as the sacrificed goat. And again, “He will carry their sins” (Isaiah 53:11), showing he was the scapegoat. So, Jesus is like both goats: he was sacrificed because he died, and he escaped through his resurrection when God raised him and took him up to heaven.

Because the one who saves doesn’t own what he saves until he pays the price, and that price was his own death, it’s clear that Jesus, as a man, was not king of the people he saved before he died. That means while he was living on earth in his body, he wasn’t king yet. I mean, he wasn’t king right then, even though people agreed to follow him when they were baptized. But by renewing their promise to God in baptism, they had to obey him as king, under God the Father, whenever Jesus decided to take the kingdom. Jesus himself said, “My kingdom is not from this world” (John 18:36). The Bible talks about only two worlds: this one that exists now and will last until Judgment Day (also called the last day), and the new world that will come after Judgment Day with a new heaven and earth. Jesus’s kingdom won’t really start until the general resurrection.

That’s why Jesus said, “The Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then he will reward everyone according to what they have done” (Matthew 16:27). Giving everyone their reward is the job of a king, and this won’t happen until he comes back in glory with his angels. When Jesus said, “The teachers and Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat; so do whatever they tell you” (Matthew 23:2), he made it clear that at that time, he wasn’t the king, but those leaders had the authority.
