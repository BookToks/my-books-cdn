No one can think of anything without imagining it in some place. Everything has a certain size and can be divided into parts. Nothing can be in two places at the same time, and two different things cannot be in the exact same spot at once. These ideas don’t come from what we actually see or feel, but are silly ideas made up by confused philosophers and scholars.

The invention of printing is clever, but it’s not as important as the invention of letters. We don’t know who first made letters. People say Cadmus, the son of Agenor, King of Phoenicia, brought letters to Greece. Letters are useful because they help us remember things from the past and connect people who live far apart. Making letters was hard because it needed careful attention to how we move our tongue, lips, and mouth to make different sounds and symbols.

But the greatest invention was speech. Speech is made of names or words and how they are connected. It lets people share their thoughts, remember things, and talk to each other for help and friendship. Without speech, people couldn’t live together in communities, make agreements, or have peace—just like wild animals such as lions, bears, and wolves.

The first person to use speech was God, who taught Adam to name the animals He showed him. The Bible doesn’t say more than that. This was enough for Adam to keep adding new names as he learned more. Over time, language grew so he could be understood, though it wasn’t as rich as what a skilled speaker or thinker needs. The Bible doesn’t say Adam learned the names for things like shapes, numbers, colors, sounds, feelings, or grammar words like questions or commands. It also doesn’t say he learned complicated words used by scholars.
