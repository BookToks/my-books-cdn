This window is what opens the door to some dark ideas. First, the idea of eternal punishments, then purgatory, and then the idea that ghosts of dead people walk around, especially in holy, quiet, or dark places. Because of this, people started claiming they could perform exorcisms and summon ghosts, or call on the dead. It also led to the idea of indulgences, which means being free for some time, or forever, from the fire of purgatory, where these ghost-like souls are said to be cleaned by fire to become ready for heaven.  

Before Jesus, people, influenced by Greek ideas, thought souls were separate from bodies. So, when someone died, their soul stayed somewhere on its own, not because of any special gift from God. Church teachers weren’t sure where these souls stayed until the resurrection when bodies and souls would be reunited. Some thought souls stayed under altars for a while. Later, the Roman Church found it more useful to create the idea of purgatory, but some other churches have since rejected it.  

Now, let’s look at what parts of the Bible seem to support these three big mistakes I just mentioned. Cardinal Bellarmine used some Bible verses to prove the Pope’s kingdom now rules God’s kingdom on Earth, and those verses seem strong. But I’ve already answered that, showing that God’s kingdom started with Moses but ended when Saul became king. After that, priests never removed kings on their own. When the high priest removed Athaliah, he did it for the young King Joash, her son. But Solomon removed the high priest Abiathar on his own authority and replaced him.  

The hardest Bible verse to explain, which shows God’s kingdom through Christ is already here, wasn’t used by Bellarmine or anyone from the Roman Church, but by Beza, who says it started from Jesus’ resurrection. But I don’t know if Beza means that church leaders (presbyters) have all power in places like Geneva, or if he means kings and rulers have that power.
