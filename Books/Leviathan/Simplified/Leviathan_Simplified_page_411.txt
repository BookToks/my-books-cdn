Now, about worshipping saints, pictures, relics, and other things in the Church of Rome today, I say that God’s word does not allow it. These things were not part of the Church’s original teachings. They were partly kept when the Gentiles first joined the Church and later supported and increased by the bishops of Rome.

Some people use Bible stories to prove that images are okay. But those images were not made for people to worship. They were there to help people worship God only. For example, the cherubim over the Ark and the bronze serpent were not worshipped themselves. In fact, King Hezekiah broke the bronze serpent because people were wrongly worshipping it (II Kings 18:4). Also, the Bible’s second commandment says not to make any carved images for worship. It makes a difference between images God told people to make and ones people make themselves.

Just like Hezekiah broke the bronze serpent to stop people from worshipping it, Christian leaders today should remove the images people worship, so idolatry can stop. Right now, many people who worship images really believe the images have divine power. Their church leaders even say these images have spoken, bled, or done miracles. People think the saint is in the image or that the image itself is the saint.

The Israelites worshipped a golden calf thinking it was God who saved them from Egypt, but it was still idolatry. They believed the calf was God or had God inside it. Some might think people today are too smart to believe an image is God or a saint, but the Bible shows that people have believed this before. When the golden calf was made, the people said, “These are your gods, Israel” (Exodus 32). Also, Laban’s images were called his gods.
