No one can think of anything without imagining it in some place, with a certain size, and that can be divided into parts. Also, nothing can be in two places at the same time, and two or more things can't be in the exact same spot at once. These ideas don’t come from what we really see or sense but are just confusing ideas from mistaken philosophers and teachers.

The invention of printing is clever, but it’s not as important as the invention of letters. We don’t know who first made letters. People say Cadmus, the son of a Phoenician king, brought letters to Greece. It was a useful invention to help remember things from the past and to connect people living far apart. It was hard to create because it needed careful watching of how we move our tongue, lips, and mouth to make different sounds and letters.

But the best and most useful invention was speech. Speech is made of names and how they are put together. It lets people share their thoughts, remember things, and talk to each other to help and live together. Without speech, people wouldn’t have communities, friendships, agreements, or peace, just like animals don’t.

The first person to have speech was God, who taught Adam to name the animals he saw. The Bible doesn’t say more than this, but it was enough for Adam to learn more names over time as he needed them. He also learned to connect words so others could understand him. Over time, language grew as Adam found it useful, though it wasn’t as detailed as what a speaker or thinker might need. The Bible doesn’t say Adam learned names for shapes, numbers, colors, sounds, feelings, or grammar terms like questions or negatives, much less complicated school words like "entity" or "intentionality."
