Near Jerusalem, there was a place called the Valley of the Children of Hinnon, where some really bad things happened. The Jews once did terrible things there, like sacrificing their children to an idol named Moloch. Because of this, God punished them severely. Later, a king named Josiah burned the priests of Moloch on their own altars, as we read in the Bible in II Kings, Chapter 23. After that, the valley was used to dump trash and garbage from the city. Sometimes, fires were lit there to get rid of bad smells from dead animals.

Because this place was so awful, the Jews started calling it Gehenna, or the Valley of Hinnon. Today, the word Gehenna is often translated as "hell." The fires that sometimes burned there made people think of an eternal, never-ending fire.

Now, no one really believes that after judgment day, the bad people will be punished forever in the Valley of Hinnon. Nor do they think the dead will stay underground or underwater forever, or that they won't see or move around after coming back to life. This makes me think that when the Bible talks about hellfire, it’s using a metaphor—a way of speaking that isn’t literal. So, we need to understand what hell really means and what the punishments and those who punish actually are.

First, let’s talk about the punishers. The Bible gives us their names: the enemy, Satan; the Accuser, or Diabolus; and the Destroyer, or Abaddon. These names don’t refer to specific people like regular names do. Instead, they describe a role or a job. They are titles, not personal names. Because of this, these names shouldn’t have been translated in the Bible like they often are. When they are, people might mistakenly think they are talking about real demons, which can lead people to believe false ideas that come from other religions, not from Moses or Jesus.

The Enemy, the Accuser, and the Destroyer are meant to be the enemies of those who will be part of God's kingdom. If, after the resurrection, God’s kingdom is on earth (which, as I showed earlier from the scriptures, seems likely), then the enemy and his kingdom must be on earth too. This was also true in the past, before the Jews turned away from God.
