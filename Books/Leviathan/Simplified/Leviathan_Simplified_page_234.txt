Some people might say that only the last chapter, not the whole first five books of the Bible (called the Pentateuch), was written by someone else. But let’s look at what the Book of Genesis says: “Abraham passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh, and the Canaanites were then in the land” (Genesis 12:6). This must have been written by someone at a time when the Canaanites were not actually in the land. Since Moses died before the Israelites entered Canaan, he couldn’t have written this part. Also, in Numbers 21:14, the writer refers to an older book called The Book of the Wars of the Lord, which talks about Moses’ actions at the Red Sea and the brook of Arnon.

So, it’s clear that the five Books of Moses were written after Moses’ time, though we don’t know exactly how long after.

Even though Moses didn’t put together the whole book as we have it now, he did write some parts. For example, he wrote the laws found in Deuteronomy chapters 11 to 27. These laws were also meant to be written on stones when the Israelites entered Canaan. Moses gave these laws to the priests and elders to read out loud to the people every seven years during the Feast of Tabernacles (Deuteronomy 31:9-10). This law was the one God told their future kings to copy from the priests and Levites, and Moses told the priests and Levites to keep it beside the Ark of the Covenant (Deuteronomy 31:26). Later, this book was lost but found again by a man named Hilkiah (2 Kings 22:8), who gave it to King Josiah. Josiah had it read to the people, and they promised to follow God’s laws again (2 Kings 23:1-3).

The Book of Joshua was also written long after Joshua’s time. For example, Joshua set up twelve stones in the Jordan River as a memorial, and the writer says, “They are there to this day” (Joshua 4:9). Saying “to this day” shows it was written much later, after people had forgotten the event. Also, when the Lord said He had taken away the shame from Egypt, the writer says the place is still called Gilgal “to this day” (Joshua 5:9), which wouldn’t make sense if written during Joshua’s time. The valley of Achor got its name from trouble caused by Achan, and the writer says that name “remains to this day” (Joshua 7:24), again showing the book was written later.
