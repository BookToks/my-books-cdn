It would have been really strange if, in a town where people had only ever chosen leaders by voting together, the Christians there suddenly thought of picking their teachers and leaders, called presbyters or bishops, in any other way. St. Paul even suggested choosing them by many votes (Acts 14:23).

Before the emperors stepped in to keep peace among bishops, no one picked bishops any other way than by the Christian community in each town.

This idea is still true today when choosing the bishops of Rome. If a bishop could choose another bishop to take over when he moved to a new place, then he should also be able to pick his own replacement where he died. But history shows that no bishop of Rome ever picked his successor. Instead, the people chose them. For example, when Damasus and Ursinus both wanted to be bishop, the fight was so bad that the city’s official had to leave, and over a hundred people even died in the church.

Later on, bishops were chosen first by all the clergy in Rome and then by cardinals. But still, no bishop ever appointed his own successor. So, if they didn’t have the right to pick their own successors, it’s fair to say they didn’t have the right to choose successors for other bishops either, unless they got special power. This kind of power could only come from the government, which had authority to lead and make rules for the Church.

The word "minister" in the original language, Diakonos, means someone who willingly does work for another person. It’s different from a servant because servants have to obey by their job, but ministers only have to do what they promised to do. So, both the people who teach God’s word and those who handle the Church’s everyday tasks are ministers, but they work for different people. The pastors of the Church are called “ministers of the word” (Acts 6).
