In all courts, the ruler (which means the person in charge of the country) is the one who makes the final decision. The judge below the ruler should think about why the ruler made a certain law, so their decision matches the ruler’s decision. If not, the judge’s decision is their own and unfair.

A law is like a command, and a command shows what the person in charge wants, by speaking, writing, or some clear way. The ruler’s command is a law only for people who know about it. People like very young kids, people who can’t understand, or animals don’t have laws because they can’t agree to rules or understand what happens if they don’t follow them. Also, if someone can’t know about a certain law because of something that’s not their fault, they aren’t really breaking the law. So, it’s important to know what signs or messages are enough for people to understand the law, which is the ruler’s will, whether in a kingdom or a different type of government.

First, if a law applies to everyone without any exceptions, but it’s not written down or announced where people can see it, it is a law of nature. Laws of nature are things everyone can understand by using common sense, not by what other people say. These laws don’t need to be announced because everyone agrees on them. One example is: Don’t do something to someone else that you wouldn’t want done to you.
