In short, he has the highest power in all matters, both religious and civil, when it comes to actions and words, because only those things can be known and judged. For things that cannot be judged, only God, who knows what’s in people’s hearts, can be the judge.

These rights belong to all rulers, whether they are kings or groups of leaders. This is because those who represent Christian people also represent the Church. A Church and a group of Christian people are basically the same thing.

Even though what I have said here and in other parts of this book clearly shows that Christian rulers have the highest religious power, the Pope of Rome has strongly claimed this power for himself. Cardinal Bellarmine has argued this point very well in his book called De Summo Pontifice. So, I think it’s important to briefly look at his arguments.

He wrote five books on this topic. The first book has three questions: one asks which government is best—monarchy, aristocracy, or democracy—and says none is perfect, but a mix of all three is best. The second asks which government is best for the Church and says a mixed government is best, with more focus on monarchy. The third asks if St. Peter was the monarch in this mixed government.

About the first question, I have already shown (in Chapter eighteen) that all governments people must obey are simple and absolute. In a monarchy, one person has all power, and others have power only because he allows it. In aristocracy and democracy, one group has all power, like the monarch in a monarchy. So, these are not mixed but absolute powers.

Which type of government is best is not important if one is already established. The current government should always be kept and respected because changing it goes against natural and divine laws. Also, what kind of government is best doesn’t change the power of any religious leader unless they also have civil power. Their job is not to command people but to teach and persuade them, leaving it up to people to accept or reject what is taught.
