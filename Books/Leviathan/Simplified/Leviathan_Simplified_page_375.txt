When Jesus saw a man who wanted to follow Him, He said, “Sell everything you have, give it to the poor, and come follow me.” This meant the man should trust Jesus, who is the king. So, to follow the law and believe Jesus is the king is all you need to live forever.

St. Paul said, “The good people will live by faith,” meaning only those who want to be good and believe are saved. Jesus also said, “The time is here, and God’s kingdom is near; change your heart and believe the good news that the Christ has come.”

So, to be saved, you just need to change your heart and believe that Jesus is the Christ.

Since both faith and obedience (which means changing your heart) are needed to be saved, people argue about which one is more important. But it’s not a waste of time to explain how both help us. First, if being “right” means doing perfect works, no one can be saved because everyone breaks God’s law.

When we say people are made right by their works, it really means God accepts their will to do good as if it were the work itself, even if they fail. This is how someone is called “just” or “unjust,” and how being just makes them accepted by God and able to live by faith.

Being “justified” can also mean that even if your argument isn’t perfect, God accepts it because you try to obey and feel sorry for your mistakes. God only accepts this if you have faith, so faith makes your argument work. This is why people say faith alone justifies.

In short, both faith and obedience are needed to be saved, but they each “justify” us in different ways.
