Sometimes, people use words to show how one name is connected to another. For example, when someone says, “a man is a body,” they mean that the word “body” is linked to the word “man” because they both talk about the same thing, a man. This connection is shown by using the word “is.” Just like we say “is,” the Latins say “est,” and the Greeks say “esti” in their languages.

I don’t know if every language in the world has a word like “is” or “est.” But they don’t really need one. Putting two names together in order can also show their connection, if that’s how people usually speak. Custom, or how people use words, is what gives words their meaning, just like “is,” “be,” or “are” do.

Even if there was a language without a word like “is,” the people who speak it would still be able to think, argue, and understand things just as well as the Greeks and Latins. But then, what would happen to words like “entity,” “essence,” “essential,” and others that come from “is”? Those words aren’t names of real things. Instead, they are signs we use to show that one name or idea is connected to another. For example, when we say, “a man is a living body,” we don’t mean the man is one thing, the living body is another thing, and “is” is something separate. We mean the man and the living body are the same because if he’s a man, he is also a living body. So, words like “to be a body,” “to walk,” “to speak,” “to live,” “to see,” and words like “corporeity,” “walking,” “speaking,” “life,” and “sight” don’t actually name real things. I have explained this more fully elsewhere.

Some might ask, why go into such details in a book about government and obeying laws? The reason is to stop people from being tricked by those who use confusing ideas, like the “separated essences” from Aristotle’s old philosophy, to scare people away from following their country’s laws. It’s like scaring birds away from grain using an empty coat, a hat, and a crooked stick. For example, some say that when a person dies and is buried, their soul, which is their life, can walk away from their body and be seen by night near graves.
