After Moses turned the waters of the Egyptian streams, rivers, ponds, and pools into blood, the Egyptian magicians did the same thing using their magic. And when Moses brought frogs onto the land by God's power, the magicians also made frogs appear with their magic.

Because of this, people might think that miracles happen because of magic or the power of certain words. But nowhere in the Bible does it explain what magic really is. If magic isn’t actually about doing strange things with spells and words, but instead just tricks and lies done by normal means, then those parts of the Bible that seem to support magic must mean something different than they first appear.

It’s clear that words only affect people who understand them. Words don’t have any special power themselves; they just show what the speaker feels or wants. This can make the listener feel hope, fear, or other emotions. So, when a stick looks like a snake or water looks like blood, or when a miracle seems to happen by magic, if it doesn’t help God’s people, it’s not really the stick or water that is magical—it’s the person watching who is tricked. The whole miracle is just that someone fooled another person, which is not really a miracle, but an easy thing to do.

People are usually pretty ignorant and quick to believe mistakes, especially if they don’t understand natural causes or how people really are. This means many tricks can fool them easily. For example, before people knew about stars and science, if someone said the sun would be darkened at a certain time, people might think it was a miracle. A juggler who plays with cups and other things might be seen as having devil’s power if people didn’t know better. And a person who can make their voice seem like it’s coming from far away (called a ventriloquist in ancient times) can make many people believe the voice is from heaven, no matter what they say.
