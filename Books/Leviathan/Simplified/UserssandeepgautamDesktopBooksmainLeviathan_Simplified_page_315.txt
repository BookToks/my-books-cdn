But in the same chapter, the decision in a case like this is clearly said to be made by the whole group: “But now I have written to you not to hang out with anyone who is called a brother but is sexually immoral,” and, “don’t even eat with such a person. Why should I judge those outside the church? Don’t you judge those inside?” (1 Corinthians 5:11-12). 

So, the punishment that removes a person from the Church was given by the Apostle or pastor, but the group of Christians living in the same city—like in Corinth—decided if the person was really guilty. This was before kings and rulers had power over the church.

This kind of power to kick someone out of God’s kingdom is called excommunication. The word means to throw someone out of the synagogue, which was the Jewish place of worship. The Jews used this to separate people who were seen as dangerous or unclean, like lepers, until the priest said they were clean again.

At first, excommunication didn’t involve government power. It just meant that people who were not kicked out had to avoid those who were. They didn’t treat excommunicated people like strangers who never believed, because they could still eat and drink with those people. But with excommunicated people, they were not allowed to eat or hang out with them. St. Paul said this when he told the church not to “keep company” with fornicators (people who sin sexually), especially if they were part of the church (1 Corinthians 5:9-10). 

Jesus said something similar: “Let him be to you like a heathen and a tax collector” (Matthew 18:17). Tax collectors were hated by the Jews because they worked for the government and took money from them. Tax collectors and sinners were treated the same—both were looked down on. When Jesus accepted Zacchaeus, a tax collector, people criticized him for it. So, Jesus warned his followers not to eat with someone who was excommunicated.
