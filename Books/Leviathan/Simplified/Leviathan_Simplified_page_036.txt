Fear without knowing why or what causes panic or terror. It’s called panic because of old stories that blame Pan for it. But really, when someone is scared, they first have some idea of the cause, even if others just run away because they see everyone else doing it. This feeling usually happens only when there’s a big group of people.

Joy from seeing something new or amazing is normal for people because it makes us want to understand why it happens.

Joy that comes from imagining our own power or skills is called glorying. If this is based on things we have actually done before, it’s the same as confidence. But if it’s just because others praise us or we only imagine being powerful, it’s called vainglory. This is called “vain” because real confidence makes us try new things, while just thinking we’re powerful doesn’t.

Feeling sad because we think we don’t have power is called dejection of the mind.

Vainglory, or pretending we have skills we don’t, happens most to young people. It grows from stories about brave or cool people, but usually gets better with age and work.

Sudden glory is the feeling that makes people laugh. It happens when they do something that makes them happy or when they see something ugly in someone else and feel better by comparison. This kind of laughter mostly comes from people who don’t feel very capable themselves. They try to feel good by noticing other people’s mistakes. Laughing a lot at others’ faults shows weakness. Strong people try to help others, avoid mocking, and compare themselves only with the best.

On the other hand, sudden sadness makes people cry. It happens when something they hoped for is suddenly lost or when they lose support they counted on. Women and children, who often depend more on outside help, feel this most.

People cry for different reasons: losing friends, being treated badly, or when plans for revenge don’t work because of peace. But both laughing and crying are quick feelings that usually fade with time.
