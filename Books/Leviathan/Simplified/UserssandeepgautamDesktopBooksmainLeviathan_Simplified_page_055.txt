A good leader of soldiers is very important during war or when war is about to happen, but not so much during peace. A smart and honest judge is really valuable during peace, but not as much during war. Just like in other things, the value of a person depends on how others see them, not how they see themselves.

People usually think they are worth a lot, but their true worth is only as much as others think they are.

The way we show how much we value someone is called honouring or dishonouring. If we think someone is really valuable, we honour them; if we think they are less valuable, we dishonour them. This value is compared to how much the person values themselves.

The value a community gives to a person is called dignity. This is shown by giving them important jobs, titles, or positions.

Asking someone for help shows honour because it means we believe they have the power to help us. The harder the help is to get, the more honour we show.

Obeying someone is honouring them because we don’t obey people we think have no power. Not obeying is dishonouring.

Giving big gifts to someone honours them because it shows we want their protection and respect their power. Giving small gifts is more like charity and shows we don’t think they have much power.

Working hard to help someone or praising them is honouring because it means we want their support. Ignoring them is dishonouring.

Letting someone have the better place or thing honours them because it shows we think they have more power. Taking more than our share is dishonouring.

Showing love or fear for someone is honour because both mean we value them. If we don’t love or fear them as much as they expect, it’s dishonouring because it means we don’t value them enough.

Praising someone or calling them lucky is honouring because it means we see them as good and powerful. Mocking or feeling sorry for them is dishonouring.

Talking to someone politely and acting respectfully shows honour because it means we don’t want to offend them. Speaking rudely or acting badly in front of them is dishonouring.
