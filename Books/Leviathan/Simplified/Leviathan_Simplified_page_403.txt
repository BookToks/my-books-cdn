If we expect the Bible to answer every question that might confuse us about following God’s commands, we might as well complain that Moses didn’t explain when spirits were created, just like he didn’t explain when the earth, sea, people, and animals were made.

In the Bible, I see that there are angels and spirits, both good and bad. But it doesn’t say they are invisible like ghosts people see in the dark, dreams, or visions, which the Romans called “spectra” and thought were demons. I see that some spirits have bodies, though they are very light and hard to see. But the Bible doesn’t say that any person’s body was taken over or lived in by these spirits. Also, it says the bodies of saints will be special spiritual bodies, like St. Paul talks about.

Still, many people in the Church believe that spirits without bodies exist. Because of this, they practice exorcisms, which means trying to force devils out by special prayers. This doesn’t happen often now, but it hasn’t completely stopped.

Long ago, there were many people thought to be possessed by demons in the Church, and fewer people were called crazy. Today, we see more people called crazy and fewer called possessed. This change is mostly because of different names, not because people have changed.

It’s also a mystery why the early Church leaders, like the Apostles, could heal these special illnesses and do amazing things, but people today don’t seem to do these things. The Bible says they could “in Jesus’ name cast out devils, speak new languages, handle snakes, drink poison without harm, and heal the sick just by touching them” (Mark 16:17), and they did this just by saying Jesus’ name.

One possible reason is that these special gifts were given only while people fully trusted Christ and hoped for his kingdom in the future. When people started wanting power, money, and their own kingdoms on earth, these special gifts were taken away from them.
