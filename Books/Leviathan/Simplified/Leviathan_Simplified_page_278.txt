Thomas Hobbes says that where people will live forever after coming back to life is called heaven. By heaven, he means the farthest parts of the world, like where the stars are or even beyond them, in a place called the "empyrean heaven." But this idea is not clearly shown in the Bible or by reason.

When the Bible talks about the Kingdom of Heaven, it means the kingdom of God, who lives in heaven. This kingdom was first the people of Israel, ruled by prophets like Moses, Eleazar, and the priests. Later, in the time of Samuel, the people rebelled and wanted a human king like other nations.

Hobbes says that when Jesus’s followers convince the Jews to come back and the Gentiles to follow God, then there will be a new King of Heaven. This King will be God himself, whose throne is in heaven. The Bible doesn’t clearly say that people will go higher than the earth, which God calls his "footstool," to be happy forever.

In fact, it says, “No one has gone up to heaven except the one who came down from heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.” Hobbes notes that this is not Jesus speaking, but John the Apostle writing, because Jesus was on earth at that time.

Peter also uses Psalm words to show Jesus’s ascension, saying they were about Christ, not David, and that David did not go up to heaven. Some might say that while their bodies didn’t go up until the final judgment day, their souls went to heaven right after death. This idea seems supported by Jesus when he says Moses called God "the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," meaning God is the God of the living, not the dead.

But if this means only the soul lives forever, it doesn’t prove what Jesus meant, which is that the whole person, body and soul, will live forever. So, Hobbes says Jesus meant that those early believers lived forever not because humans naturally do, but because God chose to give eternal life to those who are faithful.
