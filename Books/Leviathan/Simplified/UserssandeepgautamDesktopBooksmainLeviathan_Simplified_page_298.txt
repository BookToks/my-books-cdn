The people always found some excuse, either about justice or religion, to stop obeying whenever they thought they could win. Samuel was upset with the people because they wanted a king, even though God was already their King, and Samuel only had authority under God. But when Saul didn’t follow Samuel’s advice to destroy Agag as God commanded, Samuel chose another king, David, to take over after Saul’s family.

Rehoboam wasn’t an idol worshiper, but when the people thought he was a harsh ruler, ten tribes left him and joined Jeroboam, who did worship idols. Throughout the history of the kings of Judah and Israel, prophets often corrected kings when they broke religious rules or made political mistakes. For example, Jehoshaphat was scolded by the prophet Jehu for helping the King of Israel fight the Syrians, and Hezekiah was warned by Isaiah for showing his treasures to Babylon’s ambassadors.

This shows that even though kings had power over the state and religion, they were not free to do whatever they wanted unless they were naturally wise or lucky. So, from what happened back then, you can’t say that kings didn’t have the highest religious authority unless you think it belonged to the prophets. But just because Hezekiah’s prayers weren’t answered directly before the cherubim but later through Isaiah, or because Josiah asked the prophetess Huldah about the Book of the Law, doesn’t mean the prophets were the supreme leaders of the Church. Most experts don’t believe that.

During the Captivity, the Jews didn’t have any government at all. After they returned, they renewed their promise to God, but no one promised to obey leaders like Esdras or anyone else. Soon after, they became subjects of the Greeks, and their religion got mixed up with Greek ideas and the teachings of the Cabalists. Their state and religion became so confused that we can’t learn much about who had the highest authority.

So, looking at the Old Testament, we can say that whoever ruled the Jewish government also had the highest authority in God’s public worship and represented God’s presence—that is, God the Father. This was before God was called Father, which only happened when He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to save people from their sins and bring them into His eternal kingdom.
