Power is split up, and it’s just as risky to share power with someone who has indirect control as it is with someone who has direct control. But let’s look at his main points now.

The first point is this: “Civil power is under spiritual power, so whoever has the highest spiritual power can command kings and control their kingdoms to serve spiritual purposes.” About the difference between civil and spiritual power, let’s think about what it really means to say civil power is under spiritual power.

There are only two ways this makes sense. Either the person with one kind of power is under the person with the other, or one kind of power is a step toward the other kind of power, like a tool to reach a goal.

We can’t really say one power controls another power, or that one kind of power has the right to command the other, because control and power belong to people, not to powers themselves. One skill can be less important than another, like the skill of a saddler (someone who makes saddles) compared to the skill of a rider. So even if civil government helps us reach spiritual happiness, it doesn’t mean a king with civil power has to obey the Pope who has spiritual power—just like a saddler doesn’t have to obey a rider.

So from one skill being less important, you can’t say the person with that skill is under the other person. The same goes for governments and rulers. When he says civil power is under spiritual power, he means the king is under the religious leader. His argument goes: the king is under spiritual power, so the spiritual leader can command kings. But he’s just repeating his idea instead of proving it.

To prove it, he says, “Kings and popes, clergy and regular people, all belong to one group, one Church. In all groups, members depend on each other. Spiritual things don’t depend on worldly things, so worldly things depend on spiritual things, meaning the worldly are under the spiritual.” This has two big mistakes.

First, not all Christian kings, popes, clergy, and people make one group. France is one group, Spain another, Venice a third. These are all Christians, but they’re separate groups or churches. Their rulers speak for them, which means they can command and obey like normal people.

No universal Church exists on earth with one ruler who has power over both spiritual and worldly matters. If there were one, all Christians would be one group under that ruler. But the Pope doesn’t have that. To be that ruler, the Pope would need three things that Jesus didn’t give him: power to command, judge, and punish directly, except by excommunication, which just means cutting people off who won’t listen.

Even if the Pope is Christ’s only representative, he can’t fully govern until Jesus comes back. And then, it won’t be the Pope but St. [the sentence ends here].
