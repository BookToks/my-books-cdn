These are the ways God showed His will in the Old Testament.

He used the same ways in the New Testament too. For example, He showed a vision of an angel to the Virgin Mary, gave Joseph a dream, showed Paul a vision of Jesus on the way to Damascus, gave Peter a vision of a sheet with different kinds of animals, sent an angel to prisoners, gave the Apostles and New Testament writers special gifts from His Spirit, and chose Matthias to replace Judas by drawing lots.

Since all prophecy involves visions or dreams (which are basically the same when natural), or special gifts from God that are very rare and amazing, we need to use reason and judgment to tell the difference between natural and supernatural gifts, and between natural and supernatural visions or dreams.

Because of this, people must be very careful and watchful when listening to someone who says they are a prophet and tells us to obey God in a certain way. Anyone who says they can teach the way to true happiness wants to be in charge of others, which is something everyone naturally wants. So, we should be suspicious and check carefully before obeying them, unless they have already been given authority by the government or ruler. If people were not allowed to check prophets and spirits themselves, it would be pointless to give signs to help us know who to follow.

Since there are signs to recognize a true prophet (like in Deuteronomy 13:1) and to recognize spirits (like in 1 John 4:1), and since the Old Testament talks a lot about prophesying and the New Testament warns against false prophets, and because there are usually many more false prophets than true ones, everyone should be careful about following their advice. For example, when King Ahab asked 400 prophets, all but one, Micaiah, were false.
