In a democracy, the whole group can’t fail unless the people being ruled fail. So, questions about who should take over don’t really come up in this kind of government.

In an aristocracy, when a member of the group dies, the group itself gets to choose someone new to take their place. This group is like the boss and picks all the leaders and officers. Even if the group lets others pick new people, it’s still their decision, and they can take that power back if needed.

The hardest part about choosing who comes next is in a monarchy. The problem is that it’s not clear who gets to pick the next ruler or who the ruler has chosen. This requires careful thinking that not everyone does.

When a king or queen dies, either the current ruler has the right to choose who comes next, or the people have to decide. But if the ruler dies without choosing, the people don’t have a leader, and everyone has equal chance to pick someone or protect themselves with force. This leads to chaos, which is the opposite of why monarchy was created. So, it’s clear that the current ruler usually gets to decide who will be next.

If there’s a question about who the ruler has picked, it’s shown by their clear words or will, or by other obvious signs.

Clear words or a will means the ruler said it out loud or wrote it down during their life, like the first Roman emperors did when they chose their heirs.
