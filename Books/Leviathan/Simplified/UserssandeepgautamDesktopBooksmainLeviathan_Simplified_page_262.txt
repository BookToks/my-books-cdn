Sometimes, when people spoke in a confusing way, others thought it was a kind of prophecy. This happened with the prophets of the Gentiles, who were inspired by a spirit or vapor from the Pythian Oracle at Delphi. For a while, they seemed crazy and spoke like madmen. But people tried to find meaning in their strange words, just like how all things are made from basic materials.

In the Bible, there is a similar idea in the words, “And the evil spirit came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house.” (I Samuel 18:10) The word "prophet" can mean many things in the Bible, but most of the time, it means someone who hears directly from God and tells others what God wants them to know.

This makes us wonder: how does God speak to a prophet? Some might ask if God really has a voice or language like humans do, since He doesn’t have a mouth or tongue. The Prophet David said, “Shall He that made the eye not see? Or He that made the ear not hear?” (Psalms 94:9) This means God can see and hear, but it’s not like human seeing and hearing. It’s a way to show respect for God’s power.

If we took it too literally, we might think God has a body like ours, which wouldn’t make sense or be respectful. So, when the Bible says God spoke to people, it means God made them understand His will in some way. There are many ways God does this, and we can learn about them by reading the Bible. Sometimes the Bible doesn’t say exactly how God spoke, but other times it gives clues to help us understand.

We don’t know exactly how God spoke to Adam, Eve, Cain, or Noah. Nor is it clear how He spoke to Abraham until Abraham left his country and came to a place called Sichem in the land of Canaan. Then, God is said to have appeared to him.
