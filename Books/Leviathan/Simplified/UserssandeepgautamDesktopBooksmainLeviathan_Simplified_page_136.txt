If a ruler tries to take something by pretending he has power, there is no legal action against him. This is because everything he does with his power is actually done with the approval of all the people, so anyone who sues the ruler is really suing themselves.

If a king or ruling group gives freedom to some people but then can't protect them, that freedom is not valid unless the ruler clearly gives up or hands over his power to someone else. Since the ruler didn’t do that, we can assume he didn’t want to give up power, and the freedom he gave was because he didn’t understand that it conflicts with his power. So, the ruler still keeps all the powers needed to protect the people, like making war or peace, judging, appointing officials, and collecting money.

People must obey the ruler only as long as he can protect them. Everyone has the natural right to protect themselves if no one else can. The ruler’s power is like the soul of the country; if it leaves, the country can no longer function.

The reason people obey is for protection. When they see protection, whether from their own or someone else’s strength, they obey and try to keep it. Even though rulers want their power to last forever, it can be destroyed by war or problems caused by people’s mistakes and disagreements.

If someone is captured in war and is allowed to live freely only if they obey the winner, they can choose to accept and become the winner’s subject, because it’s the only way to survive. This is the same if they are held in another country under similar conditions.

But if a person is locked up or not allowed to move freely, they are not really bound to obey, and they can try to escape by any means they can.
