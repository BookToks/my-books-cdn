A sixth rule of nature is this: when someone apologizes and promises to be better in the future, we should forgive them for what they did wrong before.

Forgiving means giving peace. If we forgive people who keep being hostile, that’s not really peace but just fear. But if we don’t forgive those who promise to change, it shows we don’t want peace, which goes against natural law.

A seventh rule is about revenge. When people get back at someone, they shouldn’t think about how bad the past hurt was, but about the good that can come next. We should only punish others to help them learn or to warn others, not just to hurt them. Revenge without a good reason is just showing off, which makes no sense and can lead to war, which is cruel and against natural law.

Because showing hate or disrespect often leads to fighting, many people would rather risk their lives than not get revenge. So, the eighth rule says: no one should show hate or disrespect through actions, words, or expressions. Breaking this rule is called insult.

The question of who is better doesn’t matter in the natural state, where everyone is equal. The differences we see now come from laws made by people. Aristotle said some people are naturally born to lead because they are wiser, and others to serve because they are stronger but less wise. But this idea goes against reason and experience. Most people want to rule themselves, not be ruled, and smart people don’t always win when they fight those who doubt their wisdom.

So, if nature made people equal, we should accept that. And even if nature made people different, since everyone thinks they are equal, peace can only happen if we all agree to be treated equally.
