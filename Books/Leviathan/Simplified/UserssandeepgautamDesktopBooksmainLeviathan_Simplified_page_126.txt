A ruler has complete power over everyone; otherwise, there is no real ruler at all. If there isn’t one, then each person can defend themselves with their own sword, which means it’s like being at war.

This shows that a big family, if it’s not part of a bigger group or country, is like a small kingdom. Whether the family is just a man and his kids, or a man and his servants, or both, the father or master is the ruler. But a family isn’t really a country unless it’s strong enough to protect itself and not easily taken over without fighting. When a group is too weak to defend themselves together, each person can use their own judgment in danger to save their life, either by running away or giving in to the enemy. This is like a small group of soldiers who get caught by a big army—they might surrender or run instead of being killed. This explains what I have learned about rulers’ rights from thinking about why people create countries and choose leaders or groups with enough power to keep them safe.

Now, let’s look at what the Bible says about this.

The Israelites told Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but don’t let God speak to us, or we might die.” (Exodus 20:19) This shows they obeyed Moses completely. About kings’ power, God told Samuel to say: “Here’s the power the king you want will have. He will take your sons to drive his chariots and be soldiers, and your daughters to serve him as cooks and bakers. He will take your fields, vineyards, and olive trees and give them to his servants. He will take a part of your crops and give it to his servants. He will take your servants and your best young people to work for him. He will take a part of your animals, and you will become his servants.” (1 Samuel 8:11-17) This is total power, summed up by saying, “You will be his servants.” Even after hearing this, the people agreed and said, “We want to be like other nations, and our king will judge us and lead us in wars.”
