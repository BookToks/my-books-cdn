Wanting huge amounts of money and aiming for big honors is seen as honorable because it shows you have the power to get them. But wanting small gains or minor promotions is not honorable.

It doesn’t matter if a big and difficult action is right or wrong; honor comes from showing power. That’s why old pagan stories didn’t think gods were dishonored when they did bad things like stealing or cheating. For example, Jupiter is famous for his affairs, and Mercury is famous for tricks and thefts. Homer even praised Mercury for inventing music by noon and stealing Apollo’s cattle by night.

Before big governments existed, being a pirate or robber wasn’t considered shameful; it was a normal job for Greeks and other people. Even today, private duels are seen as honorable, even though they are illegal. Duels often show courage, which comes from strength or skill—both signs of power. But many duels happen because people talk recklessly or fear losing honor, and then they fight to avoid being embarrassed.

Family crests and coats of arms are honorable only if they come with special privileges or wealth, which are also respected. This kind of honor, called gentry, comes from the ancient Germans. There was no such thing where German customs didn’t exist. The old Greek soldiers painted their shields with designs, but they didn’t pass these designs down to their kids. Romans passed down family symbols, but these were just images, not personal designs. People in Asia, Africa, and America never had this custom. Only the Germans did, and that tradition came to England, France, Spain, and Italy when the Germans helped or conquered these places.
