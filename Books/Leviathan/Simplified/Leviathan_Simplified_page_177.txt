At Mount Sinai, Moses went up to God alone. The people were told they couldn’t go near God or they would die. But they had to listen to everything Moses said because it was God’s law. They agreed by saying, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but don’t let God speak to us, or we will die.”

This shows that in a country, people have to follow the rules given by the government unless they have a special message from God. If everyone just believed their own ideas or someone else’s ideas about God’s commands, no one would agree on what to do, and they would ignore the government’s rules.

So, as long as the rules don’t go against basic moral laws or natural laws, people must obey the laws the government says come from God. This makes sense because any rule that doesn’t break natural law can be made by those in charge. People should follow these rules even more if they say they come from God. Also, no one is allowed to claim other commands from God except the ones the government says are true. Christian countries punish those who reject Christianity, and other countries punish those who start religions they don’t allow. If the government doesn’t control something, then everyone should be free in that area, because fairness and natural law say everyone should have equal freedom.

There is also a difference between important laws and less important laws, but I’ve never seen a clear explanation of what a really important law means. Still, it makes sense to separate laws like that.

An important law is one that if taken away, the country would fall apart, like a building losing its foundation. A fundamental law makes sure people support the power given to the ruler or government group so the country can keep running. This includes the power to make war and peace, decide laws, choose leaders, and do whatever is needed for the public good. Laws that aren’t fundamental don’t cause the country to break down if they are removed, like laws about arguments between citizens.
