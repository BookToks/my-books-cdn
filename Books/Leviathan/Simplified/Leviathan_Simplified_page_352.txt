So, the decisions made by this council weren’t really laws, but more like advice.

The sixth point comes from Romans 13: “Let everyone obey the higher powers, because all power comes from God.” This means not just kings and governments, but also church leaders. But here’s the thing: the only church leaders who have real power are those who are also leaders in the government. Their church authority doesn’t go beyond their government power. If the author meant we should obey both our government leaders and the Pope, that would be like trying to serve two bosses, which Jesus said you can’t do. Also, when the author talks about using power to punish, he’s not talking about things like putting people in jail or fining them. He means excommunication, which just means cutting someone off from the church group. Without the government’s help, that’s just like treating them like a stranger, and sometimes it hurts the church more than the person kicked out.

The seventh point is from 1 Corinthians 4:21, where it says, “Should I come to you with a rod, or with love and kindness?” Here, “rod” doesn’t mean the power to punish people like a government would. It means the power to excommunicate, which isn’t a real punishment by itself but a warning about the punishment Jesus will give one day. Even then, it’s not punishment like breaking a law, but more like revenge against someone who denies Jesus’s right to be king. So, this doesn’t prove that any bishop has real law-making power unless they also have government power.

The eighth point is from Timothy 3:2, which says, “A bishop must be married to only one wife, and be careful and serious,” etc. This was called a law. But I thought only the leader of the Church, St. Peter, could make laws. Even if St. Peter made this rule, it seems more like advice than a strict law because Timothy wasn’t a citizen under someone’s rule but a student of St. Paul. And the people Timothy was in charge of weren’t subjects in a kingdom, but students learning from Christ.
