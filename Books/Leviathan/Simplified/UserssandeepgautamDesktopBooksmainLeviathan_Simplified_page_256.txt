When we say “Hallowed be thy name,” we are praying to God to help us follow the first Commandment, which says we should have no other gods but Him.

All people belong to God’s nation, but only the Jews were called a holy nation. This is because they made a special agreement, or covenant, with God.

The word "profane" in the Bible usually means "common" or ordinary. So, in God’s kingdom, holy and proper mean the same thing. Sometimes, people who live very godly lives, giving up worldly things and fully dedicating themselves to God, are also called holy.

Something is truly holy when God sets it apart for His own use. For example, the seventh day was made holy in the fourth Commandment. Also, in the New Testament, people chosen by God are called holy when they receive the spirit of godliness. Things dedicated by people to God, like temples, priests, or offerings, are called sacred or consecrated because they are used only for God’s public service.

There are different levels of holiness. Some things set apart for God’s service are made even more special. The whole nation of Israel was holy to God. Within Israel, the tribe of Levi was even more holy. Among the Levites, the priests were holier, and among the priests, the high priest was the most holy. The land of Judea was called the Holy Land, but the Holy City was more holy. The Temple was even more holy than the city, and the innermost part of the Temple, called the sanctum sanctorum, was the most holy of all.

A sacrament is when something visible is set apart from ordinary use and dedicated to God’s service. It can be a sign that we belong to God’s kingdom or a way to remember that. In the Old Testament, the sign of belonging was circumcision. In the New Testament, it is baptism.

In the Old Testament, people remembered this by eating the Paschal Lamb on a special anniversary. This reminded them of the night they were freed from slavery in Egypt. In the New Testament, we remember our freedom from sin through the Lord’s Supper, which reminds us of Jesus’ death on the cross.
