When we see something that might have a natural cause, even if it hardly ever happens, or if it happens a lot but we can’t figure out how it happens naturally, we don’t think it’s a miracle anymore.

So, if a horse or a cow suddenly talked, that would be a miracle because it’s really strange and we can’t imagine how it could happen naturally. It would also be a miracle to see a totally new kind of animal that looks very different. But when a man or another animal has babies like itself, even though we don’t fully understand how it happens, it’s not a miracle because it happens all the time. Similarly, if a man turned into a stone or a pillar, that would be a miracle because it’s so weird; but if a piece of wood changes shape, it’s not a miracle because it happens often. Still, we don’t know how God might make either one happen.

The first time anyone ever saw a rainbow, it was a miracle because it was new and strange. It was also a sign from God, showing that He wouldn’t flood the whole world again. But now rainbows happen so often that people don’t think they’re miracles anymore, whether they understand how they happen or not. Also, humans make many amazing things with art and skills, but once we know how they’re made, we don’t call them miracles because they aren’t made directly by God, but by people’s hard work.

Since people have different levels of knowledge and experience, something might seem like a miracle to one person but not to another. That’s why some people who don’t understand science or facts get amazed by things others know are natural. For example, common people used to think eclipses of the sun and moon were supernatural, but others who understood them could even predict exactly when they would happen. Or, if someone secretly knows what another person did before and tells them about it, it might seem like a miracle to the unaware person. But smart and careful people know those kinds of “miracles” don’t happen easily.
