Leviathan/357 The third point is that the See of St. Peter is called by St. Cyprian the head, the source, the root, and the sun, meaning the place where the authority of bishops comes from. But by natural law, which is a better way to know right and wrong than what any human teacher says, the civil ruler in every country is the head, the source, the root, and the sun, where all power comes from. So, the authority of bishops actually comes from the civil ruler.

The fourth point is about how their powers are different in size. It says, if God had given their power directly, then all bishops would have equal power, just like their rank. But we see some bishops rule over just one town, some over many towns, and some over whole provinces. These differences were not set by God. So, their power comes from humans, not God. Some have more power, some less, depending on what the leader of the Church decides. If it was proven that the Pope had power over all Christians, this argument would make sense. But since that’s not proven, and we know the Pope got his big power from the Roman emperors (because the Patriarch of Constantinople also claimed equal power as the bishop of the capital city), it means all bishops get their power from the rulers of the places where they work. So, since bishops don't get their authority directly from God, the Pope doesn’t either, unless he is also the civil ruler.

The fifth argument says: If bishops got their power straight from God, the Pope couldn’t take it away from them, because he can’t go against God’s rules. This is true and well explained. But the Pope can take power from bishops and has done so—but only in his own lands or lands where a ruler gave him that power. He can’t do this everywhere just because he’s the Pope. This kind of power belongs to every country’s ruler inside their own kingdom and can’t be separated from their rule. Before Israel had a king, the high priest ruled the people and only he could appoint or remove other priests. But later, the king had that power, which proves this point: if priests got their power directly from God, the king couldn’t take it from them, because he can’t go against God’s rules.
