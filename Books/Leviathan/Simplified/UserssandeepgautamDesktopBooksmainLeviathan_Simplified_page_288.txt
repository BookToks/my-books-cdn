Our Savior Christ did not pay for our sins in a way that made it wrong for God to punish sinners forever. Instead, when He first came, He offered Himself as a sacrifice that God wanted. This was so that when He comes again, those who say sorry and believe in Him can be saved. Sometimes the Bible doesn’t call this act a sacrifice but a price. But this price is not about how much He was worth to get us a pardon from God. It’s the price God the Father kindly asked for.

The word Church (ecclesia) means different things in the Bible. Sometimes, though not often, it means God’s house—a temple where Christians gather to worship. For example, in the Bible it says, “Let your women keep silence in the churches” (1 Corinthians 14:34). This means the people gathered there, but later it also meant the building itself, to show the difference between Christian temples and others. The Temple of Jerusalem was God’s house and a place to pray. Any building Christians use to worship Christ is also called Christ’s house. That’s why early Greek Christians called it Kuriakón, meaning the Lord’s house. This is why in English we say kirk or church.

When Church doesn’t mean a building, it means the same as in ancient Greece—a group or assembly of citizens called together to listen to a leader speak. In ancient Rome, this was called concio, and the speaker was called ecclesiastes or concionator. When people were called together by legal authority, it was a lawful Church (ecclesia legitima). But if they were gathered by noisy, rebellious crowd, it was a confused Church.

Church also means the people who have the right to be part of the group, even if they are not actually gathered. This means all Christians everywhere. For example, when it says “Saul made havoc of the church” (Acts 8:3), it means he attacked all Christians. In this way, Christ is called the Head of the Church.
