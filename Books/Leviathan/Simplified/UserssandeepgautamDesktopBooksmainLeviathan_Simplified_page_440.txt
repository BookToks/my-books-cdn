This passage explains when people can be called conquered and what it means to be a conqueror.

Being conquered isn’t just about winning a battle. It means gaining control over people after winning. If someone is killed, they are defeated but not conquered. If someone is captured and put in prison or chains, they are still an enemy and might escape. But if someone promises to obey the winner and keeps their life and freedom, then they are truly conquered and become subjects.

The Romans said they “pacified” a place when the people promised to follow their rules. That’s what real conquest is.

This promise to obey can be clear or silent. For example, if someone hasn’t promised openly but lives under the conqueror’s protection, it’s understood they obey the new government. But if they hide and act like enemies, they can be treated like spies and punished, even killed. If someone is away when their country is conquered, they aren’t conquered until they return and accept the new government. So, conquest is when the winner gains the right to rule because the people promise to obey for their life and freedom.

In another chapter, the writer talks about why governments sometimes fail. One reason is they don’t have full power to make laws and enforce them properly. Leaders often feel unsure about using their power because they want to justify the war that gave them control. For example, some think the kings of England only have power because of how William the Conqueror won and passed down his rule. But if their right to rule depended only on that, then people wouldn’t really have to obey them now. By trying to justify their power this way, they actually encourage rebellions against them and future rulers.
