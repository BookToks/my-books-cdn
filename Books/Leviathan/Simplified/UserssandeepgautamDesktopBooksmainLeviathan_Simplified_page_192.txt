Eighth, if the law says what the punishment is for a crime, but after someone commits the crime they get a worse punishment, that extra punishment isn’t really a punishment—it’s more like an attack. Punishment isn’t about revenge, it’s about making people scared to do bad things. When the law says the punishment is smaller, people expect that, so if something worse happens, it’s not fair. But if the law doesn’t say what the punishment is, then anything done to the person is considered punishment. That’s because if someone breaks a law without a set penalty, they can expect any kind of punishment, even random ones.

Ninth, if someone is hurt for doing something before there was a law against it, that’s not punishment—it’s an attack. This is because you can’t break a law that doesn’t exist yet. Punishment only happens when someone breaks an existing law, so hurting someone before the law was made is just being hostile.

Tenth, hurting a person who represents the government is not punishment either, but an act of hostility. That’s because punishment should only come from public authority, which means the government itself.

Lastly, hurting someone who is officially an enemy isn’t called punishment. That’s because enemies either never had to follow the law or they stopped following it on purpose, so they can’t be punished by the law. Any harm done to them is just part of fighting. So, if someone who used to follow the government’s rules says they don’t recognize the government anymore, they can be treated however the government wants. This is because they are acting like enemies, not citizens, and the punishments in the law only apply to citizens, not enemies.

The first big way to divide punishments is into ones from God and ones from people. I will talk more about the ones from God later.
