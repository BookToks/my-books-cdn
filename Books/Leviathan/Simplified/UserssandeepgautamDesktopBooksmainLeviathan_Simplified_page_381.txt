Heresies are all the beliefs that the Church of Rome has said people are not allowed to hold. Because of this, whenever the Pope’s political plans clash with those of other Christian rulers — which happens a lot — the people get confused. They can’t tell the difference between a stranger trying to take over their ruler’s throne and the ruler they actually chose. In this confusion, people end up fighting each other without knowing who their real enemies are, all because of someone else’s ambition.

Because the Church is seen as God’s kingdom, the leaders like pastors and deacons call themselves the clergy. They call the rest of the Christians the laity, which just means regular people. The word “clergy” comes from when God gave the tribe of Levi special land and money to support them as His ministers during the time of the Israelites. The Pope acts like the Church now is God’s kingdom, so he and his ministers claim money and land just like the Levites did. That’s why church leaders have been collecting tithes and other payments from Christians for a long time, saying it’s God’s right.

Because of this, people have to pay taxes twice: once to the government and once to the church. The church’s tax, which is one-tenth of what people earn, is actually double what a king of Athens (who was called a tyrant) demanded from his people to pay for everything. The Jewish priests used to get all the public money through tithes and offerings when God was their ruler.

Because people wrongly think the Church is God’s kingdom now, there is a split between civil law and canon law. Civil law is made by rulers in their own countries, while canon law is made by the Pope in those same countries. At first, these church rules were just suggestions and Christian rulers could choose whether to follow them. But after the empire was given to Charlemagne, the Pope’s power grew a lot. Eventually, these church rules became official laws, and even emperors had to accept them to avoid bigger problems that might happen if the people were confused.
