Sometimes, the exact words of a law might seem confusing or unfair. But the goal is to understand what the law really means. No problem with the words can make a judge go against the law itself. Judges don’t just decide what’s comfortable or uncomfortable for society.

A good judge needs different skills than a lawyer. A judge should only listen to witnesses to find out what happened. They should only learn about the law from official laws or from people who have the power to explain the law. Judges don’t need to decide what to say before hearing the facts. Witnesses tell them what happened, and lawyers explain the law during the case.

In England, the Lords of Parliament were judges who handled hard cases. Most of them didn’t study law deeply or work as lawyers, but they still had the power to make decisions. They could ask lawyers for advice, but only they could give the final judgment. Also, in regular court cases, twelve ordinary people act as judges. They decide not just what happened, but also what is right or wrong. In criminal cases, they decide if someone did a crime and what kind of crime it was. Since they usually don’t know the law well, a legal expert helps explain it to them. But if the twelve don’t follow that advice, they usually aren’t punished unless it’s proven they ignored their conscience or took bribes.

What makes a good judge is first having a clear understanding of fairness, which is called equity. This isn’t about reading other people’s ideas, but about using your own natural reason and careful thinking. People who have more time and interest to think about this are usually better at it.
