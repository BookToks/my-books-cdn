Peter, or St. Peter, is said to give authority to the Popes. St. Peter and all other church leaders are told to treat Christians who disobey the Church, meaning those who disobey their Christian ruler, like non-believers or tax collectors. Since people don’t accept the Pope’s power over non-Christian rulers, they shouldn’t accept it over those seen as non-believers.

But from the Pope’s power to teach, some say he also has the right to force kings to obey. The pastor must give his people proper guidance, so the Pope can and should make kings do their duty. This means the Pope, as the leader of Christians, is the king of all kings. All Christian kings should either accept this or take full control of their own church in their lands.

His last argument is based on examples. But I say, first, examples don’t prove anything; second, the examples he uses don’t even suggest he’s right. The story of Jehoiada killing Athaliah was either done with King Joash’s permission or it was a terrible crime by the high priest, who was just a subject after King Saul was chosen. The story of St. Ambrose punishing Emperor Theodosius, if true, was a serious crime. And for the Popes Gregory I, Gregory II, Zachary, and Leo III, their decisions don’t count because they judged their own cases. The things they did following this idea are some of the worst mistakes people can make, especially Zachary’s. So, that’s enough about church power. I would have been shorter if these arguments were just from Bellarmine as a private person, not as the main defender of the Pope’s power against all Christian rulers.

XLIII: What a Person Needs to Enter Heaven

The biggest cause of rebellion and civil war in Christian countries has long come from the problem of having to obey both God and human rulers when their orders conflict. It’s clear that when someone gets two opposite commands and knows one is from God, they should obey God and not the other, even if it’s from their lawful ruler or their father. The problem is that people don’t always know when a command said to be from God really is from God, or if someone is just using God’s name for their own selfish reasons.
