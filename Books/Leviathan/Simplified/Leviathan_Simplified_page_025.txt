Leviathan/25 Sometimes people put together two names that mean opposite or mixed-up things, like calling something an incorporeal body or incorporeal substance. When this happens, the phrase doesn’t really mean anything. For example, saying a square is round is false, so “round square” means nothing—it's just a sound. The same goes for saying virtue can be poured or blown; “poured virtue” or “blown virtue” don’t make sense either. You’ll often find silly or meaningless words made from Latin or Greek. For example, French people don’t usually call Jesus “Parole,” but they do say “Verbe,” which is just the Latin word “Verbum” in French.

When someone hears words and thinks the exact ideas the words are meant to show, we say they understand it. Understanding is just the idea caused by words. If speech is only for humans (which might be true), then understanding is only for humans too. So, when people hear false or silly statements, they usually don’t really understand them—they just repeat the words quietly or memorize them.

I will talk about what kinds of speech show our feelings, like wants, dislikes, and emotions, after I explain about passions.

Names of things that affect us—things that make us happy or unhappy—can mean different things to different people because not everyone feels the same way about the same thing, and even one person can feel differently at different times. Since all names are made to show our ideas, and all our feelings are ideas, when we think about the same thing in different ways, we often use different names for it. Even if something is the same, how we feel about it changes because of our body and opinions, so it gets a different “color” from our feelings. This means when arguing, people need to be careful with words. Words don’t just show what we think something is, but also show what the speaker feels, believes, or wants. For example, one person might call wisdom “fear,” or call cruelty “justice,” or call being wasteful “brave,” and what one calls serious, another might call stupid.
