The way food and resources are shared is what makes up what belongs to me, you, and him; this is called ownership. In any kind of government, ownership belongs to the person or group in charge. 

If there is no government, like we saw before, everyone is always fighting each other. So, everything belongs to whoever takes it and keeps it by force. This is not real ownership or sharing, but just chaos. Even Cicero, who really liked freedom, said that all ownership depends on laws. He said if laws are ignored or weak, no one can be sure what belongs to them or what they can leave to their kids.

Because ownership comes from the government, only the leader or ruling group can decide laws about it. Long ago, people called these laws "Nomos," meaning distribution, and they said justice means giving each person what is theirs.

The first law about sharing is how land is divided. The leader decides who gets what land, not regular people, based on what is fair and good for everyone. The Israelites were a community in the desert but didn’t have land until they took over the Promised Land. Then, a priest and a leader divided the land into parts for the twelve tribes. One tribe, Levi, didn’t get land but was given a tenth of all the crops. This way of dividing was decided by the leaders.

Sometimes, when people take land by war, they don’t always kill the old owners. They might let them keep their land, but only because the new rulers allow it. Like in England, where people kept their land after William the Conqueror took over.

So, when a person owns land, they have the right to keep others from using it, but they cannot stop the ruler or government from using it if needed.
