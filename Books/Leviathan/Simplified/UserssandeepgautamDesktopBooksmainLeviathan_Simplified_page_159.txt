The difference between giving advice and giving orders comes from what advice really is. Advice is about figuring out the good or bad things that might happen to the person being advised, based on what will probably result from the action suggested. The difference between good and bad advisers comes from this too.

Experience is just remembering what happened before in similar situations, and advice is sharing that experience with someone else. So, good and bad advice depends on how smart and clear the advice is. For a country, its advisers are like its memory and thinking. But unlike a person, who learns from things that happen naturally without any hidden motives, advisers to a country often have their own goals and feelings, which can make their advice untrustworthy.

So, the first rule for a good adviser is that their goals should not clash with the goals of the person they are advising.

Second, when someone is thinking about what to do, the adviserâ€™s job is to clearly show the results of each choice so the person can understand the truth easily. The advice should be clear, logical, and use the right words without being too long. Bad advice comes from jumping to quick conclusions, using only examples or book quotes instead of real reasons, being confusing or unclear, or using emotional language to trick or push someone toward a different goal. This kind of speech is not what a good adviser should do.

Third, giving good advice comes from experience and careful thinking. No one knows everything about running a big country, so a person can only be a good adviser in things they have studied and thought about a lot.
