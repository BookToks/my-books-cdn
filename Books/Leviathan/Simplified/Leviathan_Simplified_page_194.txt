Imprisonment is when someone is locked up by the government and loses their freedom. This can happen for two main reasons: one is to keep a person safe while they are waiting to find out if they did something wrong, and the other is to punish someone who has been found guilty. The first reason is not punishment because no one should be punished before a fair trial. So, any extra harm done to a person before their trial is against natural law. The second reason is punishment because it causes pain and is done by the government after a person is found guilty. Imprisonment means any kind of stopping someone from moving freely, whether they are locked in a prison, kept on an island, made to work in a hard place, or tied up with chains.

Exile, or banishment, is when someone is forced to leave their country or a part of it because of a crime, either for a set time or forever. By itself, exile doesn’t seem like a punishment but more like a chance to escape or a rule to avoid punishment by running away. The Roman thinker Cicero said exile was never really a punishment in Rome but a safe place for people in danger.

If a banished person can still keep their property and money, then just being in a new place is not a punishment. It doesn’t help the country get better by stopping bad behavior, and sometimes it even harms the country. A banished person becomes an enemy of their country because they are no longer part of it. But if they also lose their property or money, then that loss is the real punishment, not the exile itself.

It is against natural law to punish anyone who is innocent, no matter how big or small the punishment is. Punishment should only happen when someone breaks the law, so innocent people should never be punished. Also, people should only punish others if it will lead to some good in the future, but punishing innocent people never helps the country.
