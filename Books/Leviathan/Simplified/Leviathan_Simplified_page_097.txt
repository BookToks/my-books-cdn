Even though understanding the laws of nature might seem too complicated for most people—because many are too busy just trying to get food, and others don’t bother to learn—they are actually summed up in a simple rule anyone can understand: Don’t do to others what you wouldn’t want done to yourself. This means that when you think about how others act, you should imagine swapping places with them, so your own feelings and selfishness don’t make things seem worse than they really are. Then, the laws of nature will seem fair and reasonable.

These laws mainly affect what we want to do inside ourselves, but they don’t always force us to act a certain way in the outside world. For example, if someone is always honest and kind when others aren’t, they might just get taken advantage of and end up in trouble. But if someone breaks these laws when they know others will follow them, they’re not trying to keep peace—they’re causing problems that could hurt everyone.

Also, the laws can be broken not just by doing something wrong, but also by doing something right if the person’s intention is bad. So even if an action follows the law, if the person means to go against it, they are still breaking the law inside.

The laws of nature never change and will always be true. Things like injustice, pride, and unfairness can never become okay, because war can’t protect life, and peace can’t destroy it.

These laws only require people to truly try to follow them, which makes them easy to keep. If you honestly try to follow the laws, you are doing what is right.

Learning about these laws is the real meaning of moral philosophy, which is about understanding what is good and bad in how people live together. What is good or bad depends on what people want or dislike, which can change based on different cultures and opinions. People don’t just disagree about what tastes or smells good, but also about what is reasonable or not in how we act every day.
