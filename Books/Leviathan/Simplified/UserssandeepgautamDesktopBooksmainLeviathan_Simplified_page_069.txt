Religion started from four main ideas: believing in ghosts, not understanding why things happen, being devoted to things people fear, and thinking random events can predict the future. Because people have different imaginations, opinions, and feelings, these ideas grew into many different ceremonies. What one person finds normal, another might think is silly.

These ideas were shaped by two kinds of people. One group made up their own rules and ceremonies. The other followed what they believed was God’s instructions. Both groups wanted to help people obey laws, live peacefully, be kind, and get along in society. The first kind of religion is part of human politics and teaches what earthly rulers expect from their people. The second kind is about God’s rules for those who follow Him. Leaders of countries made the first kind, while Abraham, Moses, and Jesus gave us the second kind.

When it comes to beliefs about invisible powers, almost everything had a name and was worshiped as a god or demon somewhere. Poets also imagined many spirits living in or controlling things.

The unshaped stuff of the world was called Chaos and thought of as a god.

The sky, ocean, planets, fire, earth, and winds were all seen as gods.

People worshiped men, women, animals like birds, crocodiles, calves, dogs, snakes, and even plants like onions and leeks. They also believed many places were full of spirits: plains had Pan and Satyrs, woods had Fauns and Nymphs, the sea had Tritons and Nymphs, rivers and fountains had their own ghosts, every home had spirits called Lares, every person had a spirit called a Genius, and the underworld had ghosts and creatures like Charon, Cerberus, and the Furies. At night, people thought ghosts, fairies, and scary creatures were everywhere. They even prayed to ideas like time, night, day, peace, love, honor, health, rust, fever, and more, treating them like spirits who could help or harm them.
