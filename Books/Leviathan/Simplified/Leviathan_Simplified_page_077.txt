Because people don’t trust each other, the best way for someone to stay safe is to get control over as many people as possible, either by force or tricks, until no one is strong enough to threaten them. This is just about protecting themselves, and most people agree it’s okay. Also, some people enjoy showing off their power by conquering others, going beyond what they need just to feel safe. If these people didn’t try to take over others, those who just want peace wouldn’t be able to stay safe for long by only defending themselves. So, gaining more control over others is necessary for survival and should be allowed.

People don’t like being around others if no one is strong enough to keep everyone in check. Everyone wants others to respect them as much as they respect themselves. If someone feels disrespected, they try to get back at those who look down on them, as much as they can. When there’s no common power to keep things peaceful, this usually leads to people hurting each other.

So, human nature has three main reasons for fighting. First, competition; second, fear or distrust; third, wanting a good reputation.

The first makes people fight to get things like money or property; the second makes them fight to protect themselves; the third makes them fight over small things like words, looks, opinions, or insults, whether to themselves or their family, friends, country, job, or name.

Because of this, it’s clear that when people live without a common power to scare or control them all, they are in a state of war—where everyone is against everyone else. War isn’t just fighting battles. It’s a period of time when people are ready and willing to fight. So, war is more like bad weather: it’s not just a few rain showers but many days of rain. War is not just about fighting but about the ongoing threat of fighting until people feel safe again.
