Finally, we read that David made Hashabiah and his brothers, the Hebronites, leaders in Israel on the west side, “in all matters of the Lord, and in serving the king.” He also made other Hebronites “rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh” (these were the people living beyond the Jordan River) “for everything related to God and the king.” This shows they had full power over both religious and government matters.

To sum up: from the start of God’s kingdom until the Captivity, religion and government were controlled by the same people. The priests’ job, after Saul became king, was not to rule but to serve.

Even though government and religion were joined first in the high priests and then in the kings, the people did not really understand this. Many people only believed in God and the priests when they saw big miracles or when their leaders were strong and successful. When they didn’t like their leaders, they would blame either the government or religion and try to change or rebel whenever they wanted. This caused many problems and fights in the nation.

For example, after Eleazar and Joshua died, the new generation didn’t see God’s miracles and only trusted their own weak thinking. They stopped following the priests’ commands and Moses’ laws and did whatever they thought was right. They listened to leaders who could help them fight their enemies but didn’t ask God for help like they should have. They also believed some men or women were prophets because they could predict things. Even though they had idols in their places of worship, if they had a Levite priest, they thought they were worshiping the God of Israel.

Later, when they asked for a king like other nations, it wasn’t because they wanted to stop worshiping God as their King. They just lost trust in Samuel’s sons to be fair judges and wanted a king to handle civil matters. But they did not want their king to change the religion Moses gave them.
