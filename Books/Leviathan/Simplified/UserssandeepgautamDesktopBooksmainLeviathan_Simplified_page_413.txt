Over time, pastors started wanting to make new Christians happy and liked the idea of being honored, even after they died, just like those who were already honored. Because of this, people began to worship images of Christ and his Apostles more and more, which became like idol worship. After Constantine’s time, some emperors, bishops, and church meetings noticed this was wrong and tried to stop it, but their efforts were either too late or too weak.

Making saints official, called canonizing, comes from old Roman traditions, not from misunderstanding the Bible or being a new thing by the Roman Church. The first person made a saint in Rome was Romulus. Julius Proculus told the Senate he talked with Romulus after Romulus had died and that Romulus was living in heaven under the name Quirinus and would protect the city. So, the Senate officially recognized him as a saint.

Julius Caesar and other emperors were also made saints this way. This kind of recognition is what we now call canonization and is similar to how the ancient pagans honored their heroes.

The popes got the title and power of Pontifex Maximus from the Roman pagans. In ancient Rome, this was the top religious leader who controlled all religious ceremonies and laws under the Senate and people. When Augustus Caesar changed Rome into a monarchy, he took this role and the power over the people, and later emperors had the same power. When Emperor Constantine, the first to support Christianity openly, ruled, he let the bishop of Rome control religion under his authority. At first, these bishops didn’t call themselves Pontifex Maximus, but later popes used the name to show their power over other bishops.

This power wasn’t because of St. Peter but because Rome itself was important, and emperors supported the bishop of Rome having authority over other bishops. When the Emperor moved the capital to Constantinople, the bishop there said he was equal to the bishop of Rome. After some fights, the Pope won and became Pontifex Maximus, but only because of the Emperor’s power. When the Emperor lost power in Rome, the Pope’s power also became limited, even if the Pope claimed it came from himself.
