What do these words mean: “The first cause does not have to force anything into the second, because the second causes are naturally below the first, and can still help it work”? This is the title of the sixth chapter in Suarez’s first book, called *Of the Concourse, Motion, and Help of God*. When people write long books like this, aren’t they crazy, or just trying to confuse others? Especially about transubstantiation; after some words are said, they claim that things like whiteness, roundness, size, quality, and changeability, which are not physical, leave the wafer and enter the body of Jesus. Don’t they make these “nesses,” “tudes,” and “ties” sound like spirits inside his body? They mean spirits as invisible things that can move from one place to another. This kind of idea is clearly crazy, and all the times they stop arguing or writing like this are just moments of clear thinking. That’s what I think about smart ideas and mistakes.

There are two kinds of knowledge. One is knowing facts, and the other is knowing how one statement follows from another. The first is just using your senses and memory, and it’s absolute knowledge – like when you see something happen or remember it happening. This kind of knowledge is what a witness needs. The second kind is called science, and it depends on conditions – like when you know that if a shape is a circle, then any straight line through its center will split it into two equal parts. This is the knowledge a philosopher needs, someone who reasons.

The record of knowledge about facts is called history, which has two types. One is natural history, which is about things in nature that don’t depend on people’s choices, like metals, plants, animals, and places. The other is civil history, which is about people’s voluntary actions in societies.

Books that explain how one statement leads to another are called books of philosophy. There are many kinds, depending on the topic, and I have divided them in the table below.
