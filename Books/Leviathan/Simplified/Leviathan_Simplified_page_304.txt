St. John the Baptist used this special ritual when people decided to follow Christ, who he said was already in the world. Our Savior also set up this ritual as a special ceremony for everyone who believed in Him.

The Bible doesn’t clearly say why baptism started, but it might be based on a rule from Moses about people with leprosy. Those sick people had to stay outside the Israelite camp for a while. After they were healed and checked by a priest, they had to wash before coming back. Baptism is kind of like that washing, but for people who are cleaned from their sins by faith and then welcomed into the Church.

Some people think it might come from a tradition among the Gentiles. If someone thought to be dead suddenly woke up, others didn’t want to be close to them, like they were ghosts, until they were washed and accepted back. Also, babies were washed to clean them when they were born, which was like a new start. This Greek custom might have influenced the Jews when they were under Greek rule. But since Jesus wouldn’t support a non-Jewish tradition, it’s more likely baptism comes from the washing rule after leprosy.

Another important ceremony is eating the Paschal Lamb, which is clearly connected to the Lord’s Supper. In the Lord’s Supper, breaking bread and pouring wine help us remember how Christ saved us from sin, just like the Jews remembered being saved from Egypt by eating the lamb.

Since Moses’ authority was only temporary and he was like God’s helper, Jesus’ authority as a man was also under God the Father. Jesus showed this when He taught us to pray saying, “Our Father, let your kingdom come,” and “For yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory.” It also says Jesus will come in His Father’s glory, and St. Paul says that in the end, Jesus will give the kingdom back to God the Father.

So, Jesus, both in teaching and ruling, shows God’s presence, just like Moses did. From that time on, God is called the Father. God is one being but is shown as one person by Moses and another person by Jesus, His Son.
