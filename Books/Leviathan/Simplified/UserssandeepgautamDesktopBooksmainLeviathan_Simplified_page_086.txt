Promises made because of fear, in a natural situation, must be kept. For example, if I promise to pay money or work to save my life from an enemy, I have to do it. This is a deal where one person saves their life, and the other gets money or work. If no other rule says not to do it, the promise is valid. So, prisoners of war who are trusted to pay their ransom have to pay it. Also, if a weaker leader makes a bad peace deal with a stronger one because they are scared, they must keep it—unless something new and fair happens that makes the war start again.

Even in countries with laws, if I am forced to pay a thief to get myself back, I have to pay until the law says I don’t have to. Because what I can legally do freely, I can also legally promise to do even if I am scared. And if I legally promise something, I can’t break that promise.

If I make one promise first, a later promise that goes against it is not valid. For example, if I give my right to one person now, I can’t give that same right to someone else later. So, the later promise doesn’t count.

A promise to not defend myself when someone uses force against me is never valid. No one can give up their right to protect themselves from death, injury, or being captured because protecting yourself is the main reason for any deal. So, promising not to fight back doesn’t actually give up any rights and isn’t binding. People naturally choose the lesser danger—fighting back and risking harm rather than accepting certain death. Everyone agrees with this because criminals are taken to punishment by armed guards, even if the criminals agreed to the laws.

A promise to admit to something wrong without being sure of forgiveness is also not valid. In nature, where everyone judges themselves, there is no need for accusations. In a society, accusations lead to punishment, which is force, and people don’t have to accept that without fighting it. This is also true if the accusation comes from someone who would hurt you, like a father, wife, or helper. If someone’s testimony is not given willingly, it is assumed to be unfair and should not be trusted. And if someone’s testimony isn’t trusted, they don’t have to give it.
