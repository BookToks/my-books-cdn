Tenthly, the church leaders get rich because of beliefs like purgatory, doing good works to be saved, and selling indulgences.

Eleventhly, by talking about demons, using exorcisms, and other related things, they make people more scared of their power.

Lastly, the complicated ideas of Aristotle, and the confusing words and ideas taught by scholars in universities (all controlled by the Pope), help them hide these mistakes. They make people think that useless philosophy is actually the true message of the Bible.

If that’s not enough, they have other secret teachings that clearly help them take control over kings and rulers, or keep that control once they have it. These teachings also bring money, respect, and power to those who support this control. So, it’s fair to say that the Pope, the Roman church leaders, and others who want people to believe that the church on earth is God’s kingdom are the ones causing all this spiritual darkness.

But the emperors and rulers who let these wrong ideas and the church’s power grow in their lands, even though they didn’t see the problems coming, can also be blamed. Without their permission, these dangerous ideas couldn’t have been spread at first. They could have stopped it early on, but once the people were caught up in these church teachings, no human solution could fix it. 

For the solutions that God will provide—He never fails to stop people’s plans against the truth—we just have to wait. Sometimes God allows bad people to succeed for a while, so that their pride and power become so obvious that people finally see the truth. Trying to fight the church’s power too soon only made it stronger, just like Peter’s fishing net broke because too many fish struggled in it at once.
