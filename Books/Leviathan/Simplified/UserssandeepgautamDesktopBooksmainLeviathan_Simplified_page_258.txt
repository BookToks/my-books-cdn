The phrase "words of this life" means the teachings of the Gospel. You can see this from what they did in the Temple, and it is clear in the last verse of the same chapter: “Daily in the Temple, and in every house, they never stopped teaching and preaching about Jesus Christ.” This shows that Jesus Christ was the main topic of this “word of life” or the “words of this eternal life” that our Savior gave them.

So, the word of God is called the word of the Gospel because it contains the teachings about the kingdom of Christ. The same word is also called the word of faith, which means the teaching about Christ who came and rose from the dead. Also, when someone hears the word of the kingdom, it means they hear the teaching about the kingdom that Christ taught. The word is said to “grow and multiply,” which is easy to understand when talking about the Gospel teaching, but harder to understand if we mean God’s voice or speech. Similarly, the “doctrine of devils” doesn’t mean words from actual devils, but false teachings from people who worship demons and false gods.

Looking at these two meanings of the word of God in the Bible, it’s clear that in the second meaning (the teachings of the Christian religion), the whole Bible is the word of God. But in the first meaning (words God actually spoke), it's not always true. For example, the words “I am the Lord thy God,” and the Ten Commandments were spoken by God to Moses. But the phrase “God spoke these words and said” is from the person who wrote the holy history. The word of God, meaning what He has spoken, can be understood in two ways. Literally, it means the words He spoke to His prophets. Figuratively, it means His wisdom, power, and plan in creating the world. In this figurative sense, the commands like “Let there be light,” “Let there be a sky,” and “Let us make man” from Genesis 1 are the word of God.

In the same way, the Bible says, “All things were made by it, and without it nothing was made that was made,” and “He holds everything up by the word of His power.” This means God’s power, shown through His word, keeps everything going. It also says, “The worlds were created by the word of God,” and many other places say similar things. Even in Latin, the word for fate, which means the word spoken, is used in this way.
