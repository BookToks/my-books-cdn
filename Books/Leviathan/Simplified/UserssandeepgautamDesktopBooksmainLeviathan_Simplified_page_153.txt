When we talk about the sovereign, which means the Commonwealth (and the person who represents it), we understand that they only act to keep peace and safety for everyone. So, when land is divided, it should be done to help keep that peace and safety. If the sovereign divides land in a way that hurts this goal, it goes against what every person who trusts the sovereign wants. That’s why such divisions should be considered invalid.

It is true that a king or most of a ruling group might sometimes do things based on their own feelings, even if it’s wrong and breaks trust. But this doesn’t mean people have the right to fight against or accuse their ruler of being unfair, or even speak badly about them. This is because people have given their ruler the power and accept their decisions. However, there are some cases when the ruler’s commands go against fairness and natural law, and those will be talked about later.

When it comes to dividing land, the Commonwealth itself can be thought of as owning some land, which is managed by the ruler. This land should be enough to cover the costs needed for peace and defense. This would be true if the ruler was free from personal faults. But since people are not perfect, setting aside public land or money for the Commonwealth often fails and can lead to the government falling apart and chaos starting, especially if the ruler or ruling group is careless with money or spends too much on long wars.

Commonwealths can’t survive on a fixed budget because their costs depend on unpredictable events and what other countries do. So, the public money can only be limited by what emergencies need.

In England, after the Conqueror took over, he kept some lands and services for himself, like forests and hunting areas. These were not for running the country but for his personal use. Even so, he and later rulers still made people pay extra taxes on their land when they thought it was needed. If those public lands and services were meant to fully support the Commonwealth, it didn’t work out that way. The extra taxes show that the lands weren’t enough, and the Crown’s small income proves that the land could be lost or reduced over time.
