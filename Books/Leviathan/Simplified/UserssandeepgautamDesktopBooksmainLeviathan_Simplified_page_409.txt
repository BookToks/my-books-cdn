The Gentiles worshipped gods like Jupiter and others who were once human, maybe people who did great and famous things. They also thought some men and women were special, somewhere between a god and a normal person. This was idolatry because they made these ideas up themselves, without any permission from God or His laws.

Even though Jesus was a man, we believe He is God and the Son of God. This is not idolatry because our belief is based on what God revealed in the Bible, not just our own ideas.

When it comes to worshipping the Eucharist, if Jesus’ words, “This is my body,” mean that the bread really becomes His body, then it is not idolatry because Jesus Himself approved it. But if this is not true, and the worship is just something made up by people, then it is idolatry. Saying God can change bread into Jesus’ body is not enough, because even the Gentiles believed God was all-powerful and could change their statues into gods too.

Some people say divine inspiration means the Holy Spirit enters a person supernaturally, not just learning and studying to gain God’s grace. I think this is a tricky problem. If they don’t worship the inspired people, they might seem disrespectful to God’s presence. But if they do worship them, that is idolatry, because even the Apostles never allowed that.

The safest belief is that when the Holy Spirit came down on the Apostles, it was a sign from God to help them learn, teach, and live in a way that helps others, not to be worshipped themselves.
