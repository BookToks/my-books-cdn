You can’t use these Bible verses or any others to say that the Pope’s decisions count as laws unless he also has control over the government.

The last thing he wants to prove is that Jesus gave church authority directly only to the Pope.

Here, he’s not talking about whether the Pope is more powerful than Christian kings, but about the Pope compared to other bishops. First, he agrees that bishops have authority from God in general. He uses a verse from St. Paul in Ephesians 4:11, where Paul says that after Jesus went to heaven, he gave gifts to people like apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. From this, he says these leaders do have authority from God, but not directly—they get it through the Pope.

But if someone can have authority from God but not directly, then what kind of legal power, even if just civil, doesn’t come from God in a Christian country? Christian kings get their government power directly from God, and the officials under them do their jobs because God gave them the right. So what they do is just as much from God as what bishops do because the Pope gave them their power. All legal power comes from God—directly to the highest ruler, and indirectly to those under him. So either you have to say that every police officer holds their job by God’s right, or you can’t say that any bishop holds their power except the Pope.

But this whole argument about whether Jesus only gave authority to the Pope or also to other bishops doesn’t really matter if the Pope doesn’t have control over the government. Because without being the ruler, the Pope or any bishop doesn’t have real authority. Authority means the power to hear and decide disputes between people, and only the person who can make laws and enforce them with justice can do that. This is the job of the government leader.

So when he points to Luke 6, where Jesus picked twelve disciples and called them Apostles, he’s showing that Jesus chose them (except Matthias, Paul, and Barnabas) and gave them power to teach, but not to judge people’s disputes. Jesus refused to be a judge among them, saying, “Who made me a judge or divider among you?”
