The phrase "words of this life" means the teachings of the Gospel. You can see this by what they did in the Temple, and it’s clear in the last verse of the same chapter: “Daily in the Temple, and in every house, they kept teaching and preaching about Jesus Christ.” This shows that Jesus Christ was the main subject of these “words of life” or “words of eternal life” that our Savior shared with them.

The word of God is called the word of the Gospel because it contains the teachings about the kingdom of Christ. It is also called the word of faith, as explained in Romans 10:8-9, which means the teaching about Christ who came and rose from the dead. When someone hears the “word of the kingdom” (Matthew 13:19), it means they are hearing the teachings about the kingdom taught by Christ. The same word is said to “grow and multiply” (Acts 12:24), which makes sense if it means the Gospel message, but would be strange if it just meant God’s voice or speech. Similarly, the “doctrine of devils” (I Timothy 4:1) doesn’t mean words spoken by devils, but the false teachings from pagan people about demons and false gods.

There are two ways the phrase "word of God" is used in the Bible. The first is the teachings of the Christian religion, and in this sense, the whole Bible is the word of God. The second meaning is the actual words God spoke. For example, the Ten Commandments were spoken by God to Moses, but the introduction, “God spoke these words and said,” is understood as words written by the person recording the story. 

The word of God, when it means the words God spoke, can be used in two ways: literally, as the words God gave to His prophets; and figuratively, meaning God’s wisdom, power, and plan in creating the world. In this figurative sense, commands like “Let there be light,” “Let there be a firmament,” and “Let us make man” (Genesis 1) are called the word of God. In the same way, the Bible says, “All things were made by it, and without it nothing was made” (John 1:3), and “He holds everything together by the word of His power” (Hebrews 1:3). This means God’s power, shown through His word, created and keeps everything in the world. It also says, “The worlds were formed by the word of God” (Hebrews 11:3), and many other verses use the word of God this way. Even in Latin, the word for fate originally meant a spoken word, showing this idea too.
