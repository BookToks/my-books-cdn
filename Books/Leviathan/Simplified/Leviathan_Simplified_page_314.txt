People don’t have the power to forgive or keep sins away just by saying words, like God can, because only God truly knows what’s in a person’s heart and if they really feel sorry and want to change. Forgiveness or being cleared of sin only works if the person is truly sorry. If someone pretends to be sorry but isn’t, then the forgiveness means nothing and actually makes their sin worse.

So, the Apostles and the people who follow them are supposed to look for signs that someone is truly sorry. If those signs are there, they can’t refuse to forgive. But if the signs aren’t there, they can’t forgive either. The same goes for baptism: the Apostles couldn’t refuse baptism to someone who was truly changed, and they couldn’t give it to someone who wasn’t sorry or ready.

Since no one can really know for sure if someone is truly sorry, they have to judge by what they see and hear—words and actions—which can be faked. This brings up the question: who gets to decide if those signs are real? Jesus answers this by saying if your brother does something wrong, first talk to him alone. If he listens, you’ve helped him. If not, take one or two others with you. If he still won’t listen, tell the Church. If he refuses the Church, treat him like a stranger. This shows that deciding if someone is truly sorry isn’t up to just one person but to the whole Church or those who represent it.

Besides deciding, someone also has to give the official decision. This job belongs to the Apostle or a Church leader, who acts like a spokesperson. Jesus said, “Whatever you forbid on earth will be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you allow on earth will be allowed in heaven.” This matches what St. Paul did when he said, “Even though I’m not there, I have decided that this person should be removed from the Church,” meaning they aren’t forgiven. Paul made the decision, but the Church had to hear the case and agree first because Paul was not there.
