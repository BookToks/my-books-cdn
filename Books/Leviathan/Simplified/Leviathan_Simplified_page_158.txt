It’s clear that when someone gives advice mainly to help themselves, they often push their own ideas strongly or give advice even when it’s not asked for. This kind of advice is mostly for their own benefit and only sometimes helps the person being advised, or maybe not at all.

Second, telling people what to do or not do mostly works when speaking to a big group. If you talk to just one person, they can ask questions and challenge you more easily. But with a large group, it’s harder to have a back-and-forth conversation with everyone at once.

Third, people who give advice with strong opinions when asked for help might be biased because they want something for themselves. Even if their advice is good, they aren’t really good advisers, just like a judge who only rules fairly when paid isn’t a fair judge. But when someone has the right to give orders, like a dad in his family or a leader in an army, their strong advice or warnings are okay and even important. In these cases, what sounds like advice is actually a command, and sometimes commands have to be said nicely to make hard tasks easier to accept.

We can look at examples from the Bible to see the difference between commands and advice. Commands are like, “Don’t have other gods,” “Don’t make idols,” “Don’t take God’s name in vain,” “Keep the Sabbath holy,” “Honor your parents,” “Don’t kill,” and “Don’t steal.” These are commands because we obey them because God wants us to. But advice is like, “Sell everything you have, give to the poor, and follow me.” This is advice because doing it helps us personally by giving us “treasure in Heaven.” Another example: “Go to the village and bring me the donkey” is a command because it comes from the master’s will. But “Repent and be baptized in Jesus’ name” is advice because it helps us avoid punishment for our sins, not because God needs it.
