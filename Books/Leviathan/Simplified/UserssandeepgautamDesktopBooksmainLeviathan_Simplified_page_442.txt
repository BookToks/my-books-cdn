Sometimes people think that anyone can kill someone else if they feel very strongly about it, like acting on their own passion or anger. But this idea is wrong. Back in the days of God’s kingdom, people only punished others when the ruler or an official gave the order, not just because someone felt like it.

For example, when the Levites killed three thousand people who made a golden calf to worship, they did it because Moses told them to, following God’s command (Exodus 32:27). Another time, when a man blasphemed God, the people didn’t kill him right away. They took him to Moses and waited for God’s judgment (Leviticus 24:11-12).

Also, when Phinehas killed Zimri and Cozbi, he wasn’t acting on his own feelings. Their crime happened in front of everyone, and the law was clear. Phinehas was next in line to lead, and his action was later approved by Moses, which made it lawful (Numbers 25:6-7). Sometimes, in emergencies like a sudden rebellion, someone might stop it on their own and get permission later to keep the peace.

The law says that if someone kills a murderer, it must be done based on witnesses and a proper court decision, not just personal anger (Numbers 35:30). When someone tries to lead others to worship false gods, the law says they must be reported and punished only after a fair trial, not just killed on the spot (Deuteronomy 13:8). The process is clear: people must investigate carefully, and if the person is guilty, the witnesses are the first to carry out the punishment (Deuteronomy 17:4-6). This shows it’s about public judgment, not private revenge.

Similarly, if a son disobeys his father badly, the father must bring him to the town judges, and the people will decide if he should be punished (like being stoned). This is how justice was meant to work, with rules and not just personal anger.
