Ministers of Christ are people who teach God’s word. But deacons have a different job, called “serving of tables.” This means they help the church by doing practical tasks. So, no single person or the whole church could say a pastor was their minister, but the whole church could call a deacon their minister because deacons help with many things like serving food, taking care of church money, or looking after the church building.

Deacons serve the church, but sometimes they also preach God’s message and teach about Christ, depending on their abilities, like St. Stephen did. Some deacons even baptized people, like Philip, who preached in Samaria and baptized a man called the eunuch. Philip was a deacon, not an apostle.

When Philip preached in Samaria, the apostles were still in Jerusalem. When they heard that people in Samaria believed God’s word, they sent Peter and John to them. Peter and John laid hands on the new believers, and they received the Holy Spirit. This showed that baptism needed to be confirmed by a minister who teaches God’s word, not just by a church servant like a deacon.

That’s why Peter and John came to confirm the baptism that Philip had done. They gave the new believers the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which showed they truly believed. St. Mark said these signs would happen to believers: they would cast out demons, speak new languages, handle snakes safely, drink poison without harm, and heal sick people by laying their hands on them.

Philip couldn’t give these gifts, but the apostles could. This proves that only true ministers of Christ can give these special powers when someone is baptized. If ministers today can’t do this, it means either there are very few true believers or very few real ministers of Christ.

The first deacons were not chosen by the apostles alone but by the whole group of disciples, meaning all kinds of Christian people. In the book of Acts, chapter 6, we read that the twelve apostles told the disciples it wasn’t right for them to stop preaching to serve tables. So, they asked the disciples to pick seven honest and wise men full of the Holy Spirit to help with this work.
