Justice means keeping promises that matter, but promises only matter when there’s a government strong enough to make people keep them. That’s also when the idea of owning things starts.

Some people say there’s no such thing as justice. They think everyone should do whatever helps themselves, so making or keeping promises isn’t always necessary if breaking them helps you. They don’t deny promises exist or that breaking them can be unfair. But they wonder if sometimes breaking promises might be okay when no one, not even God (because they don’t believe in God), can stop you and you benefit from it.

People say the kingdom of God is won by force, but what if that force is unfair? Would it be wrong to get power by unfair force if no one gets hurt? If it’s not wrong, then it’s not against justice. Some have used this idea to call bad actions good, and even people who usually dislike breaking promises have accepted it if it helps get a kingdom. 

In old stories, people believed Jupiter took over from Saturn but was still the one who punished unfairness. This is like a law saying if the rightful king is accused of treason, the crown still belongs to him. So, if a prince kills the king, even his father, some might call it unfair, but it’s not against reason because people always act to help themselves. The most reasonable actions are the ones that help people reach their goals.
