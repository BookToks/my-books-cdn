When we see things, light from those things enters our eyes either in one straight line or many lines. This light bounces off solid objects or bends when passing through clear things. Because God made our eyes to work this way, our brain creates an image of the object we’re looking at. This is called sight. It feels like the object is really there outside us, even though it’s just a picture made inside our heads. 

For example, if someone presses hard on their eye, they might see a light even though nothing is really there. Only they can see it because it’s just a reaction inside their eye. When this kind of image stays in our mind after we stop seeing the object, it’s called imagination or memory. When we dream, it’s a similar experience happening while we sleep or when we’re sick. I talked about this a bit already in earlier chapters.

People long ago didn’t understand how sight really works. Because of this, they found it hard to believe that these images in our mind weren’t real things outside us. Some thought these images had no body at all, like invisible shapes or colors without anything physical behind them. Others believed they were real but made of air or some kind of invisible, thin matter that could become solid when they wanted to be seen. Both groups called these things demons.

They acted like the dead people they dreamed about weren’t just pictures in their brains but actual spirits living in the air, heaven, or hell. This is like saying you see your own ghost in a mirror or the ghosts of stars in a river, which doesn’t make sense. They even called the sun’s image a demon or ghost, as if it were a spirit instead of just a bright object. Because of this, people were scared of these “demons,” thinking they had unlimited power to help or hurt them.

This fear gave leaders in ancient pagan societies a way to control people. They set up a system called demonology, where poets acted like priests and told stories about good and bad demons. Good demons encouraged people to follow the laws, and bad demons warned them not to break the rules. This helped keep order and made sure people obeyed the leaders.
