Stephen. (Acts, 6:9) But what good have those schools really done? What useful knowledge do people get today from their reading and arguing? The geometry we have, which is the base of all natural science, didn’t come from those schools. Plato, the best Greek philosopher, didn’t even let anyone into his school unless they already knew some geometry.

Many people studied geometry and helped humanity a lot. But there’s no talk about their schools, no group of geometricians, and they weren’t called philosophers back then. The natural philosophy from those schools was more like a dream than real science. It was explained in confusing and meaningless words, which happens when people try to teach philosophy without knowing a lot about geometry first.

Nature works through movement, and you can’t understand this without knowing about the sizes and shapes of lines and figures. Their ideas about right and wrong were just about their own feelings. The real rules for behavior come from civil government and the law of nature, which tells us what is honest, dishonest, just, unjust, good, and evil.

But those philosophers made rules about good and bad based on what they liked or didn’t like. Because everyone had different opinions, there was no agreement, and people did whatever they wanted, which messed up society.

Their logic, which should help with clear thinking, was just tricks with words to confuse others. To sum up, there is nothing so silly that old philosophers didn’t say it (Cicero, who was one of them, said this). I think nothing is more nonsense in natural philosophy than what is called Aristotle’s Metaphysics, nor more against good government than much of his Politics, nor more foolish than a big part of his Ethics.

The Jewish school was originally about learning the law of Moses, who told people to read the law aloud every seven years during the Feast of the Tabernacles so everyone could hear and learn it (Deuteronomy 31:10). So, the law readings on the Sabbath after the Captivity were meant only to help people know the Commandments they had to follow and to explain the prophets’ writings.
