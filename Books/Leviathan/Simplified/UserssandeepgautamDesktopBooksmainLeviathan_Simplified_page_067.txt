People have always been scared of things they don’t understand, like being in the dark without knowing why things happen. So, when they can’t see what causes their good or bad luck, they blame some invisible power or being. That’s probably why old poets said gods were made because of human fear. This idea about many gods is true for ancient times.

But believing in one God who is eternal, infinite, and all-powerful comes more from people wanting to understand how nature works, not just from fear of what might happen. If someone thinks deeply about what causes things to happen, and then thinks about what causes those causes, they will eventually believe in one First Mover. This First Mover is the first and eternal cause of everything, which is what people call God. This idea doesn’t come from fear of the future, which usually makes people scared and stops them from trying to understand causes. That fear is why many different gods were invented.

About what these invisible beings might be made of, people naturally thought they were like human souls. They thought souls were like dreams when we sleep or reflections in a mirror when we’re awake. Since people didn’t know these things were just made-up images from the mind, they believed they were real and called them ghosts. The Romans called these images “imagines” and “umbrae” and thought they were spirits—thin, airy bodies that appear and disappear as they want. But no one naturally thought spirits could be without a body, because even if people use words like “spirit” and “without body,” they can’t imagine what that really means.

So, people who think deeply and believe in one infinite, all-powerful God often say He is beyond their understanding instead of trying to explain Him as a “spirit without a body.” If they do use that word, it’s not to explain God clearly but to honor Him with words that show He is very different from visible, physical things.
