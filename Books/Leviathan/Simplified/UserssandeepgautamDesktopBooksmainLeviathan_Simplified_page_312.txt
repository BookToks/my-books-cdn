Jesus sent his followers to people who didn’t believe in Him. He said, “I’m sending you out like sheep among wolves,” not like sheep with other sheep.

The job they were given in the gospel didn’t give them any power over the church members.

First, the twelve Apostles were sent “to the lost sheep of Israel” and told to preach that “the kingdom of God was near.” Preaching means announcing something important, like a town crier announcing a king. But a town crier doesn’t have the power to boss people around.

The seventy Disciples were sent out as workers, not as bosses. They were told to say, “The kingdom of God is near.” Here, the kingdom means the kingdom of glory, not grace. They were even told to warn cities that didn’t welcome them that it would be worse for those cities than for Sodom. Jesus also told His followers, who wanted to be the most important, that their job was to serve others, just like He came to serve, not to be served. So, preachers don’t have ruling power but serve others. Jesus said, “Don’t call yourselves masters, because only Christ is your master.”

Another part of their job was to “teach all nations” or “go into the world and preach the gospel to everyone.” Teaching and preaching mean the same thing here. When you announce a king, you also explain why he should be followed. For example, Paul explained to the Jews in Thessalonica from the Scriptures that Jesus had to suffer, rise again, and that He is the Christ. But teaching that Jesus is the king doesn’t mean people must disobey their current rulers. Instead, it means they should wait patiently and faithfully for Christ while obeying the laws they live under.

Another part of their job was to baptize people “in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.”
