A ruler is weak if the people they rule are weak; and the people are weak if their ruler doesn’t have real power over them.

Unnecessary laws are bad laws. They are just traps to take people’s money. If the ruler’s power is accepted, these laws are not needed. If the ruler’s power is not accepted, these laws won’t protect the people enough.

Clear laws don’t depend so much on the exact words, but on explaining why the law was made. This explanation helps us understand what the lawmaker meant. When we know the reason, the law is easier to understand, even if it uses fewer words. Words can be confusing, so using too many in a law just causes more confusion. It also makes it seem like people who find loopholes in the words are outside the law’s reach. This causes many unnecessary court cases. Looking back, old laws were short, but over time they got longer. It seems like law writers and lawyers compete: writers try to limit lawyers, and lawyers try to avoid those limits. Usually, the lawyers win.

So, it is the lawmaker’s job (whether one person or a group) to clearly explain why the law exists and to keep the law itself short but clear and meaningful.

It is also the ruler’s job to punish and reward people fairly. Punishments are not for revenge or anger, but to correct the wrongdoer or to warn others. The harshest punishments should be for crimes that are very harmful to the public, like those against the government, disrespect toward justice, acts that make people angry, or crimes that seem allowed because they are done by powerful people’s family or servants. When people get angry at unfair acts, they get angry at both the wrongdoers and the rulers who protect them. For example, in ancient Rome, when the king’s son acted badly, people got so mad that they kicked out the king and ended the monarchy.

But for crimes done because of weakness—like fear, need, or not knowing the crime was serious—laws should be more forgiving when it’s safe to do so. Being kind in these cases is required by natural law.
