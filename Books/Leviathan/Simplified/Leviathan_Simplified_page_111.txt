Ninthly, the leader has the power to decide when the country should go to war or make peace with other countries. This means they decide what’s best for everyone, how many soldiers are needed, how to equip and pay them, and how to collect money from people to cover these costs. The army protects the people, and its strength comes from everyone working together under one leader. Because the leader is in charge of the army, they are the top general.

Tenthly, the leader gets to choose all the important helpers, like advisors, officials, and officers, both in times of peace and war. Since the leader is responsible for keeping peace and safety, they can pick whoever they think will do the best job.

Eleventhly, the leader has the power to reward people with money or honors and to punish them by fines, physical punishment, or shame, following the laws they have made. If there’s no law, the leader decides what will encourage people to help the country or stop them from causing trouble.

Lastly, because people naturally care a lot about themselves and how others see them, they often get jealous, fight, form groups, and sometimes even go to war, which weakens them all against outside enemies. That’s why there need to be rules about honor and a clear system to show who deserves respect for helping the country. The leader has the power to give titles and decide each person’s rank and how they should be treated in public or private.
