You have heard, he says, the Law of Moses: "You shall not kill," and that "Whoever kills will be judged by the judges," or by the group of seventy leaders. But I tell you, being angry with your brother for no reason, or calling him names like "Raca" or "Fool," is like murder and will be punished on the day of judgment by Christ and his Apostles with hellfire.

So, those words were not meant to separate different crimes, courts, or punishments. Instead, they were meant to show the difference between sins. The Jews thought about sin based on their courts, but this shows that even if someone only wants to hurt their brother, even just by insulting him, they will be punished by the same judges on Judgment Day. Thinking about this, I can’t see how this passage supports the idea of purgatory.

The sixth example is from Luke 16:9: "Make friends with the unrighteous money, so that when you fail, they may welcome you into eternal homes." This is used to prove praying to dead saints, but it actually means we should use our wealth to help the poor and get their prayers while they are still alive. "He who gives to the poor, lends to the Lord."

The seventh example is Luke 23:42: "Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom." Some say this means sins can be forgiven after death. But that’s not right. Jesus forgave the man then, and when Jesus returns in glory, he will remember to raise him to eternal life.

The eighth example is Acts 2:24, where Peter says God raised Jesus and freed him from death because death couldn’t hold him. Some say this means Jesus went down to purgatory to free souls there, but it clearly means Jesus himself was freed. It was Jesus who couldn’t be held by death, not the souls in purgatory.

If you pay attention to what Beza says in his notes, you’ll see it should say "bands" instead of "pains," and then there’s no reason to look for purgatory in this passage.
