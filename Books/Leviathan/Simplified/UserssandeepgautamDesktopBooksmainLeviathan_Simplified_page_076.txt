Nature has made people pretty equal in their body and mind. Sometimes one person might be stronger or smarter than another, but overall, the differences aren’t big enough for anyone to claim special advantages over others. Even the weakest person can kill the strongest, either by tricking them or teaming up with others who feel threatened.

When it comes to the mind, people are even more equal than in strength. Skills like science, which uses exact rules, are rare and not something we’re born with. Wisdom, or being smart from experience, is something everyone can get if they spend time learning the same things. The reason people might think they’re smarter than others is just because they see their own thoughts clearly but don’t know others’ thoughts as well. This actually shows people are about equal because usually, when everyone is happy with what they have, it means things are shared fairly.

Because people have similar abilities, they also have similar hopes to get what they want. So if two people want the same thing but only one can have it, they become enemies. They try to defeat each other to survive or sometimes just for fun. This means if someone starts a farm or builds a home, others might come with a group to take it away, along with the person's life or freedom. The attacker faces the same risks from others too.
