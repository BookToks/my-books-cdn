When he was chosen, he became a king with complete power.

Second, a king whose power is limited is not above the people or groups that limit him. If he isn’t above them, he isn’t the highest ruler, or sovereign. So, the real power was always with the group that could limit the king. This means the government wasn’t a monarchy but a democracy or aristocracy, like in ancient Sparta. There, the kings led the army, but the real power was with the Ephori, a group of leaders.

Third, before, the Roman people ruled places like Judea through a president. But Judea wasn’t a democracy because the people there had no right to be part of the government. It wasn’t an aristocracy either because no one there could be chosen by the people. They were ruled by one person. Even though Rome was a democracy, Judea was like a monarchy because the people had no say. When people are ruled by a group they choose, it’s a democracy or aristocracy. But if they’re ruled by a group they don’t choose, it’s a monarchy—not of one person over another, but one group over another.

All types of government involve people who die, both kings and groups. To keep peace, there needs to be a way to keep the government going forever, like an “artificial eternity.” Without this, people ruled by a group would go back to fighting every time leaders died, and people ruled by one person would fall apart when the ruler died. This “artificial eternity” is what we call the right of succession.

No government is perfect unless the current ruler decides who comes next. If someone else, like a private person or group, decides, they are actually under the ruler’s power and the ruler can take back the right whenever they want. If no one decides and the next ruler is chosen by a new vote, then the government falls apart. The right to rule goes to whoever can grab it, which goes against what the people who made the government wanted—they made it to last forever, not just for a short time.
