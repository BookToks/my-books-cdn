The same rules that tell people without a government what they should do and what to avoid also apply to whole countries. These rules guide the consciences of kings and rulers because there is no true court of natural justice except in our conscience, where God is the ruler. Some of God’s laws apply to everyone because He created nature, and as the King of all kings, His laws are real laws.

In this discussion, I will talk more about God’s kingdom as King of all and as the King of a special group of people.

The natural state of people who are neither rulers nor subjects is total freedom, but this leads to chaos and war. The rules that help people avoid this chaos are called the laws of nature. A country without a ruler is just a name and can’t really last. People owe simple obedience to their rulers in everything, as long as this obedience doesn’t go against God’s laws. I have already explained this.

What’s missing is knowing exactly what God’s laws are. Without this, people don’t know if obeying their government goes against God’s rules or not. So, they might obey too much and offend God or disobey out of fear of offending God and break the government’s laws. To avoid these problems, it’s important to understand God’s laws. Since knowing all laws depends on understanding who has the highest power, I will now talk about God’s Kingdom.

The Bible says, “God is King, let the earth be happy,” and “God is King even if nations are angry.” Whether people like it or not, they must always obey God’s power. Even if people deny God, they cannot escape His rule. But calling God’s power over everything—people, animals, plants, and even objects—a kingdom is just a way of speaking.

A true king is someone who rules his people by his word, promises rewards to those who obey, and threatens punishment to those who don’t.
