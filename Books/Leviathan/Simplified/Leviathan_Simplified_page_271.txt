A miracle is something amazing that happens to show that God’s messengers, ministers, or prophets are really sent by God. This helps people believe and listen to them. 

The creation of the world and the big flood were amazing, but they are not called miracles because they were not done to prove a prophet was sent by God. People already believe God can do anything, but a true miracle happens when God does something because a person prays or asks Him to. 

God’s works in Egypt through Moses were real miracles because they were meant to make the Israelites believe Moses was sent by God, not just acting on his own. When God told Moses to free the Israelites, Moses worried they wouldn’t believe him. So, God gave Moses power to turn his stick into a snake and back again, and to make his hand sick and then heal it. These signs were to help the Israelites believe that God had appeared to Moses.

God also gave Moses power to turn water into blood. When Moses showed these miracles, the Israelites believed him, but they were still scared of Pharaoh and didn’t obey him yet. The other miracles and plagues were meant to help the Israelites believe Moses and were real miracles.

If we look at all the miracles done by Moses, the prophets, Jesus, and his apostles, their purpose was always to make people believe they were sent by God. The Bible also shows miracles were meant to make only certain people believe—the ones God chose to be His followers. For example, the plagues in Egypt were not meant to change Pharaoh’s mind because God had already decided Pharaoh’s heart would be hard. Pharaoh only let the people go because the plagues forced him, not because he believed the miracles.
