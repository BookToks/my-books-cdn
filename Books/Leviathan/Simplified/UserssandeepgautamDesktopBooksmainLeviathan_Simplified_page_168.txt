When people have enough power to get what they want, even if it’s unfair, they might make their own rules without asking the government. That’s why laws need to clearly show who made them and where the power comes from. In every country, the person or group who makes laws is clear because they are the leader chosen by everyone.

Even though most people forget or don’t think about who protects them or keeps things fair, no one who really thinks can doubt who is in charge. It’s just common sense that you shouldn’t try to weaken the power that protects you, especially if you asked for that protection. So, no one should be confused about who the leader is, unless they don’t want to see the truth.

The hard part is proving where the leader’s power comes from. This proof comes from public records, official meetings, trusted officials, and official seals. These things show the laws are real, but they don’t create the power of the law—that power only comes from the leader’s command.

If someone feels hurt or treated unfairly, and it’s about basic fairness, a judge who has the right to decide on these issues will explain what the law says. Even if a lawyer gives advice, it’s only advice. The judge is the one who decides what the law means in a fight.

But if the problem is about breaking a written law, anyone can check the official records themselves or through others before doing something wrong. They should do this because if they don’t check and then do something wrong, they are breaking the law on purpose. Also, if someone thinks they were treated unfairly but complains without checking the law first, they are just being annoying instead of trying to fix the problem fairly.
