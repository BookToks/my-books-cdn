They always made up excuses, like justice or religion, to avoid following orders whenever they thought they could get away with it. Samuel was unhappy with the people because they wanted a king, even though God was already their King, and Samuel only had power because God gave it to him. But when Saul didn’t listen to Samuel about killing Agag as God said, Samuel chose another king, David, to take over after Saul’s family.

Rehoboam wasn’t a worshiper of idols, but when the people thought he was unfair, ten tribes left him and joined Jeroboam, who did worship idols. Throughout the history of the kings in Judah and Israel, prophets always kept the kings in check when they broke religious rules or made political mistakes. For example, Jehoshaphat was criticized by the prophet Jehu for helping the King of Israel fight the Syrians, and Hezekiah was warned by Isaiah for showing his treasures to Babylon’s ambassadors.

This shows that even though kings had power over the government and religion, they weren’t completely free to do whatever they wanted unless they were naturally good or lucky. So, from what happened back then, we can’t say that kings didn’t have the highest religious authority unless we think prophets had it instead. But just because Hezekiah prayed to God without getting an answer until Isaiah came, or because Josiah asked the prophetess Huldah about the Book of the Law, it doesn’t mean the prophets were in charge of the church. No respected teacher thinks that.

During the Captivity, the Jews didn’t have a government at all. After they came back and made a new promise to God, there was no promise to obey leaders like Esdras or anyone else. Soon after, they became subjects to the Greeks. Because of Greek customs, strange beliefs, and the teachings of the Cabalists, their religion got mixed up and confused. So, it’s impossible to say who was in charge of the government or religion then.

Therefore, from the Old Testament times, we can say that whoever ruled the Jewish nation also had the highest authority over how God was worshiped publicly. They represented God’s authority, like God the Father, even though people didn’t call Him “Father” until He sent His Son Jesus to save people and bring them into His eternal kingdom.
