Leviathan/425 Sometimes, people explain natural events by saying they don’t know the real cause. They use fancy words like “fortune” to mean luck, or blame unknown “occult qualities.” These are things they don’t understand and think no one else does either. They also use words like sympathy, antipathy, antiperistasis, and other confusing terms that don’t really explain what causes things or how they happen.

If this kind of thinking isn’t just useless nonsense, then nothing ever was. That’s why St. Paul warned us to stay away from it.

When it comes to right and wrong, their ideas are just as messed up or even worse. If someone does something unfair or breaks a law, they say God made the law and also caused every action, but God didn’t cause the unfairness. That makes no sense. It’s like saying one person makes straight lines and crooked lines, and another causes the difference between them. This kind of thinking tries to explain things before even understanding the facts and mixes up what is natural with what is honorable. They do this to support the idea that people have free will, meaning their will isn’t controlled by God’s will.

Aristotle and other ancient thinkers said good and bad come from what people want. That works if everyone only follows their own desires. But in a society, this idea doesn’t work. The law, which is what the whole group wants, decides what’s good or bad, not individual desires. Still, many people judge what’s good or bad based on their own feelings and don’t care about the public laws. Only monks and friars, who promise to obey their leaders, follow rules like everyone else should. Judging right and wrong this way is not only silly, but it also harms society.

It’s also wrong to say that marriage goes against being pure or self-controlled, and to call marriage a moral mistake. Some people use this idea to stop clergy from marrying, but they are wrong.
