The first part of the Bible law was the Ten Commandments. They were written on two stone tablets, given by God to Moses, who then told the people about them. Before that, there was no written law from God because He had not chosen any special group of people yet. Instead, everyone had the law of nature, which means the rules that make sense and are written in every person’s heart.

The first tablet had rules about who should be in charge. First, people were told not to follow or worship the gods of other nations. The command said, “You shall not have other gods besides me.” This meant they could only obey the one true God who spoke to Moses and later to the high priest. Second, they were told not to make any pictures or statues to represent God. They had to obey Moses and Aaron, who God chose to lead them. Third, they should not use God’s name carelessly or disrespect Him. They also should not question God’s authority or the leaders Moses and Aaron. Fourth, every seventh day, they had to stop working and spend time honoring God.

The second tablet was about how people should treat each other. It said to respect parents, not to kill, not to cheat on your partner, not to steal, not to lie in court, and not even to think about hurting others.

Now, the question is who made these tablets official laws that everyone had to follow. It’s clear God made the laws, but a law only works if the people agree it comes from the one in charge. The Israelites were not allowed to come close to the mountain to hear God speak to Moses, so how could they be forced to obey all these laws Moses told them? Some laws, like the ones on the second tablet, were natural rules for all people, so everyone should follow them. But the ones special to the Israelites, like those on the first tablet, were different. Still, the people agreed to obey Moses when they said, “Speak to us, and we will listen, but don’t let God speak to us directly, or we might die.”
