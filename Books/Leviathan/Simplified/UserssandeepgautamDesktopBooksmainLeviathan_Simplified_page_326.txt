Again, Jesus told His Apostles and followers to announce His kingdom, which was not here yet but would come later. They were to teach all people and baptize those who believed. They could enter the homes of people who welcomed them, but if someone didn’t accept them, they were told to shake the dust off their feet and move on. They were not supposed to call down fire from heaven to punish people or force them to obey by using weapons. Their power was not about force but about convincing others. Jesus sent them out like sheep among wolves, not like kings ruling over subjects. They didn’t have the job of making laws but to follow laws and teach others to do the same. So, their writings could only become official rules if the government agreed.

Because of this, the New Testament is only a law where the government says it is. Also, the king or ruler makes these laws for himself, meaning he obeys God and Jesus directly, just like the Apostles did—not because a teacher or Apostle told him to.

What made the New Testament seem like law during times when Christians were being persecuted were the decisions made by their church meetings, called synods. For example, the council of Apostles and elders said, “It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no heavier burden than these necessary things” (Acts 15:28). This language shows they had the power to set rules for those who believed in their teachings. Saying “to lay a burden on someone” means to require something from them, so these decisions were like laws for early Christians. But even so, these were no more laws than other instructions like “Repent,” “Be baptized,” “Keep the Commandments,” “Believe the Gospel,” “Come to me,” “Sell all you have,” “Give to the poor,” and “Follow me.” These were not commands but invitations to follow Christianity, like the prophet Isaiah said, “Hey, everyone who is thirsty, come to the water; come and buy wine and milk without money” (Isaiah 55:1).

First of all, the Apostles’ power was just like Jesus’s power—to invite people to accept the kingdom of God. They themselves said it was a kingdom that was going to come, not one that was already here. And people who don’t have a kingdom can’t make laws.
