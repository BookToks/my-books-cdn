If a man's dad, mom, or boss is kicked out of the church, their kids are still allowed to hang out with them and eat with them. It wouldn’t make sense to stop children from eating just because their parents or bosses were kicked out. Also, it would be wrong to make kids disobey their parents or bosses, which goes against what the Apostles taught.

In short, the power to kick someone out of the church only goes as far as the Apostles and church leaders were given by Jesus. Their job isn’t to control people by force, but to teach and guide them toward salvation and a better life after this world. Like a teacher who might stop helping a student who refuses to learn but can’t complain the student is being unfair, a Christian teacher can stop helping followers who live badly but can’t say they are being wronged. Because those followers aren’t forced to obey the teacher. If a teacher complains, God’s answer would be like it was to Samuel: “They haven’t rejected you, but me.”

Excommunication doesn’t work unless the government supports it. For example, if a Christian leader is kicked out by a foreign church, it has no real power and shouldn’t scare anyone. The idea of "the thunderbolt of excommunication" came from the Bishop of Rome who imagined himself as the king of kings, like how the ancient gods had a thunderbolt to punish those who didn’t obey. This idea was wrong for two reasons: first, Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world,” so His kingdom isn’t about earthly power; second, there’s no proof in the Bible that the Bishop of Rome rules over all Christians everywhere.

When St. Paul went to Thessalonica, he visited a Jewish synagogue and spent three Sabbath days talking with them. He explained from the Jewish Scriptures that Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead, and that the Jesus he was preaching was the promised Christ. The Scriptures he used were the Jewish Old Testament.
