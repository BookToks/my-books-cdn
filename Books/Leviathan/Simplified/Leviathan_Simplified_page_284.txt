“This is the second death.” (Revelation 20:13-14) This means there will be a second death for everyone who is judged and condemned on Judgment Day, and after that death, they will never die again.

The happiness of eternal life is called salvation in the Bible, which means being saved. To be saved means being protected—either from certain bad things or from all bad things like poverty, sickness, and even death. People were created to live forever and not break down, but because of Adam’s sin, we lost that. So, being saved from sin means being saved from all the bad stuff that sin causes.

In the Bible, forgiveness of sin and being saved from death and suffering mean the same thing. Jesus showed this when he healed a paralyzed man and said, “Son, be happy, your sins are forgiven.” The religious leaders thought it was wrong for Jesus to say he could forgive sins, so Jesus asked them if it was easier to say “Your sins are forgiven” or “Get up and walk.” He meant that forgiving sins is just as powerful as healing someone. It makes sense because death and suffering come from sin, so getting rid of sin means getting rid of death and suffering too. This is the full salvation that believers will have after Judgment Day, through Jesus Christ, who is called our Savior.

There are also specific examples of salvation in the Bible, like when God saved Israel from their enemies, or when someone was saved from violence. These are easier to understand and don’t need much explanation.

But when it comes to the general salvation, which happens in heaven, it’s harder to understand where it takes place. Some think it should be on earth because a kingdom is a place where people are safe from enemies and want.
