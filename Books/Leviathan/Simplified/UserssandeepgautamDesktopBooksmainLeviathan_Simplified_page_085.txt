Fear can only make a promise invalid if it happens after the promise is made, like a new reason or sign showing someone won’t keep their word. If something didn’t stop a person from promising in the first place, it can’t stop them from keeping it later.

When someone gives or sells a right, they also give what’s needed to use that right as much as they can. For example, if someone sells land, they also sell the grass and plants on it. If someone sells a mill, they can’t stop the water that makes it work. If someone gives power to rule a country, they also give the right to collect money for soldiers and to choose judges.

You can’t make promises with animals because they don’t understand our language, they don’t agree to rights, and they can’t pass rights to others. Without both sides agreeing, there is no promise.

You can only make promises with God through someone He talks to, like through special messages or leaders He chooses. Otherwise, we don’t know if God accepts the promise. So, if someone promises to do something against natural law, the promise is useless because it’s not right to do that. If the promise follows natural law, it’s the law that makes it binding, not the promise itself.

Promises are always about something you think about carefully. To promise is to decide to do something in the future, and it must be something you believe you can do.

So, promising to do something you know is impossible isn’t really a promise. But if it becomes impossible later, after you thought it was possible, the promise still counts. You have to pay its value or try your best to do as much as you can because that’s all anyone can be asked to do.

People are free from their promises in two ways: by doing what they promised or by being forgiven. Doing what you promised is the normal way to end an obligation, and forgiveness gives you back your freedom by taking away the promise.
