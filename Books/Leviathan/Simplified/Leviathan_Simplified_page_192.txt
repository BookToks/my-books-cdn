Eighth, if the law sets a punishment for a crime, but after someone commits the crime they get punished more than the law says, that extra punishment isn’t really punishment—it’s an act of attack. Punishment is meant to scare people, not to get revenge. If the law says the punishment is less, people won’t expect more. So, adding extra punishment isn’t fair. But if the law doesn’t say what the punishment is, then any punishment given is still punishment because the person breaking the law should expect some kind of punishment, even if it’s random.

Ninth, hurting someone for something they did before a law said it was wrong isn’t punishment—it’s an attack. You can only be punished if you broke a law that was already there. If the law didn’t exist yet, you didn’t do anything illegal, so hurting you is just being hostile.

Tenth, hurting someone who represents the government isn’t punishment either—it’s an attack. That’s because punishment comes only from the government’s official power, and their representatives have that power.

Finally, hurting someone who is a declared enemy isn’t punishment. This is because enemies either never followed the law, so they can’t break it, or they used to follow the law but now refuse to. So, any harm done to them is just an act of war. In war, hurting the enemy is allowed. This means if a person says or does something that clearly denies the government’s authority, no matter what the law says about treason, the government can punish them however it wants. By denying the government, they lose the right to legal punishment and become an enemy instead. The laws are meant for regular citizens, not for enemies who rebel and reject the government’s power.

The first big way to divide punishments is between divine (from God) and human (from people). I will talk more about divine punishment later.
