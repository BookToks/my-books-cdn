The way food and resources are shared is what creates the idea of "mine," "yours," and "his." This is called property, and in any government, it belongs to the ruling power. Without a government, there is constant fighting between people. So, everything belongs to whoever grabs and keeps it by force, which isn’t really property or sharing, but just chaos.

This idea is so clear that even Cicero, who strongly supported freedom, said that all property depends on laws. He said, “If civil law is ignored or weak, no one can be sure what belongs to them or what they can pass on to their kids.” He also said, “Without civil law, no one knows what is theirs or someone else’s.” So, property only exists because of the government, which acts through the person or group in charge. Laws are made only by those with sovereign power. Long ago, people called laws “Nomos,” which means distribution, and justice was about giving everyone what is theirs.

The first rule in this sharing is how land is divided. The ruler decides who gets what, not the people themselves, based on what is fair and good for everyone. The Israelites were a community in the desert but didn’t have land until they took over the Promised Land. Then, the land was divided by their leaders, not by the people, into twelve parts for the tribes, with the tribe of Levi getting no land but a tenth of the crops. This division was decided by the leaders. Sometimes when a people conquer land, they don’t always kick out the old owners but let them keep their property. Still, those properties are controlled by the conqueror, like how the English people held land under William the Conqueror.

From this, we understand that when someone owns land, they have the right to keep others from using it, except for the ruler, whether that is a group or a king.
