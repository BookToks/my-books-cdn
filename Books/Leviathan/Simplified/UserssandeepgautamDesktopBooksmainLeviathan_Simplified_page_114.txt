There are different kinds of governments based on who has the highest power. The power can be with one person or with a group of people. If the group includes everyone, that’s a democracy. If it’s just a few people chosen from the rest, that’s an aristocracy. If it’s one person, that’s a monarchy. So, there are only three kinds of governments: monarchy, democracy, and aristocracy.

Sometimes, people use other words like tyranny or oligarchy. But those aren’t really new types of governments. They are just names people use when they don’t like the government they have. For example, people unhappy with a monarchy might call it tyranny. People unhappy with an aristocracy might call it oligarchy. Those unhappy with democracy might say it’s anarchy, which means no government at all. But no one really thinks having no government is a new kind of government. So, a government doesn’t change just because people like it or not.

People who are free can choose to give their power to one person or to a group. They can decide to follow a king or a group of representatives. But once a government is set up, there can’t be two governments with the same power at the same time. If there were two leaders with the same power, they would fight each other and cause problems. The power must be one and whole so people can live peacefully.
