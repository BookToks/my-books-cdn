If someone makes a promise knowing that the only proof is their own word, the promise is still valid because they are the one making it. So, when someone clearly has permission, the promise binds the person giving permission, not just the one acting. But if the permission is fake, it only binds the person acting, since they are the only one responsible.

Lots of things can be represented by someone else. For example, a church, hospital, or bridge can be represented by a leader or manager. But these things aren’t alive and can’t give permission themselves, so they can’t really be the real source of authority. Still, the people in charge of these things can give permission to those who take care of them. This kind of representation only works when there is some kind of government or rules in place.

Similarly, kids, people who can’t think clearly, or people who are mentally ill can be represented by guardians or caretakers. But these people can’t make real decisions during that time, unless they later decide the actions were reasonable when they get better.

During the time someone can’t think clearly, the person in charge can give authority to the guardian. But this also only makes sense when there is a system of government because before that, no one really rules over others.

An idol or something made-up, like the gods worshiped by ancient people, could be represented by officials chosen by the state. These idols were believed to own things and receive gifts, but they couldn’t really make decisions because they don’t exist. The power came from the government, so before governments existed, these idols couldn’t be represented.

The true God can be represented. First, Moses led the Israelites—not as his own people, but as God’s people—and spoke in God’s name. Second, Jesus, God’s Son, came to bring people into God’s kingdom, not by his own power but sent by God. Third, the Holy Spirit worked through the Apostles, not on its own, but sent by God and Jesus.
