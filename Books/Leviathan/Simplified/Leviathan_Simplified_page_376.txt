Thomas Hobbes explains what people need to be saved and how this fits with obeying both God and the ruler of their country, whether that ruler is Christian or not.

If the ruler is a Christian, he believes Jesus is the Christ and accepts all the main Christian beliefs that come from that. Since he is the leader, he expects people to follow all his civil laws, which also include God’s natural laws. These are the only true divine laws. So, if people obey their Christian ruler, they are not stopping themselves from believing or obeying God.

Even if a Christian ruler makes some mistakes in what he teaches, like building on false ideas, St. Paul says he will still be saved. People who teach these ideas by the ruler’s order will also be saved, and those who just believe the ruler without teaching will be saved even more.

If the ruler says a person cannot share some of their own opinions, on what good reason can someone disobey? Christian rulers might make mistakes, but who can judge them? Can an ordinary person judge when it’s about obeying authority? Only those chosen by the Church, or the ruler representing the Church, should judge. Even important church leaders like St. Peter or St. Paul made mistakes sometimes, so there is no real conflict between God’s laws and the laws of a Christian country.

If the ruler is not a Christian, any subject who fights against him sins against God’s laws, which include natural laws. They also go against what the Apostles say about obeying rulers and parents or masters. Their faith is private and invisible, like Naaman’s in the Bible. They don’t have to risk their safety for it. But if they do risk their lives, they should expect a reward in heaven and not complain about their ruler or start a war. Someone who is not willing to face danger for their faith probably doesn’t truly believe but just wants to excuse their disobedience.
