To make their difference clearer, imagine one man who is naturally good and quick at using his weapons. Another man has that same skill but also has learned exactly where he can attack or be attacked by his opponent in every possible position or defense. The first man’s skill is like being careful, while the second man’s skill is like being truly wise. Both are useful, but the second man’s skill is much more reliable. People who only trust what books say, without thinking for themselves, are like someone who blindly follows the wrong advice from a fencing teacher and then fights an opponent who either beats or embarrasses them.

Science has some signs that are certain and some that aren’t. It is certain when someone who claims to know something can clearly teach it to others and prove it is true. It is uncertain when only a few examples match what they say, but many others do not. Signs of being careful and wise are always uncertain because it’s impossible to remember every detail that can change the outcome. In any situation where a person doesn’t have perfect knowledge, ignoring their own natural judgment and following general advice from books that don’t always apply is foolish. People who do this are often mocked as being show-offs. Even those who like to talk about politics and history to look smart usually don’t use that knowledge in their own personal lives, where they tend to be wiser. But in public, they care more about seeming smart than about helping others succeed.

There are two kinds of movements in animals. One is vital movement, which starts when they are born and continues without stopping their whole life, like the flow of blood, heartbeat, breathing, digestion, and waste removal. These movements don’t need imagination. The other is voluntary movement, which animals control themselves, like walking, talking, or moving a part of the body the way they first imagine in their minds. What we call “sense” is a kind of movement inside the organs and parts of the body, caused by things we see, hear, and experience.
