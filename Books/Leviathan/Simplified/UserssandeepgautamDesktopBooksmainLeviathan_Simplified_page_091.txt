Some people think that the rules of nature are not just about keeping people alive on Earth, but about helping them reach eternal happiness after death. They believe breaking promises can be good and fair if it helps with that. These people think it’s okay to kill, remove, or rebel against the rulers they agreed to follow. But since no one really knows what happens after death or what rewards come from breaking promises, except stories passed down by others, breaking promises can’t be called a rule based on reason or nature.

Other people believe that keeping promises is a natural law, but they make exceptions for certain people like heretics or those who usually don’t keep their promises. This also goes against reason.

If someone’s mistake or fault is enough to cancel a promise, then logically, that fault should have stopped the promise from being made in the first place.

When we call people just or unjust, it means something different than when we call actions just or unjust. For people, these words mean how much their behavior follows reason. For actions, it means whether the specific action follows reason or not. A just person tries their best to make all their actions just. An unjust person doesn’t care about doing this. We often use the words righteous and unrighteous for people, but they mean the same as just and unjust.

A righteous person doesn’t stop being righteous because of one or two wrong actions done in anger or by mistake. And an unrighteous person doesn’t become good just because they avoid some bad actions out of fear. This is because their choices are based on what benefits them, not on justice.

What makes actions feel just is a special kind of bravery or honor that is rare. It means a person refuses to rely on cheating or breaking promises just to get by. This kind of justice in behavior is what we call a virtue; injustice is its opposite, a vice.

But calling actions just means the person is not guilty. When actions are unjust, the person is called guilty and responsible for harm or injury.
