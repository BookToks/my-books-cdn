Human punishments are penalties given by people’s laws. These punishments can be physical, money-related, shameful, or involve jail, exile, or a mix of these.

Physical punishment is when the body is hurt directly, like being whipped, wounded, or losing pleasures that were once allowed.

Some physical punishments lead to death, which is called capital punishment. Others don’t cause death, like whipping, wounds, or being chained. If someone dies by accident during a punishment that wasn’t meant to kill, it’s not considered capital punishment.

Money punishment means losing money, land, or things you can buy and sell. Sometimes, laws charge money to break rules, but if the law is designed just to get money, it’s not truly a punishment but a fee to avoid the law—unless the law is natural or religious. For example, if someone swears using God’s name wrongly and has to pay money, that money isn’t to allow swearing but is a real punishment. Also, if a law says the offender must pay the person they hurt, that money is to make up for the damage, not to erase the crime.

Shameful punishment is when someone loses honor or respect given by the community. Some honors, like bravery or intelligence, come naturally and can’t be taken away by law, so losing them isn’t a punishment. But honors given by the government, like titles or official jobs, can be taken away as a punishment. For example, a person can be stripped of their title or job if they are found guilty.
