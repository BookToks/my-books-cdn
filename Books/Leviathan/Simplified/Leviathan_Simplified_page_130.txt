Usually, when people follow laws in a country, they do so because they are afraid of getting in trouble. They actually have the freedom to not follow those laws if they wanted to.

Freedom and things happening for a reason can both be true at the same time. Think about water that has to flow down a river— it has the freedom to move, but it also has to go down because of how rivers work. People’s choices are similar. They choose freely, but every choice happens because of something else that caused it, like a chain of events starting with God, who is the first cause of everything.

If someone could see all these causes, they would understand why people’s choices seem necessary. God knows and controls everything, so He sees that people have freedom to choose, but only in ways that fit with what He allows. People can do many things God doesn’t tell them to do, but they can’t want or desire anything unless God allows it. If God didn’t cause people’s will, their freedom would go against God’s power and freedom. This is enough to explain the natural kind of freedom people have.

Because people want peace and to protect themselves, they create a group called a Commonwealth, or a country. They also create rules called civil laws. These laws are like chains that connect the government’s orders to the people’s actions. The laws might be weak on their own, but people follow them because breaking them can be dangerous, not just because it’s hard.

Right now, I’m only talking about the freedom people have as citizens under these laws. Since no country can make rules for every single thing people do or say (which is impossible), people have the freedom to do whatever they think is best for themselves in cases not covered by laws. If we think about freedom as just being free from physical chains or prison, it would be silly for people to complain about not having freedom when they clearly have it.
