Second, a king can ask for advice from anyone he wants, whenever and wherever he wants. He can listen to experts on the topic, no matter who they are, and can do this well before making a decision and in private. But when a big group needs advice, only certain people can join, usually those who know more about making money than about real knowledge. They give long speeches that might excite people to act but don’t really help guide their actions. Also, because of all the people, a big group can’t keep things secret or focused.

Third, a king’s decisions only change as much as any person’s might. But in a group, decisions can change a lot more because of the number of people involved. If some people who agree don’t show up, or if a few who disagree are very active, they can undo what the group decided before.

Fourth, a king can’t argue with himself out of jealousy or selfishness, but a group can fight among themselves so much it might cause a civil war.

Fifth, in a monarchy, one big problem is that one person can take away everything from someone to give to their favorite or someone who flatters them. This is a serious problem. But the same thing can happen in a group because they have the same power and can also be tricked by smooth talkers. They can become each other’s followers, helping their own greed and ambition. A king’s favorites are few and usually family, but a group’s favorites are many and have more connections. Also, a king’s favorite can help friends and hurt enemies, but the favorites in a group mostly have the power to hurt and little power to help.
