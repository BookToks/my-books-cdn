When something affects us through our eyes, ears, or other senses, it causes a reaction in our heart. This reaction is really just movement or effort, which shows up as wanting or not wanting something. We feel this movement as either happiness or sadness.

This movement, called appetite, feels like energy and helps keep us alive. Things that make us happy were called "jucunda," meaning they help or strengthen us. Things that bother us were called "molesta," meaning they stop or trouble that energy.

So, pleasure or happiness is how we feel good things, and pain or displeasure is how we feel bad things. Because of this, wanting or loving something usually comes with some happiness, and hating or avoiding something comes with some pain or discomfort.

Some pleasures come from experiencing something right now, like things we see, hear, smell, taste, or touch. These are called pleasures of the senses. Other pleasures come from looking forward to something good happening later, which is called joy. Similarly, pain can come from something happening now or from worrying about something bad that might happen later, which is called grief.

These feelings, like wanting, loving, hating, joy, and grief, have different names depending on different reasons. First, the name changes depending on how likely we think it is that we’ll get what we want. Second, it depends on what we love or hate. Third, it depends on how many feelings happen at once. Fourth, it depends on how these feelings change over time.

For example, wanting something when you think you can get it is called hope.

Wanting something when you think you can’t get it is called despair.

Not wanting something when you think it will hurt you is called fear.
