First, Solomon says, “Then the dust will go back to dust, just like before, and the spirit will go back to God who gave it.” This might mean that only God knows what happens to a person’s spirit after they die, not humans. Solomon also says, “Everyone goes to the same place; all come from dust and go back to dust. Who knows if a person’s spirit goes up and an animal’s spirit goes down to the earth?” This means only God knows what happens after death, and it’s normal to say “God knows” when we don’t understand something.

In Genesis, it says, “Enoch walked with God, and then he was no more because God took him.” This is explained in Hebrews as meaning Enoch didn’t die but was taken by God because he pleased Him. This shows that only those who please God get this special treatment, not everyone, and it’s because of God’s grace, not just nature.

On the other hand, Solomon also says, “What happens to people happens to animals too; they both die the same way. They all have the same breath, so no person is better than an animal—life is meaningless.” Taken literally, this means there is no natural immortality of the soul. But this doesn’t go against the idea of eternal life, which the good people get by God’s grace. Solomon also says, “It is better not to have been born than to live,” which would be strange if everyone’s soul was immortal, because then having a soul would be worse than having none.

Also, Solomon says, “The living know they will die, but the dead don’t know anything,” meaning naturally, before the resurrection.

Another place that seems to support the soul living forever is when Jesus says Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are still alive. But this is about God’s promise that they will rise again, not that they are actually alive right now. It’s like when God told Adam he would die if he ate the forbidden fruit—he was considered dead by sentence from that moment, but he didn’t actually die until many years later.
