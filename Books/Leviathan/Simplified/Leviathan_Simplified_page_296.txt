Before, the right to control both the government and religion was linked together.

Then kings took over from the judges. Earlier, the high priest had all the power in both religion and government, but now the king had all the power. The people stopped following the high priest’s rule, which was based on God’s power and a special agreement with the Israelites, and chose to follow the king instead—with God’s approval.

When the people told Samuel, “Make us a king to rule us like other nations” (I Samuel 8:5), they showed they didn’t want to be led by the priest’s commands from God anymore. Instead, they wanted a king to rule them like other countries do. By doing this, they ended the special government that God had set up. God agreed, telling Samuel, “Listen to the people; they haven’t rejected you, but they have rejected me as their king” (I Samuel 8:7). Since they rejected God’s rule, the priests only had power if the king allowed it, depending on whether the king was good or bad. And clearly, the king was in charge of running the country.

In the same chapter, the people said they wanted to be like other nations, with a king who would judge them, lead them, and fight their battles (I Samuel 8:20). This meant the king had all the power during peace and war. The king also controlled religion because the only rules for religion at the time came from the Law of Moses, which was also the country’s law. For example, Solomon kicked out Abiathar, the high priest, showing he had power over the high priest like any other person (I Kings 2:27). Solomon also dedicated the Temple, blessed the people, and prayed publicly, showing he was the top religious leader (I Kings 8). Later, when questions came up about the Book of the Law found in the Temple, the king Josiah didn’t let the high priest decide. Instead, he sent others to ask Huldah, a prophetess, showing again that the king was the top authority in religion (II Kings 22).
