But the rights and responsibilities of being in charge are the same in both cases.

His power can’t be given to someone else without his permission: he can’t lose it: none of his people can say he did something wrong: they can’t punish him: he decides what is needed for peace and what beliefs are true: he makes all the laws, judges arguments, and decides when to go to war or make peace: he picks leaders, advisors, commanders, and other officials; and decides rewards, punishments, honors, and ranks. The reasons for this are the same as explained before about the rights of being in charge by choice.

Control over others is gained in two ways: by birth or by taking over.

The right to control by birth is like the power a parent has over their children, called parental power. This doesn’t come just because the parent created the child, but because the child agrees to it, either clearly or in other ways. Since having a helper is part of life, and there are always two parents, both should have equal control over the child, which is impossible because a person can’t obey two bosses. Some say the man should have control because he is the stronger or better sex, but they are wrong.

Because there isn’t always a difference in strength or wisdom between a man and a woman, deciding who should have control without fighting is hard.

In societies, this issue is decided by laws, and usually, but not always, the father gets control because most societies were started by fathers, not mothers. But now we are talking about a natural state where there are no marriage laws, no rules for raising children, just natural feelings between men, women, and their kids. In this natural state, either the parents agree on who controls the child or they don’t decide at all. If they agree, control passes according to their agreement.

In history, the Amazons made a deal with nearby men that their sons would be sent back to the fathers, but daughters would stay with the mothers, so the mothers had control over the girls.
