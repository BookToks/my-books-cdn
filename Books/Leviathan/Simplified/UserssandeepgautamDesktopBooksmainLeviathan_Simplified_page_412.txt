Every day, we see that people who only care about eating and being comfortable are happy to believe anything silly without checking if it’s true. They treat their beliefs like something they can’t change unless there’s a new rule.

Some people think it’s okay to paint pictures of angels and even God because of stories like God walking in the garden or Jacob seeing God at the top of a ladder. But dreams and visions, whether natural or supernatural, are just illusions. So, if someone paints a picture of these, they aren’t really painting God, but their own imagination, which is like making an idol. I’m not saying drawing a picture from your imagination is wrong, but believing that picture really shows God goes against the second Commandment. It only leads to worshiping the picture itself.

The same goes for pictures of angels or dead people, unless the pictures are meant to remember friends or important people. In that case, it’s just a way to honor them, not worship them. But if people pray to a picture of a saint, thinking the saint can hear them and likes being honored even though they’re dead and can’t feel anything, that’s giving the saint more power than a human has, which is idolatry.

There is no rule in the Law of Moses or the Gospel that says it’s okay to worship pictures of God or anything else in heaven, on earth, or under the earth. Since Christian kings are God's representatives on earth and people don’t worship them as if they were gods, it’s clear that worshiping images in the Church didn’t come from misunderstanding the Bible. It must have stayed because the images themselves weren’t destroyed when non-Christians who worshiped them became Christians.

This happened because people valued these artworks too much. Even after they stopped worshiping the images as demons, they kept them at home, pretending it was to honor Christ, the Virgin Mary, the Apostles, and early Church leaders. By giving old images new names, they turned pictures of gods like Venus and Cupid into the Virgin Mary and Jesus, or changed Jupiter into Barnabas, Mercury into Paul, and so on.
