These are the rights that show who has the true power in a country, and you can tell where the sovereign power lies by looking at them. These rights can’t be shared or separated.  

Some powers, like making money, managing the property and people who are too young to decide for themselves, or having the first choice in markets, can be given away by the ruler. But the power to protect the people must stay with the ruler.  

If the ruler gives away control of the army, then having judges is useless because laws can’t be enforced. If the ruler gives away the power to collect money, then having the army is useless. If the ruler gives away control over religion, people might rebel because they fear different beliefs.  

If we look at any one of these rights, we see that holding the others won’t keep peace and fairness, which is why all countries are made in the first place. This is why it’s said a kingdom divided can’t survive. If these powers aren’t divided correctly, then opposing armies will form.  

If most people in England hadn’t believed that power was split between the King, the Lords, and the House of Commons, the people wouldn’t have been divided and fought the Civil War. First, they fought over politics, then over religious freedom. Because of this, many people now understand that these rights can’t be separated, and they will accept this when peace returns. The rights will stay this way until people forget their troubles or are better educated.  

Since these rights are so important and can’t be separated, if it looks like the ruler gave them away in words but didn’t clearly give up being the ruler, then the deal doesn’t count. If the ruler gives away everything but still keeps the title and power, then everything goes back to the ruler because the rights are connected to sovereignty.  

This huge power can’t be divided and is always connected to being the ruler. So, it doesn’t make sense to say that a king has more power than any one person but less power than all the people together.
