When it comes to physics, which means understanding the smaller causes behind natural events, they don’t really give any real answers—just empty words.  

If you want to know why some things naturally fall down toward the earth and others naturally go up, the Schools will tell you, using Aristotle’s ideas, that things that fall are heavy, and this heaviness makes them go down. But if you ask what they mean by heaviness, they say it’s an effort to move toward the center of the earth. So basically, things fall or rise just because they do.  

They might also say the center of the earth is where heavy things want to rest and stay safe. But that’s like saying stones and metals have feelings or can think like people, or that glass prefers being on the floor rather than in a window.  

If you want to know why the same object looks bigger sometimes and smaller other times, they say when it looks smaller it’s “condensed,” and when it looks bigger it’s “rarefied.” But what does that mean?  

They say “condensed” means the same stuff has less quantity, and “rarefied” means it has more. But that’s like saying stuff can change how much it has without adding or taking anything away. Quantity is just how much matter there is, so it doesn’t make sense that the same stuff can be more or less without changing. It’s like saying something can have no size and then gain size later.  

For the soul, they say it’s created by “pouring it in,” meaning it’s put into the body when created. For senses, they say it’s about having copies or images of things around us: when these images reach the eyes, it’s sight; ears, hearing; tongue, taste; nose, smell; and the rest of the body, feeling.  

For why we choose to do something, called will, they say it’s just because we have the ability to want different things at different times. So they say having the power to will is the reason we act. But that’s like saying the ability to do good or bad things is what causes us to actually do them.
