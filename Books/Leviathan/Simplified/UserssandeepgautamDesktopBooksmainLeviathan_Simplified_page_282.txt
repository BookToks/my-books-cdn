Near Jerusalem, there was a place called the Valley of the Children of Hinnon. In a part of it called Tophet, the Jews once did horrible things—they sacrificed their children to a false god named Moloch. God punished those who did this badly. Later, King Josiah burned the priests who served Moloch on their own altars, as you can read in II Kings, Chapter 23. After that, this place was used to dump trash and garbage from the city. Sometimes, fires were made there to clean the air and get rid of the bad smell from dead animals. Because this place was so awful, the Jews started calling it Gehenna, or the Valley of Hinnon. Today, Gehenna is the word often translated as hell, and the fires there made people think of a never-ending fire.

Now, no one really thinks the Bible means that after the day of judgment, all the bad people will be punished forever in the Valley of Hinnon. Nor do they believe the wicked will rise and live underground or underwater, or that after coming back to life, they won’t see each other or move around. So, it makes sense to believe that the talk about hellfire is a metaphor—a way to explain something using an image. Because every metaphor is based on some real idea, we should try to understand the true meaning behind the place called hell and what the punishments and those who punish really are.

First, about the ones who punish: they are described by names like the enemy, Satan; the Accuser, or Diabolus; and the Destroyer, or Abaddon. These names don’t mean just one person, like normal names do. Instead, they describe a role or quality. So, these are titles, not personal names. They shouldn’t have been translated into other languages because it makes people think these are the names of demons. This mistake makes it easier for people to believe in the wrong ideas about evil spirits, which was the religion of other nations back then and went against the teachings of Moses and Christ.

Since the enemy, the accuser, and the destroyer are against those who will be in God’s kingdom, and if God’s kingdom will be on earth after people come back to life (which I explained in the last chapter using scripture), then the enemy and his followers must also be on earth. This was also true long ago, before the Jews stopped following God properly.
