A law of nature is a rule we find using reason. It tells people not to do things that would harm their life or stop them from keeping themselves safe. It also tells them to do things that help protect their life. Some people mix up the ideas of right and law, but they are different. A right means you can choose to do something or not. A law tells you what you must do. So, law and right are like being forced to do something versus being free to choose.

Since people live in a state where everyone is against everyone else, and everyone uses their own reason to survive, anything can be used to protect yourself. In this situation, everyone has the right to everything, even to use other people’s bodies. Because of this, no one can feel safe, no matter how strong or smart they are, to live a full natural life. So, there is a basic rule of reason: everyone should try to make peace if they think they can get it. But if they cannot get peace, they can use any help or advantage in war. The first part of this rule is the most important law of nature: always try to find and follow peace.

The second part is the basic right to defend yourself by any means.

From this main law, which tells people to try for peace, comes another rule: a person should be willing, if others are too, to give up some of their rights to everything. They should be okay with having as much freedom as they want others to have with them. If everyone keeps all their rights without giving any up, then everyone stays in a state of war.

But if others don’t give up their rights like you do, there’s no reason for you to give yours up. Doing that would just make you an easy target, and no one has to do that instead of trying to make peace.
