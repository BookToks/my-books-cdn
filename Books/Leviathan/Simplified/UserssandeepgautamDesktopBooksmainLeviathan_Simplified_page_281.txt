16, “The man who goes away from understanding will stay with the giants,” and Job 26:5 says, “Look, the giants groan under the water, and those who live with them.” Here, the place for the damned is under the water. Isaiah 14:9 says, “Hell is upset about how to meet you” (meaning the King of Babylon) “and will push aside the giants for you.” So again, if taken literally, the place of the damned is under water.

Thirdly, because the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by God’s great anger with fire and brimstone because of their wickedness, and the area around them became a smelly, sticky lake, the place of the damned is sometimes described as fire or a fiery lake. For example, in Revelation 21:8, it says, “But the fearful, unbelieving, disgusting, murderers, people who cheat on others, sorcerers, idol worshippers, and all liars will have their part in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone; this is the second death.” So it is clear that hellfire here is used as a metaphor from the real fire of Sodom. It doesn’t mean a specific kind or place of punishment, but should be understood generally as destruction. Revelation 20:14 says, “Death and hell were thrown into the lake of fire,” which means they were destroyed. This shows that after judgment day, there will be no more dying or going to hell (which comes from the word Hades), meaning no more death.

Fourthly, from the plague of darkness that God sent on the Egyptians, it’s written, “They couldn’t see each other, and no one left their place for three days; but all the Israelites had light in their homes” (Exodus 10:23). So, the place of the wicked after judgment is called complete darkness, or in the original language, “darkness outside.” This is also shown when the king orders his servants “to tie up the man who wasn’t wearing his wedding clothes and throw him into ‘outer darkness’” (Matthew 22:13). This “outer darkness” doesn’t mean how dark it is, but where the darkness is—outside where God’s chosen people live.
