X: About Power, Worth, Honor, and Respect  
A personâ€™s power is their current ability to get some future good thing. This power can be natural or through tools.  

Natural power is the special skill or strength of the body or mind, like great strength, good looks, wisdom, skills, speaking well, generosity, or noble status.  

Instrumental power is what you get by using natural power or luck, like money, fame, friends, or good fortune.  

Power grows as it is used, like reputation that gets bigger, or a heavy object that moves faster the further it goes.  

The biggest power people have is when many people join their powers together under one person, who can use all their power. This is the power of a country or government. Or it can depend on many separate people, like a group or faction.
