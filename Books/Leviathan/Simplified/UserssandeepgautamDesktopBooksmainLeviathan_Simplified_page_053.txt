Of consequences from the same, to the duty and right of the subjects X: Of Power, Worth, Dignity, Honour and Worthiness The power of a man, to take it universally, is his present means to obtain some future apparent good, and is either original or instrumental.
 
 Natural power is the eminence of the faculties of body, or mind; as extraordinary strength, form, prudence, arts, eloquence, liberality, nobility. Instrumental are those powers which, acquired by these, or by fortune, are means and instruments to acquire more; as riches, reputation, friends, and the secret working of God, which men call good luck.
