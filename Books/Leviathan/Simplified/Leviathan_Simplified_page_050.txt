Thomas Hobbes says the Bible was written to help people understand God's kingdom and get them ready to obey Him. It’s not meant to explain the world or science perfectly—that’s for people to talk about using their own reason.

It doesn’t matter if the day and night come from the earth moving or the sun moving, or if bad actions come from anger or the Devil. What matters is that we worship and obey God, which is what the Bible is really about.

When Jesus talks to sickness or spirits like they are people, that’s just a way of speaking. People who heal by talking often do this, even if it’s not literal. For example, Jesus is said to have calmed storms and healed fevers by talking to them, but that doesn’t mean the storm or fever is a person or a devil.

Sometimes people in the Bible who are said to be possessed actually might have just been crazy. When Jesus talks about a spirit leaving a person and then coming back with more spirits, it’s a story that shows how someone who tries to stop bad habits but fails can end up worse than before. So, the Bible doesn’t really prove that people with these problems were possessed by demons; they were probably just mentally ill.

Hobbes also talks about how some people use words in a confusing or meaningless way, which is a kind of madness. This happens when people repeat complicated words without really understanding them, or when they try to trick others by being unclear. This mostly happens with scholars and philosophers who talk about very hard topics like God’s nature or free will.

Regular people usually don’t speak nonsense, but these scholars can be very confusing. If you want to see what Hobbes means, try reading a chapter by a scholar about difficult ideas and see if you can translate it into simple, clear language. It’s often almost impossible to understand, even in the original Latin they used.
