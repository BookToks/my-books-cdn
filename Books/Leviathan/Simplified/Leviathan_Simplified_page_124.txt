If there is no agreement, the mother has control over the child. In nature, where there are no marriage rules, you can only know who the dad is if the mother says so. So, the mother decides who controls the child, and that control belongs to her.

Also, the baby is first under the mother’s care because she can either feed it or leave it alone. If she feeds it, the baby owes its life to her and must obey her more than anyone else. That means she has control over the child. But if she leaves the baby and someone else finds and feeds it, then the person who feeds the baby has control. The baby should obey whoever keeps it alive because staying alive is why people obey others.

If the mother is under the father’s control, then the child is under the father’s control. If the father is under the mother’s control (like when a queen marries a man who is her subject), then the child is under the mother’s control because the father follows her.

If a king and queen from two different kingdoms have a child and agree who will control the child, control goes to whoever they agree on. If they don’t agree, control follows whoever rules the place where the child lives, because the ruler has control over everyone living there.

Whoever controls the child also controls the child’s children and all future descendants. Control over a person means control over all that belongs to them. Without this control, having a title would mean nothing.

The right to take over a father’s control passes down like a monarchy does, as I explained earlier.

Control gained by winning a war or conquering is called despotic control. This means the winner becomes the master, and the loser becomes the servant. This happens when the loser agrees, either by words or actions, that as long as the winner lets him live and stay free, the winner can use him however he wants. After this agreement, the loser is a servant. 

A servant is not just a prisoner or slave locked up, waiting for the owner to decide what to do. Such slaves have no real duty and can try to escape or fight back. But a servant is someone who is free to move but promises not to run away or harm the master, and the master trusts him to keep that promise.
