God’s kingdom was in Palestine, and the countries around it were ruled by the Enemy. So, when the Bible talks about Satan, it means any enemy on earth who fights against the Church.

The pain of hell is described in different ways. Sometimes it’s shown as “weeping and teeth grinding,” like in Matthew 8:12. Other times, it’s called “the worm of conscience,” like in Isaiah 66:24 and Mark 9:44, 46, 48. Sometimes it’s described as fire, like where it says “the worm does not die, and the fire is not put out.” It’s also shown as “shame and dishonor,” like in Daniel 12:2, where some people wake up to shame and forever shame. All these images are ways to explain the sadness and regret people feel when they see others enjoying eternal happiness that they lost because they didn’t believe or obey.

Because they can only notice this happiness by comparing it to their own suffering, it means they will feel real physical pain and troubles. These pains are like those who live under cruel rulers and also have God as their enemy. One of these pains is called the second death, which everyone who is wicked must face.

Even though the Bible clearly says everyone will rise from the dead, it never promises eternal life to the wicked. St. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:42-43 that our bodies will be raised in glory and power, but that doesn’t apply to bad people. The second death can’t apply to those who only die once. Sometimes, a terrible endless life is called an everlasting death, but that’s not the same as a second death. The fire for the wicked lasts forever, meaning they will suffer in body and mind after rising from the dead. This fire never goes out, and the pain never ends, but that doesn’t mean people will burn forever without ever being destroyed.

There are many verses that talk about eternal fire and punishment where people are thrown in one after another forever. But none say that any person will live forever in that fire. Instead, it’s called an everlasting death — the second death. After death and the grave give up all the dead, everyone will be judged by their actions. Then death and the grave will be thrown into the lake of fire.
