At first, we see that Adam was created to live forever in the Garden of Eden if he had not broken God’s rule. There was a tree called the tree of life that he could eat from as long as he didn’t eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which God said he couldn’t eat from. But as soon as Adam ate from that tree, God kicked him out of the Garden so he wouldn’t eat from the tree of life and live forever. 

So, it seems to me (though I respect the official Bible interpretation) that Adam would have lived forever on earth if he hadn’t sinned. Death came to him and all his descendants because of his first sin. It doesn’t mean he died right away, because Adam lived a long time and had many children. When God said, “On the day you eat from it, you will surely die,” it means that death and mortality began from that day.

Since Adam lost eternal life by sinning, the one who could fix that had to bring eternal life back. Jesus Christ paid for the sins of everyone who believes in him and brought back eternal life for all believers, which Adam lost. This is what St. Paul meant when he said, “Because of one person’s sin, everyone was judged and condemned; but because of one person’s goodness, everyone can be made right and live.” He also said, “Death came through one man, and resurrection from the dead came through another. Just like everyone dies because of Adam, everyone will be made alive because of Christ.”

About where people will enjoy that eternal life Christ gave them, the verses suggest it will be here on earth. If everyone died and lost paradise on earth because of Adam, then everyone will live again on earth because of Christ. This fits with the Psalm that says, “God blesses Zion with life forever,” and Zion is in Jerusalem, on earth.
