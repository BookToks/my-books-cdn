If someone says something will happen, then they should not go back on it. Also, if we don’t see a miracle ourselves but only hear about it, we should ask the official Church leader how much we should believe the people telling us about it. This is especially true for people living under Christian rulers today.

Nowadays, I don’t know anyone who has actually seen a real miracle done by magic, words, or prayer that a reasonable person wouldn’t think was supernatural. The real question isn’t if what we see is a miracle or if the stories we hear or read are true or just made up. The important thing is whether the report is true or false.

In this case, we shouldn’t just trust our own private opinions or feelings. Instead, we should trust the public authority, which means the highest leader God has given for our peace and safety. If we have accepted that leader’s power, we have already made them the judge.

Every person is free to believe or not believe in their heart those things that are said to be miracles, based on whether they think the people telling the stories have good reasons or not. But when it comes to officially saying what to believe, private opinions must follow the public leader’s decision. Who this leader is and the head of the Church will be explained later.

The safety of society depends on justice, and justice depends on the power to give life or take it away, and other rewards or punishments that belong to the rulers. A country can’t survive if anyone other than the ruler has the power to give bigger rewards than life or punishments worse than death.

Since eternal life is a greater reward than life now, and eternal punishment is worse than natural death, it’s important for everyone who wants to avoid chaos and war by obeying authority to understand what the Bible means by eternal life, hell, the world to come, and redemption.

People should know for what sins and against whom they will be punished forever, and for what good actions they will receive eternal life.
