This window is what opens the way to the dark ideas of eternal punishment, then purgatory, and also the idea that ghosts of dead people walk around, especially in holy, quiet, or dark places. This leads to pretending to cast out evil spirits, calling up ghosts, and the idea of indulgences, which means being free for a time or forever from the fire of purgatory. People believed that these invisible souls were burned to be cleaned and ready for heaven.

Before Jesus, people thought that souls were separate from bodies and that after death, souls stayed somewhere by themselves. They didn’t think this was a special gift from God. Church leaders took a long time to figure out where souls stayed before the resurrection. At first, they thought souls were under altars, but later the Church of Rome made up the idea of purgatory, which some other churches now reject.

Now, let’s look at the Bible verses that seem to support these three big mistakes. Cardinal Bellarmine used some verses to prove that the Pope rules God’s kingdom now, but I already showed those are wrong. God’s kingdom started with Moses and ended when Saul was chosen as king. After that, priests didn’t have the power to remove kings. When the high priest removed Athaliah, he did it for Joash, her son, not for himself. But Solomon did remove the high priest Abiathar on his own authority.

The hardest Bible passage to explain, which some say proves God’s kingdom started with Christ’s resurrection, is not used by Bellarmine or the Church of Rome, but by Beza. He says the kingdom began then. But I’m not sure if he means that church leaders in Geneva or kings and rulers have the highest power now.
