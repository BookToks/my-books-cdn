God says He will take care of priests and Levites. This shows that the main center of God’s kingdom, where salvation for non-Jews (Gentiles) will come from, is Jerusalem. Jesus also confirmed this when He talked with a woman from Samaria about where people should worship God. He said that Samaritans worshipped things they didn’t fully understand, but the Jews worshipped the true God because “salvation comes from the Jews.”

Jesus meant that although the Samaritans worshipped God, they didn’t know that salvation would come through someone from the tribe of Judah, a Jew, not a Samaritan. The woman even replied that she knew the Messiah would come. So, when Jesus said “Salvation is from the Jews,” He was saying the same thing Paul said: the message of God’s power to save comes first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles.

The prophet Joel also talked about the day of judgment, describing amazing signs in the sky like the sun turning dark and the moon turning red. He said, “Whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved, because salvation will be in Mount Zion and Jerusalem.” Obadiah said something similar, that deliverance and holiness will come to Mount Zion, and the people of Jacob (Israel) will get back their land from other nations. He mentioned places like the land of Esau, the Philistines, and Samaria, and said that the kingdom will belong to the Lord.

All these places are where salvation and God’s kingdom will be on earth after judgment. On the other hand, I haven’t found any clear proof that saints will go up to heaven in a physical way after death. Heaven is called the kingdom of heaven because God, the King of the Jews, ruled them through commands given to Moses by angels. After the people rebelled, God sent His Son from heaven to bring them back to obedience. He will send Him again to rule all faithful people forever from the day of judgment. Also, God’s throne is in heaven, while the earth is just His footstool.
