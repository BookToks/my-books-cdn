Secondly, because the right to represent everyone is given to the person they make sovereign, by an agreement only between the people themselves and not with the sovereign, the sovereign cannot break this agreement. Because of this, none of the people ruled by the sovereign can stop being under their control by claiming the sovereign broke the agreement.

It’s clear that the person made sovereign doesn’t make any agreement with the people beforehand. This is because they would have to make the agreement either with everyone as one group or with each person individually. Making an agreement with everyone as one group is impossible because they are not one person. If the sovereign made separate agreements with each person, those agreements would become useless after the sovereign takes power. That’s because any action by one person would count as the action of all, since the sovereign represents everyone.

Also, if some people say the sovereign broke the agreement but others say they didn’t, there’d be no judge to decide who’s right. This would lead to conflict and everyone would have to protect themselves with force, which goes against the whole point of creating the sovereign in the first place. So, it’s useless to think of sovereignty as being based on a prior agreement.

The idea that a monarch gets power through an agreement, meaning with conditions, comes from not understanding this simple fact: agreements are just words and don’t have real power unless backed by force. That force comes from the person or group who holds the sovereign power, and whose actions are supported and carried out by everyone.

But when a group of people is made sovereign, no one thinks they made an agreement with themselves to keep power under certain conditions. For example, no one would say the people of Rome made a deal with themselves to rule only if certain rules were followed, and if not, they could remove themselves from power. The reason people don’t see that the same idea applies to both monarchies and popular governments is because some people prefer assemblies where they might share power, rather than monarchies where they have no chance to join in.
