A long time ago, Germany was made up of many small lords or family leaders who often fought each other. These lords painted their armor and shields with pictures of animals or other symbols so their followers could recognize them in battle. They also put noticeable marks on their helmets. These decorations were passed down to their children, with the oldest getting the exact same design and the younger ones getting slightly different versions. 

When many families joined to form a bigger kingdom, a special person called a herald was in charge of keeping track of these symbols. The sons of these lords became the noble class, often using pictures of brave animals, castles, weapons, and other war symbols on their shields because military skill was very respected. Later on, kings and even some groups of people gave shields with different symbols to soldiers as rewards for fighting or returning from war. You can see these kinds of stories in old Greek and Latin histories about Germany.

Titles like duke, count, marquis, and baron are important because they show the respect given by the rulers. These titles started as jobs or leadership roles. Dukes were generals in war, counts were leaders who helped govern and protect conquered lands, and marquises were counts who ruled border areas of the empire.

These titles of duke, count, and marquis came into the empire around the time of Emperor Constantine, based on German military customs. The title baron likely came from the Gauls and meant a great man who served kings or princes in war. The word baron comes from old words meaning “man,” and over time these men were called barones or barons (and varones in Spanish).
