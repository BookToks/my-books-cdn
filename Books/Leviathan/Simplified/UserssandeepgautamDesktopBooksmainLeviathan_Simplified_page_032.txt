Imagination is like the leftover feeling or motion that stays after we have sensed something, as explained in the first two chapters. When we do things on purpose like walking or talking, it always starts with a thought about where, how, or what to do. This shows that imagination is the first step inside us before any action. 

Even though people who don’t study this might think no motion happens if they can’t see the thing moving or the space it moves in is too small to notice, that doesn’t mean the motion isn’t there. If something moves over a big space, it has to move over the small parts of that space first. These tiny movements inside our body before we actually walk, talk, or hit something are called “endeavour.”

When this endeavour moves toward something that causes it, it’s called appetite or desire. Desire is the general word, but appetite often means the desire for food, like hunger or thirst. If the endeavour moves away from something, it’s called aversion. These words come from Latin and mean moving closer or moving away. The Greek words mean the same. Nature often pushes people to accept simple truths, but when they try to think beyond nature, they get confused. Some scholars say that just wanting to move isn’t real motion, but since some motion has to exist, they call it “metaphorical motion,” which doesn’t make sense because bodies and motions aren’t just words.

When people want something, we say they love it, and when they don’t want something, we say they hate it. Desire and love mean the same thing, but desire usually means the thing is not there, and love means it is. Similarly, aversion means the thing is not there, and hate means it is there.

Some desires and dislikes are born with us, like wanting food or needing to get rid of waste, which can also be called aversions because of how our bodies feel. But most other desires come from experience, from trying things and seeing how they affect us or others. If we don’t know or believe something exists, like Leviathan, we can only want to try it out to understand more.
