No one laughs at old jokes or cries over old problems.

Feeling sad because you realize you’re not good at something is shame. It’s like blushing because you think you’ve done something embarrassing. For young people, this shows they want to have a good reputation, which is a good thing. For older people, it means the same, but it’s not as good because it happens too late.

Not caring about having a good reputation is called being rude or shameless.

Feeling sad when someone else has a hard time is called pity. It happens because you imagine the same bad thing could happen to you. That’s why it’s also called compassion or, nowadays, “fellow-feeling.” People feel less pity when the bad thing happens because of someone’s own bad choices, and those who think they wouldn’t have the same problem feel even less pity.

Not caring about other people’s problems is called cruelty. This usually happens because people feel safe and don’t think the same thing could happen to them. I don’t think anyone enjoys seeing others suffer without a reason.

Feeling upset when a competitor does better in money, fame, or other good things is called emulation if it makes you want to work harder and be better. But if it makes you want to stop or hurt the competitor, it’s called envy.

When our mind keeps going back and forth between wanting and not wanting something, hoping and fearing about it, thinking about the good and bad things that could happen if we do or don’t do it, this process is called deliberation.

We don’t deliberate about things that already happened because we can’t change them. We also don’t think much about things we know are impossible because it feels useless. But sometimes we think something is possible and keep thinking about it, even if it’s not, and that’s still called deliberation. It’s called that because it ends our freedom to just do what we want.

This back-and-forth of wanting, not wanting, hoping, and fearing happens not only in people but in animals too. So, animals also think things over and make choices.
