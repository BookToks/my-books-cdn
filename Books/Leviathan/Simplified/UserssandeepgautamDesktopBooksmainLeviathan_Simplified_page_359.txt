When people say the Pope does not have the highest civil power in other countries, it means he doesn’t claim it like regular rulers do, who get their power because the people agree to follow them. It’s clear, and has been shown before, that all rulers get their power from the permission of the people they rule. Sometimes people choose a ruler to protect them from enemies, or sometimes they have to accept a ruler who wins by force.

The Pope, when he says he doesn’t have direct civil power over other countries, just means he doesn’t get his power that way. But he still claims power in another way—he says God gave it to him when he became Pope. No matter how he says it, the power is the same. If we accept his claim, he can remove kings or rulers whenever he thinks it’s necessary to save people’s souls, and he alone decides when that is.

This idea isn’t just from Bellarmine and other church teachers, but also from some church councils and Popes who have acted on it. For example, the Fourth Council of Lateran, under Pope Innocent III, said if a king doesn’t remove heretics after being warned by the Pope, and doesn’t fix things within a year, his people don’t have to obey him anymore. This has actually happened many times, like when Childeric, King of France, was removed; when Charlemagne got the Roman Empire; and in conflicts with kings of England, Navarre, and France.

Most rulers think this is unfair and causes problems. I wish all rulers would decide clearly—either be fully in charge themselves or give all power to the Pope. People can’t serve two bosses at once. So, rulers should either keep full control or let the Pope have it, so those who want to obey can do so safely. The difference between political power and spiritual power is just words.
