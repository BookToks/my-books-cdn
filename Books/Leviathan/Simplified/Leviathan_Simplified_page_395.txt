There is another part of the Bible that seems to support this idea. When St. Paul says, “What will those do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why are they baptized for the dead?” (1 Corinthians 15:29), some people think it means that back then, people were baptized on behalf of their dead friends. This was like promising that their dead friends would be ready to accept Jesus as their king when he comes again. This idea also suggests that because of this, there is no need for a place like purgatory where souls are punished after death. But both of these ideas sound strange to me, so I leave it to people who know the Bible well to decide if there is a clearer explanation that goes against these ideas.

What I do believe is clear from the Bible is that there is no mention of purgatory anywhere. There is no proof that souls need a place to stay without their bodies, not even for Lazarus during the four days he was dead, or for the souls that the Roman Church says are suffering in purgatory right now. God, who can give life to a lump of clay, can just as easily bring a dead person back to life and transform their old, broken body into a perfect, spiritual, and eternal one.

Another passage is in 1 Corinthians 3, which says that people who build with weak materials like straw or hay on the true foundation will have their work destroyed, but they themselves will be saved “as through fire.” Some say this fire means purgatory. But as I said before, this refers to a verse in Zechariah 13:9, where God says he will bring people through fire to refine them like silver and gold. This happens when the Messiah comes in power and glory on judgment day, when the world is destroyed by fire. The chosen people won’t be destroyed but will be purified, meaning their wrong beliefs and traditions will be burned away, and they will call on the true God. In the same way, the Apostle says that those who believe Jesus is the Christ but add wrong teachings will not be destroyed by this fire, but will go through it and be saved, while giving up their previous mistakes.
