A weak ruler has weak people; and weak people have rulers who want too much power over them.

Unnecessary laws are not good laws. They are just traps to take money. Where the ruler’s power is accepted, these laws are not needed. Where it is not accepted, these laws don’t protect the people enough.

The clarity of a law doesn’t come mainly from its words, but from explaining why the law was made. This explanation helps us understand what the lawmaker meant. When we know this, the law is easier to understand even if it uses fewer words. Too many words can confuse people and make the law harder to follow. It can also make people think they can find ways around the law. This causes many unnecessary legal cases. Long ago, laws were short, but over time they got longer. It feels like law writers and lawyers were fighting — writers tried to limit lawyers, and lawyers tried to avoid limits. It seems the lawyers won.

So, the job of a lawmaker (who is the top leader or group in any country) is to clearly explain why the law was made and keep the law itself short but clear and meaningful.

The ruler’s job is also to use punishments and rewards the right way. Punishment is not for revenge or anger, but to correct the offender or warn others by example. The harshest punishments should be for crimes that are most dangerous to the public. These include crimes against the government, crimes that disrespect justice, crimes that make people very angry, and crimes by people close to those in power that seem allowed if left unpunished. When people see injustice protected by power, they get angry not just at the wrongdoers but at the rulers too. For example, the king Tarquin was driven out of Rome because of the bad actions of his son, and the monarchy ended.

But for crimes done out of weakness like fear, great need, or ignorance about how serious the crime is, there should often be mercy without harming the country. Mercy is required by natural law when it is possible.
