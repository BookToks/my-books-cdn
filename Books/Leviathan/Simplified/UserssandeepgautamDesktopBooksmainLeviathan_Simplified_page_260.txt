So, this passage is not about just any word becoming human, but about God’s Son becoming human. He is called the Word because his coming was the fulfillment of God’s promise. In the same way, the Holy Spirit is called the Promise (Acts 1:4; Luke 24:49).

There are also times in the Bible when “the Word of God” means wise and fair words, even if they aren't said by a prophet or holy person. For example, Pharaoh Necho was a false god worshiper, but the advice he sent to King Josiah not to fight him was said to come from God’s mouth. Josiah didn’t listen and died in battle (2 Chronicles 35:21-23). The story is also told in the book of Esdras, but there Jeremiah, not Pharaoh, is the one speaking from God. We should trust what the official Bible says, even if the other writings differ.

“The Word of God” can also mean the ideas of reason and fairness that are written in people’s hearts, as shown in Psalms 37:31, Jeremiah 31:33, Deuteronomy 30:11,14, and other places.

The word “prophet” in the Bible can mean different things. Sometimes it means someone who speaks from God to people or from people to God. Other times, it means someone who predicts the future or someone who talks in a confusing way like someone who is upset. Most often, it means someone who speaks from God to the people. Moses, Samuel, Elijah, Isaiah, and Jeremiah were prophets. The high priest was also a prophet because he went into the holy place to ask God questions and then told the people what God said.

For example, when Caiaphas said it was better for one man to die for the people, John says he didn’t say this on his own but prophesied as high priest that one man would die for the nation (John 11:51). Also, people who teach in Christian churches are said to prophesy (1 Corinthians 14:3). God told Moses that Aaron would be his spokesman to the people, and in Exodus 7:1, this spokesman is called a prophet. God said, “I have made you like a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron will be your prophet.” 

In the sense of speaking from people to God, Abraham is called a prophet when God tells Abimelech in a dream, “Restore the man his wife, for he is a prophet and will pray for you” (Genesis 20).
