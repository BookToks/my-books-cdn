XXXIV: About the Meaning of Spirit, Angel, and Inspiration in the Holy Scriptures

Since the basis of all true thinking depends on the steady meaning of words, and in what I will explain next, these meanings don’t depend on what the writer wants or on how people usually talk, but on what the words mean in the Bible, it’s important to first figure out the meaning of certain words. These words can be confusing or unclear, so I want to make sure what they mean before I explain more.

I will start with the words body and spirit, which in school language are called substances—either physical (body) or non-physical (spirit).

The word body usually means something that takes up real space, not just something imagined. It is a real part of the universe, because the universe is made up of all bodies. There is no real part of the universe that isn’t a body, and nothing is a body if it’s not part of the universe.

Also, because bodies can change—they can look different to living creatures at different times—they are called substances. For example, a body can move or stay still, feel hot or cold, or have different colors, smells, tastes, or sounds at different times.

These changes we notice come from the way bodies affect our senses, and we call these changes “accidents” of the bodies. So, body and substance mean the same thing. Because of this, the phrase “incorporeal substance” doesn’t make sense, like saying “a body without a body.”

But regular people don’t call everything in the universe a body. They only call parts bodies if they can feel them or see that they block their view. So, air and things like air are usually not called bodies. Instead, when people notice their effects, they call them wind, breath, or spirits (because the Latin word spiritus means breath). For example, the air inside a living creature that gives it life and movement is called vital or animal spirits.
