To believe, trust, or depend on someone is to show respect for them. It means you think they are good and capable. Not trusting or believing them is disrespectful.

Listening carefully to what someone says, no matter what, is respect. It shows you think they are smart or interesting. Ignoring them by sleeping, leaving, or talking shows disrespect.

Doing things for someone that they see as respectful, or that the law or customs say are respectful, is to honor them. By doing this, you agree with what others see as respect. Refusing to do these things is disrespect.

Agreeing with someone's opinion is respect because it shows you believe they are wise. Disagreeing is disrespect and suggests they are wrong or foolish, especially if you disagree a lot.

Copying someone is respect because it means you really admire them. Copying someone you don’t like is disrespect.

Respecting the people someone else respects shows you respect them too. Respecting their enemies is disrespect.

Asking someone to help with advice or hard tasks is a way of respecting them because it shows you think they are smart or powerful. Not asking them when they want to help is disrespect.

All these ways of showing respect are natural, both inside and outside of countries. But in countries where leaders decide what shows respect, there are other ways too.

A ruler shows respect to a person by giving them titles, jobs, or special roles that the ruler decides mean respect.

The king of Persia showed respect to Mordecai by having him ride through the streets in the king’s clothes, on the king’s horse, with a crown, and a prince announcing, “This is how the king honors someone.” But another time, the king let someone wear his robe only as a joke, like a fool, which was disrespectful.

So, respect given by the government comes from the leader’s choices and can change. This kind of respect is called civil honor and includes jobs, titles, and symbols like coats of arms. People respect those who have these because it shows they have power and favor from the government.
