People only believed in what the Apostles taught. The Apostles taught that Jesus was the Christ, which means the King who would save them and rule forever in the world to come. They said Jesus was not dead but had risen from the dead, gone up to heaven, and would come back one day to judge the world. Everyone would be judged and rewarded based on what they did.

None of the Apostles said that they or anyone else was the only person who could explain the Scriptures. Explaining the laws is part of running a kingdom, but the Apostles didn’t have a kingdom to run. They prayed, “Let your kingdom come,” and told their followers to obey their local rulers. The New Testament wasn’t all put together yet. Each gospel writer explained their own gospel, and each Apostle explained their own letters. Jesus told the Jews to “Search the Scriptures,” because the Scriptures show proof that he is the Christ. If he didn’t want them to understand the Scriptures for themselves, he would have explained everything himself or told them to listen only to the priests.

When there was a problem, the Apostles and church leaders met to decide what to teach and how to explain the Scriptures to everyone. But they didn’t stop people from reading and thinking about the Bible on their own. The Apostles sent letters and other writings to help teach the churches. These would have been useless if people weren’t allowed to think about what they meant. This stayed the same until there were pastors who could officially explain the Bible and everyone agreed to accept their explanations. But that didn’t happen until kings became pastors or pastors became kings.

There are two ways a writing can be called “canonical.” A canon is a rule, and a rule tells someone how to act. Rules given by a teacher or a friend aren’t laws because the person doesn’t have to obey them. But when rules come from someone you must obey, they become laws. So the question is about who has the power to make the Scriptures, which guide Christian faith, into laws.
