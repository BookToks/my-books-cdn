Peter, the Bishop of Rome, is often said to have started the Bible, but many people don’t agree with that. The first time we know the Bible was officially recommended to Christian churches was at the Council of Laodicea in the year 364 after Christ.

At that time, some church leaders acted like they were in charge of everything. They didn’t respect emperors who were Christians and thought of them as just followers, while they saw non-Christian emperors as enemies. They tried to make their teachings into strict rules, not just advice, and believed it was okay to trick people if it made them follow Christian teachings better. But even so, I don’t think they changed the Bible on purpose. If they wanted to, they would have made it support their power more. So, I believe the Old and New Testaments we have now are true records of what the prophets and Apostles said and did.

Some books called the Apocrypha might also be true, but they aren’t in the official Bible because they weren’t written in Hebrew. After Alexander the Great took over Asia, most educated Jews spoke Greek. The Bible was translated into Greek by seventy Hebrew translators, and we still have works by Jewish writers like Philo and Josephus written in Greek. But it’s the Church’s decision that makes a book part of the Bible, not just who wrote it.

Even though different people wrote these books, they all share the same spirit and goal: to explain the kingdom of God, made up of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The book of Genesis starts with the creation and the early history of God’s people, leading to their time in Egypt. The next four books, called the Books of Moses, show God choosing His people and giving them laws to live by.

Books like Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and Samuel tell the story of God’s people until they rejected God and asked for a king, like other nations. The rest of the Old Testament shows the line of King David, who was the ancestor of Jesus, the Savior and Son of God, whose coming was predicted by the prophets. The New Testament writers tell about Jesus’ life and his claim to God’s kingdom.

Finally, the Acts and Letters of the Apostles talk about the coming of the Holy Spirit and the authority given to them and their successors to guide both Jews and other nations.
