Usually, people do things in a country because they are afraid of the law, and those things are things they could choose not to do.

Freedom and necessity can go together: like water has the freedom to flow but also has to go down the river, people do things freely because they want to, but every choice comes from something else, in a long chain of causes that starts with God. So, if someone could see all these causes connected, they would see that people’s choices happen out of necessity. God, who controls everything, sees that people’s freedom to choose is mixed with the necessity of doing what God wants, no more and no less. People might do things God doesn’t order, but they can’t want anything without God’s will causing that desire. If God’s will didn’t make people’s will necessary, then people’s freedom would go against God’s power and freedom. This is enough to explain natural freedom, which is the real kind of freedom.

But since people want peace and to protect themselves, they have made an artificial person called a Commonwealth. They also made artificial chains called civil laws. People agreed to tie one end of these chains to the government or ruler and the other end to themselves. These chains are naturally weak, but they can hold because people are afraid of the punishment for breaking them.

Now, I am talking about the freedom of people under these chains. Since no country can have laws for every single thing people do or say (which is impossible), people have the freedom to do what they think is best for themselves in all actions not covered by laws. If we think about freedom as just not being locked up or in chains, it would be silly for people to complain about the freedom they clearly have.
