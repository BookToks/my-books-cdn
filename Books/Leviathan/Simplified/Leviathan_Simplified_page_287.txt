But it doesn’t make sense for God’s followers to have a place as high as His throne or even higher than His footstool. That would not fit the respect a king deserves, and I can’t find any clear Bible verse that says so.

From what has been said about God’s kingdom and salvation, it’s not hard to understand what “the world to come” means. The Bible talks about three worlds: the old world, the present world, and the world to come. The first world was from Adam until the big flood. St. Peter says, “God didn’t spare the old world but saved Noah, who was a preacher of goodness, and brought the flood on the wicked people.” The second world is the one we live in now. Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world,” meaning He came to teach people how to be saved and to bring back His Father’s kingdom through His teachings. The world to come is what St. Peter talks about when he says, “We look forward to new heavens and a new earth.” This is the future world where Christ will come down from heaven with great power, send His angels, gather His chosen people from everywhere, and rule over them forever under His Father.

To save a sinner, someone must be freed first. If a person has done wrong, they owe a penalty and must pay it, or someone else must pay it for them. Since God is the one offended and has all power, this payment must be made before saving the person, as God requires.

But this payment is not about making up for the exact amount of wrong done, because no sinner or good person can do that for someone else. When a person hurts another, they can fix it by giving back or paying, but sin can’t be taken away like that. Otherwise, people would think it’s okay to sin as long as they can pay for it.

However, God can forgive sins if a person is truly sorry, either freely or after accepting a penalty God chooses. In the Old Testament, God usually accepted some kind of sacrifice. Forgiving sin isn’t unfair, even if there was a punishment promised.

Even people keep their promises when good things are promised, but threats don’t always make them keep their word. So it’s even less likely that threats would force God, who is much more merciful than people, to act against His mercy.
