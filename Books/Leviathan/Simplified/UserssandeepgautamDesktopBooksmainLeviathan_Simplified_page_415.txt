The Church of Rome copies some old customs in their holy days. They had their wild parties called bacchanalia, and we have our wakes that are similar. They had saturnalia, and we have carnivals and Shrove Tuesday when servants get some freedom. They had a parade for Priapus, and we have Maypole celebrations where people bring in, set up, and dance around the poles. Dancing is a kind of worship. They had a procession called Ambarvalia, and we have a parade around the fields during Rogation week.  

I don’t think these are all the old ceremonies still in the Church since the first time Gentiles became Christians, but they are the ones I remember now. If someone studied the old religious rites of the Greeks and Romans carefully, I’m sure they would find many more old empty bottles of their pagan ways that the leaders of the Roman Church, either by mistake or on purpose, have filled again with Christian ideas. These new mixtures will eventually break.

Philosophy means knowledge gained by thinking about how things are made or how they work. It helps us understand how to make or do things that people need, as much as possible with the materials and skills we have. For example, a geometrician studies shapes and finds out their properties by reasoning. Then, using those properties, they find new ways to build shapes, to measure land and water, and for many other uses. An astronomer watches the sun and stars moving and figures out why we have day and night and different seasons, so they can keep track of time. Other sciences work the same way.

By this meaning, we shouldn’t call experience part of philosophy. Experience is about learning from past events and is found in animals as well as humans. It’s just remembering what happened before, but if you miss any small detail, the result may fail even if you were careful. True philosophy produces general, eternal, and unchanging truths by right reasoning.

Also, we should not call false conclusions philosophy because if someone reasons correctly and understands the words, they can’t end up with an error. We shouldn’t call knowledge philosophy if it comes from supernatural revelation, because that’s not learned by reasoning. And we shouldn’t call what is learned from books philosophy if it’s just faith based on authority, not reasoning from cause to effect or effect to cause. That’s faith, not knowledge.
