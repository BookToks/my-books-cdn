But this right couldn’t be taken by force. It was about keeping everyone safe by agreeing together to choose leaders with real power to protect and guide them. If there had been someone super powerful, they could have ruled and protected everyone however they wanted. So, those with unstoppable power naturally have control over others. This power and the right to punish people come from God, not because He’s kind, but because He’s all-powerful. Even though punishment is meant for sin, the right to punish doesn’t always come from people’s sins but from God’s power.

People have long wondered why bad people often do well, while good people go through hard times. This is the same question about why God gives some people good things and others bad things in life. It’s a tough question that has made many people, even smart thinkers and holy people, doubt God’s plan. David said, “God is good to those who are honest, but I almost slipped when I saw bad people doing well.” Job also questioned God for the suffering he faced even though he was good.

God Himself answered Job’s question, not by blaming Job for sin, but by showing His own power. Job’s friends said he must have sinned because he suffered, but Job said he was innocent. God proved Job’s innocence by reminding him of His own power, like when He said, “Where were you when I created the earth?” This showed Job was right and his friends were wrong.

This idea matches what Jesus said about a man born blind: neither the man nor his parents sinned, but God allowed it so His works could be shown. Even though it’s said that death came into the world because of sin, that doesn’t mean God couldn’t have punished someone who didn’t sin, just like He punishes animals that can’t sin.
