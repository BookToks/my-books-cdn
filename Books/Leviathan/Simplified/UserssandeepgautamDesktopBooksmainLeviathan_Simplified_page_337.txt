First, we need to remember that deciding what beliefs are okay for peace and what subjects should be taught always belongs to the highest power in any country. This power can be one person or a group. It’s clear even to the simplest person that people’s actions come from what they think is good or bad for themselves. 

If people believe that obeying the ruler will harm them more than disobeying, they will break the laws. This can cause the country to fall apart and lead to chaos and civil war. All governments were created to stop this from happening. That’s why, in countries with no religion, rulers have been called leaders or guides of the people, because no one could teach the people without their permission.

This right of rulers didn’t disappear when they became Christians. Jesus didn’t say that kings should lose their power just because they believed in him. Kings still have to keep their power to keep peace and protect their people from enemies. So Christian kings are still the main leaders of their people and can choose who teaches the Church and the people.

Also, the right to choose these teachers can belong to the Church, like it did when the Apostles lived. But even then, the civil ruler has this right because he represents the Church. When Christians in a country pick their pastor, it’s actually the ruler who chooses him because it’s done with his permission. It’s like when a town picks a mayor; it only counts if the ruler agrees. So, even if history shows people or church members choosing pastors, it’s always because the ruler allowed it.
