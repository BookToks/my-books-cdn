The best advice about things that only affect a country’s own people, and not other countries, should come from the people living in each area. They know what they need the most. Their requests should be listened to carefully, as long as they don’t go against the main rights of the government. Without those main rights, the country cannot survive.

A top army leader who isn’t liked won’t be respected or feared by their soldiers, and won’t do a good job. The leader has to work hard, be brave, friendly, generous, and lucky to earn both respect and love from the soldiers. This popularity makes soldiers want to do well and be brave to gain the leader’s favor. It also helps the leader punish bad or rebellious soldiers when needed. But if the leader’s loyalty isn’t trusted, being popular with soldiers can be dangerous for the government, especially if the leader is chosen by a group that isn’t liked. So, it’s important for the people and the government to pick leaders who are both good and loyal.

When the leader of the whole country is popular and loved by the people, there is no problem if a subject is popular, too. Soldiers usually won’t go against their leader, even if they like their captain, as long as they love the leader and believe in their cause. That’s why people who have taken power by force always try to make their rule seem fair, so the people won’t be ashamed to accept them. Having a real, known right to rule is so powerful that the ruler doesn’t have to do much to get people’s loyalty—people just need to see that the ruler can control their own family and that enemies have no army. Most people have never been fully happy with the way things are.

About how one ruler treats another, which is called the law of nations, I don’t need to explain here because it’s the same as the law of nature. Every ruler has the same right to keep their people safe as any person has to protect their own body.
