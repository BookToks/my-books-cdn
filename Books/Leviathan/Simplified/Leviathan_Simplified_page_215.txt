Punishing the leaders and teachers who cause trouble, not the poor people who are tricked, can help the country by setting an example. Being harsh to people is punishing their ignorance, which is often the fault of the ruler because they didn’t teach them better.

Similarly, it is the ruler’s job to give rewards in a way that benefits the country. Rewards are meant to encourage people who have served the country well, paying them fairly but without wasting public money. This way, others will want to serve well and learn how to do it better.

Buying off troublemakers with money or favors is not a real reward because rewards are for past good service, not for stopping bad behavior. It shows fear, not thanks, and harms the country. It’s like fighting a monster that grows more heads each time you cut one off. When one troublemaker is bought off, many more appear, hoping to get the same reward. Bad behavior spreads like a business when it can be paid for. Though this might delay a civil war, it makes the danger bigger and the country’s ruin more certain. So, it’s the ruler’s duty to protect the country by stopping troublemakers early, even if it’s a bit risky, rather than waiting until the problem is much worse.

Another important job of the ruler is to pick good advisers. Advisers are people who help plan what to do next, not just judges of past actions. In democracies or groups where power is shared, there is no real choice of advisers because everyone advises themselves. But in a monarchy, the ruler must choose the best people to give advice. If the ruler doesn’t do this, they are not doing their job properly.
