If there really was a spiritual government separate from a regular government, then its leader could go to war to protect themselves if they were hurt or felt threatened. This would mean they could overthrow, kill, or fight enemies. But by the same idea, a regular government leader could also go to war against the spiritual leader if they felt threatened, which is probably not what Cardinal Bellarmine meant.

But there is no spiritual government in this world. That belongs to the kingdom of Christ, which Jesus said is not part of this world but will come in the next life, after people who lived good lives and believed in Him rise again with spiritual bodies. Then, Jesus will judge the world, defeat His enemies, and start this spiritual kingdom. Until then, since no one here has a spiritual body, there can’t be a spiritual government among people alive now. Preachers who teach about this kingdom aren’t a government, as I have already shown.

The third point is this: “Christians shouldn’t accept a king who tries to make them believe wrong things. But only the Pope can decide if a king is leading people the wrong way. So, the Pope has the right to decide if a king should be removed.” I say both ideas are wrong. People of any religion who do not obey their king, even if the king makes laws about religion, break their faith and God’s law. Also, only the king can decide what is heresy (wrong belief) among his people. Heresy is just a private opinion that goes against what the king says should be taught. So, if something is officially taught, it can’t be heresy, and kings who allow it aren’t heretics. Heretics are just private people who stubbornly hold beliefs their kings have banned.
