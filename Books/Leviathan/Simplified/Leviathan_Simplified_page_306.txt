A person, as I explained before, is someone who is shown or represented by something else. So, God, who has been shown in three different ways, can be called three persons. Even though the Bible doesn’t use the words “Person” or “Trinity” for God. St. John says, “There are three that give witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.” This doesn’t contradict the idea of three persons, because a person means someone who is represented by another.

For example, God the Father is one person when shown by Moses; another person when shown by His Son; and a third person when shown by the Apostles or teachers who followed them. But all three are still the same one God. Someone might ask what these three are testifying about.

St. John says they bear witness that “God has given us eternal life through His Son.” If you wonder where this proof is, it’s easy to find. God showed it through miracles done first by Moses, then by His Son, and then by the Apostles who received the Holy Spirit. All of them represented God and talked about Jesus Christ.

The Apostles especially had the job of proving Jesus rose from the dead. For example, when they chose a new Apostle to replace Judas Iscariot, St. Peter said that person had to have been with them from John’s baptism until Jesus was taken up to heaven, to be a witness of His resurrection. This explains what St. John meant by “bearing witness.”

There is also another group of three witnesses on earth. St. John says, “There are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree as one.” This means God’s Spirit and two important ceremonies, baptism and the Lord’s Supper, all work together to prove to believers that they have eternal life. St. John adds, “Anyone who believes in the Son of Man has this witness inside them.”
