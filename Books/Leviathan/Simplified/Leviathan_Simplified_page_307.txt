In this Trinity on earth, the unity is not about being the same thing; the spirit, the water, and the blood are different, but they all tell the same story. In heaven, the Trinity is made up of three persons who are actually one God, but they show themselves at different times and in different ways.

To sum up, the idea of the Trinity from the Bible is this: God is always one and the same. God showed up as Moses, as His Son who became a man, and as the Apostles. The Holy Spirit, which spoke through the Apostles, is God; the Son is both God and man; and the Father, who is Jesus’ Father, is God too. That’s why the names Father, Son, and Holy Spirit don’t appear in the Old Testament—they come from different people representing God over time.

So, we see that Jesus gave the church’s power to the Apostles. To help them use that power, they were given the Holy Spirit, sometimes called the paraclete, which means helper or comforter.

Now, let’s think about what this power actually was and who had it.

Cardinal Bellarmine talked a lot about the Pope’s church power and asked if it should be a monarchy, aristocracy, or democracy—all types of strong power. But if it turns out that Jesus only gave the Apostles the power to share His kingdom, to convince people to accept it, and to teach those who do, then all those arguments don’t matter.

I already explained that Christ’s kingdom is not part of this world. So, unless His ministers are kings, they can’t demand obedience in His name. If the King of all doesn’t have power on earth, how can His officers ask people to obey them?
