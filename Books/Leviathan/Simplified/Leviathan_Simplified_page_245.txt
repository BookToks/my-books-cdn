Leviathan/245 Also, the phrase “And Jesus full of the Holy Ghost” (Luke 4:1), which in Matthew 4:1 and Mark 1:12 says “of the Holy Spirit,” can mean that Jesus was very eager to do the work God the Father sent him to do. But saying it means Jesus was filled with a ghost is wrong. That would mean God Himself (since Jesus is God) was filled with God, which doesn’t make sense. 

I don’t know why we started translating “spirits” as “ghosts,” which doesn’t really mean anything real, just made-up things in people’s minds. The word “spirit” here doesn’t mean that. It either means a real thing or, as a metaphor, some special power or feeling in the mind or body.

Jesus’ followers thought he was a spirit when they saw him walking on water (Matthew 14:26, Mark 6:49). They meant a real, physical kind of spirit, not just a vision or ghost. It says they all saw him, and hallucinations don’t happen to a whole group at the same time like that—only real bodies do.

In the same way, when the apostles thought Jesus was a spirit after he rose (Luke 24:3,7), or when Peter was freed from prison and the maid said he was at the door but the others said it was his angel (Acts 12:15), they meant a real, physical being. This shows they believed in actual spirits or angels that are not made up, but real. Jews and Greeks called these beings spirits, angels, or demons.

Some of these spirits can be real and have a physical form, but a very subtle one. God can create these beings by His power, just like He made everything else, and use them as messengers to do His will in amazing ways. These beings have bodies that take up space and can move around, so they aren’t “ghosts” without bodies, which would be nothing at all.

If you think of “corporeal” as something you can see or touch, then spirits are not that kind. They are real, but invisible and very thin, like a substance that has size and shape but you can’t see it with your eyes.
