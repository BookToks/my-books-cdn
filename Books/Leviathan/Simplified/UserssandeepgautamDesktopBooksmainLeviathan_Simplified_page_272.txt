Our Savior didn’t do many miracles in His own country because people there didn’t believe in Him (Matthew 13:58). In Mark 6:5, it even says He couldn’t do any miracles there. It wasn’t because He didn’t want to show His power—that would be disrespecting God. It also wasn’t because miracles don’t help people believe. The point of all miracles by Moses, the prophets, Jesus, and His followers was to bring people into the Church.

But miracles only worked to bring in the people God had chosen to be saved. Since Jesus was sent by God the Father, He couldn’t use His power to change the hearts of those God had already rejected. Some people say the phrase “He could not” really means “He would not,” but that’s not how the Greek language works. Saying “He would not” instead of “He could not” here can confuse Christians and make them think Jesus could only do miracles for people who already believed.

From what I’ve explained about miracles, we can say this: a miracle is a special act of God, outside of natural laws, done to show His chosen people that an important messenger has come to save them.

From this, we understand two things: first, miracles don’t happen because the prophet has some special power. Instead, God does the miracle directly, without using the prophet as the cause.

Second, no demon, angel, or other spirit can do a true miracle.

If someone does something amazing, it must be either because they know natural science or because they use magic words. If they do it by their own power, that means there’s some power not from God, and everyone denies that. If their power is given by God, then it’s natural, not a miracle.

Some parts of the Bible talk about magic that looks like miracles. For example, when Moses’ rod turned into a serpent, the magicians in Egypt did the same by their magic (Exodus 7).
