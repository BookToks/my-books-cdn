This was the goal of our smartest king, King James, who wanted to unite England and Scotland. If he had succeeded, it probably would have stopped the civil wars that both countries are sadly going through right now. So, it’s not wrong for a king to decide who will take over after him by leaving a will. Even though some kings made mistakes, this idea is still legal. 

One more reason this is okay is that any problems caused by giving the kingdom to someone from another place can also happen when marrying people from other countries, because then the right to rule can pass to them too. But everyone agrees that kind of situation is allowed.

A commonwealth by acquisition means the ruler gets power by force. This happens when people, alone or in a group, agree—usually because they’re scared of death or being captured—to let one person or group control their lives and freedom.

This kind of rule is different from when people choose their ruler by agreement. In those cases, people pick a leader because they trust or respect them. But when power is taken by force, people obey because they are afraid of the ruler. Both cases involve fear, which is important to understand for those who think agreements made out of fear aren’t real. 

If that were true, no one in any government would have to obey rules. It’s true that in a government, promises made out of fear don’t count if they go against the law. But that’s not because the promise was made in fear, it’s because the person who made the promise doesn’t have the right to promise that thing. 

Also, if someone can keep their promise but doesn’t, it’s not the broken promise that frees them, but the decision of the ruler. If a person breaks a promise they could keep, they do something wrong. But if the ruler forgives them, then they are forgiven by the one who made the promise necessary in the first place.
