I already explained in Chapter 20 that to honor someone means to really respect their power, and we decide how much by comparing them to others. But since no one is more powerful than God, giving Him anything less than infinite respect is actually dishonoring Him. So, true honor is something deep inside our hearts.

Our inner feelings show up in what we say and do, and these actions are called worship. Worship means praying, promising, obeying, working hard to serve, and all actions that show we don’t want to upset or want to please someone. Whether we mean it or just pretend, these actions look like respect and are called honor.

When we show respect to people like kings or leaders, that’s called civil worship. But when we show respect to God, no matter the words or actions, that’s divine worship. For example, bowing down to a king is civil worship, but taking off your hat in a church because you believe it’s God’s house is divine worship.

Some people try to guess the difference between divine and civil worship by certain words, but that’s mistaken. In old times, there were two kinds of servants: slaves, who had no freedom and were fully controlled by their masters, called "Douloi," and paid or voluntary servants, called "Teteis," who worked by choice and had agreements with their masters. Both kinds of servants worked for others, and the word "Latres" was used for anyone working for someone else, whether as a slave or a helper.

So, "Latrea" means any kind of service, but "Douleia" means service only by slaves. Both words are used in the Bible to talk about serving God, sometimes without making a clear difference.
