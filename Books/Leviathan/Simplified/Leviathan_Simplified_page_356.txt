Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world.” But if someone can’t make decisions between people, they don’t really have any real power. Still, Jesus gave his followers the power to preach and baptize everywhere, as long as their own rulers didn’t stop them. Jesus and his Apostles also told us to obey our own rulers in everything.

Some people say that bishops get their power from the Pope, but the Pope doesn’t have power in other rulers' lands, so this argument doesn't work. Actually, all bishops get their power from their own rulers when they have it, and I’ll explain why.

First, in the Bible, Moses couldn’t handle all the work alone, so God told him to pick seventy elders and shared some of Moses’ spirit with them. This didn’t make Moses weaker; it showed that the elders got their power from him. Since Moses was the leader of the Jewish people, it means they got their authority from their ruler. This shows that bishops get their authority from their civil rulers, not the Pope—except in the Pope’s own land.

Second, in a monarchy, all power belongs to one person and others get power from them. The Church is also ruled like a monarchy. This is good for Christian kings because they are the rulers of their own people, which is also their Church. The Pope’s power isn’t like a king’s. Even if he were St. Peter, his power is only about teaching, not ruling or forcing people. God wants people to obey willingly, not because they are forced.
