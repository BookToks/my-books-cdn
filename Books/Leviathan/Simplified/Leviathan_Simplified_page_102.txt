The second type is someone who agrees to do something for another person, but only if that person does not do it themselves by a certain time.  

These people are usually called sureties, which is a Latin word.  

If it’s about paying a debt, they are called praedes.  

If it’s about showing up in court or before a judge, they are called vades.
