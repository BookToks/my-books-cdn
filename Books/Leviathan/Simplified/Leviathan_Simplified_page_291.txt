God said, “All the nations on earth will be blessed because I know Abraham. Abraham will teach his children and family to follow God’s ways.” From this, we can understand that people who don’t hear directly from God should follow the commands given by their leader, just like Abraham’s family did.

So, in any country, if people don’t have a special message from God that says otherwise, they should obey their ruler’s laws about religious actions and public worship. But what people believe inside their hearts is between them and God, and rulers can’t control that because only God knows what’s in a person’s heart.

This leads to another idea: Abraham was allowed to punish anyone in his family who claimed to have a private message from God if it went against what Abraham said. So today, rulers have the right to punish anyone who goes against the laws by following their own private spiritual ideas, because the ruler has the same role as Abraham did in his family.

There’s also a third point: just like only Abraham could understand and explain God’s words to his family, only the ruler in a Christian country can decide what really comes from God. God spoke only to Abraham, and Abraham was the only one who could explain God’s words to his family. So, the ruler has the same responsibility to interpret God’s word for the people.

This promise from God was renewed with Abraham’s son Isaac, and later with Jacob. But after that, there were no more until the Israelites were freed from Egypt and reached Mount Sinai. Then Moses renewed the promise, making the Israelites God’s special kingdom, with Moses as God’s leader at that time. Later, the leadership was passed to Aaron and his family to serve God as priests forever.
