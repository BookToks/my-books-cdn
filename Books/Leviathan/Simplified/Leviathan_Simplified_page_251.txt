In the writings of religious people, especially in sermons and devotional books, the "kingdom of God" usually means everlasting happiness after death, in the highest heaven. They also call this the kingdom of glory. Sometimes, it means the beginning of that happiness, called sanctification or the kingdom of grace. But it never means God’s actual rule over people who choose Him as their king, which is the true meaning of a kingdom.

Actually, in most parts of the Bible, the kingdom of God means a real kingdom. It was made when the people of Israel chose God as their king by making a special agreement with Him. God promised to give them the land of Canaan. Only rarely is the kingdom of God used as a metaphor. When it is, it means God’s control over sin, and this only happens in the New Testament. This kind of control doesn’t take away God’s full power as king.

From the very beginning, God ruled over everyone by His power. But He also had special people He gave direct commands to, like one person talking to another. For example, God ruled over Adam and told him not to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. When Adam disobeyed and ate from the tree, trying to be like God by deciding right and wrong on his own, he was punished by losing eternal life. Later, God punished almost everyone for their sins with a huge flood, saving only eight people. These eight made up God’s kingdom at that time.

After this, God spoke to Abraham and made a special agreement with him. God said, “I will make a promise between me and you and your children forever. I will be your God and give you and your children the land of Canaan forever.” (Genesis 17:7-8) Abraham promised to obey God, and God promised to give him the land forever. As a sign of this promise, God told Abraham to have his sons circumcised (Genesis 16:11). This promise is called the Old Covenant or Testament. It is a contract between God and Abraham, where Abraham and his children agree to follow God’s special laws, in addition to the basic moral laws they already had.
