God said clearly about Joshua: “He will stand before Eleazar the priest, who will ask God for advice for him; when the priest says go, they will go, and when he says come, they will come—Joshua and all the people of Israel with him.” (Numbers 27:21)

So, the highest power to make war and peace was with the priest. The highest power to judge also belonged to the high priest because they kept the Book of the Law. The priests and Levites were judges for smaller civil cases, as we see in Deuteronomy 17:8-10. When it came to worshiping God, everyone agreed that the high priest had the top authority until the time of Saul. This means the high priest had both civil and religious power. This should be true for anyone who rules by God’s authority, meaning their power comes directly from God.

After Joshua died and until Saul became king, the Book of Judges often says, “there was no king in Israel.” It even adds that “everyone did what was right in their own eyes.” This means there was no real leader or ruler in Israel during that time. After Joshua and Eleazar died, a new generation grew up that didn’t know the Lord or what He had done for Israel. Instead, they did bad things and worshiped false gods called Baalim (Judges 2:10).

The Jews wanted signs and miracles to believe in their leaders, both before and after they agreed to follow Moses. Signs and miracles were meant to help people believe, not to stop them from breaking their faith once they had accepted it, because people should follow their promises naturally. If we look at who had the right to rule, the high priest still had the highest power. The judges, who were chosen by God to save the people from their enemies, didn’t have normal power but special power for a short time. People obeyed them not because they had the right to rule, but because they respected them for their wisdom, bravery, or luck. Even Samuel had this special, temporary role.
