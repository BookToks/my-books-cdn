This passage talks about when different parts of the Bible were written, showing that many were written long after the events they describe.

For example, the Book of Joshua and the Book of Judges mention things that happened much later than Joshua’s time. Judges 18:30 even says that Jonathan and his sons were priests until the land was captured, which was long after Joshua.

The Books of Samuel were also written after David’s time. One example is when David divided the spoils of war and made a rule that lasted “to this day,” meaning the writer lived much later. Another example is when David named a place Perez-uzzah, and the writer says it’s still called that “to this day,” showing the book was written long after David lived.

The Books of Kings and Chronicles mention records that lasted until the writer’s own time, which was after the Babylonian captivity. These books also refer to other writings and prophets, proving they were written later than the events they describe.

The Books of Esdras and Nehemiah were definitely written after the people returned from captivity because they talk about rebuilding Jerusalem, renewing their agreements, and setting up new rules.

The story of Queen Esther happens during the captivity, so whoever wrote it must have lived at that time or later.

The Book of Job doesn’t say when it was written, but it shows that Job was a real person.
