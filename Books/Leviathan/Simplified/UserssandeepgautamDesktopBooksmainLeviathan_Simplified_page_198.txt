The barons gained a lot of power when William Rufus used them to help him take the throne from his older brother. This power became so big that it didn’t fit with the king’s authority, and the barons kept this power when they rebelled against King John with help from the French.

This kind of problem doesn’t only happen in monarchies. In ancient Rome, the government was called “The Senate and People of Rome.” But neither the senate nor the people had all the power. This caused fights and rebellions, like those led by Tiberius Gracchus and others. Later, wars between the senate and the people happened under leaders like Marius and Sylla, and then under Pompey and Caesar. These fights ended the democracy and brought in a monarchy.

The people of Athens made a rule that no one could suggest starting a war over the island of Salamis, or they would be killed. But if Solon hadn’t pretended to be crazy and acted weird while secretly talking about it, the people would have faced a constant enemy right near their city. This shows how all governments, even if their power is small, have to deal with tricky problems like this.

Next, I notice problems in a government caused by bad ideas. One bad idea is that every person can decide for themselves what is right and wrong. This is true in nature where there are no laws, and sometimes in governments when the law doesn’t cover something. But usually, the law decides what is right and wrong, and the lawmaker represents the government. When people believe they can ignore laws and do what they want, the government becomes confused and weak.

Another bad idea is that anything a person does against their conscience is a sin. This comes from thinking they are the judge of right and wrong. But a person’s conscience is the same as their judgment, and both can be wrong. Someone without laws might always sin if they follow only their conscience. But in a government, the law is like the public conscience, and people agree to follow it instead of just their own judgment.
