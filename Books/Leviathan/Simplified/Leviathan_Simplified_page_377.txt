But what kind of unreasonable king would, knowing that one of his people is waiting for Jesus to come back after the world ends and plans to follow Him then (which is what believing in Jesus means), still expect that person to obey his laws now? And then want to kill or punish that person for it, even though all Christians are supposed to follow the king’s laws in the meantime?

That’s enough said about the kingdom of God and church rules. I’m not trying to share my own ideas here, just to show what I think naturally follows from Christian politics (which come from the Bible). This supports the power of rulers and the duty of their people.

When I use the Bible, I try to avoid confusing or unclear parts. I only use verses that are simple and fit well with the whole Bible, which was written to bring back God’s kingdom through Jesus.

It’s not just the exact words but the author’s main purpose that helps us understand writing correctly. People who focus on just one verse without thinking about the whole message don’t really understand it clearly. Instead, they throw bits of Scripture around to confuse others, which is something people who want to trick others, not find the truth, often do.
