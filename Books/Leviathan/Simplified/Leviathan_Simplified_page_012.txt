When we try to talk about the fading feeling of something we once sensed (like an image in our mind), we call that imagination, like I said before. But when we talk about this feeling getting weaker, old, and in the past, we call it memory. So, imagination and memory are basically the same thing but have different names depending on how we think about them.

Having a lot of memories, or memories of many things, is called experience.

Imagination only works with things we have seen or sensed before, either all at once or in parts at different times. Imagining the whole thing as we first saw it is called simple imagination, like picturing a man or a horse we’ve seen before. But when we mix different things we’ve seen at different times, like imagining a centaur from a man and a horse, that’s called compound imagination. Also, when someone imagines themselves as a hero or famous person because of reading stories, that’s compound imagination too—basically a made-up idea in the mind. Sometimes, when we stare at something like the sun or geometric shapes for a long time, we keep seeing those images even after looking away, like seeing the sun’s image in our eyes or shapes in the dark. These kinds of images don’t have a special name because they don’t come up often in everyday talk.

The images people see when they sleep are called dreams. These dreams, like all imaginations, come from things we’ve sensed before, either fully or in pieces. When we sleep, our brain and nerves, which help us sense things, are kind of numb and don’t easily react to outside stuff. So, dreams don’t come from outside things but from movements inside our body. When parts inside us get upset, they affect the brain and cause these pictures or imaginations to appear like we’re awake. But since our senses are numb and can’t bring in new images to replace these, dreams become clearer than our thoughts when awake. Because of this, it’s often really hard, and some say impossible, to clearly tell the difference between what’s real and what’s a dream.
