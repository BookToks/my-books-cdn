It’s useless to give land to the government if they can just sell or give it away, which they actually do through their representatives.

Just like how land is shared inside the country, deciding where and what people can trade with other countries is up to the ruler. If private people made these choices, some might help the enemy by trading harmful things or bring in stuff that tastes good but is bad or useless for the country. So, only the ruler should decide what places and goods are okay for foreign trade.

Also, it’s not enough for everyone to just own some land or a few useful skills. Since every skill is important for people’s survival or happiness, people need to share and trade what they have with each other. That’s why the ruler must set the rules for how people can make deals like buying, selling, borrowing, or renting, and how these agreements should be understood as official.

By "concoction," I mean turning all goods that aren’t eaten right away but saved for later into something of equal value that is easy to carry so people can have food wherever they go. This is basically gold, silver, and money. Since gold and silver are valued almost everywhere, they help compare the worth of things between countries. Money, made by the ruler, helps measure the value of things inside the country.
