What is said here about the rights of a group that runs a province or colony also applies to groups that run a town, a university, a college, a church, or any other kind of government over people.

Usually, if someone in a group feels they have been treated unfairly by the group itself, their complaint is handled by the highest authority, called the sovereign, or by judges chosen by the sovereign. It is not up to the group to decide on the complaint. The group is like a fellow member, except in a sovereign assembly, where if the sovereign does not act as judge in their own case, then no one else can.

In any organized group, the best way to manage trade with other countries is to have an assembly made up of all its members. This means that anyone who invests money can join in the discussions and decisions if they want. Merchants, who buy and sell goods and ship them to and from different places, join together to form one group. Most merchants cannot afford to ship goods on their own, so they work together in a society where everyone shares the profits based on how much they invest. This group is not a political body because it doesnâ€™t have a single leader to make laws beyond the regular laws everyone follows.

The main goal of joining together is to make more money. They do this in two ways: by being the only buyers and the only sellers in the market, both at home and abroad.

So, when a group of merchants is given the right to be a corporation or political body, they get two monopolies. One is to be the only buyers, and the other is to be the only sellers. For example, if a company controls trade with a certain foreign country, they are the only ones who export goods to that country and the only ones who sell goods from that country at home. This means there is only one buyer at home and one seller abroad, which helps the merchants make more money because they can buy goods cheaper at home and sell them for more in other places. Abroad, there is also only one buyer of foreign goods and one seller at home, which again helps the investors make a profit.
