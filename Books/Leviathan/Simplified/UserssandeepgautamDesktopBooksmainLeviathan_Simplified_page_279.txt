Even though back then the patriarchs and many other faithful men had died, they still “lived to God.” This means their names were written in the Book of Life because their sins were forgiven, and they were promised eternal life when they are raised again. The idea that a person's soul is naturally eternal and lives on without the body, or that anyone is immortal before the resurrection day (except Enos and Elias), is not clearly shown in the Bible.

In the whole fourteenth chapter of Job, Job himself talks about how humans die and are mortal, but he doesn’t deny that people will live forever after the resurrection. He says, “There is hope for a tree that has been cut down. Even if the roots grow old and the stump dies, it can still sprout again when it gets water.” But for people, he asks, “Man dies and disappears. Where does he go?” (Job 14:7). Later, he says, “Man lies down and doesn’t get up until the heavens are no more” (Job 14:12).

So, when will the heavens be no more? St. Peter tells us it will happen at the general resurrection. In his second letter, he says the current heavens and earth are kept safe for fire on the day of judgment, when wicked people will be destroyed. He also says the heavens will burn and melt away, but after that, we will have new heavens and a new earth where goodness lives. So, when Job says people won’t rise until the heavens are gone, it means eternal life doesn’t start until the resurrection and judgment day. This is not because of who we are, but because of God’s promise.

Finally, it has already been shown from many parts of the Bible that God’s kingdom is like a government where God rules as king—first through the Old Covenant and now through the New Covenant. God rules through His representative. The same parts of the Bible show that after Jesus comes back in glory to rule forever, God’s kingdom will be on earth. Although this idea might seem new to many people, I’m just sharing it. I don’t want to argue about religion now. Instead, I’m waiting to see who will decide the final authority that decides which beliefs people should follow. Whoever that authority is, everyone who wants to live under the law must obey them, no matter what they personally believe.
