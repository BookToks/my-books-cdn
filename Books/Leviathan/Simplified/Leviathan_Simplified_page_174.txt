Second, not caring about having too much money or fancy titles. Third, being able to make decisions without being scared, angry, hateful, loving, or overly caring. Fourth, and last, having patience to listen, paying close attention, and remembering what you heard so you can use it later.

The way laws are divided and explained has been done differently by different people who wrote about them. This depends not on nature, but on what the writer wants to focus on, and everyone has their own way of doing it. In Justinian’s laws, there are seven types of civil laws:

1. The orders, rules, and letters from the emperor, because he had all the power from the people. These are like the kings of England’s official announcements.

2. The decisions made by the whole Roman people, including the Senate when they were asked. These laws were originally made by the people’s power and stayed laws unless the emperor canceled them. These are similar to Acts of Parliament in England.

3. The decisions made by the common people without the Senate, asked by a people’s representative called the tribune. These also stayed laws unless the emperor canceled them. These are like orders from the House of Commons in England.

4. The Senate’s orders: when Rome got too big to gather everyone, the emperor said the Senate should make decisions instead of the people. These are somewhat like Acts of Council.

5. The rules made by praetors and sometimes aediles, who were like the top judges in English courts.

6. The advice and opinions of special lawyers chosen by the emperor to explain the law and help judges. Judges had to follow this advice. This is similar to how English judges look at past cases for guidance. English common law judges are more like legal experts who the actual judges, usually lords or a group of twelve men, ask for advice.
