If a guy thinks about where this big church power started, he’ll see that the pope’s power is basically the ghost of the old Roman Empire, sitting on its grave. That’s because the pope’s power suddenly appeared from the ruins of that old empire.

They also use Latin in their churches and official events, which no one really speaks anymore. So, Latin is like the ghost of the old Roman language.

Fairies everywhere have one king, called King Oberon by some poets, but the Bible calls him Beelzebub, the prince of demons. The church leaders also have one king for all of them—the pope.

Church leaders are spiritual people, kind of like ghostly fathers. Fairies are spirits and ghosts. Both fairies and ghosts live in dark places, lonely spots, and graves. Church leaders live in confusing beliefs, in monasteries, churches, and churchyards.

Church leaders have big churches called cathedrals. In any town, these churches can make the town feel like a center of power using holy water and special spells called exorcisms. Fairies also have magical castles and huge ghosts that rule the nearby areas.

Fairies can’t be caught or punished when they cause trouble. Church leaders also disappear when they need to face civil courts.

Church leaders take away young men’s ability to think for themselves with strange ideas made of metaphysics, miracles, traditions, and twisted Bible stories, making them just follow orders. Fairies are also said to take babies from their cradles and turn them into fools called elves, who like to cause trouble.

No one knows exactly where fairies do their magic, but church leaders do theirs in universities that learned their ways from the pope’s authority.

When fairies are mad at someone, they send elves to pinch them. Church leaders, when angry with a government, also create their own “elves” — superstitious, enchanted people who cause trouble by preaching rebellion, or they use one leader, tricked with promises, to cause problems for another.
