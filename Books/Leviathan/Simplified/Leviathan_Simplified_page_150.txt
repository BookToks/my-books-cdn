In any argument or dispute, the people involved had judges from the area where the problem happened. They could object to some judges until they agreed on twelve fair people. Then, the decision made by those twelve was final.

These public officials, chosen by the ruler, are like the voice of a country, helping to guide and judge the people.

Public ministers are those who have the ruler’s power to make sure decisions are carried out. They share the ruler's orders, stop riots, catch criminals, and keep peace. Everything they do is like the work of hands in a body, acting for the whole country.

Public ministers sent to other countries represent their ruler. These include ambassadors, messengers, agents, and heralds who work officially for the government.

But if someone is sent only by a private group from a troubled area, they are not official ministers of the country because their actions don’t represent the whole government. Also, an ambassador sent by a prince for private reasons, like to say congratulations, is a private person. If someone is sent secretly to spy on another country, even though it’s official work, they act privately and only for themselves, but still serve the country like an eye in a body. Those who receive petitions or information from the people act like public ears and represent the ruler in that role.

A counselor or council of state that only gives advice to the ruler, without any real power to judge or command, is not considered a public official. Advice is given only to the ruler, who cannot be represented by others when he is present. But a group of counselors usually has some power, like judging or managing. In a monarchy, they speak for the king when giving orders. In a democracy, the council shares their decisions with the people. When they choose judges or meet ambassadors, they act as officials for the people. In an aristocracy, the council is the main ruling group and only advises themselves.
