The elect are the only kids who come back to life for sure; that means they are the only ones who will live forever. They are the only ones who can never die again. These people are like angels and are called the children of God, unlike the reprobate.

The reprobate will face a second and eternal death after they come back to life. Between their resurrection and this final death, they will go through a time of punishment and suffering. This punishment will last forever, as long as humans keep being born.

This idea about souls living forever after they separate from the body is the basis for the belief in purgatory. If eternal life only comes by God’s grace, then life only lasts as long as the body lives, and souls don’t live forever until the resurrection.

One proof for purgatory comes from the Bible, where David fasted for Saul and Jonathan (II Samuel 1:12), and also for Abner (II Samuel 3:35). Bellarmine says David fasted to ask God for something for them after they died. Since David stopped fasting when he found out his own child had died, it shows that souls exist separately from the body. Also, fasting can’t help souls already in heaven or hell, so some souls must be in a third place, which is purgatory.

But this is a weak argument. Mourning and fasting for people who didn’t help the mourners is just to show respect. When it’s done for someone who helped the mourners, it’s because they feel sad and hurt. So David fasted to honor Saul and Abner, and he ate to comfort himself after his child died.

In other Bible verses Bellarmine uses, there is no real proof for purgatory. He points to words like anger, fire, burning, purging, or cleansing just because some church fathers once used them to talk about purgatory in their sermons.

For example, Psalm 37 says, “O Lord, don’t punish me in your anger, or punish me in your hot displeasure.” This wouldn’t connect to purgatory if Augustine hadn’t said that the anger means hell’s fire and the displeasure means purgatory’s fire.
