But people often do less than this. They yell at, fight against, and even hurt the very people who have protected them their whole lives. If this kind of madness happens in big groups, it happens in every single person too. It’s like when you’re in the middle of the sea—you might not hear the waves right next to you, but you know that part of the water is making noise just like the rest. In the same way, even if one or two people don’t seem upset, their strong feelings still add to the angry noise of a troubled nation. And if you needed proof of their madness, just look at how they act like they have special messages from God. If someone in a mental hospital calmly told you they were God and wanted you to remember them, you wouldn’t expect them to act normal.

This idea of being “inspired,” often called having a private spirit, usually starts when someone finds a mistake that most others believe. But they don’t understand or remember how they figured it out, and sometimes they’re actually wrong. Still, they quickly think they’re chosen by God and have been given a special secret message.

Also, madness is really just having too much strong emotion. You can see this when people drink too much alcohol. Their behavior is just like mad people: some get angry, some get loving, some laugh too much, all following whatever strong feeling controls them. Drinking just removes their ability to hide these feelings and makes them show. I think most sober people, when alone and not busy, don’t want others to see how wild their thoughts can be. This shows that when feelings aren’t controlled, they are mostly just madness.

People in history have had two main ideas about what causes madness. Some say it comes from emotions; others say it’s caused by spirits or demons, good or bad, that enter a person and make their body act strangely, like madmen do.
