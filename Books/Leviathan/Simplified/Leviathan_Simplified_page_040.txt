All talking or thinking aimed at learning something has an end—either you find the answer or you stop trying. And whenever a conversation or thought process stops, it ends for that moment.

If you’re just thinking in your head, your thoughts go back and forth between "this will happen" and "this won’t happen," or "this did happen" and "this didn’t happen." So if you stop someone while they’re thinking, they’re left guessing if something will or won’t happen, or if it did or didn’t happen. This guessing is called opinion. When you’re deciding if something is good or bad, your feelings go back and forth just like your opinions do when trying to figure out what’s true or false. The final feeling you have when deciding is called your will, and the final opinion you have about what’s true or false is called your judgment. The whole process of deciding if something is good or bad is called deliberation, and the whole process of questioning what’s true or false is called doubt.

No matter what, you can’t end a thought or conversation with complete, absolute knowledge about the past or future. Knowledge about facts comes first from what you sense, then from your memory. And knowledge about how things connect—called science—is never absolute, only conditional. That means you can’t be 100% sure that something is, was, or will be; you can only know that if one thing is true, then another thing follows. This knowledge is about how words relate to each other, not about the actual things themselves.

When you speak, your ideas start with defining words, then connecting those definitions into general statements, and from those into logical arguments called syllogisms. The final point you reach is called the conclusion. This conclusion shows the kind of conditional knowledge I mentioned earlier, and it’s what people usually call science. But if you don’t start with clear definitions or don’t connect them properly, the conclusion is just another opinion—sometimes even nonsense that doesn’t make sense at all.

When two or more people know the same fact, they are said to be conscious of it together, which means they know it at the same time. Because these people are the best witnesses to each other’s facts, it has always been considered very wrong for anyone to lie against their own conscience or to force someone else to do so. That’s why people have always taken the idea of conscience very seriously.
