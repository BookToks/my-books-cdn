A king on Earth can be called the image of God, and a lower official can be called the image of that king. Sometimes, people who worship idols don’t care if the statue looks like what they imagine their god to be, but they still call it an image of that god. For example, a rough stone might be set up for Neptune, or other gods might have shapes very different from what people think they look like.

Today, we see many statues of the Virgin Mary and other saints that don’t look alike or match anyone’s idea exactly. Still, these statues serve their purpose—they just represent the people in stories. Everyone thinks of their own mental picture or none at all. So, an image can mean something that looks like or represents something you can see, or both.

The word idol can mean even more in the Bible. It can mean the sun, a star, or any other creature, whether we can see it or not, when people worship it as a god.

Now that we know what worship and images are, let’s look at the kind of idolatry that is forbidden in the second Commandment and other parts of the Bible.

To worship an image means to do things on purpose that show respect either to the material the image is made of—like wood, stone, or metal—or to the idea in your mind that the image represents, or both together, like a body and soul.

Taking off your hat or bowing before a powerful person, a prince, or their throne is a way of showing respect to that person, not the chair or place. This is called civil worship and is not idolatry. But if someone thinks the soul of the prince is in the chair or prays to the chair, that would be divine worship and idolatry.

Praying to a king for things he can actually do for you is civil worship, even if you bow down to him, because you only see him as human. But if you pray to him for things only God can do, like good weather, that is divine worship and idolatry. On the other hand, if a king forces someone to worship him by threat of death or punishment, that is not idolatry. The person obeys out of fear to save their life, not because they truly honor the king as a god. If there is no true respect inside, it is not worship, and so not idolatry.
