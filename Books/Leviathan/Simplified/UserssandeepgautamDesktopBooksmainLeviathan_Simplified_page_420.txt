But it means something else too. There, it means “books written or placed after his natural philosophy.” But the Schools think these books are about supernatural philosophy. The word metaphysics can mean both things. Actually, most of what is written there is so hard to understand and goes against natural reason that anyone who thinks it makes sense must believe it’s about supernatural stuff.

From these metaphysics, mixed with the Bible to create School divinity, we’re told there are certain essences separate from bodies, called abstract essences and substantial forms. To explain this confusing talk, you need more than usual attention. Also, I’m sorry if you’re not used to this kind of discussion; I’m speaking to those who are.

The world (not just the earth, which people call “worldly men” when they love it) means the whole universe, all things combined. The universe is made of bodies, which have size—length, width, and depth. Every part of a body is also a body and has size too. So every part of the universe is body, and anything that isn’t body isn’t part of the universe. Since the universe is everything, anything outside it is nothing and nowhere.

But this doesn’t mean spirits are nothing. Spirits have size too, so they are real bodies, even though we usually call bodies only those things we can see or touch. Spirits are called incorporeal, which means “not made of body,” a nicer term that can be used for God. When we talk about God, we don’t focus on what best describes His nature (which we can’t fully understand), but on what shows our respect and honor for Him.

To understand why they say there are abstract essences or substantial forms, we need to know what those words really mean. Words help us keep track of and show others what we think. Some words name things we imagine or see, like different bodies. Other words name the images or ideas in our minds of the things we remember or see. And some words name other words or types of speech, like universal, plural, or singular. Words like definition, true, false, promise, or question are names of certain ways we speak.
