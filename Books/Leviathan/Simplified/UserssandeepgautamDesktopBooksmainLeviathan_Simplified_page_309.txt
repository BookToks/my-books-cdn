Paul says, "Children, obey your parents in everything because it pleases the Lord." He also says, "Servants, obey your masters in everything, not just to look good but sincerely, as if you are serving the Lord." This was said to servants whose masters did not believe in God, yet they were still told to obey them in all things.

Paul also talks about obeying rulers, saying, "Be subject to the higher powers," because all power is given by God. We should obey them not just because we are afraid of punishment but also because it is the right thing to do. Peter says, "Submit to every human authority for the Lord’s sake, whether to the king or governors, who punish wrongdoers and praise those who do right, because this is God’s will." Paul tells us to remind people to obey rulers and authorities.

The rulers Peter and Paul talked about were mostly non-believers, so we should definitely obey Christian rulers that God has put in charge of us. But how can we obey a minister of Christ if he tells us to go against the orders of the king or government that protects us? Clearly, Christ’s ministers do not have the right to command others unless they also have civil authority.

Some might ask, what if a king or government stops us from believing in Christ? My answer is that such laws don’t work because belief can’t be forced or taken away by punishments. Faith is a gift from God, not something people can control. 

If a ruler orders us to say we don’t believe, should we obey? Saying something with our mouth is just an outward action, like a gesture to show obedience. A Christian who truly believes in their heart can still do this without losing faith. This is like what happened with Naaman the Syrian in the Bible. He believed in God in his heart but bowed with his master in a place of worship to other gods. He asked God to forgive him for this because he stayed true inside.
