Thirdly, when you talk to someone alone, you can check if their reasons and advice make sense by asking questions and interrupting if needed. You can’t do this in a big group because there’s too much going on, and it’s hard to know what to do. Also, in a big group, some people just want to sound smart and impress others instead of giving helpful advice. They waste time with fancy speeches made up of bits from different authors, which is annoying and slows things down. But when you talk privately, you can avoid this.

Fourthly, when you need to keep plans secret, which happens a lot in public matters, having many people involved is risky. That’s why big groups usually pick a smaller, trusted team who know what they’re doing to handle these things.

To finish, who really wants to get advice from a big group when deciding important stuff like marrying off kids, dealing with land, running a household, or managing private matters, especially if some people don’t want you to succeed? The best way is to get help from a few smart people who each give advice separately, like having good teammates in a tennis game. Next best is to trust your own judgment. But the worst is relying on a big group where decisions need most people to agree because some might slow things down or even want you to fail. It’s like being pushed around in a heavy cart by people who don’t all want to help you. Even though many eyes can see more than one, it only works well if one person makes the final decision.
