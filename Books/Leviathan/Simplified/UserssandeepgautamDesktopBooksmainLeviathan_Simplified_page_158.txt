It’s clear that when someone gives advice mainly to help themselves, you can tell because they keep pushing their opinion strongly or in a fake way. This advice isn’t really needed and mostly helps the person giving it, not the one receiving it.

Second, giving advice or warnings really only works when talking to a big group. If you talk to just one person, they can ask questions and challenge you more easily. But with a crowd, it’s too many people to have a back-and-forth talk.

Third, people who give advice or warnings only because they want something for themselves aren’t good advisors. Even if their advice is good, they aren’t truly honest, just like a judge who takes bribes isn’t really fair. But when someone has the right to give orders, like a dad at home or a leader in the army, their advice or warnings aren’t just okay, they’re necessary and good. In these cases, their advice is really more like commands. Sometimes, when a hard job has to be done, these commands need to be said kindly to make them easier to accept.

We can see the difference between commands and advice in the Bible. Commands are things like “Don’t worship other gods,” “Don’t make idols,” “Don’t lie using God’s name,” “Keep the Sabbath holy,” “Respect your parents,” “Don’t kill,” and “Don’t steal.” These are commands because we obey them because God, our King, wants us to. But advice is like when Jesus says, “Sell everything you have, give to the poor, and follow me.” That’s advice because it helps us personally, like getting treasure in heaven.

Another example: “Go to the village nearby and bring me the donkey and her colt” is a command because it comes from the master’s will. But “Repent and be baptized in Jesus’ name” is advice because it helps us avoid punishment for our sins, not because it benefits God, who stays powerful no matter what we do.
