Even though this way of doing things isn’t fully understood, it has led some people to believe something dangerous. They think anyone can kill another person because of their own strong feelings, like a kind of personal justice. But the punishments given in God's kingdom long ago didn’t come from personal feelings—they came from the official commands of those in charge. If we look closely at the examples that seem to support this idea, we see they actually don’t.

First, when the Levites attacked the people who made and worshipped the golden calf and killed three thousand of them, they did it because Moses told them to, and God spoke through Moses. We see this clearly in the Bible, in Exodus 32:27. Also, when a man’s son cursed God, the people who heard it didn’t kill him right away. Instead, they took him to Moses, who kept him safe until God decided what should happen, as it says in Leviticus 24:11-12.

Another example is when Phinehas killed Zimri and Cozbi. He didn’t act out of personal anger. Their crime was done in front of everyone, so no one needed to prove it. The law was clear, and Phinehas was next in line to lead. Most importantly, Phinehas’s action was only okay because Moses later approved it. Sometimes, acting first and getting approval later is needed to protect the community. For example, if a sudden rebellion starts, anyone who can stop it right away, even without official permission, can do so and then ask for approval or forgiveness afterward.

The law also says that if someone kills a murderer, they must do it based on the word of witnesses. This means there has to be a proper legal process, which goes against the idea of killing out of personal feelings. The Law of Moses says that if someone tries to get others to worship false gods, people must not hide that person. The accuser is supposed to make sure the person is put to death, and the first stone is thrown by the accuser. But the person can’t be killed before being judged. 

The process for dealing with idolatry is very clear: God tells the people to carefully check the accusation, and if it’s true, then they stone the person. The accuser throws the first stone. This isn’t about personal anger but about public judgment. Similarly, if a son is rebellious, the father must bring him before the town’s judges, and then the whole town will stone him.
