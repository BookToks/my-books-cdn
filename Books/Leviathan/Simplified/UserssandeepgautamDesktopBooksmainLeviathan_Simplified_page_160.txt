The main job of a Commonwealth (or country) is to keep its people safe and peaceful at home and to protect them from attacks by other countries. To do this, you need to understand a lot about how people behave, what governments are allowed to do, and what is fair and just. You also need to know about the strengths and resources of your own country and your neighbors, as well as what other countries might plan or want to do that could cause problems. Learning all this takes a lot of time and experience.

Not only does understanding all these things take years, but it also needs serious study. Good advice comes from good judgment, and people have different kinds of judgment because of their different education and experience. When there are clear rules, like in building or machines, the best advice comes from someone who knows those rules well. But when there are no clear rules, the person with the most experience in that area gives the best advice.

Also, when giving advice about dealing with other countries, you need to know what information and messages come from them and understand all the past agreements and talks between the countries. Only trusted representatives can really know all this information.

This shows that people who are not asked to give advice usually don't have good advice to offer in these situations.

If you have a group of advisors, it’s better to hear their opinions one by one instead of all together. That’s because when they speak separately, you get each person’s true opinion. But in a large group, many just agree or disagree without thinking because they want to fit in, or they’re influenced by others’ speeches or afraid to seem less smart. Also, some people might have their own interests that don’t match what’s best for the country. Their strong feelings can make them speak passionately, and this can convince others to follow their ideas too.

When many people get emotional together, it’s like many fires burning and feeding each other, which can cause big problems for the country—even though they say they’re trying to help it.
