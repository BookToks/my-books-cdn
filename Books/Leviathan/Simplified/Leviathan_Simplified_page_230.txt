Even though God can talk to people through dreams, visions, voices, or inspiration, He doesn’t force anyone to believe they really heard Him. People can make mistakes, and some might even lie.

So, if God hasn’t directly told someone what to do—except through natural thinking—how can they know when to listen to a person who says they are a prophet? When the King of Israel asked 400 prophets for advice about a war, only one, Micaiah, was telling the truth (I Kings, 22). Another true prophet, sent to warn against a false altar, was tricked by an older prophet who told him to eat and drink with him, pretending it was God’s command (Ibid., 13). If prophets can fool each other, how can anyone be sure about God’s will except by using reason?

The Bible says there are two signs to know a true prophet. One is that they do miracles. The other is that they don’t teach anything new, but follow the religion already known. Neither sign alone is enough. The Bible says, “If a prophet or dreamer does a miracle but tells you to follow other gods, don’t listen to them. That person should be put to death because they want you to turn away from God” (Deuteronomy, 13:1-5).

Two things are important here. First, God doesn’t want miracles to be the only proof that someone is a real prophet. Miracles also test how loyal we are to Him. For example, Egyptian magicians did miracles, but they weren’t from God. Second, no matter how big the miracle is, if it tells you to rebel against your king or leader, you shouldn’t trust it. In this case, turning away from God meant turning away from their king, because they had made God their king at Mount Sinai and followed His commands through Moses.

Similarly, after Jesus made his disciples recognize Him as the Messiah—the king the Jews expected but rejected—He warned them about the dangers of miracles used to trick people.
