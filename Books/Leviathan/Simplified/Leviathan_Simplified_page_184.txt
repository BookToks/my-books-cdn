This is a crime: the harm is not physical but imaginary, and (though, in this part of the world, made real by a custom started not long ago among young and proud men) it is so small that a brave man who trusts his own courage wouldn’t even care about it. Also, a person might be scared of spirits because of their own superstitions or because they believe others who tell them about strange dreams and visions; this can make them think spirits will hurt them if they do or don’t do certain things, even if those things go against the law. But doing or not doing those things because of fear is still a crime. As I explained earlier, dreams are just the leftover thoughts from what we sensed when awake, and sometimes when people aren’t sure if they really slept, dreams seem real. So if someone breaks the law because of their own or another’s dream or imagined spirit power beyond what the government allows, they leave the natural law, which is wrong, and follow their own or someone else’s private ideas, which they can never really understand or trust. If everyone did this, no laws could be kept, and the whole community would fall apart.

From these different kinds of crimes, it’s clear that not all crimes are the same, unlike what the old Stoics believed.

There is room not only for excuses, which show that something that seemed like a crime isn’t one at all, but also for lessening the crime, making what looked very bad seem less serious. Even though all crimes are unfair, like all curves are crooked, it doesn’t mean all crimes are equally unfair, just like all crooked lines aren’t equally crooked. The Stoics didn’t see this difference and thought it was as bad to kill a chicken against the law as to kill your father.

Only something that completely removes the law’s demand can fully excuse an action and take away its nature as a crime.
