Ezekiel, Daniel, Haggai, and Zechariah lived during the time when the Jews were held captive.

We don’t know exactly when Joel and Malachi made their prophecies just by reading their books.

But looking at the titles of their books, it’s clear that the whole Old Testament was put together after the Jews came back from Babylon and before King Ptolemy Philadelphus had it translated into Greek by seventy men from Judea. 

If we trust the Apocrypha books (which the Church recommends for learning but doesn’t consider part of the main Bible), the Old Testament was arranged by Esdras. He said in his book that God’s law was lost, so he asked God to help him write down everything again so people could find the right path and live well in the future. After 40 days, God told him to share the first part with everyone but keep the last part only for wise people.

This tells us when the Old Testament was written down.

The writers of the New Testament lived less than 100 years after Jesus rose to heaven. Most of them saw Jesus or were his followers, except Paul and Luke. So, their writings are as old as the time of the Apostles.

But the Church didn’t accept these New Testament books as official right away. Just like the Old Testament was gathered by Esdras, the New Testament books were collected and approved by Church leaders later on. The first list of all the Old and New Testament books was made by the Canons of the Apostles, probably put together by Clement the First.
