People think faster or slower because they have different feelings. Some love one thing, others dislike it. So, some people’s thoughts go one way, and others go another way. They notice different things in their imagination.

When people notice things that are similar, especially if those similarities are unusual, they are said to have a good imagination or “fancy.” But when people notice differences and can tell things apart easily, they have good judgment. In social situations and business, this skill is called discretion.

Having a good imagination without good judgment isn’t seen as a good thing. But good judgment and discretion are praised even without fancy imagination. Besides knowing the right time, place, and people to use imagination well, a person must also focus their thoughts on a goal or purpose.

If someone has this skill, they can find connections that make their speech interesting and fresh, using new and fitting comparisons. But without focus and direction, having a big imagination can feel like madness. Some people jump from one idea to another so much that they lose track of what they were talking about.

This happens because they lack experience, so things seem new and amazing to them. Or it happens because they are timid, so small things seem very important. New or big ideas can pull someone away from their main point.

In a good poem, both imagination and judgment are needed, but imagination should be stronger because poems are enjoyed for their creativity. Still, they shouldn’t be confusing or careless.

In a good history, judgment is more important. This is because good history depends on choosing the right way to tell the story, telling the truth, and picking the most useful events to share.
