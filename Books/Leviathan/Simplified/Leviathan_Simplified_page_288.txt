Our Savior Christ did not make a payment for our sins that would stop God from punishing sinners forever just because of His death. Instead, when He first came, He offered Himself as a sacrifice that God wanted so that when He comes again, those who have turned to Him and believe will be saved.

Sometimes the Bible calls this act a sacrifice, sometimes a price. But the price doesn’t mean something with value that could buy us forgiveness from God. It means the payment God wanted to show mercy to us.

The word Church in the Bible can mean different things. Sometimes, though not often, it means God's house—a building where Christians gather to worship. For example, in one verse it says, “Let your women keep silence in the churches.” Here, it means the group of people gathered there, and later it was used to mean the actual building, to show the difference between Christian places of worship and those of other religions.

The Temple in Jerusalem was God’s house and a place for prayer. Any Christian building dedicated to worshiping Christ is also called Christ’s house. That’s why early Greek Christians called it Kuriakē, meaning the Lord’s house. From that came the words kirk and church in English.

When Church doesn’t mean a building, it means the same as the word Ecclesia in ancient Greece. That was a group or gathering of citizens called to listen to a leader. In Rome, this was called concio, and the speaker was called ecclesiastes or concionator. When the group was called together by legal authority, it was a lawful Church. But if the group was gathered by chaos or riots, it was a confused Church.

Sometimes Church means all the people who have the right to be part of the group, even if they are not gathered together. This means all Christians everywhere. For example, when it says “Saul made havoc of the church,” it means he attacked all Christians. In this way, Christ is called the Head of the Church.
