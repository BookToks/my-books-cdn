They couldn’t stop people from going into their synagogues or meeting places unless the owner of the place said so, whether that owner was Christian or not. Since all places belong to the government, anyone—whether kicked out of the church or never baptized—could enter if they had permission from the civil authorities. For example, before Paul became a Christian, he entered synagogues in Damascus to arrest Christians because he had permission from the high priest (Acts 9:2). This shows that if a Christian left the faith in a place where the government didn’t support the Church, being kicked out of the church didn’t really cause any harm or fear. It didn’t scare them because they didn’t believe, and it didn’t hurt them because they gained favor with the non-believers. Instead, the Church was hurt because those kicked out were free to cause more trouble.

Excommunication only affected people who believed that Jesus would come back to judge everyone and that those kicked out wouldn’t be allowed into His kingdom. That’s why Paul called excommunication handing someone over to Satan. Without Jesus’ kingdom, all other kingdoms belong to Satan. Believers were afraid of this punishment because it meant their sins weren’t forgiven. When Christianity wasn’t supported by the government, excommunication was used only to correct bad behavior, not wrong beliefs. It was a punishment only people who believed in Jesus’ return could understand, and these people only needed to live good lives to be saved.

Excommunication could happen if someone was treated unfairly. If your brother offends you, first tell him privately. If that doesn’t work, tell some witnesses. If that still doesn’t work, tell the Church. If he still won’t listen, “Let him be like a stranger or outsider” (Matthew 18:15-17). Excommunication could also happen for living a bad life, like if someone was a sinner, greedy, worshipped idols, drank too much, or cheated others. With such a person, you shouldn’t even eat with them.
