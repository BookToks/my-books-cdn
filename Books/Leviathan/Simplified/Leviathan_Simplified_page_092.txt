Injustice in behavior means having the tendency to harm others, even before actually doing anything, and without necessarily hurting a specific person. But injustice in actions means actually hurting someone who had an agreement with you. Sometimes, one person gets hurt, but another person suffers the loss. For example, if a boss tells a worker to give money to a stranger and the worker doesn’t do it, the boss is the one hurt because the worker promised to obey him, but the stranger isn’t hurt because the worker had no promise to help him. 

In governments, people can forgive each other’s debts, but they can’t forgive serious crimes like robbery or violence because those harm the whole society, not just the individuals involved. 

If something is done to a person with their own permission, it’s not an injury. If the person doing it hasn’t given up their right to act freely by some agreement, then no promise is broken and no injury is done. And if the person has given up that right but agrees to what’s happening, then the agreement is canceled, so again no injury happens.

Justice in actions is divided into two types by writers: commutative and distributive. Commutative justice is about fair trade, like making sure things exchanged are equal in value. Distributive justice is about sharing benefits fairly based on what people deserve. For example, it would be unfair to sell something for more than you paid or to give someone more than they deserve. The value of things is based on what buyers and sellers agree on. What someone deserves isn’t always about justice but about kindness or reward. 

So, commutative justice is about keeping promises in deals like buying, selling, renting, borrowing, or trading. Distributive justice is about deciding what’s fair in the bigger picture, like a judge or leader making rules.
