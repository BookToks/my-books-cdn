When people see princes, their example usually influences what they do even more than laws do. Even though we should do what princes say, not just what they do, people won’t really follow this rule unless God gives them a special kind of help to do it.

If we think about crimes based on how much harm they cause, a crime that hurts many people is worse than one that hurts only a few. Also, if a crime causes harm now and sets a bad example for the future, it’s worse than a crime that only causes harm right now. The first kind of crime spreads and hurts more people over time, while the second kind doesn’t.

It’s a bigger mistake for a preacher to teach ideas against the official religion than for a normal person to do so. It’s also worse if someone who is supposed to follow the law tries to weaken the ruler’s power. If a wise person who many people listen to breaks the law, it’s worse than if just anyone does it, because they not only break the law but also encourage others to do the same. In general, crimes are worse when they cause others to stumble or go the wrong way because they follow someone’s bad example.

Doing harmful acts against the government is a bigger crime than doing the same acts against private people, because the damage affects everyone. This includes betraying the country’s secrets to enemies, attacking the ruler or government, or trying to reduce their power now or in the future. The Romans called these crimes crimina laesae majestatis, which means acts against the fundamental laws of the country.
