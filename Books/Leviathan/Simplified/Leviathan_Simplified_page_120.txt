In a democracy, the whole group can’t fail unless the people being ruled fail. So, questions about who should take over next don’t really come up in this kind of government.

In an aristocracy, when a member dies, the group gets to choose someone new to take their place. The group is the boss and picks all the important people. What one representative does is actually done by all the people together. Sometimes, the group lets others pick new members for their court, but it’s still the group’s choice. They can also take back that power if needed.

The biggest problem with deciding who comes next happens in a monarchy. The hard part is figuring out who gets to pick the next ruler and sometimes even who the next ruler is. This needs careful thinking, more than most people usually do. When a king or queen with full power dies, either they had the right to pick their successor, or that right goes back to the people. But when the ruler dies, the people have no leader to unite them. So, they can’t easily pick a new ruler because everyone has the same right to choose whoever they want or even protect themselves. This leads to chaos, like a war where everyone fights everyone else, which is the opposite of why monarchy was created. So, it’s clear that the current ruler always has the right to decide who comes next.

If there’s a question about who the ruler picked to take over, it’s decided by what the ruler said clearly or by other obvious signs.

The ruler can say it out loud or write it down while they are alive, like the first emperors of Rome who named their heirs this way.
