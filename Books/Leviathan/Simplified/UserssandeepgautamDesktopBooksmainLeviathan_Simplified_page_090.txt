This kind of thinking is actually wrong.

The question isn’t about promises where neither side can be sure the other will keep them, like when there’s no government to enforce promises. Those kinds of promises aren’t real agreements. But when one side has already done their part, or there’s a way to make them do it, the question is whether it makes sense for the other side to keep their promise or not. I say it does make sense.

First, think about when someone does something that seems like it will hurt them, even if something lucky happens later. That doesn’t mean what they did was smart or reasonable. Second, in a situation like war where everyone is against everyone else and there’s no power to keep peace, no one can stay safe alone without help from others. Everyone expects help from their group. So if someone says it’s okay to trick the people helping them, they can only count on themselves to stay safe.

So, a person who breaks their promise and thinks it’s okay to do that can’t be trusted to join a group that wants peace and safety. If such a person is accepted by mistake, the group is in danger. If they stay in the group, it’s only because others make a mistake by trusting them. The person who breaks promises can’t count on these mistakes to keep safe, so if they get kicked out, they die. If they stay, it’s only because others don’t know what’s best for themselves.

About the idea of getting forever happiness in heaven by doing something else, that’s silly. There’s only one way to get that, and that’s by keeping promises, not breaking them.

And about getting power by rebelling, even if it works sometimes, it’s not something you can expect to happen. Usually, it won’t work, and when people try it, they teach others to do the same, which is against reason. So justice, which means keeping promises, is a rule of reason that stops us from doing things that could harm our own lives. It’s a natural law.
