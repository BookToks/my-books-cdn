When things press on us, they are just different kinds of movement (because movement only makes more movement). But how they seem to us is just like a trick of the mind, the same way when we’re awake or dreaming. Just like when you press, rub, or hit your eye and you see light, or when you press your ear and hear noise, the things we see or hear do the same by their strong but hidden action. If colors and sounds were really inside the things that cause them, they couldn’t be separated from those things. But with glasses and echoes, we can see they are separate: we know the real thing we see is in one place, and the image or trick we see is somewhere else. Even if the real thing and what we imagine seem connected when they are far away, they are still different. So, what we sense is just a kind of original image or idea caused by the pressure or movement of outside things on our eyes, ears, and other senses.

But schools and universities, following Aristotle, teach something different. They say that for sight, the thing we see sends out a "visible species" — like a visible image or appearance — in all directions. When this enters the eye, we see. For hearing, they say the thing we hear sends out an "audible species" — an audible image — which enters the ear and makes us hear. Even for understanding, they say the thing we understand sends out an "intelligible species" that enters the mind and makes us understand. I’m not saying universities are useless, but since I will talk later about their role in society, I want to show that sometimes they waste time on things that don’t matter much.

II: About Imagination  
Everyone agrees that if something is still, it will stay still forever unless something else moves it. But not everyone agrees that if something is moving, it will keep moving forever unless something else stops it, even though the reason is the same (nothing can change itself). People judge other people and things by themselves: since they get tired and want to stop after moving, they think everything else gets tired too and wants to rest on its own. They don’t think about whether that desire to rest is actually caused by some other kind of movement.
