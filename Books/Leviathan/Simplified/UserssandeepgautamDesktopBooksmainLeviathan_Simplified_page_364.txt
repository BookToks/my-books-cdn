When it comes to the risk to religion from people accepting a non-Christian or a wrong leader, regular people aren’t the right ones to decide. If they were, then the Pope’s own followers could decide about the Pope’s teachings. Every Christian king, as I said before, is just as much a leader for his people as the Pope is for his.

The fourth point is about kings being baptized. When they become Christians, they give their power to Christ and promise to protect the Christian faith. This is true because Christian kings are Christ’s followers. But they can still be equals to the Pope since they are the top leaders for their own people, and the Pope is also just a king and leader in Rome.

The fifth point comes from Jesus’ words “Feed my sheep,” which gave all the power a leader needs. This includes the power to get rid of dangers like heretics (people with wrong beliefs), to control bad leaders even if they are Christian kings, and to provide proper guidance. The writer says St. Peter got these three powers from Jesus. But I think the last power is just about teaching.

About the first power, to chase away heretics, the Bible says to “beware of false prophets” (Matthew 7:15). But heretics aren’t the same as false prophets, and even if they are, the apostles were told to avoid them, not to kill or remove them from power. This advice was given to the Jewish people, many of whom were not yet Christians, and was for them to be careful.

As for the power to control bad kings who don’t listen to the Pope, Jesus himself didn’t take that power while on Earth. He said to let good and bad people live together until the final judgment. So, he definitely didn’t give that power to St. Peter or any apostles.
