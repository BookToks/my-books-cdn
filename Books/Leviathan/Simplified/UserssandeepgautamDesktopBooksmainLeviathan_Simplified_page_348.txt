Then Jesus spoke to St. Peter, saying, “Simon, Simon, Satan wants to make you doubt your future faith by using power now. But I have prayed for you, so your faith won’t fail. When you turn back and understand that my kingdom is not of this world, help your brothers keep the same faith.” 

St. Peter answered, as if he didn’t expect to have any power on earth, “Lord, I’m ready to go with you, even to prison or death.” This shows that St. Peter wasn’t given authority over the world, and he was told to teach the other Apostles the same – that they shouldn’t have worldly power. Also, the idea that St. Peter’s decisions about faith can never be wrong only means he should keep believing that Christ will come again and take over the kingdom on Judgment Day. This promise wasn’t given to his followers, who do claim power in this world now.

The second part is from Matthew 16:18, where Jesus says, “You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not win against it.” This only means that the Church will not be defeated because of Peter’s belief that Jesus is the Son of God, not that Peter has special power over the Church.

The third part is from John 21:16-17, where Jesus tells Peter to “Feed my sheep.” This means Peter was given the job of teaching. And if we think the other Apostles are the “sheep,” then this is the highest teaching power. But this was only for a time when there were no Christian rulers with this power yet.

I have already shown that Christian kings and queens are the top leaders in their lands because they were baptized, even without special ceremonies. Those ceremonies are not needed when a ruler already has full power to teach what they want. As I said before, rulers are the main teachers by their role, and their baptism makes them responsible to teach Christ’s teachings. If they let others teach their people wrong things, they risk their own souls. God will ask them to explain how they guided their families and servants.
