Here’s a simpler version of the passage, split into paragraphs for easier reading:

There is a lot to say about how laws are divided.

I see people use the words "lex civilis" and "jus civile," which mean "civil law" and "civil right," as if they mean the same thing. Even smart people do this, but they shouldn't. A right is freedom—specifically, the freedom that civil law allows us. But civil law is a rule that limits us and takes away some freedom that natural law gave us. Nature gave everyone the right to protect themselves by their own strength and even to attack a neighbor if they seemed dangerous. But civil law stops us from doing that when the law can protect us safely. So, "lex" (law) and "jus" (right) are very different—like the difference between rules and freedom.

Also, people often mix up laws and charters. But charters are gifts from the ruler, not laws. Charters give exceptions to the law. When someone says "I command" or "I order," they mean a law. When they say "I have given" or "I have granted," they mean a charter. What is given to someone is not forced on them by law. A law is made to apply to everyone, but a charter or liberty applies only to one person or a small group.

If everyone in a country is free to do something in every case, it means either no law was made about it or the law was canceled.

XXVII: About Crimes, Excuses, and Lessening Punishments

A sin is not just breaking a law, but also disrespecting the person who made the law. Disrespect breaks all the laws at once. Sin can be doing something wrong, saying forbidden words, not doing what the law says, or even planning to break the law. Planning to break the law shows some disrespect to the person who should enforce it.

Just wanting something that belongs to someone else, like their stuff, servants, or partner, without planning to take it by force or cheating, is not breaking the law that says, "You shall not covet." Also, enjoying imagining or dreaming about someone’s death, especially if that person only causes harm, is not a sin. But deciding to do something that leads to their death is a sin. Enjoying imaginary things that would make you happy if real is a natural feeling for all living creatures. If that were a sin, then being human itself would be a sin.
