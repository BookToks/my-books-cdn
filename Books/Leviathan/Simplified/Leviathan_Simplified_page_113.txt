If by "all together" they don’t mean the group acting as one person, then "all together" and "every one" mean the same thing, and what they say doesn’t make sense. But if "all together" means the group acting as one person (which is what the ruler represents), then the power of the whole group is the same as the ruler’s power. This also doesn’t make sense. People notice this problem when the ruler is a group of people, but not when it’s just one monarch. Still, the power is the same no matter who holds it.

Just like the power, the honor of the ruler should be greater than that of any or all the people. The ruler is the source of all honor. Titles like lord, earl, duke, and prince come from the ruler. When servants are with their master, they are all equal and have no special honor. It’s the same with subjects in front of the ruler. Even if some look more important when the ruler isn’t around, in the ruler’s presence, they shine no more than stars do next to the sun.

Someone might argue that subjects have a tough life because those with unlimited power can act on their own desires and bad feelings. People living under a monarch often blame monarchy for this, while people living under a democracy or other group government blame that system. But the power is the same in all forms if they work well to protect people. They don’t realize that life always has problems, and the worst thing that can happen under any government is small compared to the horrors of civil war or a lawless state where people can do whatever they want. Also, rulers don’t usually harm their people for fun or gain because their strength comes from the people. Instead, rulers take what they need during peaceful times to be ready for emergencies or attacks. People naturally focus on their own feelings and think small payments or taxes are a big problem, but they don’t think ahead about the bigger troubles those payments help prevent.
