People can change their opinions about what is good or bad at different times. Sometimes, they praise something they later criticize, which causes arguments, fights, and even wars. When people live just by their natural instincts, which is like being in a state of war, they decide what’s good or bad based on what they want. Everyone agrees that peace is good, so things that help keep peace—like justice, thankfulness, modesty, fairness, mercy, and other natural rules—are good too. These are called moral virtues, and their opposites are bad. Studying what’s right and wrong is called moral philosophy, so understanding the laws of nature is the same as understanding true moral philosophy.

But writers about moral philosophy, even though they agree on what virtues and vices are, don’t always understand why they are good. They sometimes think it’s about feeling brave or being generous in the right amount, instead of knowing these virtues help people live peacefully and happily together.

People used to call these ideas “laws,” but that’s not quite right. These ideas are really conclusions about how people protect and take care of themselves. Real laws are commands given by someone who has the right to tell others what to do.

However, if we think of these ideas as commands from God, who has the right to rule everything, then we can properly call them laws.

A person is someone whose words or actions are seen either as their own or as representing someone else’s words or actions. When the words or actions are their own, they are called a natural person. When they represent someone else, they are called an artificial or feigned person.

The word “person” comes from Latin, meaning a mask or disguise worn on stage. The Greek word for person means “face.” On stage, a mask covers the face, showing a character. From the theater, the word came to mean anyone who speaks or acts for themselves or others, whether in court or on stage.
