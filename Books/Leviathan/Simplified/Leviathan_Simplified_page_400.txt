The kind of things people called demons can be partly found in the family tree of their gods, written by Hesiod, one of the oldest Greek poets. Some other stories about demons I mentioned earlier in the twelfth chapter of this talk also help explain it.

The Greeks spread their language and writing to places like Asia, Egypt, and Italy through their colonies and conquests. This also spread their ideas about demons, or as St. Paul called them, their beliefs about devils. This way, these ideas reached the Jewish people in places like Judaea and Alexandria, and other areas where they lived.

But the Jews didn’t call all spirits demons like the Greeks did. They only called the bad ones demons. The good spirits they called the Spirit of God. They believed that when good spirits came into people, those people became prophets. So, if something unusual was good, they said it was from the Spirit of God. If it was bad, they said it was from an evil demon, or devil.

Because of this, people who were thought to be possessed by a devil were called demoniacs. These were people we might call crazy or those with epilepsy. If someone said things they didn’t understand, they thought a demon was talking through them. If someone was very dirty or acted strange, they’d say they had an unclean spirit. For example, they said John the Baptist had a devil because he fasted a lot (Matthew 11:18). They also said Jesus had a devil because He said people who followed Him wouldn’t die forever, and some didn’t believe Him (John 8:52). When Jesus said people wanted to kill Him, others said, “You have a devil! Who’s trying to kill you?” (John 7:20). This shows the Jews believed these spirits were real, not just made-up ideas.

If this idea about demons wasn’t true, some might ask, why didn’t Jesus say so and teach the opposite? In fact, He sometimes spoke in ways that seemed to agree with it. For example, Jesus said, “A spirit doesn’t have flesh and bones” (Luke 24).
