When Moses made the tabernacle, the altar, and the vessels special, he put oil on them that God told him to use (Exodus 40), and they became holy. There was no magic or spells to chase away ghosts. 

The same Moses, who was the leader of Israel, also made Aaron (the high priest) and his sons holy by washing them with water (not magic water), putting special clothes on them, and putting oil on them. They were made ready to serve God as priests. This was a simple and respectful way to clean and prepare them before they started their work for God.

When King Solomon, who was the leader of Israel, made the temple he built special, he stood in front of all the people of Israel. He blessed them, thanked God for inspiring his father to build the temple, and for giving him the chance to finish it. Then he prayed, asking God to accept the temple even though it wasn’t as great as God is. He also asked God to listen to the prayers said there or even towards it when people were not there. Finally, he offered a peace sacrifice, and the temple was dedicated (II Kings 8). There was no parade or magic water used, no sprinkling or strange words said like at other times. Instead, there was a respectful and fitting speech to God when giving Him the new temple.

We don’t read that St. John made the water of the Jordan River special by magic, or that Philip did that to the water where he baptized the eunuch. Nor did any early church leader spit on someone’s nose and say “for a sweet smell to the Lord” during baptism. These actions, like spitting and using that phrase, don’t have any real reason or support from authority.

To prove that the soul lives forever after leaving the body, not only the souls of those chosen by God who get eternal life through Jesus’ sacrifice, but also the souls of those who are not saved, just because they are human. This idea is natural to being human, without needing special grace from God, but just the grace given to everyone. There are many Bible verses that seem to support this at first, but when I compare them with what I shared earlier from Job chapter 14, I think those verses can have different meanings and are not as clear as Job’s words.
