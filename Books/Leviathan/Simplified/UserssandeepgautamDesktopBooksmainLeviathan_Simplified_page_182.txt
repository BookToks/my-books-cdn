When people make mistakes in their thinking, none of those mistakes can excuse someone from doing wrong, especially if they are managing their own affairs. It's even less okay for those in public office, because they are supposed to use reason and can't just make excuses for their bad actions.

One big cause of crime is vainglory, which means having a foolishly high opinion of yourself. Some people think they are better than others because of their intelligence, money, family, or other natural qualities, not realizing that those in charge decide how things are. Because of this, they wrongly believe that laws and punishments shouldn't apply to them as strictly as they do to regular people.

Because of this, rich people often take risks and commit crimes, hoping they can avoid punishment by bribing officials or using their money to get out of trouble.

Also, people with powerful family connections or those popular with the crowd feel brave enough to break laws, thinking they can overpower the ones who enforce them.

Some people think they are so smart that they criticize the leaders and question their authority. They try to confuse everyone so that only the laws they want to be crimes actually become crimes. These same people often lie and trick others because they believe their plans are too clever to be caught. This is just a false belief in their own wisdom.

Those who start trouble in a country usually don’t live long enough to see their plans work out. Often, their crimes end up helping future generations or people who never wanted those changes, which shows they weren’t as smart as they thought.

People who try to cheat thinking no one will notice usually only fool themselves. Thinking you are hidden just because you can’t see others is like a child covering their eyes and believing no one can see them.
