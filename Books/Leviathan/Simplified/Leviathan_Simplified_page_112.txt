These rights are what make a ruler truly powerful. They show who actually holds the top authority. These rights cannot be shared or separated.

Some powers, like making money, managing the property of young heirs, or having first choice in markets, can be given away by the ruler. But the ruler still keeps the main power to protect the people. However, if the ruler gives away control of the army, having judges is useless because laws can’t be enforced. If the ruler gives away the power to collect money, then owning the army doesn’t help. If the ruler lets others control religious beliefs, people might rebel out of fear.

If we look at any one of these rights, holding onto the others won’t keep peace and justice, which is why societies are created. This is why it’s said a kingdom divided against itself cannot last. If these powers weren’t believed to be shared between the King, Lords, and House of Commons, the people wouldn’t have split and gone into Civil War. First, they fought over politics, then over religious freedom. This taught people that these rights must stay together, and most people in England now understand this. They will accept this again when peace returns, and it will stay this way until people forget their troubles—unless ordinary people learn better than before.

Since these rights are essential and can’t be separated, even if it seems like some have been given away in words, the grant means nothing unless the ruler fully gives up being the sovereign and those who receive the power stop calling the ruler sovereign. Because if the ruler still keeps sovereignty, everything stays as it was.

This big power cannot be split or separated from being the ruler. So, it doesn’t make sense when some say that a king has more power than any one subject but less power than all the subjects together.
