When people make mistakes in thinking, none of those mistakes can excuse a crime, especially for someone managing their own affairs. It’s even less excusable for people in public positions because they are supposed to use reason, not excuses.

One common reason people commit crimes is vainglory, which means being too proud or thinking too highly of themselves. They believe their worth comes from their intelligence, money, family background, or other natural qualities, not from the rules set by those in power. This leads them to think that laws and punishments shouldn’t apply to them as strictly as they do to regular people.

Because of this, rich people often take risks and commit crimes, hoping they can avoid punishment by bribing officials or buying their way out.

Also, people with powerful family connections or popular followers feel brave enough to break laws because they think they can overpower those who enforce the rules.

Some people who think they are very smart criticize the government and question its authority. They try to confuse everyone and change the laws to fit their own plans, making only what they want illegal. These people often commit sneaky crimes because they believe they are too clever to get caught. This wrong belief in their own smartness leads to trouble.

In fact, most of the people who start big fights or civil wars don’t live long enough to see their plans succeed. Their crimes usually end up benefiting future generations or people who didn’t want those changes, showing they weren’t as smart as they thought.

People who try to hide their bad actions often fool only themselves. They think they’re invisible, but really, they’re just blind to their own mistakes, like kids who believe they’re hidden when they cover their eyes.
