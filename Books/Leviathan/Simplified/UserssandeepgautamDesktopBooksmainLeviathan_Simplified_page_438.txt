When people talk and argue, they need good reasoning skills. Without these, decisions are quick and unfair. But if there isn’t strong speaking to get people to listen and agree, good reasons don’t have much effect. These two skills are opposite: reasoning is based on truth, while speaking often depends on opinions, feelings, and what people want, which can change.

Among feelings, courage means not being afraid of pain or death. It can make people want revenge or disturb peace. Fear, on the other hand, can make people avoid protecting others.

They say a person can’t be both brave and fearful at the same time.

Also, because people think and act so differently, it’s hard to stay friendly with everyone we have to deal with. Life is mostly about fighting for respect, money, and power.

I think these problems are big but not impossible. With learning and practice, people can handle them. Judgment and imagination can both be in one person, but at different times, depending on what’s needed. Like the Israelites in Egypt who sometimes worked making bricks and sometimes gathered straw, people can focus on serious things or let their thoughts wander. Reason and good speaking can work together, especially about right and wrong. Where people like to show off wrong ideas, they can also show off the truth if it’s available. You can respect laws and still be brave against enemies. You can avoid hurting others and forgive them too. Human nature isn’t really against being a good citizen, even if some think so. I’ve seen clear thinking, creativity, strong reasoning, smooth speaking, bravery in war, and respect for laws all in one person—my good friend Mr. Sidney Godolphin. He didn’t hate anyone and wasn’t hated. Sadly, he was killed early in the recent civil war by someone who didn’t understand him.
