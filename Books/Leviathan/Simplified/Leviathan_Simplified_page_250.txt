God made him a living being. When it says “all Scripture is given by inspiration from God” (II Timothy 3:16), it means that God guided the minds of the Old Testament writers so they would write things helpful for teaching people, correcting them, and showing them how to live right.

But when St. Peter says “Prophecy came not by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit” (II Peter 1:21), the Holy Spirit means God’s voice coming through dreams or visions, which is different from inspiration. When Jesus breathed on His disciples and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit,” that breath was a sign of the spiritual gifts He gave them, not the Spirit itself. 

Even though it says many people, including Jesus, were full of the Holy Spirit, this means they had many gifts from God, like being holy or speaking in tongues. These gifts could come naturally or through hard work, but they are all from God. When God says, “I will pour out my Spirit on all people, your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions” (Joel 2:28), it doesn’t mean the Spirit is like water that can be poured out. It means God promised to give them dreams and visions. Saying that God’s grace is “poured in” is not quite right because grace is a virtue, not a physical thing like water.

In the same way, saying good spirits enter people to make them prophesy, or bad spirits enter people who are crazy or sick, is not the meaning in the Bible. The Spirit means God’s power working in ways we don’t understand. The wind that filled the house when the apostles were gathered on Pentecost (Acts 2:2) is not the Holy Spirit itself, which is God, but a sign showing God’s special work in their hearts. This helped them receive the grace and virtues they needed to do their work as apostles.
