The sacraments we use when we first join the church only happen once because you only need to join once. But we need to be reminded often about how we were saved and our commitment, so other sacraments are done again and again. These are the main sacraments and feel like serious promises we make to show our loyalty. There are also other special ceremonies called sacraments because they involve dedicating ourselves to God. Since sacraments mean making a promise to God, the Old Testament only had circumcision and the Passover. The New Testament only has baptism and the Lord’s Supper.

When we talk about the word of God or the word of man, it doesn’t just mean a single word like a noun or a verb. It means a full sentence or message where someone says something clearly, like telling, promising, or asking.

In this way, the word means a full speech or message, not just one word.

Sometimes, when we say the word of God or man, it means the person who spoke it. For example, when we say the Gospel of St. Matthew, we mean the book written by St. Matthew. Other times, it means the topic or subject. For instance, when the Bible says “The words of the days of the kings of Israel or Judah,” it means the things that happened during those kings’ times.

In the Greek Bible, “word of God” often doesn’t mean what God said but talks about God and His rules. It means the teaching about religion. So, saying “word of God” is like saying “theology,” which is the study of religion.

For example, in Acts 13:46, when Paul and Barnabas spoke about the “word of God,” they meant the message of the Christian faith. Also, when an angel told the Apostles to “go stand and speak in the Temple, all the words of this life,” it meant sharing the teachings of life.
