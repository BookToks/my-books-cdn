Only Moses, and after him the high priest, were given the power by God to make this short part of the Ten Commandments into law for the people of Israel. Moses, Aaron, and the high priests were the leaders in charge. So, making the Scripture into law was the job of the civil leaders.

The judicial law, which means the rules God gave to judges in Israel to help them make fair decisions between people, and the Levitical law, which means the rules about the priests and their ceremonies, were all given by Moses. These laws became official because people promised to obey Moses. It’s not clear if these laws were written down or just told to the people by Moses after he spent forty days with God on the mountain. But all these laws were important and counted as holy Scripture, made official by Moses as the civil leader.

When the Israelites reached the plains of Moab near Jericho, ready to enter the Promised Land, Moses added more laws. These are called Deuteronomy, which means “Second Laws.” They are described as a new agreement God told Moses to make with the people, besides the first one at Horeb. In Deuteronomy, Moses explains the old laws and adds new ones starting from chapter twelve to chapter twenty-six. The people were told to write these laws on big plastered stones as they crossed the Jordan River. Moses also wrote them down in a book and gave it to the priests and elders. They were told to put the book beside the Ark of the Covenant, which held only the Ten Commandments.

Moses told the kings of Israel to keep a copy of this law. After a long time, the book was lost but later found again in the Temple during King Josiah’s time. Josiah made it the official law of God again. Both Moses, when he wrote it, and Josiah, when he found it, had the highest authority in the land.
