The first Apostle who was chosen after Jesus was no longer on earth was Matthias. About 120 Christians gathered in Jerusalem. They picked two men, Joseph the Just and Matthias, and then they prayed and picked one by drawing lots. The lot fell on Matthias, so he became an Apostle. This shows that the group of believers chose Matthias, not just Peter or the other Apostles.

After Matthias, no other Apostles were chosen except Paul and Barnabas. In the church at Antioch, there were some prophets and teachers like Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, and Saul (Paul). While they were praying and fasting, the Holy Spirit told them to set apart Barnabas and Saul for a special job God had for them.

After more praying and laying hands on them, the church sent Barnabas and Saul away to do their work. This shows that even though the Holy Spirit called them, the church at Antioch confirmed their mission. Both Barnabas and Saul are called Apostles. Paul himself said he was an Apostle chosen to preach God’s message, referring to the Holy Spirit’s words when he was chosen.

Some might wonder how Paul could be an Apostle since he never met Jesus before Jesus died. But Jesus appeared to Paul on the way to Damascus after Jesus had risen and gone to heaven. Jesus chose Paul to tell people about Him. Since Paul saw the risen Jesus, he could witness to His resurrection. Barnabas was already a follower before Jesus died.

So, Paul and Barnabas were Apostles too. But they were chosen and sent by the church at Antioch, not just by the first Apostles. Just like Matthias was chosen by the church in Jerusalem.
