Leviathan/21 Speech helps us remember how one thing causes another by giving names and connecting them.

Some names are for just one thing, like Peter, John, this man, or this tree. Others are for many things, like man, horse, or tree. Even though these names are the same, they refer to many different things. These names are called universal because they apply to many things, while the things themselves are all unique.

A universal name is given to many things because they share some quality or feature. A proper name reminds us of only one thing, but universal names can mean any one of many things.

Some universal names cover more things than others. For example, "body" includes "man," so it's a bigger group. The names "man" and "rational" cover the same group of things. Also, a name doesn’t always have to be just one word. Sometimes, many words together can be one name. For example, "He that in his actions observeth the laws of his country" means the same as the single word "just."

By giving names like this, we change how we think about the results of things in our mind into how we think about the results of names. For example, a person who cannot speak or hear might look at a triangle and see that its three angles add up to two right angles, like the corners of a square. But if they see a different triangle, they can't easily tell if its angles add up the same way.

Someone who knows words can understand that this angle equality happens not because of the triangle’s side lengths or any other detail, but because it has three straight sides and three angles, which is why it’s called a triangle. This person can then say for all triangles: the three angles always add up to two right angles.
