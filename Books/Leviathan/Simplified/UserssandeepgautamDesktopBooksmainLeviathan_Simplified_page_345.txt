We need to understand that the Apostle Simon was called Stone. This comes from the Syriac word "cephas" and the Greek word "petrus," both meaning stone. After Simon said that Jesus was the Christ, Jesus said, “You are Stone, and on this Stone I will build my Church.” This means that Jesus was saying, “Believing that I am the Christ is the foundation of faith for everyone in my Church.” 

Using someone’s name like this is common when people talk, but if Jesus wanted to build his Church only on Peter himself, he would have simply said, “I will build my Church on you.” Instead, he made a connection to Peter’s name, which means stone.

When Jesus said, “I will give you the keys of heaven,” he was actually giving this power to all his disciples too. He told them, “Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven” (Matthew 18:18). This power belongs to all top church leaders, including Christian rulers in their own lands.

If Peter or Jesus had converted any of these leaders to believe in him, they didn’t take away their right to rule or teach in their own kingdoms. Jesus’ kingdom is not of this world, so the rulers kept their authority. This shows that Peter was not the boss of all Christians everywhere, which some people say in their books.

The second book says two things: that Peter was the Bishop of Rome and died there, and that the Popes of Rome are his successors. Some people disagree with this. But even if it’s true, being the Bishop of Rome doesn’t mean being the boss of the whole Church. The first Christian emperor, Constantine, was the real bishop in charge of the Roman Empire. Other Christian rulers had the same right to lead in their own areas. This answers Thomas Hobbes’ second book.
