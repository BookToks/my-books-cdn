If we expect the Bible to answer every single question that might confuse us when trying to follow God’s commands, it’s like complaining that Moses didn’t say exactly when spirits were created, just like he didn’t say when the earth, sea, people, and animals were made.

In the Bible, I see that there are angels and spirits, both good and bad. But it doesn’t say that they have no bodies, like ghosts people see in the dark, or in dreams or visions. The Latin word for those is "spectra," and people used to think they were demons. The Bible does say there are spirits with bodies, but they are very subtle and invisible. It doesn’t say that anyone’s body is taken over or lived in by these spirits. It also says that the bodies of saints will be special spiritual bodies, as St. Paul explains.

Still, many people in the Church believe that there are spirits without bodies. Because of this belief, the Church practices exorcism, which means driving out devils by special prayers. This is done only rarely now, but it hasn’t completely stopped. Long ago, in the early Church, there were many people thought to be possessed by demons, and few who were just mentally ill. Today, we see more people with mental illness and fewer who seem possessed. This change is not because people have changed, but because the names we use have changed.

Why the early Church leaders, like the Apostles, could heal strange illnesses and do amazing things, but people today rarely do, is another question. Back then, true believers could do things like cast out devils, speak new languages, pick up snakes, drink poison without being hurt, and heal the sick just by praying in Jesus’ name (Mark 16:17). It’s likely that these special gifts were only given as long as people fully trusted Christ and hoped for his kingdom to come. But when people started wanting power and money, and relied on their own cleverness for success in this world, these amazing gifts from God were taken away.
