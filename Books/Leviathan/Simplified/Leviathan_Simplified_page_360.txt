Power is really divided, and it’s just as risky to share power indirectly with someone else as it is to share it directly. Now, let’s look at his arguments.

The first argument says, “The civil power is under the spiritual power. So, the person with the highest spiritual power can tell kings and rulers what to do, especially about spiritual matters.”

But when we talk about civil (or government) power and spiritual power, we need to understand what it means to say one is under the other. There are only two ways to make sense of it. Either the person with one power is controlled by the person with the other, or one power is a step toward reaching the other.

We can’t really say one power controls another power, or that one power has the right to command another. Things like control and command belong to people, not powers. One skill can be less important than another, like the skill of a saddler (who makes saddles) compared to the skill of a rider. If civil government helps us reach spiritual happiness, it doesn’t mean a king has to obey the Pope any more than a saddler must obey a rider. So just because one government is less important doesn’t mean the leader of that government has to obey the other leader.

When he says the civil power is under the spiritual power, he means the ruler of the civil government is under the spiritual ruler. His argument is: the civil ruler is under the spiritual ruler, so the spiritual ruler can command civil rulers. But that just repeats the idea without proving it.

To prove it, he says, “Kings, popes, clergy, and regular people all make one group, or one Church. All parts depend on each other. Spiritual things don’t depend on worldly things, so worldly things depend on spiritual things, meaning spiritual leaders have power over civil leaders.”

This argument has two big mistakes. First, not all Christian kings, popes, clergy, and people are one group. For example, France is one country, Spain is another, and Venice is a third. Each has many Christians, so each is like its own church. Their rulers speak for them and have the power to command and obey, like regular people do. There is no one big Church with one ruler on earth. If there were, all Christians would be one group with one leader in both spiritual and worldly matters.

The Pope doesn’t have this kind of power because he is missing three things Jesus didn’t give him: the power to command, judge, and punish, except by excluding people who don’t listen. Even if the Pope is Christ’s only representative, he can’t really rule until Jesus comes back. And when Jesus returns, it won’t be the Pope but St. [text cuts off].
