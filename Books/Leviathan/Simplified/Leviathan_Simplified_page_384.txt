At first, when the priest makes holy water, he says a special prayer, asking God to make the water holy so it can drive away evil spirits. He does the same with salt, asking that it keeps away the devil’s tricks and unclean spirits. He also blesses oil, asking it to protect against all attacks from the devil.

Before a baby is baptized, the priest does several things to protect the child from evil. At the church door, he blows on the baby three times and tells any unclean spirits to leave and make room for the Holy Spirit. It’s like he’s acting as if all babies have evil spirits until the priest blows on them. He repeats these prayers a few more times before the baptism. These kinds of prayers and rituals take the place of blessings during baptism and the Lord’s Supper, except for the priest’s spit, which is used without special prayers.

Other church ceremonies like marriage, last rites, visiting the sick, and blessing churches and graveyards also use these kinds of charms. They use holy oil and water, the sign of the cross, and special words from the Bible, all meant to drive away evil spirits or imagined ghosts.

Another common mistake comes from misunderstanding words like eternal life, everlasting death, and the second death. The Bible clearly says God made Adam to live forever if he didn’t disobey. This wasn’t because humans are naturally immortal, but because of the tree of life, which Adam could eat from as long as he stayed sinless. When Adam sinned, he was kicked out of Paradise so he couldn’t eat from the tree and live forever. Jesus’ death and suffering remove sin for those who believe in Him, giving eternal life only to the faithful. But many people wrongly believe that every human naturally has eternal life just because their soul never dies.
