The things that push on us are just different kinds of movements (because movement only makes more movement). But how they look to us is like a trick, like when we are awake or dreaming. When you press, rub, or hit your eye, you might see light, and when you press your ear, you might hear noise. The things we see or hear do the same, but in a way we don’t notice. If colors and sounds were actually inside the objects, we couldn’t separate them like we do with mirrors or echoes. We know the real thing is in one place, and the image or sound is somewhere else. Even if the real thing and the image look like they’re together from far away, they are still different. So, what we sense is just a kind of original trick caused by the movement of things outside pressing on our eyes, ears, and other senses.

But schools and universities, following Aristotle, teach something different. They say that for seeing, the thing we look at sends out a visible “show” or image in every direction, and seeing happens when this enters our eyes. For hearing, the thing making sound sends out a “sound image” that enters our ears and makes us hear. Even for understanding, they say the thing we understand sends out an “intelligible image” that comes into our mind and makes us understand. I’m not saying universities are useless, but since I will talk later about their role in society, I want to point out what could be improved, like how often they talk about things that don’t really matter.

II: About Imagination  
When something is still, it will stay still forever unless something else moves it. Everyone agrees with this. But when something is moving, it will keep moving forever unless something else stops it. People don’t easily agree with this, even though the reason is the same (nothing can change itself). People judge everything by themselves: because after moving, they feel tired and want to rest, they think everything else gets tired too and wants to stop moving. They don’t really think if maybe what they call “rest” is just a different kind of movement.
