In the Bible, it says there will be a terrible time of trouble that no one has ever seen before and no one ever will again. It will be so bad that if it lasted too long, no one would survive. But for the sake of those chosen by God, those days will be made shorter. This trouble hasn’t happened yet because right after it, the sun and moon will go dark, stars will fall, the sky will shake, and Jesus will come back in a very powerful way. So, the Antichrist hasn’t come yet. Many Popes have come and gone, but the Antichrist is different. Even though the Pope tries to make rules for all Christian kings and countries, which Jesus never did, he does it in Jesus’ name, so he is not the Antichrist.

In the fourth book, to prove the Pope is the highest judge on all religious and moral questions, meaning he is like the absolute ruler for all Christians, three main points are made. First, the Pope’s decisions can never be wrong. Second, he can make laws and punish those who don’t follow them. Third, Jesus gave the Pope all church authority.

To prove the Pope’s decisions are always right, the book uses the Bible. It quotes Luke 22:31, where Jesus says to Peter, “Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith won't fail. When you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.” According to the book’s explanation, this means Jesus gave Peter and all future Popes two powers: their faith would never fail, and they could never be wrong when deciding on faith or morals. But this is a strange and forced way to understand the verse. If you read that chapter carefully, you’ll see it actually argues against the Pope’s authority.

In the story, the priests and teachers of the law wanted to kill Jesus during Passover, and Judas had already decided to betray Him. When the time came, Jesus celebrated Passover with His apostles, saying He wouldn’t eat it again until the kingdom of God came. He told them one of them would betray Him, and they argued about who would be the greatest in this coming kingdom. Jesus explained that kings rule over their people and are called “benefactors," but He said He wouldn’t be like that. Instead, His followers must serve each other. He said He was setting up a kingdom, but it was the kind His Father had planned. It’s a kingdom He would earn through His death and wouldn’t fully own until He returned. Then, His followers would sit with Him as judges over the tribes of Israel.
