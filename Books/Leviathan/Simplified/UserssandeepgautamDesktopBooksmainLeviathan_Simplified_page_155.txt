Money is something that helps people carry things they need, whether those things can be moved or not, wherever they go, both near and far from where they usually live. It also moves from person to person inside the country, helping every part of it. You can think of this process like how blood moves through the body, carrying nutrients to every part, keeping the body alive and healthy.

Gold and silver are valuable because of what they are made of. Their value can’t be changed easily by one or a few countries. They work as a common way to measure the value of things everywhere. But cheaper types of money can have their value changed easily. Also, gold and silver help countries reach out and trade with other countries, and they can even support whole armies. On the other hand, coins that are only valuable because of where they were made don’t travel well and only work in their own country. Their value can also change if the laws change, which can hurt the people who have them.

There are two ways money moves around in public use: one way collects money for the government; the other way pays money out for public needs. Collectors, receivers, and treasurers collect the money. Treasurers and officers pay the money to public or private workers. This system is like how the veins and arteries in the body work: veins bring blood to the heart, which then sends it out through arteries to keep the body moving and alive.

When a country sends groups of people to live in a new place, these groups are called colonies or plantations. They are led by a governor and settle in empty lands or lands cleared by war.

Once a colony is set up, it can become its own country, free from the country that sent them. In this case, the original country is called the mother country, and their relationship is like that of parents and children who have grown up and become independent, staying friends and honoring each other. Or the colony can stay part of the original country, like the provinces of ancient Rome, not becoming independent but still connected to the country that created them.
