Sometimes, people use words to show how one name relates to another. For example, when someone says, “a man is a body,” they mean that the word “body” is connected to the word “man” because they are really talking about the same thing. This connection is shown by using the word “is.” Just like we use “is” in English, the Latins use “est,” and the Greeks use “esti” in their languages.

I don’t know if every language in the world has a word like “is,” but they don’t really need one. Putting two names in order can show their connection, if that’s how people usually speak. The way people use words is what makes them powerful.

Even if a language didn’t have a word like “is,” the people who speak it could still think, reason, and make conclusions just as well as the Greeks and Latins did. But then, what would happen to words like “entity,” “essence,” and “essentiality,” which come from “is”? These words don’t really name things; instead, they are signs that show we understand how one name relates to another. For example, when we say, “a man is a living body,” we don’t mean the man, the living body, and the word “is” are three separate things. We mean the man and the living body are the same thing because if he is a man, then he is a living body. So, words like “to be a body,” “to walk,” “to speak,” “to live,” and “to see,” or nouns like “walking,” “speaking,” “life,” and “sight” don’t actually name anything by themselves.

Some people might ask, why bother with all these tricky ideas when I only want to talk about government and obeying laws? The reason is to stop people from being tricked by complicated ideas from old philosophy, like Aristotle’s, that scare them away from following their country’s laws. These ideas are like scaring birds away from crops using a fake bird, a hat, and a stick. For example, when someone dies and is buried, some people say their soul, which is their life, can walk around separately from their body and be seen at night among the graves.
