A king on earth can be called the image of God, and a lower official can be called the image of that king. 

In the past, people who worshiped idols didn’t always care if the idol looked exactly like what they imagined their god to be, but they still called it an image of their god. For example, sometimes a rough stone was used to represent Neptune, even if it didn’t look like the god they pictured. 

Today, we see many statues of the Virgin Mary and other saints that look different from each other and don’t match any one person’s imagination. But these statues still serve their purpose—they just stand for the people mentioned in stories. Everyone thinks about them in their own way, or not at all. So, an image is basically a copy or symbol of something you can see, or sometimes both a copy and symbol together.

The word “idol” in the Bible can also mean the sun, a star, or any other creature, whether visible or invisible, when people worship them like gods.

Now that we know what worship and images are, let’s look at what idolatry is—the thing forbidden in the second Commandment and other parts of the Bible.

To worship an image means to do actions that show honor to either the material of the image (like wood, stone, or metal), or the idea in your mind that the image represents, or both together, like a body and soul.

If you take off your hat before a powerful person or a throne, or in places they set for that, you are showing respect to that person, not the chair or place. This is civil respect, not idolatry. But if you think the soul of the ruler is in the chair, or pray to the chair, that would be worshiping like a god and is idolatry.

If you pray to a king for things he can actually do, even if you bow down to him, it’s just civil respect because you see him as a human. But if you pray to him for things only God can do, like good weather, that’s worshiping him as a god and is idolatry. 

If a king forces someone to worship him out of fear of death or punishment, it’s not idolatry. The worship done because of fear doesn’t show true honor inside, but just a desire to stay alive or safe. Worship that doesn’t come from inside isn’t real worship, so it’s not idolatry.
