I already explained earlier that to honor someone means to think they have a lot of power, and we decide how much by comparing them to others. But because no one is more powerful than God, if we don’t value Him as having unlimited power, we are actually disrespecting Him. So, true honor is something deep inside us, in our hearts.

The way people show their honor is through their thoughts, words, and actions, which we call worship. Worship means praying to, promising by, obeying, and trying hard to serve someone because we don’t want to upset them or want to please them. This is true whether the worship is real or fake, and because it shows honor, we often call it honor itself.

The worship we give to other people, like kings or leaders, is called civil worship. But the worship we give to God, no matter what words or actions we use, is called divine worship. For example, bowing down to a king is civil worship if you think he’s just a person. Taking off your hat in church because you believe it’s God’s house is divine worship.

Some people try to separate divine and civil worship by the words used in the Bible (douleia and latreia), but that’s confusing. There are two kinds of servants: slaves who have no freedom because their masters control everything about them, and hired servants who work because they want to and have an agreement. Both kinds of servants work for someone else.

The word latreia means any kind of service, whether by slaves or hired workers. Douleia means the service of slaves only, which is about being owned. The Bible uses both words to talk about how we serve God.
