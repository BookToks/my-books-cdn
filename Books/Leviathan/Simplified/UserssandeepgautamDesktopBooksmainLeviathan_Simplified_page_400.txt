What kind of things were called demons can be partly found in the family tree of their gods, written by Hesiod, one of the oldest Greek poets, and partly in other stories I mentioned earlier in Chapter 12 of this talk.

The Greeks spread their language and writings to Asia, Egypt, and Italy through their colonies and conquests. Because of this, their ideas about demons, or as St. Paul called them, their teachings about devils, also spread. This influence reached the Jews in places like Judaea and Alexandria, where they lived. But unlike the Greeks, who called both good and bad spirits demons, the Jews only called the bad ones demons. They called the good spirits the Spirit of God and believed that people with these spirits inside them were prophets.

In short, the Jews thought that anything special and good came from the Spirit of God, and anything bad came from an evil demon, or devil. They called people possessed by devils "demoniacs," like how we might say someone is crazy, has epilepsy, or says strange things. They also said that very dirty or sinful people had unclean spirits, dumb people had dumb devils, and even said that John the Baptist had a devil because of how much he fasted (Matthew 11:18). They said Jesus had a devil because He said those who followed Him wouldn’t die forever, and people didn’t believe Him (John 8:52). When Jesus said some wanted to kill Him, people said, “You have a devil; who’s trying to kill you?” (John 7:20). This shows that the Jews believed these spirits were real, not just made-up ideas.

If this belief isn’t true, some might ask, why didn’t Jesus say otherwise? Why did He sometimes talk like He believed it? First, Jesus said, “A spirit doesn’t have flesh and bones” (Luke 24), meaning spirits are different from humans.
