The main job of a Commonwealth is to keep its people safe and peaceful at home and protect them from attacks by other countries. To do this well, you need to understand people, how governments work, and ideas like fairness, law, justice, and honor. You also need to know about your own country’s resources and strengths, as well as those of your neighbors. Plus, you have to understand what other countries might want or plan to do. Learning all this takes a lot of experience and study.

Not only do you need to know everything in general, but each part of it needs time and observation to understand. Good advice comes from good judgment, which depends on what kind of education and experience a person has. For some things, like building machines or buildings, there are exact rules you can learn. But when there are no clear rules, the person with the most experience gives the best advice.

Also, when giving advice about dealing with other countries, you have to know what information and messages come from them and understand all the past agreements between the countries. Only trusted representatives can really know this.

This shows that people who aren’t asked for their advice usually don’t have good ideas to share in these situations.

When there are many advisers, it’s better to listen to them one by one, not all together. That’s because in a group, some people might just agree with others without thinking for themselves, trying to avoid conflict or seem smarter. Also, some people in the group may have their own interests that don’t match what’s best for everyone. Their strong feelings can influence others, and when many people get heated together, it can cause big problems for the country even though they’re supposed to be helping.
