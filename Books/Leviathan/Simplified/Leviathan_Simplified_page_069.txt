Religion started from four things: belief in ghosts, not knowing what really causes things, being devoted to what people are afraid of, and thinking random events predict the future. Because people think and feel differently, religion has grown into many different ceremonies. What one person does might seem silly to another.

Two kinds of people have shaped these ideas. One group made up their own rules and practices. The other followed what they believed was God’s instructions. Both groups wanted people to obey laws, live peacefully, be kind, and get along in society. The first group’s religion is part of human politics and teaches what kings want from their people. The second group’s religion is about God’s kingdom and guides those who follow God’s rules. The first group includes the founders of countries and lawmakers. The second group includes Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, who gave us the laws of God’s kingdom.

When it comes to beliefs about invisible powers, almost everything had a god or spirit in the old times. Poets even made up stories about these spirits living in things.

For example, the world’s raw material was called Chaos, a god. The sky, ocean, planets, fire, earth, and wind were all gods too.

People worshipped many things—men, women, animals like birds, crocodiles, calves, dogs, snakes, and even plants like onions and leeks. They also believed many places had spirits called demons: plains had Pan and Satyrs; woods had Fauns and Nymphs; the sea had Tritons and other Nymphs; rivers and fountains had their own ghosts and Nymphs; every house had household spirits called Lares; every person had a spirit called a Genius; Hell was full of ghosts and spirits like Charon, Cerberus, and the Furies. At night, places were thought to be full of ghosts and fairies. They even made gods out of things like time, night, day, peace, love, fighting, honor, health, rust, and fever. When they prayed for or against these things, they acted like ghosts of those names were controlling what happened.
