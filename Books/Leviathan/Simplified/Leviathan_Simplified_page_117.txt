It’s easier for people to blame others than to forgive them because that’s just how humans are. Also, it feels more like justice to punish someone than to let them off.

One problem with a monarchy is if the king or queen is a baby or too young to know right from wrong. In that case, someone else, like a person or a group, has to use the ruler’s power for them and protect them. But saying it’s a problem to have someone else in charge when the ruler is too young is like saying any government is worse than chaos or war.

The real danger comes from people who want the power for themselves because it’s a big honor and brings a lot of benefits. To show that this problem isn’t because of monarchy itself, we should look at who the previous ruler picked to take care of the young ruler. This might be written down or just accepted by tradition. If problems happen, it’s not because of monarchy but because some people are greedy or unfair. This happens in any kind of government if people don’t understand their responsibilities or the ruler’s rights.

If the old ruler didn’t choose anyone to help the young ruler, nature has a rule: the person who cares the most about keeping the ruler’s power safe, and who gains the least if the ruler loses power, should be in charge. Since everyone wants to help themselves, putting a baby ruler under the control of someone who benefits from harming them is not care—it’s betrayal. So if the right steps are taken, any fights about who rules when the monarch is a child aren’t caused by monarchy itself but by people’s greed and ignorance.

On the other hand, even big governments where power is shared by many people are in a similar situation. When making big decisions like war or peace, these groups act like children because they have to follow what most people want, whether it’s good or bad, and can’t easily disagree with the majority.
