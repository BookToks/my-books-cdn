This kind of thing isn’t very rare. Even people who are fully awake, if they are scared and believe in ghosts, can think they see spirits or dead people walking in graveyards when they are alone at night. But really, it’s just their imagination, or sometimes it’s tricksters using people’s fear to sneak around without being noticed.

Because people didn’t know how to tell the difference between dreams, imagination, and real things, a lot of old religions started. They worshipped creatures like satyrs, fauns, and nymphs. Today, some people believe in fairies, ghosts, goblins, and witches. I don’t think witches actually have real powers, but they often get punished because they believe they do and want to cause trouble. Their beliefs are more like a new religion than a skill or science. As for fairies and ghosts, people either taught these stories on purpose or didn’t stop them, so that things like exorcisms, crosses, and holy water would stay important. 

There’s no doubt God can make strange visions happen, but He doesn’t do it so often that people should be more afraid of ghosts than of changes in nature, which He can also control. Some bad people use the idea that God can do anything to say whatever they want, even if it’s not true. Wise people shouldn’t believe them unless what they say makes sense. If people stopped being so scared of spirits, and stopped believing in dreams and false predictions, it would be easier for them to follow rules and live together peacefully.

Schools should help with this, but instead they often teach these wrong ideas. They don’t really understand what imagination or the senses are. Some say imaginations just happen on their own with no reason, others say they come from what a person wants. Some believe good thoughts come from God and bad thoughts from the Devil, or that these thoughts are put into people by God or the Devil. Some think the senses pass information from one part of the mind to another, using complicated words that don’t really explain anything clearly.
