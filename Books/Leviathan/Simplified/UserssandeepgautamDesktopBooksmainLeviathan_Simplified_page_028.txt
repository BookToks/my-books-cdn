When we think or talk using general words and come to a wrong general conclusion, it’s not just a mistake—it’s actually nonsense or something that doesn’t make sense. A mistake is when we believe something happened or will happen, even if it might not have, but it isn’t impossible. But when we make a general statement that isn’t true, it doesn’t even make sense to think it could be possible. Words that only sound like words but don’t mean anything are called absurd or nonsense. So, if someone talks about a “round square,” or “bread having accidents in cheese,” or “things without a body,” or a “free subject” or “free will” meaning free from any kind of opposition, I wouldn’t say they made a mistake—I’d say their words have no real meaning, they are just absurd.

I said before that humans are better than animals because when they think of something, they like to find out what will happen next or what they can do with it. Now I add that humans can use words to make these ideas into general rules, called theorems or sayings. This means people can think and reason not just with numbers, but with anything you can add or take away.

But this great ability comes with a problem: humans are the only creatures who can say things that are totally absurd. And philosophers are the ones most likely to do this. Cicero once said that you can find the most ridiculous ideas in books written by philosophers. This happens because philosophers don’t start thinking with clear definitions of the words they use. Only geometry does this, and that’s why its ideas are always right.

The first reason for these absurd ideas is that philosophers don’t begin with clear definitions. It’s like trying to do math without knowing what numbers like one, two, or three mean.

Also, since all physical things can be thought about in many different ways, and these ways have different names, mixing up these names and ideas causes lots of confusion and nonsense in their arguments.
