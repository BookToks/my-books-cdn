According to this idea, a kingdom belongs to God. But Moses didn’t have the right to be the leader of the Israelites just because of Abraham’s inheritance, since he couldn’t claim it by birth. So, the people only had to follow Moses as God’s representative as long as they believed God was really speaking to him.

This means Moses’ power depended on how much people trusted that he was holy, that God really talked to him, and that his miracles were true. If people stopped believing that, they didn’t have to accept his laws as God’s commands anymore. So, we need to think about why they had to obey him at all.

It couldn’t be because God directly told them to obey, since God spoke to them only through Moses. Even Jesus said that if he only testified about himself, it wouldn’t be true. So, if Moses was only testifying on his own, especially about being king, people didn’t have to believe him. His power, like that of other rulers, had to be based on the people agreeing to obey him. And that’s what happened: when the people saw the thunder, lightning, trumpet, and smoke on the mountain, they stood far away and said, “Moses, speak to us, and we will listen, but don’t let God speak to us directly or we will die.” This was their promise to obey Moses, and because of that, they agreed to follow whatever he said was God’s command.

Even though the covenant created a priestly kingdom that would be passed down to Aaron’s family, this only applied after Moses died. Anyone who starts a new government, whether a monarchy, aristocracy, or democracy, has to have full power while they set it up. The Bible shows Moses had that power while he was alive. First, the people promised to obey Moses, not Aaron. Second, God told Moses to come close to Him alone, while the others had to stay back, showing Moses’ special role as leader.
