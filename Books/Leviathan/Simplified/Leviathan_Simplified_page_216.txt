The best advisors are those who don’t expect to gain anything from giving bad advice and who really understand what helps keep the country safe and peaceful. It’s hard to tell who wants to cause problems for their own benefit. But a clue is when people try to calm others down about problems that can’t be fixed, especially if those people don’t have enough money to cover their usual expenses. Anyone paying attention can notice this.

It’s even harder to know who really understands public matters. People who understand these things usually don’t need them much. Knowing who knows the rules of any skill means you understand the skill too because you can’t trust someone’s advice unless you understand what they’re saying. The best proof that someone knows a skill is that they spend a lot of time doing it and it works well. Good advice doesn’t come by chance or because someone is rich or noble. So, rich or noble people aren’t always the best advisers about how to run a country, just like they might not be good at designing a fortress. Politics is a serious subject that needs study, not just watching.

In parts of Europe, some people think it’s their right to be in the top government positions because their family has been there before. This comes from the ancient Germans, where powerful leaders joined forces to conquer other lands and wanted special privileges to set their children apart from others. These privileges don’t really fit with the idea of a ruler’s full power. Sometimes the rulers let them keep these privileges, but if the leaders fight too much over them, they will lose them over time and only keep the respect they earn by their abilities.

No matter how good the advisors are, their advice works best when they give it to each person separately with clear reasons, instead of giving speeches in a big group. It’s also better when they have time to think before they speak, not when they talk suddenly. This way, they can think about what might happen and avoid getting into arguments because of jealousy or other strong feelings from different opinions.
