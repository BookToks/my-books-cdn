No one has the freedom to fight against the government’s power to protect others, whether the person they’re defending did something wrong or not. This kind of freedom would take away the government’s ability to keep us safe, which would destroy how government works.

But if a lot of people have already stood up against the government unfairly, or done something very serious that could get them all killed, don’t they have the right to join forces, help, and protect each other? Yes, they do. They are just trying to save their own lives, which both guilty and innocent people can do. Even though it was wrong to start fighting the government, keeping up the fight to protect themselves isn’t unfair or wrong.

However, if the government offers them a pardon, then they can’t say they are just defending themselves anymore. If they keep helping or protecting others after the pardon, it’s illegal.

Other freedoms depend on whether the law says anything about them. If the government hasn’t made a rule about something, people can choose to do it or not do it on their own. This means freedoms can be bigger or smaller depending on where you are or what the government decides is best. For example, in England, there was a time when a man could forcefully take back his own land from someone who was living there illegally. But later, a law made by the king and Parliament took away that freedom.

In some parts of the world, people are allowed to have many wives, but in other places, that is not allowed.

If a person has a problem with the government about money they owe, land or goods they own, or any service or punishment based on an old law, they have the same right to take their case to court as if they were dealing with another person. Since the government is asking for something based on an old law and not just using its power, it shows the government only wants what the law says is fair. So, the person has the right to have their case heard and judged according to that law.
