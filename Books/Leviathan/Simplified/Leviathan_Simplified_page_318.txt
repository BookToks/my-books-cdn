If there is no community, there can be no excommunication; and if there is no power to judge, there can be no power to give a sentence.

Because of this, one Church cannot excommunicate another. Either they have the same power to excommunicate each other, which would just cause division and break friendship, or one is under the other, making them both one Church. In that case, the part that is kicked out is no longer a Church, just a group of people.

Excommunication means people are told not to hang out or even eat with the person who is excommunicated. But if a king or ruler is excommunicated, this has no effect. All subjects must be with their ruler when asked, by natural law. They can’t kick him out of his own land or leave without permission, and they can’t refuse to eat with him if he invites them. As for other kings and states, since they aren’t part of the same community, they don’t need excommunication to stay away from a state that is excommunicated. Being separate communities is enough to keep them apart. So excommunication doesn’t really do anything between kings and states except maybe cause wars.

Excommunication also doesn’t work on a Christian who follows the laws of their own ruler, whether the ruler is Christian or not.

If someone believes “Jesus is the Christ, he has the Spirit of God,” and “God lives in him, and he lives in God,” then that person can’t be hurt by being excommunicated by people. So anyone who truly believes Jesus is the Christ is safe from the dangers that come with excommunication. If someone doesn’t believe this, they aren’t a Christian. A true Christian can’t be excommunicated, and even someone who says they are Christian can’t be excommunicated until their bad behavior shows, especially when it breaks the law of their ruler. The Church can only judge behavior by what it sees outside, and those actions are only wrong if they go against the law of the country.
