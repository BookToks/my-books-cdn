We talked before about how God's power is based on nature. Now, let's think about what divine laws are. These laws come from natural reason and deal with how people should treat each other and how we should honor God.

The first laws are the same natural laws I mentioned earlier, like fairness, justice, mercy, and humility. Now, we need to think about the rules that come from natural reason alone, without needing any special message from God, about how to honor and worship God.

Honoring means thinking highly of someone's power and goodness. So, to honor God means to believe that He is as powerful and good as possible. When we show this belief through our words and actions, it’s called worship. The Latin word "cultus" means the effort we put into something to get a benefit from it.

When we work on something for a benefit, it can be something we control, like farming the land, where the results naturally come from our work. Or it can involve other people, where we try to get their favor by being nice, praising them, or showing respect. This second kind of effort is like “courting” someone’s favor, and this is what worship really means. For example, "cultus Dei" means worshiping God.

From the feeling of honoring God’s power and goodness come three emotions: love (which relates to goodness), and hope and fear (which relate to power). These lead to three ways we show worship outside ourselves: praise, magnifying, and blessing. Praise is about goodness, and magnifying and blessing are about power and the happiness that comes from it. We show praise and magnifying with words when we say someone is good or great, and with actions when we thank them or obey their power. We can only show the hope for someone’s happiness through words.
