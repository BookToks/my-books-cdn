So Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were alive because of God's promise when Christ spoke, but they are not truly alive until the resurrection. The story of Dives and Lazarus doesn’t prove anything against this if we understand it as a parable.

There are other parts of the New Testament that seem to say that the wicked live forever. It’s clear that everyone will rise for judgment. Many places say the wicked will go into “everlasting fire,” “everlasting punishment,” and that the “worm of conscience never dies.” These ideas are all part of what is called “everlasting death,” often thought to mean “everlasting life in suffering.” But I can’t find anywhere that says people will live in pain forever.

It’s also hard to believe that God, who is full of mercy and controls everything, would punish people forever with extreme suffering. God gives us the choice to do good or to change our ways, so it doesn’t make sense that He would punish people endlessly. So, we need to think carefully about what “everlasting fire” and similar phrases really mean in the Bible.

I have already explained that the kingdom of God through Christ starts on the day of judgment. On that day, faithful people will rise with glorious, spiritual bodies and be part of God’s eternal kingdom. They won’t marry or eat and drink like they did before but will live forever as themselves. The wicked will also rise to be punished for their sins. Those who are alive at that time will have their bodies changed to be spiritual and immortal.

But there is no clear Bible passage that says the wicked will have spiritual, glorious bodies like angels or that their life will be truly eternal like the faithful or like Adam’s would have been if he hadn’t sinned. The only places that seem to say they will suffer forever can be understood in other ways.
