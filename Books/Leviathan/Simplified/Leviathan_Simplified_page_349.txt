God talks about Abraham himself, not someone hired by him, when He says, “I know Abraham, and he will tell his children and family to follow God’s way and do what is right” (Genesis 18:19).

The next example is from Exodus 28:30, where God says, “You shall put the Urim and Thummim in the breastplate of judgment.” The Septuagint (an old Bible translation) explains this as “evidence and truth.” This means God gave the high priest something like perfect truth to make good decisions. Whether it was actual truth or just a strong reminder to be fair, it was given to the high priest, who was like the ruler under God in Israel. This shows that civil rulers have authority over their people, which goes against the idea that the Pope has absolute power.

These are all the Bible verses used to say the Pope’s decisions about faith can never be wrong.

For the Pope’s decisions about behavior, one verse is used: John 16:13, “When the Spirit of truth comes, he will lead you into all truth.” The writer says this means all the truth needed to be saved. But even with this, the Pope is no more perfect than any Christian who believes and won’t be lost. If someone makes a mistake about something needed for salvation, they can’t be saved. I will explain which things are necessary for salvation in the next chapter. For now, even if the Pope could never be wrong, that doesn’t give him the right to control other rulers’ lands. It would be like forcing someone to hire a worker even if they promised the job to someone else.

Besides these verses, there is a logical argument. If the Pope could be wrong about important things, then Christ didn’t do enough to protect the Church, because He told people to listen to the Pope.
