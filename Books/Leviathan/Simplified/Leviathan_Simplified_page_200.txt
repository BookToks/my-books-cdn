A fifth idea that can break apart a country is thinking that every person fully owns their stuff and the ruler has no say in it. It’s true that each person owns their things and others can’t take them, but this ownership is only allowed because the ruler says so. Without the ruler’s protection, anyone could take anyone else’s stuff. But if the ruler’s rights are ignored, they can’t do their job of protecting people from enemies or from each other, and then the country falls apart.

Also, if people’s ownership doesn’t stop the ruler from controlling their stuff, it’s even less likely to stop the ruler from controlling important jobs like judging or enforcing laws, which the ruler represents.

There is a sixth idea that goes straight against what makes a country work: that the ruler’s power can be split up. But dividing power in a country is the same as breaking it apart, because when powers are divided, they fight each other. These wrong ideas come mostly from some people who study laws and try to base them on what they’ve learned instead of following the government’s rules.

Besides wrong ideas, seeing different governments nearby can make people want to change their own. For example, the Jewish people wanted a king like other nations, so they asked the prophet Samuel for one. In Greece, small cities often fought between rulers and common people because some wanted to be like Sparta and others like Athens. Many people in England also wanted to copy the Low Countries, thinking that just changing their government would make them rich. People naturally want new things, and when they see neighbors getting richer by changing, it’s hard to stay happy with their own system. They keep wanting change even if it causes problems, like someone who can’t stop scratching an itch.
