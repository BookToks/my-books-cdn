When people talk or think because they want to know something, the conversation or thought will eventually stop, either because they find the answer or give up. If the conversation stops in the middle, it just stops for that moment.

If the thinking happens only in the mind, it goes back and forth between ideas like something will happen or it won't, or something has happened or it hasn't. So, whenever you stop someone's thinking, they are left guessing if something will or won’t happen, or if it has or hasn’t happened. This guessing is called opinion. When deciding if something is good or bad, your feelings change back and forth, and when figuring out if something is true or false, your ideas do the same. The final feeling you have when deciding is called the will, and the final idea you have about what’s true or false is called judgment or a final decision. The whole process of changing feelings about good or bad is called deliberation, and changing ideas about true or false is called doubt.

No talk or thought can ever give you 100% certain knowledge about things that happened before or will happen in the future. Knowing facts comes from what you sense and remember. Knowing how things connect, which is called science, is never absolute but depends on conditions. No one can know for sure that something is or will be without conditions; they only know things like “if this happens, then that will happen.” This knowledge is based on how words relate to each other, not on knowing facts for sure.

When people speak, they start by defining words, then connect these definitions to make general statements, and combine those statements into logical arguments called syllogisms. The final point of this kind of talk is called the conclusion, which shows conditional knowledge or science. But if the definitions or connections are wrong, the conclusion is just an opinion, sometimes even nonsense that can’t be understood. When two or more people know the same fact, they are aware of it together and can be witnesses for it. Because of this, it is always considered very wrong for someone to go against their own conscience or force someone else to do so. That’s why people have always taken the idea of conscience seriously.
