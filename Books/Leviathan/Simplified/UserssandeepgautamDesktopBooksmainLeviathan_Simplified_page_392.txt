From this, we can understand that after the resurrection, the chosen people will be brought back to the perfect state Adam was in before he sinned. But those who are rejected will stay in the state Adam and his descendants were in after sinning. God promised a savior to Adam and his descendants who trust and repent, but not to those who die in their sins, like the rejected ones.

With this in mind, the verses that talk about “eternal fire,” “eternal torments,” or “the worm that never dies” don’t go against the idea of a second and final death, which is a real death. The fire or punishment prepared for the wicked might last forever, and there will always be bad people to suffer there, but it doesn’t mean each person suffers forever.

The wicked, left in the state they were after Adam’s sin, might live after the resurrection just like before. They could marry and have children, because their bodies would still be weak and corruptible like ours now. There is nothing in the Bible that says otherwise. 

Paul talks about resurrection as rising to eternal life, not punishment. He says the body is “sown in corruption, raised in incorruption,” meaning the saved get new, perfect bodies. This can’t be said about those who rise for punishment.

Jesus also talks about resurrection meaning eternal life, not punishment. In Luke 20:34-36, He says people now marry and have children, but those worthy of eternal life won’t marry or die anymore. They will be like angels and children of God because of the resurrection. The people left in Adam’s fallen state will marry and have children after resurrection, but this is not true immortality for individuals. They won’t be part of the people who get eternal life; they will live only for a short time to be punished for their rebellion.
