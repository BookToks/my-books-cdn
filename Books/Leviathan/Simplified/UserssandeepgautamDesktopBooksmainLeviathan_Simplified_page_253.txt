No one was allowed to enter the most sacred place, called the sanctum sanctorum. This means no one could ask God directly what He wanted, except for the high priest. The English version says “a kingdom of priests,” but that either means one high priest after another or doesn’t match what St. Peter said about the high priest’s role. Only the high priest was supposed to tell the people God’s will, and no group of priests was ever allowed inside the sanctum sanctorum.

The title “holy nation” means the same thing. “Holy” means something that belongs to God in a special way, not just generally. The whole earth belongs to God, but only certain places, like the nation of the Jews, were called holy because they were set apart for God’s special service.

This shows that the kingdom of God was really like a community or government. It was made with the agreement of the people who would live under it. This government controlled how people behaved—not just in their relationship with God as their king, but also with each other in fairness and with other nations during peace and war. In this kingdom, God was the king, and after Moses died, the high priest acted as His representative or leader.

There are other examples that prove this. When the elders of Israel were unhappy with Samuel’s sons and asked for a king, Samuel prayed to God. God told Samuel, “Listen to the people, they haven’t rejected you, but they have rejected me as their king” (1 Samuel 8:7). This shows God was their king, and Samuel only passed on God’s instructions.

Also, Samuel said to the people, “When you saw Nahash, king of the Ammonites, coming against you, you said, ‘We want a king to rule us,’ but the Lord your God was your king” (1 Samuel 12:12). This clearly shows that God was their king and ruled their government.

After the Israelites rejected God as their king, the prophets said He would come back to rule again. For example, Isaiah said, “Then the moon will be confused, and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts rules on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem.”
