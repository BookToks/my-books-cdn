When people say the Pope doesn’t have the highest civil power in other countries, it means he doesn’t get that power from the people living there like other rulers do. Usually, rulers get their power because the people agree to be ruled by them, either to protect themselves from enemies or because they were conquered.

The Pope says he doesn’t get his power from the people’s agreement. Instead, he claims his power comes directly from God because he is the Pope. Even if he doesn’t get power the usual way, he still claims he can take away the power of kings and rulers whenever he thinks it’s necessary to save people’s souls. He also says only he can decide when saving souls is the reason to do this.

This belief isn’t just from one person. Many religious teachers and church councils have said the same thing, and Popes have acted on it many times. For example, the Fourth Council of Lateran said if a king doesn’t get rid of heretics after the Pope tells him to, and he doesn’t fix things within a year after being kicked out of the church, then the people don’t have to obey him anymore.

We’ve seen this happen before, like when Childeric, King of France, was removed, or when Charlemagne was made ruler of the Roman Empire, and in other cases like with King John of England and the kingdom of Navarre. More recently, the Pope’s power was challenged in the fight against Henry the Third of France.

Most kings think this is unfair and causes problems. I hope they decide to either be fully in charge themselves or fully obey the Pope, because trying to serve two rulers at once doesn’t work. So, they should either keep full control or give all control to the Pope to protect those who want to obey. The idea that there’s a difference between political power and religious power is just talk.
