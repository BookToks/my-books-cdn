If a person has been punished for something before, doing the same thing again is a bigger crime than if others got away with it. When some people aren’t punished, it gives others hope they won’t be punished either. This hope comes from the ruler, so the ruler shares some blame for the crime and can’t blame the person alone.

A crime done in sudden anger isn’t as bad as one planned carefully. If someone acts out of sudden feeling, we can understand because everyone makes mistakes. But if someone plans a crime, they think about the law, the punishment, and how it affects others, and still choose to do it. Still, no sudden anger can fully excuse a crime because from the moment they know the law, they should think carefully before breaking it.

If the law is clearly explained to everyone, breaking it is worse than when people don’t have clear information and have to guess. In the second case, part of the fault is because people didn’t know better. But if the law is well known, breaking it shows carelessness and disrespect for the ruler.

Sometimes, the law says something is wrong, but the ruler’s actions show it’s okay. These crimes are less serious than when both the law and ruler say it’s wrong. This is confusing because it’s like having two opposite rules. Since people should notice the ruler’s real feelings, this can excuse them. Also, if the ruler punishes people for following the law, the ruler partly causes the crime and can’t blame the person fully. 

For example, dueling is illegal and punishable by death. But if someone refuses a duel, they might be mocked or ignored, even by the ruler. So if they accept a duel to avoid this, they shouldn’t be punished too harshly because the ruler’s attitude partly caused it. This doesn’t mean people should take revenge or disobey the law, but rulers should avoid encouraging things they officially forbid.
