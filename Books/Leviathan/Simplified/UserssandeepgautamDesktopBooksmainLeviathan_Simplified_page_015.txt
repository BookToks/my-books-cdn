When people or animals hear words or signs, they imagine things in their mind. This is what we usually call understanding, and both humans and animals have it. For example, a dog learns to understand when its owner calls or scolds it, and many other animals do this too.

But the kind of understanding that is special to humans is different. Humans don’t just understand what someone wants; they also understand ideas and thoughts by putting together names of things into sentences that say yes, no, or other meanings. I will talk more about this kind of understanding later.

III: About the Sequence or Chain of Thoughts  
By sequence or chain of thoughts, I mean the way one thought comes right after another in the mind. This is called mental talking, to show it’s different from talking out loud.

When someone thinks about something, the next thought is not completely random. Thoughts don’t just follow each other in any order. We can only imagine things that we have sensed before, either fully or partly. Also, we can only move from one thought to another if we have experienced something like that with our senses before.  

This happens because all our thoughts are like movements inside us, leftovers from the movements made when we sensed something. The movements that happened one after another while sensing tend to stay connected in our mind. So when one thought becomes strong again, the next thought that follows is connected to it, like water on a flat surface moving in the direction your finger pushes it.  

But sometimes, when we sense the same thing, different things come one after another. So when we imagine, we can’t always be sure what the next thought will be; the only thing we know for sure is that it will be something that has followed that thought before, at some time.

This chain of thoughts, or mental talking, can be two kinds. The first kind is random, without any plan, and keeps changing. In it, no strong feeling or desire controls the thoughts to follow a goal. When this happens, thoughts wander around and don’t seem connected, like in a dream.
