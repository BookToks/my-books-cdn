Fear can only make a promise invalid if it happens after the promise is made, like a new problem or sign that shows someone won’t keep their word. If something couldn’t stop a person from making a promise, it can’t stop them from keeping it.

When someone gives away a right, they also give away the way to use it, as much as they can control. For example, if someone sells land, it includes the plants on it. If someone sells a mill, they can’t stop the water that powers it. If someone gives power to rule, it means they can collect money for soldiers and choose judges.

You can’t make promises with animals because they don’t understand our language or rules, and they can’t agree or pass on rights. Without both sides agreeing, there is no promise.

You can’t make promises directly with God except through people God talks to, either by miracles or people who represent Him. Otherwise, we don’t know if God agrees. So, if someone promises to do something against the laws of nature, the promise is useless because it’s unfair. If the promise follows natural laws, it’s the law, not the promise, that makes it binding.

Promises are always about something that can be thought about carefully because making a promise is a decision. It’s always about something in the future that the person believes they can do.

Promises to do something impossible from the start aren’t real promises. But if something becomes impossible later, and it was possible before, the promise still counts. The person must try to do as much as they can because no one can be forced to do more than possible.

People are free from their promises in two ways: by doing what they promised or by being forgiven. Doing what you promised finishes the promise, and forgiveness gives back freedom by canceling the promise.
