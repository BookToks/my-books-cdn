We only read that Jesus and his Apostles had a purse, which Judas Iscariot carried. Some Apostles who were fishermen still worked at their trade sometimes. When Jesus sent the twelve Apostles to preach, he told them not to carry gold, silver, or copper in their purses because “the worker deserves to be paid.” This probably means they were taken care of in a way that matched their work.

Their job was to give freely because they had received freely. They lived on gifts given by those who believed the good news they shared about the coming of the Messiah, their Savior. Also, some people Jesus healed gave money out of thanks. For example, some women who had been healed, like Mary Magdalene (who had seven demons), Joanna (the wife of Herod’s steward), Susanna, and others, helped support Jesus with their own money.

After Jesus went to heaven, Christians in every city shared their money from selling land and possessions. They gave it willingly to the Apostles, not because they had to. St. Peter said to Ananias, “Wasn’t the land yours before you sold it? And after you sold it, wasn’t the money yours?” This shows Ananias didn’t have to lie or save his land or money since no one forced him to give anything.

During the time of the Apostles and for many years after, until after Emperor Constantine the Great, the support for bishops and pastors came only from people who chose to give. There were no official tithes yet. But in Constantine’s time and later, Christians loved their pastors so much that bishops lived in luxury, as the historian Ammianus Marcellinus said. Bishops were carried in coaches and dressed richly because of the generosity of their followers, especially wealthy women.

Some might wonder if pastors had to live only on these voluntary gifts, like charity. St. Paul asked, “Who goes to war at their own expense? Or who feeds a flock and doesn’t eat some of the milk?” He also said, “Those who serve in holy things live from those things; and those who serve at the altar share in what the altar offers.” This means pastors deserved to be supported by their people.
