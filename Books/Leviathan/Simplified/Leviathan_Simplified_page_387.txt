The presbytery (a church group) has challenged the power to kick out their own kings and to be the main leaders in religion where they use that church system. This challenge is as strong as the Pope’s challenge everywhere else.

Jesus said, “Some of you standing here won’t die before you see God’s kingdom come with power.” (Mark 9:1) If we take this literally, it means either some of those people were still alive or the kingdom of God is already here in this world. But there’s another tricky part: after Jesus rose from the dead and before He went up to heaven, the apostles asked Him, “Are you going to bring back the kingdom to Israel now?” He said, “It’s not for you to know when that will happen. The Father decides the time. But you will get power when the Holy Spirit comes to you, and you will tell everyone about me, starting in Jerusalem and going all over the world.” (Acts 1:6-8) This means Jesus’ kingdom hadn’t come yet, and they wouldn’t know exactly when it would. It would come suddenly, but the Holy Spirit would help them spread the word about Jesus’ resurrection and teachings, so people would believe and wait for eternal life when Jesus returns.

How does this fit with the idea that Jesus’ kingdom came when He rose from the dead? St. Paul said people stopped worshiping idols and started serving the true God, “waiting for His Son to come from heaven” (1 Thessalonians 1:9-10). They wouldn’t need to wait if the kingdom was already here. Also, if the kingdom started at Jesus’ resurrection, why do Christians still pray, “Let your kingdom come”? So, it’s clear that Jesus didn’t mean the kingdom came right then.

Jesus said some of the people standing there would see God’s kingdom come with power before they died. If the kingdom came when Jesus rose, why say “some” and not “all”? Because all of them lived past the resurrection.

For those who want to understand this text perfectly, they should also think about similar words Jesus said to Peter.
