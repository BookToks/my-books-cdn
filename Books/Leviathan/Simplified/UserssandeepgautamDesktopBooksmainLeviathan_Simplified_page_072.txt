Second, they made people believe that the gods didn’t like the same things that the laws said were wrong. Third, they set up ceremonies, prayers, sacrifices, and festivals that people believed could calm the gods’ anger. They thought bad things like losing wars, big sickness outbreaks, earthquakes, and personal problems happened because the gods were angry. The gods got mad if people forgot or messed up the ceremonies or didn’t worship them properly.

Even though ancient Romans didn’t stop people from doubting what poets said about pain and pleasure after death, many important people still believed in it more than not.

Because of these rules and ideas, the leaders kept the peace in their country. When bad things happened, people blamed themselves for messing up the ceremonies or breaking laws, so they were less likely to rebel. They also enjoyed big festivals and games for the gods, which kept them happy. All they really needed was food to stop them from complaining or causing trouble. So, the Romans, who had conquered most of the known world, didn’t mind letting any religion exist in Rome unless it went against their government. The only religion they didn’t allow was the Jewish one, because Jews believed they couldn’t obey any human king or government. This shows how Roman religion was part of their political plan.

But where God revealed religion directly, He also created a special kingdom and gave rules not just about how to worship Him but also how people should treat each other. So, in God’s kingdom, the government and religion are connected, and there is no separate spiritual and political power.
