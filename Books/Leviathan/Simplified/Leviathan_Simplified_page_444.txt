In the part about a Christian country, there are some new ideas that, if the opposite had already been decided, might be wrong for someone to share without permission because it would be like taking the teacher’s job. But now, when people want not just peace but also the truth, sharing ideas that I believe are true and help bring peace and loyalty with those still thinking about these things is like offering new wine to be put in new bottles so both can be kept safe. I think that when new ideas don’t cause problems or chaos, people don’t usually respect old things so much that they would choose old mistakes over new, proven truths.

I don’t trust my way of explaining things very much, but I’m sure (except for mistakes made by the printer) it’s not hard to understand. I didn’t use fancy quotes from old poets, speakers, or philosophers like many do these days, and whether this was good or bad comes from my judgment for many reasons. First, all true teachings depend on either reason or the Bible; both are trusted by many but don’t get their trust from any writer. Second, the questions here are about what is right, not about facts, so there’s no need for witnesses. Almost none of the old writers agree with themselves or each other all the time, so their words can’t be fully trusted. Fourth, ideas trusted only because they are old are not really the true thoughts of those who repeat them, but just words passed around like gossip. Fifth, sometimes people use others’ smart ideas to hide their own wrong teachings. Sixth, I don’t think the old writers they quote thought it was cool to copy others who wrote before them. Seventh, it looks bad when people repeat Greek and Latin sentences without understanding them, like they usually do. Lastly, even though I respect those old writers who clearly told the truth or helped us find it better ourselves, I don’t think we owe anything just because they are old. If we respect age, then the present is the oldest time. If Leviathan honors old writers, I’m not sure those honored were older when they wrote than I am now. But if we think about it, the praise for old authors doesn’t come from respect for the dead, but from the competition and jealousy of the living.
