The word "prophesy" means receiving messages from God through dreams and visions. This is how God spoke to Solomon, promising him wisdom, wealth, and honor. The Bible says, “And Solomon woke up, and it was a dream.” So, in the Old Testament, prophets got God’s messages mostly through their dreams or visions. These were special, supernatural experiences for true prophets, but for false prophets, their dreams were either normal or fake.

These prophets were also said to speak by the Spirit. For example, a prophet said that the people made their hearts so hard that they wouldn’t listen to the laws and messages God sent through the prophets’ Spirit. This shows that speaking by the Spirit wasn’t different from getting visions. When prophets spoke by the Spirit, it meant they had a special mission or a new dream or vision from God.

Some prophets had a permanent role in the Old Testament, while others were less important. The most important prophets were first Moses, then the high priests, as long as the priesthood was powerful. After the Jewish people stopped accepting God as their king, the kings who obeyed God became the main prophets, and the high priests’ role became less important. When people wanted to ask God for advice, the priests wore special clothes and asked God for answers as the king ordered. But the priests could lose their job if the king wanted.

For example, King Saul told the priest to bring a burnt offering. He also told the priest to bring the Ark closer and later to leave it alone because he saw a chance to win against his enemies. Saul also asked God for advice. King David, before he became king, asked God if he should fight the Philistines in Keilah. He told the priest to bring the ephod, a special garment, to ask God if he should stay in Keilah or not. King Solomon took the priesthood away from Abiathar and gave it to Zadok.

So, Moses, the high priests, and the godly kings who asked God for guidance on important matters were all top-level prophets.
