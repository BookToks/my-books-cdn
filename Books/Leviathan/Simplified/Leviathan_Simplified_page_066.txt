Many people have noticed the idea of religion. Some of them have tried to develop it by making rules and adding their own ideas about what causes future events. They did this because they thought it would help them control others and get more power for themselves.

There are no signs of religion in animals or plants, only in humans. So, the idea of religion must be something special that only humans have. It comes from a unique part of human nature.

First, humans are naturally curious. They want to understand why things happen, especially why good or bad things happen to them.

Second, when people see something begin, they believe it must have a cause that made it start at that specific time, not earlier or later.

Third, animals only care about food, comfort, and pleasure because they don’t think much about the future. But humans notice how one event leads to another and remember what happened before. When they don’t know the real cause of something, they guess or trust others who seem wiser.

The first two points cause worry. Since people know everything has a cause, they always try to protect themselves from bad things and get good things. This makes them anxious about the future all the time.

This is like the story of Prometheus, whose name means "the wise man." He was tied to a mountain where an eagle ate his liver every day, but it grew back every night. People who worry too much about the future feel like Prometheus—they are constantly scared of death, poverty, or problems. They can only rest when they sleep.
