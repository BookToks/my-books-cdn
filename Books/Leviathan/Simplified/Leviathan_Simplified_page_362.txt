If there was a spiritual country in this world, separate from regular governments, then its leader could use war to protect himself if someone hurt him or might hurt him later. War here means overthrowing, killing, or fighting against others. But by the same logic, a regular government leader could also go to war against the spiritual leader if they felt threatened. I don’t think Cardinal Bellarmine would agree with that idea.

But there is no spiritual country in this world. The spiritual kingdom is the kingdom of Christ, which Jesus said is not part of this world but will come in the next life, at the resurrection. Then, those who lived rightly and believed Jesus is the Christ will rise again with spiritual bodies. At that time, Jesus will judge the world, defeat his enemies, and create a spiritual kingdom. Until then, since no people on earth have spiritual bodies, there can’t be a spiritual country among living humans. Preachers who teach about this kingdom aren’t a country either, as I have already explained.

The third point is this: “It’s not okay for Christians to accept a king who doesn’t believe or who tries to make them believe wrongly. But only the Pope can decide if a king is leading people into wrong beliefs. So, the Pope can decide if a king should be removed.” I say both ideas are wrong. If people don’t accept their king’s laws, even about religion, they break their faith and go against God’s law. Also, only the king or government can decide what is heresy (wrong belief) in their country. Heresy is just a personal opinion that goes against what the government says must be taught. So, if the government says a belief is true, it can’t be heresy. Heretics are just private people who stubbornly believe things their lawful rulers have banned.
