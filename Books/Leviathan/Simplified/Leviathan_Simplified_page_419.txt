But it is clear from the many times our Savior criticized them that they changed the meaning of the law with their wrong explanations and useless traditions. They didn’t really understand the prophets and so they didn’t believe in Christ or the miracles he did, even though the prophets had talked about these things.

Instead, when they taught and argued in their synagogues, they turned the law into a strange kind of philosophy. They mixed confusing ideas about God and spirits with Greek philosophy and their own made-up ideas from unclear parts of the Scriptures. They also included old stories from their ancestors that weren’t true.

What we now call a University is a group of many public schools joined together under one system in a town or city. The main schools were for three main jobs: the Roman religion, Roman law, and medicine. Philosophy was only studied as a helper to the Roman religion. Since Aristotle’s ideas were the only ones accepted there, this wasn’t really philosophy (which should not depend on one person’s ideas) but just Aristotelian philosophy.

Geometry wasn’t taught at all until recently because it only deals with exact truth. If someone got really good at geometry by their own skill, people often thought they were a magician and that their work was evil.

Now, to talk about the specific ideas of useless philosophy that came into the Universities and the Church from Aristotle and from not understanding things well, I will first look at their basic ideas. There is a certain “first philosophy” that all other philosophy should be based on. It mainly deals with clearly defining the most common and general words. These clear definitions help avoid confusion and misunderstanding when arguing. These words include things like body, time, place, matter, form, essence, substance, accident, power, act, finite, infinite, quantity, quality, motion, action, and feeling.

The explanation of these ideas is usually called metaphysics in the Schools, because it is part of Aristotle’s philosophy and that is the name it has.
