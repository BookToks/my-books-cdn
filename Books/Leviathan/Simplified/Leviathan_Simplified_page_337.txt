First, we need to remember that the power to decide what beliefs are okay for peace and what should be taught belongs to the government in every country. It doesn’t matter if the government is one person or a group of people. This is clear because people’s actions come from what they believe is good or bad for them. If people think following the government will hurt them more than not following it, they will break the laws. This can cause the country to fall apart and lead to chaos and civil war. Civil governments were made to prevent this from happening. That’s why, in old non-Christian countries, rulers were called “pastors” of the people—they controlled what could be taught and no one could teach without their permission.

The power that these old rulers had didn’t go away when they became Christians. Jesus never said kings should lose their power just because they believe in him. Kings still have to keep peace in their country and protect it from enemies. So Christian kings are still the main leaders or “pastors” of their people. They have the power to pick which teachers or pastors will teach the Church and the people.

Also, the right to choose pastors was in the Church even before kings became Christians, like in the time of the Apostles. This right now belongs to the Christian ruler, too. Because the ruler is Christian, he agrees with what is taught. And because he is the ruler, which means he represents the Church, the teachers he chooses are really chosen by the Church. When a group of Christians pick their pastor in a Christian country, the ruler is the one who actually chooses him because it’s done with his permission. It’s like when a town chooses a mayor—it only counts if the ruler agrees. So, even if history shows examples of pastors being chosen by the people or church leaders, it doesn’t go against the ruler’s right because those choices were made with the ruler’s permission.
