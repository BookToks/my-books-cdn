Some systems are under others; some are political, and some are private. Political ones (also called bodies politic or legal persons) are made by the highest power of the country. Private ones are created by people among themselves or by authority from someone outside. Authority from a foreign power inside another country is never public there, only private.

Among private systems, some are legal and some are illegal. Legal ones are allowed by the country; all others are illegal.

Irregular systems don’t have a leader and are just groups of people gathered together. If the country doesn’t forbid them and they aren’t for bad reasons (like people meeting at markets, shows, or other harmless events), they are legal. But if the reason is bad or the group is large and unknown, they are illegal.

In political bodies, the leader’s power is always limited. The one who sets these limits is the highest power, called the sovereign. Unlimited power means total control. The sovereign represents all the people in the country, so no one else can fully represent any part of them unless the sovereign allows it. Letting a group have full control would mean giving up part of the country’s government, which goes against peace and protection. The sovereign can only give up power clearly and directly, not by accident or unclear words.

The limits of power for a leader in a political body come from two things: their official orders from the sovereign, and the country’s laws.

When a country is first created and independent, no official papers are needed because the leader’s power is only limited by natural law. But in smaller groups under the main country, there need to be clear limits about their tasks, times, and places. These rules must be written down and officially sealed or signed by the sovereign so people can see and remember them.
