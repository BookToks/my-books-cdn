Monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy show us three types of rulers, not pastors. Or, you could say, they show us three kinds of heads of families, not three kinds of teachers for their kids.

So, the second point about the best way to run the Church doesn’t really answer the question about the Pope’s power outside his own lands. In other countries, if the Pope has any power at all, it’s more like the power of a teacher, not the head of a family.

The third point is that St. Peter was the leader of the Church. The main proof for this is from a passage in the Bible where Jesus says to Peter, “You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church,” and “I will give you the keys to heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”

But if you think about it carefully, this just means that the Church is built on one main belief. This belief is the one Peter said, representing all the Apostles, which made Jesus say those words.

To understand this clearly, remember that Jesus, John the Baptist, and the Apostles all preached just one main idea: that Jesus was the Christ, or the chosen one. All other beliefs depend on this one. John started by saying, “The kingdom of God is near.” Then Jesus said the same thing. When Jesus sent out his twelve Apostles, he only told them to preach this main idea. This was the foundation of the Church’s faith.

Later, Jesus asked all the Apostles, not just Peter, what people said about him. They said some thought he was John the Baptist, Elias, Jeremiah, or one of the Prophets. Then Jesus asked them all, “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered for everyone, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” This is the main belief the whole Church is built on. That’s why Jesus said, “On this rock I will build my Church.” It’s clear that the “rock” means the main belief of the Church’s faith.

But some people wonder, why did Jesus say “You are Peter” then? If the original meaning of the text had been strict, it would have been easier to understand.
