XXXIV: About the Meaning of Spirit, Angel, and Inspiration in the Holy Bible  
Since the foundation of all true thinking is the steady meaning of words, in this lesson, the meaning does not depend on what the writer wants or how people usually talk. Instead, it depends on the meaning they have in the Bible.  
Before I continue, I need to explain the meaning of some words from the Bible that might be confusing or unclear. I will start with the words body and spirit, which in school language are called substances—body is physical, and spirit is not physical.

  
The word body, in general, means something that fills or takes up a certain space, either real or imagined. It is not just made up in the mind but is a real part of what we call the universe. Since the universe is made up of all bodies, every real part of it is a body, and nothing is a body unless it is part of the universe.  
Bodies can change—they can look different to living creatures’ senses. This change is called substance, which means it can have different appearances or qualities, like moving or staying still, feeling hot or cold, or having different colors, smells, tastes, or sounds.

  
The different ways bodies appear happen because they affect our senses in different ways. We call these changes “accidents” of the bodies. So, the words substance and body mean the same thing. Saying “substance incorporeal” (a substance with no body) doesn’t make sense, like saying “a body without a body.”

  
But in everyday language, not everything in the universe is called a body, only the parts people can feel or see blocking their view. So, air and things like it are not usually called bodies. Instead, when people notice their effects, they call them wind, breath, or spirits (because in Latin, spiritus means breath or air). For example, the air inside a living creature that gives it life and movement is called vital or animal spirits.
