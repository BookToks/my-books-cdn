If a member owes money to a group, the group can sue him, but they can’t take his stuff or put him in jail by themselves. Only the government can do that. The group can only decide if the debt is real, which means they are judging their own case.

Groups made to run things or handle business can last forever or only for a certain time written down. But some groups only exist for a short time because of what they need to do. For example, if a king or a ruling group asks towns to send people to tell him about problems or help make laws, those people meet at a certain time and place. Then, they act like one group representing everyone. But they only talk about what the king or rulers ask them to. When the king says they’re done, the group breaks up. If they represented all the people fully, there would be two rulers, which would cause problems. So, where there is one ruler, the people can’t be fully represented except through that ruler. The limits of what the group can do are written down when they are chosen. People can only pick their representatives for the reasons written by the ruler.

Private groups that are legal don’t need official papers to exist, just the common laws everyone follows. These groups have one leader, like a family where the father or head makes the rules for everyone. He can make his kids and helpers obey him as far as the law allows, but not beyond that, because no one must do things the law says are wrong.
