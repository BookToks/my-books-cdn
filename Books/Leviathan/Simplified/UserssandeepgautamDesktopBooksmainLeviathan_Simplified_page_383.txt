The Egyptian magicians who were said to turn their staffs into snakes and water into blood probably just tricked people’s eyes with fake shows, but they were still called wizards.

But what would we think if their staffs didn’t really look like snakes, and the water didn’t really turn into blood or anything else, just stayed water? And yet they still acted like they had defeated the king, saying the staffs were really snakes and the blood was really water? That would be both magic and lying. 

In the same way, priests do something similar every day by using special words that don’t actually change what you see. They say the bread becomes a man, even a God, and ask people to worship it like it’s Jesus himself, which is a big mistake. If it’s okay to say the bread is really God to avoid idolatry, then why wouldn’t it be okay for Egyptians to say the vegetables they worship are really gods too?

When the priests say, “This is my body,” it really means, “This represents my body,” which is just a normal way of speaking. But if you take it literally, that’s wrong. Also, this should only apply to the bread that Jesus himself blessed. Jesus never said that any bread a priest says “This is my body” over will actually change. The idea that bread changes into Jesus’s body, called transubstantiation, wasn’t started by the Church of Rome until about 500 years ago, when the Pope’s power was very strong, and people were confused. They even put a picture of Christ on the bread to make people think it changed not only into Jesus’s body but also into the wood of the cross, and that they were eating both at once.

A similar kind of magic-like trick happens in baptism, where the names of God in the Trinity are said with the sign of the cross, making it like a charm.
