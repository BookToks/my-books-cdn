All other times are peaceful.

So, when there is war, where everyone is against everyone else, it’s the same as when people have no protection except their own strength and ideas. In this situation, no one works hard because the results are uncertain. Because of this, there is no farming, no sailing to get things from far away, no nice buildings, no tools to move heavy stuff, no understanding of the world, no way to keep track of time, no arts, no writing, no community, and worst of all, constant fear and danger of a violent death. Life is lonely, poor, unpleasant, brutal, and short.

Some people might find it strange that nature makes humans ready to fight and destroy each other. They might want proof by experience. So, think about this: when going on a trip, people take weapons and friends for safety; when going to sleep, they lock their doors; and even inside their homes, they lock their chests. They do this even though there are laws and officers to protect them. What does this say about how they trust others? Isn’t it like saying people are dangerous by their actions, just like I say with my words? But neither of us blames human nature. Our desires and feelings are not bad by themselves. Actions only become wrong when laws say so, and laws can’t exist until people agree on who will make them.

Some might think that there was never a time like this war state. I believe it never happened everywhere, but there are places where people still live this way now. For example, some savage groups in America, except for small family groups, have no government and live like I described before. Also, it’s easy to see what life would be like without a common power to fear by looking at how people who once lived peacefully can fall into civil war.
