Who can believe that someone who usually does things for selfish reasons really thinks there is an invisible power to be afraid of, when they scare others over smaller mistakes?

Love loses its meaning when people are caught doing things for their own personal gain, like wanting power, money, fame, or comfort just for themselves. If people get something good for themselves, others think they are not doing it out of love for them.

The only real proof that someone is truly chosen by God is through miracles, true prophecy (which is also a miracle), or amazing good luck. So, for religious beliefs that come from people who showed these miracles, others who don’t have miracles to prove their calling don’t get much trust. Just like smart people need natural signs to believe natural things, they also need supernatural signs, like miracles, to truly believe in spiritual things.

All these reasons for people losing faith can be seen in the examples below. First, the children of Israel, who followed Moses because he showed miracles and led them out of Egypt, stopped worshiping the true God when Moses was gone for just forty days. They made a golden calf to worship instead and went back to the idol worship of the Egyptians. Later, after Moses and his generation died, a new generation started worshiping Baal. So, when miracles stopped, faith also stopped.

Also, when Samuel’s sons became judges, they took bribes and were unfair. Because of this, the people of Israel didn’t want God to be their king in the way He had been, so they asked Samuel to choose a human king like other nations had. So when justice failed, faith failed too, and they rejected God as their ruler.

When Christianity began spreading, the old pagan priests lost respect because they were dirty, greedy, and tricked rulers. This helped many people believe in Christianity and join the faith, even though the old oracles had stopped working across the Roman Empire.
