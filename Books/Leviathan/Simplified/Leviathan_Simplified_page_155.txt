Money is what makes it possible for people to carry goods, both things that can be moved and things that can’t, wherever they go—whether it’s inside or outside their usual home. Money passes from person to person within a country, helping to support everyone, just like blood moves through the body to keep all parts alive and healthy.

Silver and gold are valuable because of what they are made of, so their worth can’t be changed by just one country or a few countries. They act as a common way to measure the value of goods everywhere. But fake or less valuable money can easily be made worth more or less. Also, silver and gold let countries reach out and trade or support travelers and armies in other lands. Money that isn’t valuable by itself but only because of where it was made only works well at home, and its value can change if laws change, sometimes hurting the people who have it.

There are two main ways money moves for public use: one way is collecting money into the government’s funds, and the other is spending that money to pay for public needs. Collectors, receivers, and treasurers bring money in; treasurers and officers pay it out. This is like how blood flows in the body—veins bring blood to the heart, which pumps it out again to keep the body working.

When a country creates new settlements far away, called colonies or plantations, they send groups of people led by a leader to live there. These places might have been empty before or emptied by war.

Once a colony is set up, it can either become its own independent country, free from the one that sent them—like children growing up and moving out but still staying close as family—or it can stay connected to the original country as a province, like the colonies of ancient Rome, not fully independent but part of the larger country.
