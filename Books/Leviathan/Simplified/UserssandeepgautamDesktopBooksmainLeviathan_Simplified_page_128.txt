After they both ate, they took on God's job of deciding what is good and bad, but they didn’t actually get any new power to tell the difference correctly. When it says they saw they were naked, no one thinks they were blind before and couldn’t see their own bodies. It simply means they first thought their nakedness was shameful, which was God’s idea to create them that way. Feeling ashamed was like secretly judging God Himself.

Then God asks, “Have you eaten?” as if saying, if you’re supposed to obey me, why are you trying to judge my rules? This shows, in a symbolic way, that people who have the right to give orders shouldn’t be questioned or argued with by those who must obey.

So, it’s clear to me from both reason and the Bible that the highest power, whether held by one person like a king or a group like a government, is as strong as it can be. Even though some might worry about bad results from such power, the problems caused by not having it—like constant fighting between people—are way worse. Life always has problems, but most big problems in a country come from people not following the rules that keep the country together. Anyone who thinks the highest power is too strong and tries to weaken it must answer to an even stronger power.

The biggest question people ask is about real life: when and where have people ever accepted this much power? But you can ask back, when has any kingdom stayed peaceful and free from rebellion for long? In countries where governments have lasted long and weren’t destroyed by outside enemies, people never argued about the highest power. Still, judging from how people act without fully understanding government is wrong. Even if everyone built their houses on sand, it wouldn’t mean that’s the right way. Making and keeping a good government is based on clear rules, like math and geometry, not just practice. But poor people don’t have time to study this, and even those who do haven’t really figured it out yet.
