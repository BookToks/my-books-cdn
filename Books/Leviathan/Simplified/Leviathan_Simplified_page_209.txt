Thirdly, because of this, people should know how bad it is to say mean things about the ruler, whether it’s one person or a group. They shouldn’t argue or disrespect the ruler’s power or use their name in a way that makes others look down on them. If people lose respect for the ruler, they might stop obeying, and that can make the whole country unsafe. This idea is connected to the third Commandment.

Fourthly, since people can’t learn this easily or remember it well, and after one generation they might not even know who is in charge, it’s important to set aside special times for them to learn. At these times, they can gather, say prayers and praise God, and hear about their duties and the laws that affect everyone. They should also be reminded who has the power to make these laws. The Jews did this every seventh day, called the Sabbath, when they read and explained the law. They remembered that God was their king because He created the world and rested on the seventh day. They also rested from work to show God was their king, who saved them from slavery in Egypt and gave them time to enjoy life. The first part of the Commandments talks about God’s total power as King, which can help rulers understand what to teach their people.

Because parents are responsible for teaching children at first, kids need to obey their parents while they are learning from them. Even after that, to show thanks, they should respect their parents openly. They should be taught that every person’s father was once like their ruler, with power over life and death. When families started creating governments, fathers gave up that total power, but this didn’t mean they lost the respect they deserve for raising their children. Giving up power was not needed to create governments, and it wouldn’t make sense for people to have children if they didn’t get any special respect from them later on.
