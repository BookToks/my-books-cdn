This double monopoly hurts both the people at home and foreigners. At home, because they are the only ones who export goods, they can set any price they want on farming and handmade products. They also control all the imports, so they decide the prices on all foreign goods people need. This is bad for the people. For foreigners, since only one group sells native products abroad and buys foreign products, they raise prices on what they sell and lower prices on what they buy. This is bad for foreigners. When only one seller exists, goods get more expensive, and when only one buyer exists, goods get cheaper. These groups act like monopolies. They could be good for the country if they only worked together when selling abroad, but at home, everyone should be free to buy and sell at their own prices.

The goal of these merchant groups is not to help everyone together (they don't share a common fund except what they put in for ships and supplies), but to make money for each investor. So, it makes sense that everyone knows what their own money is doing. This means every member should be able to join meetings where decisions are made and see the group's accounts.

If the merchant group borrows money from an outsider through their meeting’s decision, each member is responsible for the whole debt. Outsiders don’t know their internal rules, so they see each member as responsible for the full payment until someone pays it all. But if the debt is to someone inside the group, that person owes themselves the whole amount and can only ask the group’s funds for payment.

If the government charges a tax on the group, it is shared fairly based on how much each member invested. That’s because the group only has money from each person’s investment.

If a fine is given for a wrong act, only those who voted for or helped with the act are responsible. The others are not guilty. Being part of the group is not a crime just because the group was created by the government.
