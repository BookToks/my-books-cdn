7. Also, unwritten customs, which are basically habits that act like laws, become real laws if the emperor agrees with them and if they don’t go against natural law.

Laws can be split into two types: natural and positive. Natural laws have always existed and are called moral laws. These include things like justice, fairness, and good habits that help people live peacefully and kindly, which I talked about in earlier chapters.

Positive laws are made by people in power and didn’t exist forever. They can be written down or explained in some way by the rulers.

Positive laws can be human-made or divine (from God). Human positive laws are either distributive or penal. Distributive laws decide what rights people have, like owning land or goods, and apply to everyone. Penal laws say what punishments will happen if someone breaks the law and are meant for the officials who enforce the law. Even though everyone should know the punishments, the rules are really told to the officials, not the people who break them, since those people won’t punish themselves. Penal laws are usually written with distributive laws and are sometimes called judgments. All laws are like general rulings by lawmakers, and a specific judgment is a law for the person involved.

Divine positive laws come from God but are not eternal or for everyone. They are rules given to certain people or groups by those who have God’s permission to share them. But how can people know if someone really has God’s permission? God might tell a person in a supernatural way to give laws to others.

The problem is that for a law to be followed, people need to trust the person who made it has real authority. Since we can’t naturally tell if this authority is from God, how can someone without a supernatural experience be sure the law they got from another person really came from God?
