A person is like an actor, both on stage and in everyday life. To personate means to act or represent yourself or someone else. When someone acts for another, they are said to "bear their person" or act in their name. For example, Cicero said, "I bear three persons: myself, my opponent, and the judge." People who do this can be called different names like a representative, a deputy, an attorney, or an actor.

Some people, called artificial persons, have their words and actions accepted by the people they represent. In this case, the actor is the one doing the action, but the person they represent is the author. The actor acts with the author’s authority. Just like owning something means you have rights over it, having authority means you have the right to do certain actions. When something is done by authority, it’s done with permission from the person who has the right.

Because of this, when an actor makes an agreement with authority, they are legally binding the author as much as if the author made the agreement themselves. The author is responsible for all the results of that agreement.

So, the rules about agreements between people are the same when those agreements are made by actors or representatives, but only as far as the actor has permission to act.

If you make an agreement with an actor without knowing their authority, you take a risk. No one is bound by an agreement they didn’t agree to or that was made beyond the authority they gave.

If the actor does something wrong because the author told them to, and the actor promised to obey the author, it’s the author who breaks the rules, not the actor. Even if the action is wrong, the actor must obey because breaking a promise to obey is against the natural law.

If you make an agreement with the author through an actor but don’t know the actor’s authority and don’t ask for proof, you aren’t truly bound by the agreement. The agreement isn’t valid without the author’s clear approval.
