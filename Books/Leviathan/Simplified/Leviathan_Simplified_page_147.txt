The situation here, according to the laws of that people, was fair. But their meeting was called illegal, and the official scolded them by saying, “If Demetrius and the other workers want to accuse someone, they have ways to do it—let them accuse each other. And if you have other demands, your case can be handled in a properly called meeting. Right now, we might be blamed for causing trouble today, because no one can explain why this group gathered.”

He called any meeting where people can’t explain themselves a rebellion, and something they couldn’t defend. That’s all I will say about groups and meetings of people, which I compared before to parts of a human body: legal ones are like muscles, while illegal ones are like boils and infections caused by bad things mixing unnaturally.

XXIII: About Public Officials of Ruling Power

In the last chapter, I talked about the parts of a country. Now, I will talk about the important people who work for the government.

A public official is someone chosen by the ruler, whether a king or a group, to handle certain jobs with the power to act for the country. Every ruler or group has two roles: one as a normal person and one as a political leader. A king is both a person and the leader of the country, and a ruling group is both a group and the leader.

People who work for the ruler as regular people are not public officials. Only those who help run the government’s work are public officials. So, helpers like ushers or guards who only serve the people meeting, or servants in the king’s household, are not public officials.

Some public officials are in charge of running the government’s work for the whole country or parts of it.
