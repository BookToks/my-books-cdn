When someone is trusted to be a judge or decision-maker, if they do their job well, they are said to give each person what they deserve. This is called fair treatment. Sometimes people call this distributive justice, but a better word is equity, which is also a natural law, as will be explained later.

Just like justice depends on an agreement made before, gratitude depends on a free gift given before. This is the fourth natural law: if someone gets a benefit from another person’s kindness, they should try to make sure the giver does not regret being kind.

No one gives a gift without wanting something good for themselves. Giving is a choice, and everyone wants good things for themselves. If people thought giving wouldn’t be appreciated, no one would start being kind or trusting others. Without kindness or trust, people wouldn’t help each other or make peace. Instead, they would stay in conflict, which goes against the basic natural law that tells people to seek peace. Not following this law is called ingratitude, which is like being unfair after a promise.

The fifth natural law is about being friendly and flexible. Everyone should try to get along with others. People are different, just like different stones used to build a wall. Some stones are rough and don’t fit well, making the wall weak. Similarly, a person who is stubborn and wants to keep things they don’t need but others do, and refuses to change, causes problems. Such a person might be left out of the group because they make things difficult.

Since everyone needs to try to get what they need to survive, anyone who fights others over extra things causes conflict and breaks the basic natural law of seeking peace. People who follow this law are called sociable, while those who don’t are seen as stubborn and hard to get along with.
