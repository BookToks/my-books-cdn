What I have written here about moral virtues and how important they are for creating and keeping peace is true, but it doesn’t become law just because it’s true. In every country, laws exist because the rulers say they do. Even if something seems reasonable by nature, it only becomes law when the government agrees. Otherwise, calling natural laws "unwritten laws" would be wrong, especially since many books about them often disagree with each other.

The way natural law is understood is through a judge who is chosen by the government to decide cases based on it. The judge’s job is to see if what someone wants makes sense and is fair. The judge’s decision is the official meaning of natural law, not because it’s just their opinion, but because they speak with the government’s power. This makes their decision the law for the people involved at that time.

But judges and rulers can make mistakes. If later on, the same kind of case comes up and the judge thinks a different, fairer decision should be made, they must do that. No one has to keep following a wrong decision just because it was made before.

Also, a wrong decision doesn’t become law for other judges, even if they promised to follow it. Sometimes, if a ruler accepts a wrong decision, it can become a new law for similar cases, but only if the law can change. Natural laws don’t change, so wrong decisions don’t become laws for future cases.

Rulers change, and judges come and go, and even the world might change, but natural law doesn’t change because it is the eternal law of God. So, past judges’ decisions cannot make a law that goes against what is fair by nature. No example from the past can justify an unfair decision or stop a judge from thinking carefully about what is fair using their own natural reason. For example, it is against natural law to punish someone who is innocent; a person is innocent if a judge says they are after a fair trial.
