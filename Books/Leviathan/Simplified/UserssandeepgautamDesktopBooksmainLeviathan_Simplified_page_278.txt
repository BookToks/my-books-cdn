Thomas Hobbes says that the place where people will live forever after coming back to life is called heaven. By heaven, he means the farthest parts from Earth, like where the stars are, or even beyond the stars in a higher heaven called coelum empyreum. But this higher heaven is not mentioned in the Bible, and there’s no good reason to believe in it. 

When the Bible talks about the Kingdom of Heaven, it means the kingdom of God who lives in heaven. His kingdom was the people of Israel, and He ruled them through prophets like Moses and Eleazar, and later the priests. But during Samuel’s time, the people rebelled and wanted a human king like other nations. 

Later, when Jesus’ preachers convince the Jews to come back and call the Gentiles (non-Jews) to follow God, there will be a new King of Heaven. This King will be God Himself, whose throne is in heaven. But the Bible doesn’t clearly say that people will go higher than the earth, which is called God’s footstool, to be happy forever. In fact, it says that no one has gone up to heaven except Jesus, who came down from heaven. 

By the way, these words were not said by Jesus himself but by St. John, because Jesus was still on earth when he wrote them. The same idea is shown with David. St. Peter said that some words in the Psalms were meant for Christ, not David, to prove Jesus’ ascension to heaven. He said David didn’t go up to heaven. 

Some might say that even if people’s bodies don’t go to heaven until the final judgment, their souls go to heaven right after they die. This seems true because Jesus said that God is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and that they are still alive to Him. But if this only means that souls live forever, it doesn’t prove Jesus’ point about the resurrection of the body, which means the whole person lives forever. 

So, Jesus meant that those old faithful leaders were made immortal not because of human nature, but because God, by His grace, gave them eternal life.
