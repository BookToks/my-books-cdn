Sometimes, for certain Christians, the word "Church" means the group of believers in someone's home, like when it says, “Greet the Church that meets in his house.” (Colossians 4:15) Sometimes, it means the perfect Church, chosen by God, like “A glorious Church, without spot or wrinkle, holy and without blemish” (Ephesians 5:27). This refers to the Church that will exist after the final victory of good.

Other times, "Church" means a group of people who say they believe in Christianity, whether they truly do or not. This is shown when it says, “Tell it to the Church, and if they refuse to listen, treat them like a stranger” (Matthew 18:17). 

Only in this last meaning can the Church be thought of as one person that can make decisions, give orders, and expect to be followed. Without permission from the gathered group, any action taken is just the action of the individuals involved, not the whole group. Also, people who are not there or who don’t agree with the action are not responsible for it.

In this sense, I define a Church as a group of people who say they follow Christianity, united under one leader. They should only meet when this leader says so, and they should not meet without the leader’s permission. Since in any country, meetings without government approval are illegal, a Church that meets without permission is also illegal.

It also means there is no one Church on earth that all Christians must obey because there is no ruler over all countries. Christians live under different governments, and each person follows the laws of their own country. So, a Church that can command, judge, forgive, or punish is basically the same as a government made up of Christian people. It is called a civil state because it rules people, and a Church because its people are Christians.

The ideas of separate “temporal” (earthly) and “spiritual” (religious) governments are just words made to confuse people and hide who really has power. It is true that after life, believers will have spiritual and eternal bodies, but right now, their bodies are physical and mortal.
