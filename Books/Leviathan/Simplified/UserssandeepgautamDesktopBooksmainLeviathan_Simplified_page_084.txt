When someone offers a prize and puts down the money, even if they don’t say who will get it, the right to the prize is decided by who wins the contest. But there’s a difference between two ways of earning something. In a contract, I earn something because I have the power and the other person needs what I offer. But when it’s a free gift, I only earn it because the giver is kind. In a contract, I earn the right because the other person agrees to give it up. But with a gift, I don’t earn the right to get it; I only earn the right that if the giver gives it away, it should be mine, not someone else’s.

This is what some schools call the difference between “meritum congrui” and “meritum condigni.” For example, God promises heaven to people who live by His rules. They say that if you live like that, you deserve heaven “ex congruo,” meaning it fits what you did. But since no one can demand heaven just by being good on their own, only by God’s free grace, no one earns heaven “ex condigno,” which means fully deserved.

I think this is what those terms mean. But because people argue about what these words really mean, I won’t say more about it. I’ll just say this: when a gift is offered without naming the winner, like a prize for a contest, the person who wins deserves it and can claim it.

If two people make a promise to each other but neither does their part right away, just trusting each other in a world where everyone is basically fighting, the promise is worthless if there’s any reason to doubt. But if there’s a common power that can force them to keep their promises, the promise is valid. Someone who acts first can’t be sure the other will follow because words alone can’t control people’s selfishness, anger, or greed without fear of punishment. In a world where everyone is equal and judges their own dangers, this can’t be trusted.

So, the person who acts first is just putting themselves in danger, going against their right to protect their life and way of living.

But in a society where there’s a power to force people to keep their promises, that fear isn’t fair. Because of the agreement, the person who is supposed to act first has to do so.
