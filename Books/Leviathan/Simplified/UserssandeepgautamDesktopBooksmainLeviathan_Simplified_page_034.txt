So, when something keeps affecting us through our eyes, ears, or other senses, the real effect on our heart is just movement or effort. This movement is like wanting or not wanting something. We feel this as either happiness or sadness in our mind.

This movement, called appetite, feels like it helps keep us alive and active. That’s why things that make us happy were called "jucunda," meaning they help or strengthen us. Things that bother us were called "molesta," meaning they stop or disturb this movement.

So, pleasure or happiness is the feeling of something good, and pain or displeasure is the feeling of something bad. Because of this, when we want or love something, we feel some happiness, and when we hate or avoid something, we feel some pain or discomfort.

Some pleasures come from using our senses, like seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or touching something nice. We can call these pleasures of the senses. Others come from expecting something good to happen in the future, and these pleasures come from our mind thinking about that. We usually call this kind of happiness joy. Pain works the same way: some pain comes from what we sense, and some comes from worrying about what might happen later, which we call grief.

These feelings like wanting, loving, hating, joy, and grief have different names depending on how we think about them. First, the names change based on whether we believe we can get what we want. Second, they change depending on what we love or hate. Third, they depend on many feelings happening together. Fourth, they change as the feelings come and go.

For example, wanting something and thinking you can get it is called hope.

Wanting something but thinking you can’t get it is called despair.

Not wanting something and thinking it will hurt you is called fear.
