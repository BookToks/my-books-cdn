Secondly, if there is a law that only applies to certain people or one specific person, and it isn’t written down or announced, it is still a law of nature. We know it by using the same reasons and clues that separate those people from others.

Any law that is not written or announced by the person who makes the law can only be understood by the reason of the person who has to follow it. So, it is a natural law, not just a civil one. For example, if the ruler hires a public official without giving written instructions, that official must use common sense to decide what to do. Like if the ruler makes someone a judge, the judge must understand that their decisions should be fair and based on the ruler’s sense of justice, which is natural law. Or if the ruler sends an ambassador, the ambassador should use reason to do what best helps the ruler’s interests when there are no written orders. This idea of using natural reason is called fidelity, which is part of natural justice.

Except for natural law, all other laws must be made known to everyone who has to follow them, either by speaking, writing, or some other clear action from the ruler. You can’t understand someone’s will without their words, actions, or guessing their purpose, which is always assumed to be fair and reasonable for the community.

A long time ago, before writing was common, laws were often made into poems or songs so that people could remember them better. Solomon even said to keep the Ten Commandments in mind by binding them on your fingers (Proverbs 7:3). When Moses gave the Law to the people of Israel, he told them to teach it to their children by talking about it at home, on the road, before sleeping, and after waking up. They were also told to write it on their doorposts (Deuteronomy 11:19) and gather everyone to hear it read (Deuteronomy 31:12). It’s not enough for a law to be written and announced; there must also be clear signs that it comes from the ruler’s will.
