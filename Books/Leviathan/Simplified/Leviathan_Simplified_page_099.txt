A person is like an actor, both on stage and in everyday life. To personate means to act or represent yourself or someone else. When someone acts for another, they are said to "bear their person" or "act in their name." Cicero used this idea when he said, "I bear three persons: myself, my opponent, and the judge." People who do this can be called different names like a representative, deputy, attorney, or actor.

Some people speak and act for others, and those others accept responsibility for what they say and do. In this case, the person acting is the actor, and the one who owns the words and actions is called the author. The actor works by the author’s authority, which means they have permission to act. Just like owning something is called possession, having the right to do something is called authority. So, acting with authority means doing something with permission from the person who has the right to do it.

Because of this, when an actor makes an agreement using their authority, it legally binds the author just as if the author made the agreement themselves. The author is responsible for everything that comes from that agreement.

So, what was said before about agreements between people is also true when made through actors or representatives, but only as far as their permission goes—no further.

If someone makes a deal with an actor but doesn’t know what permission the actor has, they take a risk. No one has to follow an agreement they didn’t agree to or that was made beyond the actor’s authority.

If the actor does something wrong because the author told them to, and the actor is supposed to obey, it’s the author who breaks the law, not the actor. Even if the action is wrong, it’s not the actor’s fault. But if the actor refuses to do it, then they break the rule that says you must keep your promises.

If someone makes an agreement with the author through an actor, but doesn’t know what authority the actor has and just trusts their word, they don’t have to follow the agreement unless the author confirms it when asked. Without this confirmation, the agreement isn’t valid.
