I have explained before, in Chapter 14, that agreements where someone promises not to protect their own body are not valid. So, if the ruler tells a person, even if they are rightly punished, to hurt or kill themselves, or not to fight back when attacked, or to avoid food, air, medicine, or anything they need to live, that person still has the right to say no.

If a person is questioned by the ruler or their officials about a crime they did, they don’t have to admit it unless they are promised forgiveness. This is because no one can be forced to accuse themselves.

Also, when someone agrees to obey the ruler, it means they accept all the ruler’s actions, but it doesn’t take away their natural freedom. For example, just because they allow the ruler to hurt them doesn’t mean they have to hurt themselves on command. Saying, “You can kill me or someone else” is very different from saying, “I will kill myself or someone else.” So, no one is forced by their promise to the ruler to kill themselves or others. If someone must do dangerous or dishonorable tasks for the ruler, it depends on the meaning behind their agreement and the purpose of the ruler’s power.

If refusing to obey stops the ruler from doing what they were made to do, then people have no right to refuse. But if it doesn’t stop that purpose, they do have the right.

For example, a soldier ordered to fight the enemy can sometimes refuse without being unfair, like if they find someone else to fight instead. In this case, they aren’t abandoning their duty to the country. It’s also okay to be naturally scared—not only women (who are not expected to do dangerous jobs) but also men who are less brave. When armies fight, some people run away out of fear, not betrayal, and while this is dishonorable, it’s not unfair. So, avoiding battle is cowardly, not unjust.

But if someone volunteers to be a soldier or is forced into service, they lose the excuse of being scared. They must go to battle and not run away without their captain’s permission. When the country’s defense needs everyone who can fight, everyone must join; otherwise, the whole idea of the country and its protection is useless.
