Second, not caring about having too much money or fancy jobs. Third, being able to make decisions without being influenced by fear, anger, hate, love, or sympathy. Fourth, and last, having patience to listen, paying close attention while listening, and remembering, understanding, and using what was heard.

The way laws are divided and explained has been done differently by many people, depending on how they think and write. It doesn’t depend on the laws themselves, but on the writer’s purpose and style.

In Justinian’s legal system, there are seven types of civil laws:  
1. The orders, rules, and letters from the emperor, because he had all the power. These are like the kings of England’s proclamations.  

2. The decisions made by the whole Roman people, including the Senate, when asked by the Senate. These were laws because the people had power. If the emperor didn’t cancel them, they stayed as laws. This is similar to the Acts of Parliament in England.  

3. The decisions made by the common people, without the Senate, when asked by the people’s representative. If the emperor didn’t cancel these, they stayed as laws. These are like the orders from the House of Commons in England.  

4. The orders from the Senate. When Rome became too big to gather all the people, the emperor decided the Senate would make decisions instead. These are a bit like the Acts of Council.  

5. The rules made by praetors, and sometimes aediles, who were like the top judges in English courts.  

6. The advice and opinions from lawyers chosen by the emperor to explain the law and help judges make decisions. Judges had to follow this advice. This is similar to how English judges use past case reports for guidance. English judges aren’t exactly like Roman judges but are legal experts who give advice to the actual judges, who are either lords or groups of twelve people from the area.
