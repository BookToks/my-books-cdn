Sometimes, our brain tricks us into seeing things that aren’t really there, like in a mirror, a dream, or when we’re sick. These things, which the Apostle calls idols, are actually nothing. They don’t exist where we think they do. Inside our brain, they are just confusion caused by either what we see or by our senses acting up.

People who don’t study these things don’t know what to call these illusions. Some believe they are real bodies made of air by a supernatural power because they look real. Others call them spirits because when you touch where they seem to be, there’s nothing there. So, people often use the word “spirit” in different ways. Sometimes it means a thin, invisible body, a ghost, or just something imagined. Other times, it means a mood or feeling, like being rebellious, dirty, stubborn, quiet, or even holy. It can also mean special talents, strong emotions, or mental problems, like calling great wisdom “the spirit of wisdom” or saying mad people are “possessed by a spirit.”

I don’t find any other meanings for “spirit.” When none of these meanings fit in the Bible, it means the idea is beyond what humans can understand. Our faith in those cases comes from accepting it, not trying to explain it. When God is called a Spirit or when the Spirit of God means God Himself, it means God is beyond our understanding. We don’t really know what God is, only that He exists. So, the names we use for God don’t explain what He is, but show our respect by using the most honorable words we can think of.

For example, in the Bible it says, “The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” If this means God Himself, then God is described as moving. But moving usually means changing place, and only things with size and shape can do that. Since God isn’t like a physical thing, this idea is hard for us to understand. Something that takes up space is a body, but God is not a body.
