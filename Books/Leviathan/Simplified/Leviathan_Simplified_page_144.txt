If one member owes money to the group, the group can try to get the money from them, but they can't take their stuff or put them in jail by themselves. Only the government has the power to do that. The group can decide the debt is owed, but that’s like judging their own case.

Groups made to run things or trade can last forever or for a set time written down. But some groups only exist for a short time because of what they do. For example, if a king or ruling group wants to hear from towns about how people are doing or to get advice on making laws, they can ask towns to send representatives. These reps meet at a certain time and place, and at that moment, they act like the whole country’s voice. But they only talk about what the king or rulers want, and when that’s done, the group ends. If these reps could speak for everyone all the time, there would be two rulers, which would cause problems. So, where there’s one ruler, the people’s reps can only speak for them in ways the ruler allows. The rules about what the reps can do are written down, and the people can’t send reps to do anything else.

Private groups that follow the law don’t need special papers to exist. They follow the same laws as everyone else. Because they have one leader, like a family with a dad or head, they are organized. The dad makes decisions for the family, and the children and workers have to listen as long as it’s allowed by law. But they don’t have to obey if the law says no.
