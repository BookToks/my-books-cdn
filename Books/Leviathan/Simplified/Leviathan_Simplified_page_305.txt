If a person is related to a leader, then having many leaders means there must be many people, even if they are all part of the same group.

XLII: About Church Power

To understand church power and who has it, we need to look at two time periods after Jesus went up to heaven. The first period is before kings and rulers became Christians. The second is after they became Christians.

It took a long time after Jesus went up before any king or ruler accepted Christianity and allowed it openly.

During the time in between, the church power belonged to the Apostles. After them, it was given to people they chose to teach the gospel, help others become Christians, and guide those Christians in living a good life.

These leaders were chosen by a special ceremony where hands were laid on them. This showed they received the Holy Spirit from God and were given the job to spread Jesus’ teachings. This ceremony was like what Moses did when he laid hands on Joshua to give him wisdom.

After Jesus came back to life but before he went to heaven, he gave the Holy Spirit to the Apostles by breathing on them and saying, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” Later, after Jesus went to heaven, the Holy Spirit came to them in a powerful way like a strong wind and fire.

Jesus did not use the laying on of hands to give the Holy Spirit, and God didn’t do this with Moses either. But the Apostles passed the Holy Spirit on to others by laying on hands, just like Moses did with Joshua. So, in those early times when there was no Christian government, the church power stayed with those who got it from the Apostles through laying on hands.

Here, we see God shown in a new way. In the Old Testament, Moses and the high priests represented God. Jesus, as a man on earth, also represented God. Now, the Holy Spirit, which means the Apostles and those who came after them who teach and preach, represent God today because they have the Holy Spirit.
