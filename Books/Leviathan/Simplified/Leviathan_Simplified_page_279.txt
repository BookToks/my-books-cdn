Even though the early leaders and many faithful people had died by that time, the text says they still “lived to God.” This means their names were written in the Book of Life, and they were forgiven for their sins and promised eternal life at the resurrection. The idea that a person’s soul is naturally eternal and alive without the body, or that any human is immortal except for Enos and Elias, is not clearly taught in the Bible.

In Job chapter 14, Job himself talks about how people are mortal. He complains about how humans die, but he doesn’t say anything against the idea that people will live forever after the resurrection. He says, “There is hope for a tree if it is cut down. Even if its roots get old and it dies in the ground, it will grow again when it gets water.” But he asks, “Man dies and wastes away. He breathes his last, but where does he go?” In verse 12, he says, “Man lies down and does not get up until the heavens are no more.”

So, when will the heavens be no more? St. Peter explains that it will happen at the general resurrection. In his second letter, chapter 3, verse 7, he says, “The current heavens and earth are being kept for fire on the day of judgment and punishment for the wicked.” Later, in verse 12, he says, “We are waiting for the day when God will come, and the heavens will burn and disappear, and everything will melt with heat.” But he also says that God has promised “new heavens and a new earth where goodness will live.”

So when Job says people won’t get up until the heavens are no more, it means that eternal life doesn’t start until the resurrection and judgment day. It doesn’t depend on who we are by nature, but on God’s promise. St. Peter doesn’t say “We hope for new heavens and earth” just because of anything natural, but because God promised it.

Finally, it has already been shown from many clear parts of the Bible that the kingdom of God is like a government where God rules as king, first by the Old Covenant and then by the New Covenant. God rules through his representative. These Bible parts also show that after Jesus comes back in glory to rule forever, God’s kingdom will be on earth. This idea might seem new or strange to many people, but I’m only sharing it. I’m not trying to argue about religion. I’m waiting to see who will decide, by the power of authority (which hasn’t been settled yet in my country), which beliefs are right or wrong. Everyone who wants protection under the law must obey the commands of those in charge, no matter what they personally believe.
