When people live under the control of their family, they have to obey their fathers and masters, just like they obey the rulers of the country. Before governments existed, fathers and masters had total control over their families, and even after governments were made, they only lose as much power as the laws take away.

Some groups are private but illegal. These groups come together without any permission from the government. Examples are groups of beggars, thieves, or gypsies who organize themselves to make begging and stealing easier. Also, groups that get orders from foreign rulers to spread their ideas or cause trouble against their own country are illegal.

Some groups are informal, made up of people who just agree because they want to, not because they have to. Whether these groups are legal or illegal depends on what each person in the group wants to do. You can figure this out by looking at the situation.

Groups of people, called leagues, usually form to protect each other. But in a country where everyone is already united under one government, these leagues are mostly not needed and can seem suspicious or illegal. They are often called factions or conspiracies. Leagues are agreements between people, but without someone powerful to make sure they keep their promises, they only work if everyone trusts each other. Leagues between different countries can be legal and useful as long as they last. But leagues between people in the same country are not needed because the government can protect their rights. If these leagues have bad or secret plans, they are illegal because private groups joining forces for bad reasons is unfair and risky.

If the government is run by a large group, and some people within that group secretly plan to control the others without permission, that is called a faction or conspiracy. This is illegal because it tricks the group for selfish reasons.
