Finally, many mistakes come from false or unsure history. For example, all the stories about fake miracles in the lives of saints, and all the tales of ghosts and visions told by the leaders of the Roman Church. They use these stories to support their ideas about hell, purgatory, exorcisms, and other beliefs that don’t have proof in reason or the Bible. They also have traditions called the unwritten word of God, which are really just old wives’ tales.

Some of these stories show up in the writings of early church leaders, but those leaders were people who could easily believe wrong things. Using their opinions to prove these stories true doesn’t work, especially since St. John advised us to test all spirits. These early leaders didn’t always doubt false reports because they didn’t know much about the natural world. Good people often trust others too easily, so they are more likely to believe lies.

For example, Pope Gregory and St. Bernard told stories about ghosts from purgatory, as did Bede, but they only heard these stories from others. If they claimed to have seen such things themselves, it wouldn’t make the stories more real, it would just show their weakness or dishonesty.

Along with false stories, true philosophy has been stopped by men who aren’t qualified to judge what’s true. Our own sea voyages and many smart people now know there are people living on the opposite side of the earth, and we can see that years and days depend on how the earth moves. Still, some people were punished by church authorities just for writing about these ideas, even if they were only sharing reasons for and against them.

Why does this happen? Is it because these ideas go against real religion? That can’t be true if the ideas are correct.

So, let the truth be checked by qualified people, or disproved by those who say they know better. If these ideas go against the religion that’s set up, then the civil authorities should handle it. People who teach even true ideas can be punished by law if they break the rules.
