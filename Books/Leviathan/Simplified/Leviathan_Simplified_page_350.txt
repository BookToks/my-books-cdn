This reason doesn’t work unless someone can show when and where Christ ever told people to obey a Pope or even mentioned a Pope. Even if everything given to St. Peter was also given to the Pope, the Bible never tells anyone to obey the Pope if his commands go against those of their rightful ruler.

Also, the Church and the Pope have never said that the Pope is the civil leader of all Christians in the world. So, Christians don’t have to accept his control over how they live their lives. Civil leadership and the final say in deciding right and wrong behavior are the same thing. The people who make civil laws decide what is right or wrong, because doing what the ruler’s law says is what makes someone good or bad. So, when the Pope says he has the highest power over how people should behave, he is telling people to disobey their own rulers, which is wrong and goes against what Jesus and his followers taught in the Bible.

To try to prove the Pope can make laws, he points to some Bible verses. First, Deuteronomy 17:12 says, “The man that will do presumptuously, and will not listen to the priest or the judge, shall die, and you shall remove evil from Israel.” But here, the high priest was really the civil ruler, and judges were chosen by him. So this verse really means, “Anyone who disobeys the ruler or his officers shall die,” which supports civil rulers having power, not the Pope having universal control.

Second, he uses Matthew 16, where Jesus says, “Whatever you bind…” and says this means the Pope can make laws like the Pharisees and teachers of the law did. But this only supports civil rulers making laws, because the Pharisees sat in Moses’ place, and Moses was the ruler under God. Jesus told people to obey their laws but not to copy their bad behavior.
