King Solomon took away Abiathar’s job as high priest (I Kings, 2. 26, 27) and put Zadok in his place (Ibid., 2. 35). So, kings can also choose and remove bishops whenever they think it’s best for managing their people.

His sixth point is this: if bishops get their power directly from God, those who believe this should show some proof from God’s word. But they can’t. This is a strong point, and I have nothing to argue against it. However, it also means the Pope doesn’t have authority over other rulers.

Finally, he uses the words of two Popes, Innocent and Leo, as proof. I believe he could have used almost every Pope’s words since St. Peter because popes usually want to keep their power. But even then, they are only saying what they believe themselves, so their proof isn’t very strong.

In the fifth book, he has four main ideas. First, the Pope is not the ruler of the whole world. Second, he’s not the ruler of all Christians. Third, without his own land, the Pope doesn’t have any real political power. These three points are easy to agree with. The fourth idea is that the Pope has some political power in other rulers’ lands, but only indirectly. This is denied unless “indirectly” means he got it through other ways, which is true. But he means that this power belongs to him by right because of his spiritual role, and that he can’t do his spiritual job without this power. He also thinks he can change kingdoms, giving them to some people and taking them from others if it helps save souls.

Before I look at his reasons for this belief, it’s good to think about what it means for rulers and countries. They should think carefully if it’s a good idea to accept this, since they are responsible for their people and will have to answer for them on judgment day.
