In any situation, the answer depends on what’s going on; how important it is for war overall still needs to be figured out. Now, we’ll look at this question and see how important destroying the enemy really is.

Fighting is the only real way to win a war. The goal is to destroy the enemy’s forces to reach a bigger goal. This is true even if no actual battle happens because the result depends on the idea that if fighting did happen, the enemy would be defeated. So, destroying the enemy’s forces is the base for all military actions. Every plan depends on it, like an arch needs a strong support. That means all actions are done with the hope that if a real fight happens, the outcome will be good. Winning by fighting is as important in war as paying money is in business. No matter how complicated things are or how rarely fights happen, they can never be left out completely.

Since winning a battle is the foundation of all plans, the enemy can ruin everything by winning a battle. This doesn’t only happen if the fight affects a key part of our plans, but also if any victory is big enough. Every important win—meaning destroying enemy forces—changes all other chances. Like water, things settle at a new level after a big win.

So, it’s clear that destroying the enemy’s forces is always the best and strongest way, better than any other method.

But of course, saying destroying the enemy is better only works if everything else is the same. It would be wrong to think rushing in always beats careful planning. Being too aggressive would ruin the attack itself—not the defense—and that’s not what we mean. Being more effective is about the result, not the way you get there; we are just comparing the effects of different endings.

When we talk about destroying the enemy’s forces, we don’t only mean physical damage: the moral side matters too. These two always work together and can’t be separated.

We said a big victory that destroys the enemy affects everything else. At times like this, the moral effects are the strongest and can change things a lot.

The power of destroying the enemy is balanced by its high cost and danger. Other strategies are used mainly to avoid these risks.

It makes sense that destroying the enemy is expensive; the more we want to destroy them, the more effort we have to put in.

The danger is that the more we try to succeed, the worse it will be if we fail.

Other ways are cheaper if they work and cause less damage if they fail—but this only works if both sides act the same way and the enemy tries the same things we do.
