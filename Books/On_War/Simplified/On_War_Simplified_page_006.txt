First, I want to look at the different parts of the topic, then its sections, and finally how it all fits together. Basically, I’ll start with the easy stuff and move to the harder stuff. But when it comes to war, more than anything else, we have to think about the whole picture first because the parts and the whole are connected.

I won’t start with a boring, textbook definition of war. Instead, I’ll get straight to the main idea: a duel. War is just a bunch of duels on a bigger scale. Imagine two wrestlers fighting; each one tries to use their strength to make the other give up. The goal is to throw the other down so they can’t fight back anymore.

So, war is using force to make the enemy do what you want.

Force fights against other force and uses tools and technology to help. There are some rules called international law and customs, but they don’t really stop force much. Force means physical power because moral power only exists through the state and laws. The goal of war is to make the enemy powerless. That’s the real aim of war, not just fighting for some other reason.

Some kind people might hope there’s a clever way to end a war without much bloodshed and think that’s the true goal of war. It sounds nice, but it’s wrong. War is dangerous, and being too kind can cause big mistakes. Using the most force possible is not against being smart. If one side fights hard without caring about the cost, while the other holds back, the first side will win.
