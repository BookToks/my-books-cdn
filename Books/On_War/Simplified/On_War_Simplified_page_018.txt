War is a way for governments to use force to reach their goals. If war was just pure violence without any control, it would take over and ignore the plans made by leaders. It would act like a bomb set to explode in only one way. Some people think this, especially when they see conflicts between what leaders want and what happens in war. But this idea is wrong.

In real life, war isn't just one big explosion of violence. It's more like waves that get stronger or weaker over time. Sometimes the force of war is strong enough to make a big change, and sometimes it’s too weak to do much. War moves in bursts, speeding up or slowing down, but it always lasts long enough so smart leaders can change how it goes. Since war starts because of political goals, those goals stay the most important part of how war is fought.

That doesn’t mean the political goal controls everything without change. It has to adjust to the way war is fought, and this can change the goal a lot. But the goal is still the main thing. Politics affects every part of the military actions, and as much as possible, it guides how violence is used.

So, war is not just something political leaders decide to do. It’s actually a tool of politics—a way to continue political talks by using force instead of words.

What makes war different is how it uses violence. War is about causing harm and destruction in a way that politics can’t, and this makes it unique. This is a big challenge, but no matter how war changes political goals, it can only change them a little. The political goal is the main target, and war is just the way to reach it. You can’t separate the method from the goal.

The closer war gets to being just pure violence and destruction, the more it seems like a military action alone and less like a political one. When war focuses mostly on destroying the enemy, military goals and political goals become the same, and war looks less like politics and more like fighting.
