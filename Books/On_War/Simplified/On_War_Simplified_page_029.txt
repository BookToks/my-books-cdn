If he wants to decide things by having a big battle, his choice would force us to do the same even if we don’t want to. The result of the battle would be very important. But it’s clear that, all other things being equal, we would be at a disadvantage because our plans and resources were partly meant for other goals, while the enemy’s plans were not.

Two goals that don’t include each other can’t happen at the same time: one army can’t do both things at once. So, if one leader decides to win by having a big battle, they have a good chance of winning if they know their opponent is trying a different plan. On the other hand, a leader who wants to use a different approach can only do that if they believe the enemy also wants to avoid big battles.

What was said about plans and forces being used for other things only applies to positive goals in war besides just destroying the enemy’s army. It doesn’t apply to pure resistance, which is just about wearing down the enemy’s strength. Pure resistance has no positive goal; it only tries to stop the enemy’s plans and doesn’t try to do anything else.

Now we have to think about the opposite side of destroying the enemy’s forces—that is, keeping our own safe. These two things always go together and affect each other. They are both part of the same goal, and we only need to think about what happens if one is more important than the other. Trying to destroy the enemy’s forces has a positive goal and leads to good results, with the final goal being the enemy’s defeat. Keeping our own forces safe has a negative goal; it blocks the enemy’s plans and is pure resistance, which only aims to make the war last until the enemy runs out of strength.

A plan with a positive goal creates the chance to destroy the enemy; a plan with a negative goal waits for that chance.

How long you should wait like this is a question we will look at when we study attack and defense, which is closely related. For now, we just need to say that waiting doesn’t mean doing nothing. Any action involved in waiting could just as well try to destroy the enemy as achieve some other goal. It would be a big mistake to think that a plan with a negative goal means you want a decision without bloodshed instead of destroying the enemy. A mostly negative effort might lead to that, but it’s always risky because it depends on things decided by the enemy, not us. So avoiding bloodshed shouldn’t be a main goal if our priority is to keep our forces safe. In fact, if that plan doesn’t fit the situation, it could lead to losing our forces.

A negative plan might slow down the decision, meaning action turns into waiting for the right moment to act.
