Being daring, bold, rash, or just trusting luck are all different kinds of courage. These traits need the right situation—like chance—to really work.

In short, exact, guaranteed facts don’t really fit into military plans. From the start, war involves a mix of possibilities, chances, good luck, and bad luck that affects everything. War is a lot like playing cards.

Even though our brain wants clear answers, people often like uncertainty. We enjoy imagining chances and luck more than following strict logic that ends up confusing us. Without strict rules, we can imagine many possibilities. This helps courage grow, pushing us to take risks like a swimmer diving into a strong current.

If theory stopped here and only gave perfect answers, it wouldn’t help in real life.

No, theory must think about people and allow room for courage, boldness, and even foolishness. War is about living people and their feelings. So, it can’t be 100% certain. It must always leave space for uncertainty, big or small. When things are uncertain, courage and confidence balance it out. The more courage and confidence, the more chance there can be for accidents. That’s why courage and confidence are super important in war. Theory should only give rules that allow these traits in all their forms. Even daring can be planned and careful, but it’s judged differently.

That’s war, that’s the leader who controls it, and that’s the theory behind it. War isn’t a game or just fun risk-taking. It’s serious, with serious goals. All the excitement, courage, imagination, and energy are just parts of war’s nature.

When whole countries go to war—especially advanced ones—it’s always because of politics. The reason and the goal are always political.
