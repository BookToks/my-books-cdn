This question gets right to the main point.

Every action takes some time to finish. This time is called its duration, and how long it takes depends on how fast the person doing it works. We don’t need to worry about the difference here.

Everyone does a task in their own way. A slow person isn’t slow because they want to take more time, but because that’s just how they work. If they rushed, they would do a worse job. So, how fast someone works depends on personal reasons and affects how long the task actually takes.

Now, if every action in war is given the right amount of time, at first, it seems strange to stop or delay fighting. Here, we’re not talking about one side winning or losing, but about how the whole war situation moves forward.

If two sides are ready for war, it means they are still angry at each other. As long as they keep their armies ready and don’t try to make peace, that anger is still there.

Only one thing can stop this anger: wanting to wait for a better time to act. At first, it seems like only one side would want to wait because if one side wants to act, the other side would want to wait.

But a perfect balance of power can’t cause a complete stop. If the sides are equal, the one with a clear goal—the attacker—would have the advantage.

Still, it’s possible to imagine a balance where the side with the stronger goal has weaker forces. The balance would come from both their goals and their strength. If that’s true, then unless something changes soon, the two sides might agree to stop fighting.

If neither side acts, it can’t just be because they are equal in power. The only reason is that both are waiting for a better time to act. Let’s say one side wants to take some land to use as a bargaining tool for peace. Once they get it, their political goal is done, and they can stop fighting.

If the other side agrees, they should ask for peace. If not, they need to do something. And if they think they will be stronger in four weeks, that is a good reason not to act right now.
