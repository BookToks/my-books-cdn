If you think about war in a perfect, ideal way, you might try to figure out exactly what the goal should be and how to reach it. But if you do that, you end up with extreme ideas that don’t really make sense because they come from tiny, tricky details in logic. If we only thought in strict, absolute terms, we might say that the goal is always to go all out and put in the biggest effort possible. But this kind of thinking is just an idea and doesn’t change what really happens in the world.

Even if you could measure this extreme effort exactly, people probably wouldn’t agree to follow such a strict and unrealistic rule. It would often waste energy, which goes against smart government plans.

You’d need a crazy amount of willpower compared to the actual goal, but that won’t really happen because tricky logic doesn’t inspire people to act.

But when you stop thinking in ideas and look at real life, things are very different. In theory, we might think both sides in a war want to be perfect and actually are perfect in their efforts. Would that really happen? Only if: (a) war came out of nowhere with no political background; (b) war was just one big, sudden event or several events all at once; (c) the war’s result was complete and perfect by itself, without being affected by what happened before or after.

About the first point, remember that war doesn’t just pop up suddenly or spread instantly. Each side can guess a lot about the other based on who they are and what they do, not just on what they should be or do in theory. People and their actions are never perfect and never reach the absolute best. These flaws are true for both sides and actually help keep things more balanced.
