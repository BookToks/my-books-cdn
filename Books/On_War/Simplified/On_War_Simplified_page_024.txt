The second question is how to make the enemy spend more effort; in other words, how to make the war harder and more expensive for them.

The enemy spends effort by losing their soldiers—because we destroy them—and by losing land—because we take it from them.

If we look closer, it’s clear that both losing soldiers and land matter differently depending on what the goal is. Usually, the differences aren’t big, but we shouldn’t ignore them because small details can change how force is used. Right now, the main point is to show that there are different ways to reach a goal, and these ways are not wrong or silly.

There are also three ways to make the enemy spend more effort. The first is invasion, which means taking their land not to keep it, but to make them pay money or just to damage it. The goal here is not to win the country or destroy their army, but to cause damage.

The second way is to focus on actions that make the enemy suffer more. Imagine two choices: one is better if your goal is to defeat the enemy, and the other is better if you cannot defeat them. The first is often called the more military option, and the second the more political one. But really, both are military strategies, and neither is right unless it fits the situation.

The third, and most common, way is to wear down the enemy. This means using the length of the war to slowly drain their strength and will to fight.

If we want to last longer than the enemy, we should aim for small goals because big goals need more effort. The smallest goal is just defending ourselves—fighting without trying to win anything extra. With this plan, our strength lasts longer than the enemy’s, which is the best result.

But does that mean we should just do nothing and wait? No. Just waiting without fighting isn’t really fighting. Resistance means acting to stop the enemy by wearing down their power enough to make them give up. Every part of our resistance is meant to do just that, which is why our plan seems negative—it’s about stopping instead of attacking.

Sure, one big attack might seem better for a positive goal, but for a negative goal, small actions that last longer are more likely to work and keep us safer. What they might lack in quick results, they make up for by using time and making the war last longer.
