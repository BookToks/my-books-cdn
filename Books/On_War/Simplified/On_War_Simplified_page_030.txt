This usually means that action is delayed in time and place as long as the situation allows. If waiting too long causes big problems, then the advantage of waiting is gone. The goal of destroying the enemy—which was put off before but not forgotten—comes back again.

We have shown that in war, there are many ways to reach the goal, which is the political aim, but fighting is the only real way. Everything depends on one main rule: deciding things by using force. If the enemy wants to fight, you can never stop them. A leader who wants to use another plan must be sure the enemy won’t fight or will lose if they do. To sum up: out of all goals in war, destroying the enemy’s army is always the most important.

Later on, we will learn what other strategies can do in war. For now, we just need to accept that other options might exist, and sometimes war can change because of special situations. But even then, we must remember that solving the conflict by fighting and wanting to destroy the enemy’s forces is the main idea of war. If the political goals are small and tensions are low, a smart general might try to avoid big fights, use weaknesses in the enemy’s plans, and maybe find peace. If this plan looks like it will work, we can’t criticize him. But he must never forget he’s taking risky paths where war can surprise him.

He must always watch his enemy carefully so that if the enemy is ready to fight hard, he doesn’t go in with only weak weapons.

These ideas about what war really is, why it happens, and how it works—even when war changes a bit in practice—must be remembered in later discussions. This will help us understand things better and avoid mistakes or ideas that don’t match reality.
