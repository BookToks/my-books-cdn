We will study this in detail later in the chapter about war plans.

For now, it’s enough to understand the main idea of how we should look at war and the theory behind it.

War is like a chameleon that changes a little depending on the situation. But as a whole, war is made up of three main parts that seem opposite but work together: strong violence and hate, which come from natural feelings; the role of chance and creativity, where leaders and soldiers make decisions; and the fact that war is controlled by governments to reach political goals.

The first part mostly involves the people; the second part involves the commander and the army; and the third part is about the government. The feelings of the people start the war; the commander and army deal with risk and skill; and the government decides the goals.

These three parts are like different sets of rules that are connected but can change how they work with each other. If a theory ignores any of them or tries to fix their relationship in a wrong way, it won’t match reality and won’t be useful.

So, our job is to create a theory that balances these three parts, like something hanging between three magnets.

How to do this will be looked at in the book about war theory (Book Two). For now, the basic idea of war we have explained gives us a first look at its structure and helps us identify its main parts.

The last chapter showed that war is complicated and always changing.
