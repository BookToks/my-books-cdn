There is only one thing in war: fighting. No matter how many ways fighting happens, or how far it is from a simple physical fight, or how many other things get involved, the idea of fighting is always at the center of war.

It’s easy to see that this is always true, no matter what.

Everything that happens in war comes from having armed forces. But whenever armed people are used, the idea of fighting must be there.

War includes everything about the fighting forces – how they are created, kept ready, and used.

Creating and keeping forces ready are just steps; using them is the real goal.

Fighting in war is not just about two people. It’s a big thing made up of many parts. These parts come from the soldiers in an army, who form smaller groups inside the bigger group. Each part fights in its own way. Fighting itself is part of war because of what it aims to do.

Each small part of fighting is called an engagement.

Since fighting is the reason armed forces exist, using these forces means planning and organizing many engagements.

All military work is connected to these engagements. Soldiers are recruited, trained, and equipped so they can fight at the right time and place.

If everything in the military leads to engagements, then controlling the engagement means controlling all of it. The results happen because of our orders and how well they are followed, not directly by anything else.

Because fighting is the main idea, destroying the enemy’s forces is always the way to reach the goal of an engagement.

The goal might be to destroy the enemy’s forces, but it doesn’t have to be. There can be other goals in war, depending on the political reasons for fighting. These other goals can also be the purpose of certain military actions and engagements.

Even when small engagements focus on destroying the enemy’s forces, that destruction might not be their immediate main goal.
