An army is a big, complicated group with many parts, and many reasons decide how it is used. Because of this, how an army fights is also very organized and divided into different jobs. Sometimes, parts of the army are given tasks that don’t directly mean destroying the enemy. For example, if a group is told to take control of a hill or a bridge, the main goal is to hold that place. Destroying the enemy is just a step to help achieve this. Sometimes, just showing force is enough to make the enemy leave. Usually, though, the hill or bridge is taken so the army can do even more damage to the enemy.

When two countries or big groups are fighting, it gets even more complicated. There are many different situations and choices, and the goals at different levels of command can be very different. This means the first actions taken might be far from the final goal.

Because of this, fighting doesn’t always mean destroying the enemy’s forces right away. Destroying them might just be a way to reach another goal. Sometimes, a battle is just a test of strength and doesn’t have much value on its own. What matters is the result of that test.

If one side is much stronger, sometimes just knowing this is enough. The weaker side might give up without any fighting.

This is why entire war campaigns can be very active even if there isn’t much actual fighting. Many examples from history show this is true. We only want to say it’s possible, not how often it happens. But if fighting was the only goal, many campaigns would not succeed.

In war, there is only one way to fight: combat. But combat can happen in many different ways because there are many different goals. This can make it seem like we haven’t learned much, but really, the fact that combat is the only way is what holds all military actions together.

We have shown that destroying the enemy’s forces is just one of many goals in war. We have not talked about how important it is compared to other goals.
