From that moment on, it would make sense for the other side to take action quickly. The goal would be to stop the enemy from having enough time to get ready. I’m assuming both sides fully understand what’s going on.

If this nonstop action really happened in a war, it would push everything to the extreme. Constant fighting would make people more emotional and stronger. Events would happen one after another more quickly and be more connected. Every single move would matter a lot and be more risky.

But war doesn’t usually work like that. In many wars, only a small part of the time is spent fighting, while most of it is quiet. This isn’t just a weird thing. Taking breaks in war must be possible; it’s not impossible. I will explain why.

We’ve been thinking that the two commanders have completely opposite goals. This idea of true opposition, or polarity, will be explained more later. But here’s the basic idea.

Polarity only works when two sides want the exact opposite thing that cancels each other out. For example, in a battle, both sides want to win. One side’s win means the other side loses. That’s true polarity. But if we’re talking about two different goals that are linked in some way, the opposition is about how they relate, not the goals themselves.

If war was only about attacking the enemy and there was no defense, or if attack and defense were basically the same except that attack aims to gain something positive and defense doesn’t, then every advantage one side gets would be an equal loss for the other. That would be real polarity.

But there are actually two different kinds of actions in war: attack and defense.
