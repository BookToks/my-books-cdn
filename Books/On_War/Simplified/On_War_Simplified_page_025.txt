Thus the negative aim, which lies at the heart of pure resistance, is also the natural formula for outlasting the enemy, for wearing him down.
 
 Here lies the origin of the distinction that dominates the whole of war: the difference between attack and defense. We shall not pursue the matter now, but let us just say this: that from the negative purpose derive all the advantages, all the more effective forms, of fighting, and that in it is expressed the dynamic relationship between the magnitude and the likelihood of success. All this will be gone into later.
 
 If a negative aim-that is, the use of every means available for pure resistance-gives an advantage in war, the advantage need only be enough to balance any superiority the opponent may possess: in the end his political object will not seem worth the effort it costs. He must then renounce his policy. It is evident that this method, wearing down the enemy, applies to the great number of cases where the weak endeavor to resist the strong.
 
 Frederick the Great would never have been able to defeat Austria in the Seven Years War: and had he tried to fight in the manner of Charles XI1 he would unfailingly have been destroyed himself. But for seven years he skillfully husbanded his strength and finally convinced the allies that far greater efforts were needed than they had foreseen. Consequently they made peace.
 
 We can now see that in war many roads lead to success, and that they do not all involve the opponent's outright defeat. They range from the destruction of the enemy's forces, the conquest of his territory, to a temporary occupation or invasion, to projects with an immediate political purpose, and finally to passively awaiting the enemy's attacks. Any one of these may be used to overcome the enemy's will: the choice depends on circumstances.
 
 One further kind of action, of shortcuts to the goal, needs mention: one could call them arguments ad hominem. Is there a field of human affairs where personal relations do not count, where the sparks they strike do not leap across all practical considerations? The personalities of statesmen and soldiers are such important factors that in war above all it is vital not to .d underrate them. It is enough to mention this point: it would be pedantic to e vre attempt a systematic classification. It can be said, however, that these quesse r sth g o ti f o n a s c h o i f e v p i e n r g s o t n h a e l it g y o a a l n o d f p p e o rs li o c n y a l t o r e i l n at f i i o n n it s y .
 
 r aise the number of possible ways ir llA To think of these shortcuts as rare exceptions, or to minimize the differ.}re ence they can make to the conduct of war, would be to underrate them.

 C CHAPTER TWO So much then for the ends to be pursued in war; let us now turn to the means.
