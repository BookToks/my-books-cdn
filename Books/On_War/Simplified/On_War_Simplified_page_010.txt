CHAPTER ONE

If war was just one big event or a bunch of decisions made all at once, then countries would have to prepare completely and perfectly, because they couldn’t fix any mistakes later. The only way to know how to prepare would be to copy what the enemy is doing, as much as possible. Everything else would just be guesses.

But in real life, war happens in steps, one after another. Each step affects the next one. So, instead of guessing, countries can learn and adjust as the war goes on. This means they don’t have to use everything all at once.

If it were possible to use all weapons and forces at the same time, then wars would be over in one big fight. Because if you use everything right away, there’s nothing left for later. Any fighting after that would just be part of the first fight, not a new one.

However, when a country starts getting ready for war, real-life problems happen instead of just ideas. Countries don’t usually use all their power at once. This is partly because not all their forces can be moved or used at the same time.

The important resources in war are the fighting forces, the country itself (like its land and people), and its allies.

The country isn’t just where the soldiers come from. The land and people are also important parts of the war, especially the areas where fighting actually happens or which affect the battle.

You might think it’s possible to use all the fighting forces at once. But things like forts, rivers, mountains, and the people living there make this impossible. These natural and man-made features slow things down and make it harder to use all forces together.

Also, allies don’t always help immediately just because one side wants them to. Because of how countries get along, help often comes later or only when the situation changes a lot.

In many cases, a lot of the country’s power can’t be used right away. Even if a lot is spent in the first battle and one side seems to lose badly, they can still recover and get back in the fight.

This idea will be explained more later. For now, it’s enough to know that war makes it impossible to use all forces at once.

But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try your best from the start. Losing is always bad, and no one wants to risk it on purpose.
