Each side will push the other to do the same; both will push their enemy to extreme actions, and the only things stopping them are the natural limits of war.

This is how we should understand the situation. It’s useless—and wrong—to pretend war isn’t really brutal just because it’s upsetting.

If wars between civilized countries are less cruel and destructive than wars between uncivilized groups, it’s because of the social conditions and relationships between those countries. These are the forces that cause war and also keep it under control. But these forces exist before the fighting starts and are not part of war itself. Trying to add the idea of “being moderate” into the theory of war doesn’t make sense.

People fight for two reasons: hatred and bad intentions. Our definition focuses on bad intentions because that’s always involved. Even the strongest hatred can’t exist without bad intentions, but bad intentions don’t always come with strong hatred. Uncivilized people are ruled by emotions, while civilized people use their minds more. The difference isn’t in what they are but in their situations and systems. So this difference doesn’t always happen, but it does most of the time. Even the most civilized people can hate each other deeply.

Because of this, it’s wrong to think that war between civilized countries happens only because their governments make a logical choice, and that war will slowly lose all passion so that fighting won’t even be needed—just comparing their strengths would be enough.

That would be like doing war with math.

Some experts started to think this way, but recent wars have shown them they were wrong. War is about force, and feelings will always be involved. Feelings might not start the war, but they still affect it. How much they affect it depends on the situation.

The reason civilized countries fight the way they do is because intelligence plays a bigger role in their strategies, teaching them better ways to use force instead of just acting on instinct.

The invention of gunpowder and better guns proves that civilization hasn’t changed the basic urge to destroy the enemy, which is at the core of war.
