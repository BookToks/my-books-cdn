The smaller the penalty you ask from your opponent, the less they will try to stop you; the less they try, the less you need to try. Also, the smaller your own political goal, the less important it feels to you, so you won’t fight hard to keep it if you have to give it up. This is another reason why your effort will change.

The political goal—the reason the war started—will decide both the military goal and how much effort is needed.

But the political goal alone can’t measure what will happen. Since we are dealing with real situations, it only matters when we think about the two countries at war. The same political goal can cause different reactions from different people, or even from the same people at different times. So, we can only use the political goal as a guide if we look at how it affects the forces that are involved. That means we have to study those forces.

Depending on what those forces are like, the results will be different. Sometimes, the tensions between two peoples and countries are so strong that even a small fight can cause a big explosion.

This is true for the effort a political goal can create in both countries, and for the military goals their policies need.

Sometimes the political and military goals are the same—for example, taking over a province. Other times, the political goal doesn’t fit a military goal. In that case, a different military goal must be chosen that helps the political goal and shows it during peace talks. But it’s important to think about each country’s situation. Sometimes, to reach the political goal, the new military goal must be more important. The less involved the people are and the less tension there is inside and between countries, the more the political goals will control what happens. So, there are times when the political goal is almost the only thing that matters.

Usually, a military goal that matches the political goal will get smaller if the political goal gets smaller; this happens even more when the political goal becomes more important. This shows how political goals and military goals depend on each other, based on real experience. This leads to a new question that needs to be looked at and answered.

No matter how small the political demands are on either side, no matter how little force is used, no matter how limited the military goal, can the war process ever stop, even for a moment?
