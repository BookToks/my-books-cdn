Even if the first fight isn’t the only one, it still affects what happens next in a way that matches how big that first fight was. But people don’t usually try their hardest right away. They often want to wait and decide later. So, during the first fight, no one puts in all their effort or focus.

If one side holds back because they feel weak, the other side also lowers their effort. This back-and-forth makes both sides less extreme in how much they try.

Also, the final result of a war isn’t always the last word. The losing side often thinks the bad outcome is only temporary and hopes things will change later in politics. This idea can make both sides less tense and less determined to fight hard.

Because of this, war doesn’t always follow the rule that both sides must use extreme force. When no one really fears or aims for the worst, they have to decide how much effort to put in based on what’s actually happening and what’s likely to happen.

When the fighters are real countries and governments, and war isn’t just theory but a series of real actions, the facts on the ground help predict what might happen next.

Each side looks at the enemy’s personality, government, situation, and overall condition. Using these clues and what’s likely, they guess what the other side will do and plan their own moves.

Now, the goal of the war becomes important again. Before, it was mostly about beating the enemy completely. But as the extreme fighting loses power and the strong will to destroy the enemy fades, the original political goal comes back into focus. Since war is really about guessing chances based on people and situations, the political goal—the main reason for the war—must be a key part of deciding what to do.
