People usually guess that the enemy is stronger than they really are because that’s just how humans think. Knowing this, we have to admit that not fully understanding what’s going on often slows down fighting and changes how wars are fought.

Sometimes, doing nothing for a while also slows down the war. This waiting time can help avoid danger and gives both sides a chance to get ready again. When the reasons for fighting are very strong, these breaks don’t last long. But if the reasons are weak, the breaks last longer. Strong reasons make people more determined, and determination helps make a side stronger.

When fighting moves slowly and stops often, it’s easier to fix mistakes. This makes generals more confident and careful when making plans, using what’s likely to happen instead of extreme guesses. Each situation needs careful thinking based on what’s happening, and how much time they have depends on how fast the fighting is.

War is mostly about guessing what will happen next. But war also includes a big part of chance—luck and random events affect it a lot. No other human activity depends on luck as much and as often as war does.

If we think about how war is actually fought, it looks even more like a gamble. War is all about danger. The most important quality in war is courage—the bravery to face danger even when it’s scary.

Because war is so risky and uncertain, psychological factors, like how people think and feel, become very important in deciding what happens next.
