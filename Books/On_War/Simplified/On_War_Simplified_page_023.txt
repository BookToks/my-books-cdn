Since war is not an act of senseless passion but is controlled by its political object, the value of this object must determine the sacrifices to be made for it in magnitude and also in duration. Once the expenditure of effort exceeds the value of the political object, the object must be renounced and peace must follow.
 
 We see then that if one side cannot completely disarm the other, the desire for peace on either side will rise and fall with the probability of further successes and the amount of effort these would require. If such incentives were of equal strength on both sides, the two would resolve their political disputes by meeting half way. If the incentive grows on one side, it should diminish on the other. Peace will result so long as their sum total is sufficient-though the side that feels the lesser urge for peace will naturally get the better bargain.
 
 One point is purposely ignored for the moment-the difference that the positive or negative character of the political ends is bound to produce in practice. As we shall see, the difference is important, but at this stage we must take a broader view because the original political objects can greatly alter during the course of the war and may finally change entirely since they are influenced by events and their probable consequences.
 
 The question now arises how success can be made more likely. One way, of course, is to choose objectives that will incidentally bring about the enemy's collapse-the destruction of his armed forces and the conquest of his territory; but neither is quite what it would be if our real object were the total defeat of the enemy. When we attack the enemy, it is one thing if we mean our first operation to be followed by others until all resistance has been broken; it is quite another if our aim is only to obtain a single victory, in order to make the enemy insecure, to impress our greater strength upon him, and to give him doubts about his future. If that is the extent of our aim, we will employ no more strength than is absolutely necessary. In the same way, conquest of territory is a different matter if the enemy's collapse is not the object. If we wish to gain total victory, then the destruction of .d e his armed forces is the most appropriate action and the occupation of his vre se territory only a consequence. To occupy land before his armies are defeated r sth should be considered at best a necessary evil. If on the other hand we do g ir llA .}re h e o n n f o e t a m a l y i i g m h d t o a ly e t s h d n e e l s o d t t r o o s y r e i e n u k g n d a t e h b f e e r u n o t d p a e l p d o d s p e i r c n o i g s v i i o a n r n c m , e y b i , s u a t a n n r d a a t d h if v e a r w n f e t e a a a g r r e s e i i c n t o , i n t t s h v e i e l n n f c ; e a t d h n e d t h s s a e h t i o z t u u h l r d e e silb this advantage be enough to make the enemy fear for the final outcome, it u P {$ can be considered as a short cut on the road to peace.
 
 .}e ta But there is another way. It is possible to increase the likelihood of sucD {$ cess without defeating the enemy's forces. I refer to operations that have Â© th direct political repercussions, that are designed in the first place to disrupt g iryp the opposing alliance, or to paralyze it, that gain us new allies, favorably o C affect the political scene, etc. If such operations are possible it is obvious CHAPTER TWO that they can greatly improve our prospects and that they can form a much shorter route to the goal than the destruction of the opposing armies.
