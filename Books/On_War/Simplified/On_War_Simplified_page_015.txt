As will be explained later, the two sides are very different and not equally strong. The real issue isn’t about attacking or defending, but about making a decision. If one leader wants to delay the decision, the other wants to speed it up, assuming both are fighting the same kind of battle. For example, if it’s better for A to wait four weeks before attacking B, then B wants to avoid being attacked in four weeks and prefers to fight now. This is a direct conflict, but that doesn’t mean B should attack A right away—that would be a different situation.

Defense is stronger than attack. So, we need to ask if waiting to make a decision is as helpful for one side as defending is for the other. If it isn’t, then waiting can’t balance out the power of defense or change how the war goes. This means the difference between attack and defense might be so big that the conflict of interests doesn’t matter and nothing happens.

If the side that has the advantage now isn’t strong enough to rely on defense alone, it must be ready to face worse conditions later.

Even so, fighting a defensive battle in bad conditions might still be better than attacking right away or making peace. I believe defense is much stronger than it seems at first. This is why wars often have long periods where nothing happens. When there’s not a strong reason to act, the difference between attack and defense stops action, as history shows.

There’s another reason why military action can stop: not knowing enough about the situation. A leader can only fully understand his own side, while information about the enemy is often unreliable. This can lead to wrong guesses, like thinking the enemy is about to attack when actually your side has the advantage. Mistakes like this can cause bad timing—either acting too soon or waiting too long. This confusion can stop military action just as much as it can speed it up, and it’s a natural reason why fighting can come to a pause.
