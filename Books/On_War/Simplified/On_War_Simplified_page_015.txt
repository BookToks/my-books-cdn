As will be shown in detail later, the two are very different and unequal in strength. Polarity, then, does not lie in attack or defense, but in the object both seek to achieve: the decision. If one commander wants to postpone the decision, the other must want to hasten it, always assuming that both are engaged in the same kind of fighting. If it is in A's interest not to attack B now but to attack him in four weeks, then it is in B's interest not to be attacked in four weeks' time, but now. This is an immediate and direct conflict of interest; but it does not follow from this that it would also be to B's advantage to make an immediate attack on A. That would obviously be quite another matter.
 
 As we shall show, defense is a stronger form of fighting than attack. Consequently we must ask whether the advantage of postponing a decision is as great for one side as the advantage of defense is for the other. Whenever it is not, it cannot balance the advantage of defense and in this way influence the progress of the war. It is clear, then, that the impulse created by the polarity of interests may be exhausted in the difference between the strength of attack and defense, and may thus become inoperative.
 
 Consequently, if the side favored by present conditions is not sufficiently strong to do without the added advantages of the defense, it will have to accept the prospect of acting under unfavorable conditions in the future.
 
 To fight a defensive battle under these less favorable conditions may still be better than to attack immediately or to make peace. I am convinced that the superiority of the defensive (if rightly understood) is very great, far greater than appears at first sight. It is this which explains without any inconsistency most periods of inaction that occur in war. The weaker the motives for action, the more will they be overlaid and neutralized by this .d disparity between attack and defense, and the more frequently will action e vre be suspended-as indeed experience shows.
 
 se r sth g ir llA .}re h There is still another factor that can bring military action to a standstill: silb imperfect knowledge of the situation. The only situation a commander can u P {$ know fully is his own; his opponent's he can know only from unreliable .}e ta intelligence. His evaluation, therefore, may be mistaken and can lead him D {$ to suppose that the initiative lies with the enemy when in fact it remains © th with him. Of course such faulty appreciation is as likely to lead to ill-timed g iryp action as to ill-timed inaction, and is no more conducive to slowing down o C operations than it is to speeding them up. Nevertheless, it must rank among CHAPTER ONE the natural causes which, without entailing inconsistency, can bring military activity to a halt.
