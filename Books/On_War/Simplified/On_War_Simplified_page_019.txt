On the other hand, when the reasons for war are not very strong, the natural urge of the military to use violence won’t match up well with what the political leaders want. Because of this, the war will move further away from what a perfect war would be like, the political goals will be less clear, and the fight will seem more about politics.

At this point, it’s important to explain that when we say “the natural tendency of war,” we mean it in a logical and philosophical way. We’re not talking about how the soldiers feel or their emotions. Sometimes, the feelings of the fighters can be so strong that politics can’t control them. But this doesn’t happen often, because if the reasons for war are very strong, the political plan will be equally strong. On the other hand, if the political goals are small, people won’t be very emotional about the war and will need to be encouraged rather than held back.

Now, going back to the main idea, even though politics seems less obvious in one kind of war and very clear in another, both kinds are still political. If you think of the state as a person and politics as its brain, then the state must be ready for wars where violence might take over politics. Only if politics is seen as sneaky or dishonest, and afraid of force, would the second kind of war seem more “political” than the first.

All other things being equal, wars will differ depending on their causes and the situations that create them. Looking at war this way helps us understand the problem better and shows how wars must change depending on their reasons.

The most important decision for political leaders and commanders is to figure out what kind of war they are starting. They must not mistake it for something it is not or try to change its true nature. This is the first and most important strategic question.
