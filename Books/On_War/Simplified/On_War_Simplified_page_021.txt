I want to look into how the nature of war affects its goal and how it’s fought.

First, if we think about the goal of any war, which should guide the military’s actions to help the political aim, we see that the goal of a war can be very different depending on the politics and the situation.

If we think about war in a pure, simple way, we would say that war’s political goal isn’t connected to war itself. War is an act of violence meant to force the enemy to do what we want. So, its goal is always to defeat the enemy and take away their ability to fight. This idea comes from the basic concept of war. Since many wars come close to this, let’s look at this kind of war first.

Later, when we talk about war plans, we’ll look more closely at what it means to take away a country’s weapons. But right now, we should know there are three main goals that cover everything: the enemy’s armed forces, the country itself, and the enemy’s will to fight.

The enemy’s fighting forces have to be destroyed, meaning they can no longer fight. When we say "destroying the enemy’s forces," this is what we mean.

The country must be taken over; otherwise, the enemy could build new forces.

But even if both of these happen, the war isn’t really over until the enemy’s will is broken. This means the enemy’s government and allies have to ask for peace, or the people have to give up.

We might control a country completely, but fighting can start again inside it or with help from allies. This can even happen after a peace treaty. This shows that not every war ends with a clear final result. But even if fighting starts again, a peace treaty stops many smaller conflicts from continuing quietly. Also, the tension goes down because people who want peace will stop thinking about fighting more.

No matter what, we have to believe that when peace is made, the goal of the war has been reached and the fighting is done.
