This usually means that action is postponed in time and space to the extent that space is relevant and circun~stancesp ermit. If the time arrives when further waiting would bring excessive disadvantages, then the benefit of the negative policy has been exhausted. The destruction of the enemy-an aim that has until then been postponed but not displaced by another consideration-now reemerges.
 
 Our discussion has shown that while in war many different roads can lead to the goal, to the attainment of the political object, fighting is the onlv possible means. Everything is governed by a supreme law, the decision by force of arms. If the opponent does seek battle, this recourse can never be denied him. A commander who prefers another strategy must first be sure that his opponent either will not appeal to that supreme tribunal-forceor that he will lose the verdict if he does. To sum up: of all the possible aims in war, the destruction of the enemy's armed forces always appears as the highest.
 
 At a later stage and by degrees we shall see what other kinds of strategies can achieve in war. All we need to do for the moment is to admit the general possibility of their existence, the possibility of deviating from the basic concept of war under the pressure of special circumstances. But even at this point we must not fail to emphasize that the violent resolution of the crisis, the wish to annihilate the enemy's forces, is the first-born son of war. If the political aims are small, the motives slight and tensions low, a prudent general may look for any way to avoid major crises and decisive actions, exploit any weaknesses in the opponent's military and political strategy, and finally reach a peaceful settlement. If his assumptions are sound and promise success we are not entitled to criticize him. But he must never forget that he is moving on devious paths where the god of war may catch him unawares.
 
 He must always keep an eye on his opponent so that he does not, if the latter has taken up a sharp sword, approach him armed only with an ornamental rapier.
 
 These conclusions concerning the nature of war and the function of its purposes and means; the manner in which war in practice deviates in varying degrees from its basic, rigorous concept, taking this form or that, but .d always remaining subject to that basic concept, as to a supreme law; all e vre these points must be kept in mind in our subsequent analyses if we are to se r sth g p n e if r i c c e a i n v c e e t o h f e e r a e c a h l ; c a o n n d n e if c t w io e n s w i b sh e tw to e e a n v o a id ll c a o s n p s e t c a t n s tl o y f f w al a l r in , g a n in d t o th t e h e t r w ue il d s e ig st ir llA inconsistencies with reality and even with our own arguments.
