People hold dear him who embodies virtue and insight, who is principled, has realized the truth, and who himself does what he ought to be doing.
 
 218. One who is intent upon the Ineffable (Nibbana), dwells with mind inspired (by supramundane wisdom), and is no more bound by sense pleasures – such a man is called “One Bound Upstream.”18 219. When, after a long absence, a man safely returns from afar, his relatives, friends and well-wishers welcome him home on arrival.
 
 220. As kinsmen welcome a dear one on arrival, even so his own good deeds will welcome the doer of good who has gone from this world to the next.
