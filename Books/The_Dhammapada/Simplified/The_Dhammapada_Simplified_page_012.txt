You should follow the five basic rules of Buddhism. These rules tell you not to kill living things, steal, cheat on someone, lie, or use drugs and alcohol. If you break these rules, it’s like hurting yourself deeply in this life.

A student of Buddhism should be kind and caring to everyone, live honestly, control their desires, always tell the truth, and live a clean, good life. They should work hard and take care of their parents, family, and the monks or holy people who depend on others for help.

Many teachings about this first step talk about ending fights and anger. You should avoid arguments by being patient and forgiving because fighting back only keeps the cycle of hate going.

The real way to beat hate is by not hating back, being patient, and loving others. When someone says something mean, don’t answer with words—stay quiet. Don’t let anger take control; manage it like a driver controls a car. Instead of looking for others’ mistakes, focus on fixing your own faults, like a silversmith cleans silver. Even if you’ve done bad things before, don’t be sad or give up. People can change completely, and when someone chooses to do good, they shine brightly, like the moon coming out from behind clouds.

The best qualities of a good person are being generous, honest, patient, and kind. When you build these qualities in yourself, you feel peaceful inside and get along well with others.
