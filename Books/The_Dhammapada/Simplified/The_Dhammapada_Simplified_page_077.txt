Craving is like a vine that grows everywhere. When you see it starting to grow, use your wisdom to cut it off at the root.

Pleasure comes when cravings draw feelings from everything around us. People who want only fun and enjoyment get stuck in the cycle of being born, growing old, and dying.

Craving traps people like a scared rabbit caught in a trap. Because of this, they keep suffering over and over for a long time.

Since craving traps people like that, anyone who wants to be free from desire should work on stopping their own cravings.

Some people leave their homes to live in the forest as monks to get away from desire. But even after leaving, they often go back to their old life. Look at that person! Even though they are free, they return to their old chains.

Wise people say that the strongest chains are not made of iron, wood, or rope. Instead, the strongest chains are the love for things like jewelry, kids, and family. These chains pull people down and are hard to break, even if they seem loose.

The wise cut off these chains too. They give up wanting pleasure and stop longing for things, choosing to leave the world behind.
