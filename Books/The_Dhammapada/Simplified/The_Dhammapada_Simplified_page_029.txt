Don’t be careless. Don’t just chase after fun and pleasures. Only people who pay attention and think carefully can find true happiness.

Just like someone standing on top of a mountain can see all the people below, a wise person who stops being careless and gains wisdom can see how sad and lost most people are.

The wise person stays alert when others are not, moving ahead fast like a strong horse leaving a weak one behind.

Because of paying attention, Indra became the leader of the gods. Being careful is always praised, while being careless is looked down on.

A monk who loves being careful and is afraid of being careless moves forward like fire, burning away all problems, big and small.

This monk won’t fall into trouble and is very close to reaching Nibbana, a state of perfect peace.
