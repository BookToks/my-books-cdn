Just like a big flood washes away a quiet village, death takes away a person who is attached to their kids and animals.

When death comes, no family can protect him. No sons, fathers, or relatives can save him.

Knowing this, a smart person who follows good values should quickly work on finding the way to Nibbana (peace and freedom).
