The birth of the Buddhas is very special and lucky. The sharing of their important Teachings is also something to be thankful for. It’s great when people in the Order get along well. And it’s wonderful when people who seek the truth come together to follow a spiritual path.

Someone who respects the Buddhas and their followers, who have overcome all problems and are free from sadness and regret, is very lucky. Respecting these calm and brave people brings a lot of good things that can’t be counted.

Chapter 15 Happiness 197.
