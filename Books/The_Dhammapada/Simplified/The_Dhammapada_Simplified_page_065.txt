A person doesn’t become fair by just making random decisions; a smart person looks carefully at what is right and wrong.

Someone who doesn’t judge others unfairly but makes fair decisions based on the truth is wise and protects the law. This person is called just.

Being wise doesn’t mean talking a lot. A wise person is calm, friendly, and brave.

A person isn’t really knowledgeable about Dhamma (the teachings) just because they talk a lot. Someone who hears a little of it, understands it clearly, and pays attention to it is truly knowledgeable.

A monk isn’t called an Elder just because he has gray hair. That only means he is old, but he might be old without having grown in wisdom.

A true Elder is someone who is honest, good, gentle, self-controlled, free from bad habits, and wise.

A person isn’t really skilled just because they speak well or look good if they are jealous, selfish, and dishonest.

But a person who has completely gotten rid of these bad feelings and has no hate inside is truly wise and skilled.
