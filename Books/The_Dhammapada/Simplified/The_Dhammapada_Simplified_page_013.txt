The Buddha says that being good smells better than all flowers and perfumes. A good person is like the big Himalaya mountains—they shine from far away, and people love and respect them wherever they go.

The Dhammapada teaches that being moral is not just about feeling happy right now. It also shapes what happens to us in the future. This idea starts by realizing that simply helping others isn’t enough to explain why we should be good.

We naturally think that good people should be happy and bad people should suffer. But in real life, good people sometimes have a hard time, and bad people often get lucky. Our sense of right and wrong tells us this unfairness must be fixed somehow.

The Buddha explains this with the idea of kamma (or karma), which is a natural law that connects our actions with their results. This means good actions will eventually bring happiness, and bad actions will bring suffering.

Many people think kamma means fate, but that’s wrong for Buddhism.

Kamma actually means actions done with intention—things we do with our body or speech, or even thoughts and feelings we keep inside.
