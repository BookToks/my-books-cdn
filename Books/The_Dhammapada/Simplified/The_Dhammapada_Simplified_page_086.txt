394. What is the use of your matted hair, O witless man? What of your garment of antelope’s hide?
 
 Within you is the tangle (of passion); only outwardly do you cleanse yourself.28 395. The person who wears a robe made of rags, who is lean, with veins showing all over the body, and who meditates alone in the forest – him do I call a holy man.
 
 396. I do not call him a holy man because of his lineage or high-born mother. If he is full of impeding attachments, he is just a supercilious man. But who is free from impediments and clinging – him do I call a holy man.
 
 397. He who, having cut off all fetters, trembles no more, who has overcome all attachments and is emancipated – him do I call a holy man.
 
 398. He who has cut off the thong (of hatred), the band (of craving), and the rope (of false views), together with the appurtenances (latent evil tendencies), he who has removed the crossbar (of ignorance) and is enlightened – him do I call a holy man.
