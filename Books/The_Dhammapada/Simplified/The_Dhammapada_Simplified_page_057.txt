Being healthy is the best thing you can have, and feeling happy inside is the greatest kind of wealth. A person you can trust is like your best family, and Nibbana (a state of perfect peace) is the highest kind of happiness.

When someone experiences the calm and quiet of Nibbana, they feel free from pain and worry. They enjoy the deep happiness that comes from understanding the truth.

It’s really good to see and be around wise and good people. Living with them always brings happiness. You’ll feel happier if you don’t have to deal with silly or foolish people.

Being with foolish people causes sadness and longing. It’s painful, like working with an enemy. But being with wise people feels good, like being with your own family.

So, follow the example of the wise and good people who are steady, smart, knowledgeable, responsible, and devoted. You should follow only those who are truly good and wise, just like the moon follows the stars in the sky.
