A person’s moral freedom is both scary and exciting because their choices decide their own future, not just in one life but in many lives that keep coming because of samsara. If they choose badly, they can fall to the lowest, worst places. But if they choose well, they can become so good that even the gods respect them. All possible futures start from right now, from the choices and actions a person takes.

Understanding that life has two sides goes beyond just what we usually see. It includes the opposite states of being: the world of change and suffering (samsara) and the world beyond it, called Nibbana, or the “far shore.” The Buddha came to help people find the way to leave the suffering world and reach true safety in Nibbana. But he can only show the way; it’s up to each person to follow it.

The Dhammapada often tells us that people are in control of themselves—they can build themselves up or tear themselves down, save themselves or destroy themselves. In the end, everyone must choose between going back into the cycle of life or going out of it to reach Nibbana. This last path is very hard and requires a lot of effort, but the Buddha promises that it’s possible. People have the power to overcome all obstacles and even defeat death.

The Dhammapada says that the mind is the most important tool for making progress in all areas of life.
