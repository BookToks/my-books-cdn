A monk who doesn’t look down on what he has, even if it’s very little, who lives honestly and works hard – even the gods admire him.

A true monk doesn’t get attached to his mind or body and doesn’t feel sad about what he doesn’t have.

A monk who loves everyone and follows the Buddha’s teachings with all his heart finds true peace and happiness, called Nibbana, where all problems stop.

Empty your boat, monk! When it’s empty, it will float easily.

If you get rid of desire and hate, you will reach Nibbana.

Let go of the five things holding you back, stop clinging to them, and develop five good qualities. A monk who beats these five problems is like someone who has crossed a dangerous river.

Meditate, monk! Don’t be careless. Don’t let your mind chase after pleasures. If you aren’t careful, it’s like swallowing a hot iron ball and then screaming because it burns.
