To understand the different sayings in the Dhammapada, we will use a system of four levels to figure out what each verse means and how it fits into the whole teaching of the Buddha. This system is based on an old idea that the Buddha’s teaching has three main goals: helping people live better now, having a good rebirth in the next life, and reaching the ultimate good. The four levels come from splitting the last goal into two parts: the path and the result.

The first level focuses on making people happy and peaceful in their everyday relationships. It shows how to live peacefully with yourself and others, take care of your family and society, and avoid anger, fights, and violence that cause a lot of pain to people and the world. The advice here is similar to what many religions say, but Buddhism doesn’t rely on belief in a god. Instead, it’s based on two clear ideas: caring about your own honesty and long-term happiness, and caring about how your actions affect others. The Dhammapada’s main advice is to avoid doing bad things, do good things, and keep your mind clean. To help people know exactly what to avoid and what to do, some verses say you should avoid getting easily angry in what you do, say, and think, and practice self-control.
