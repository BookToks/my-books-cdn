Everyone is scared of violence and afraid of dying. If you imagine yourself in someone else’s shoes, you shouldn’t hurt or kill others, and you shouldn’t make others do it either.

Everyone values their life because it is precious. So, by thinking about how others feel, you should avoid harming or killing them.

If you try to be happy but hurt others who also want to be happy, you won’t find true happiness later on.

But if you try to be happy and don’t hurt others, you will find real happiness in the future.

Don’t speak harshly to people because they might get angry and say mean things back. Angry words can hurt, and you might end up in a fight.

If you stay calm and don’t respond with anger, it shows you are close to peace, because you have no desire for revenge.

Just like a herder uses a stick to guide cows to the field, old age and death guide life from one stage to another.

When a foolish person does bad things, they don’t understand that it’s wrong. But they suffer because of their own mistakes, like someone who gets burned by fire.
