You can only understand its true value by studying it again and again, thinking about it carefully, and most importantly, by using its ideas in your everyday life. So, if you’re looking for spiritual advice, it’s a good idea to treat the Dhammapada like a guide for thinking deeply.

After reading it the first time, try reading a few verses or a whole chapter each day, slowly and carefully, really enjoying the words. Think hard about what each verse means, how it relates to your own life, and use it to help you make good choices.

If you keep doing this patiently and don’t give up, the Dhammapada will give your life new meaning and purpose. It will fill you with hope and inspiration, and little by little, it will help you find a freedom and happiness that’s much better than anything the world can give you.
