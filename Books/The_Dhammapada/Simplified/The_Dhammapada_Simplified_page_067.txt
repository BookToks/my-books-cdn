Out of all the paths, the Eightfold Path is the best. Of all the truths, the Four Noble Truths are the best. Of all things, not being controlled by desires is the best. And of all people, the Seeing One (the Buddha) is the best.

This is the only path; there is no other way to truly understand and clear your mind. Follow this path, and you will confuse Mara (the force that causes suffering).

By walking this path, you will end your suffering. I have found the way to remove the pain caused by desire, and I want to share it with you.

You have to work hard yourself; Buddhas only show the way. Those who meditate and follow the path break free from Mara’s control.

“All things that depend on causes don’t last forever” – when you understand this deeply, you stop suffering. This is the way to cleanse your mind.

“All things that depend on causes are not perfect” – when you understand this deeply, you stop suffering. This is the way to cleanse your mind.

“All things are not really 'me' or 'mine'” – when you understand this deeply, you stop suffering. This is the way to cleanse your mind.

A lazy person who doesn’t try when they should, especially when young and strong, with a mind full of useless thoughts, will not find the path to wisdom.
