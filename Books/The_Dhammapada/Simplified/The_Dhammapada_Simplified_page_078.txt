People who are obsessed with their desires get caught again and again, like a spider stuck in its own web. Wise people stop this cycle. They let go of all suffering and give up caring about the world.

Let go of the past, the future, and even the present. Then you can cross over to a better place beyond life and death. With a free mind, you won’t be born again.

If someone is always thinking bad thoughts and chasing pleasure, their cravings only get stronger. This makes them more trapped.

But someone who works hard to stop bad thoughts, thinks about what’s not good, and stays aware can end their cravings and break free from the traps of desire.

A person who has reached this goal is not afraid, doesn’t want anything, and has removed all pain from life. For them, this is their last life.

Someone who is free from craving and attachment understands the true meaning of the teachings perfectly and knows how to follow them right. This person is wise and truly great.

I have won over everything and know it all. But I don’t hold on to anything I’ve won or learned.

By giving up everything, I am free because I destroyed my cravings. Having understood everything on my own, who else could I call my teacher?
