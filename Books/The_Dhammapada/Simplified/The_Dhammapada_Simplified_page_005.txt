The Buddha had deep ideas that turned into these bright and wise verses. Each verse gives advice on how to live the right way. The Buddha clearly said that anyone who seriously follows the teachings in the Dhammapada will feel true happiness and freedom.

Because it is so important, the Dhammapada has been translated into many languages. In English, there are several versions by well-known scholars like Max Muller and Dr. S. Radhakrishnan. But when the Buddhaâ€™s teachings are explained without understanding Buddhism fully, mistakes can happen. This has already occurred with our collection: some translations have caused wrong ideas, and the notes sometimes seem unfair.

This translation was first made in the late 1950s. Before that, while looking at many English versions of the Dhammapada, it was noticed that some were either too loose and wrong or too strict and boring. So, it was decided to make a new translation that avoids these problems. The result is a simple effort by a true follower of the Buddha to share the meaning, spirit, and style of the original teachings.

While working on this book, I used many editions and translations of the Dhammapada in different languages like Sanskrit, Hindi, Bengali, Sinhala, Burmese, and Nepali.
