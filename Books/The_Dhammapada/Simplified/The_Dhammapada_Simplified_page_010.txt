The teachings come from what it means to be human, so they have to be shared in ways that different people can understand. Everyone is at different levels of spiritual growth, has different problems, goals, and ways of thinking. 

Just like water is the same but takes the shape of any container, the Dhamma (the Buddha’s teachings) changes form to fit the needs of the people learning it. This is clear in the simple talks, but even more obvious in the short, powerful verses of the Dhammapada. These strong messages can sometimes seem confusing or even contradictory if you’re not careful.

For example, in some verses, the Buddha says certain actions lead to being born in heaven, but in others, he says not to want heaven and praises those who don’t enjoy heavenly pleasures. Sometimes he talks about doing good deeds, but elsewhere he praises those who go beyond both good and bad deeds. Without understanding the bigger picture of the Dhamma, these statements can look like they don’t match or even contradict each other.

The way to understand these differences is to realize that the Dhamma changes based on the needs of the different people it’s teaching. Even one person can have many different needs at once, so the teachings adjust to fit those too.
