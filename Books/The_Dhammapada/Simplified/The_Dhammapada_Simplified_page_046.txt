If someone hurts people who can’t fight back, or bothers those who don’t do anything wrong, they will soon face one of these bad things: sharp pain, disaster, serious injury, a bad illness, mental problems, trouble with the government, serious accusations, losing family members, losing money, or having their house burned down. When that person dies, if they didn’t understand what’s right, they will be born in hell.

Just walking around naked, having messy hair, being dirty, fasting, lying on the ground, putting ashes or dust on yourself, or sitting in a certain way won’t make someone pure if they still have doubts in their mind.

Even if someone dresses nicely, but they are calm, in control, and live a good, peaceful life without hurting anyone, they are truly holy, like a monk or a person who has given up worldly things.

It’s very rare to find someone who behaves modestly and avoids getting into trouble, just like a well-trained horse avoids being hit with a whip.

Like a horse reacting to a whip, be strong and full of spiritual desire. Use faith, good behavior, hard work, meditation, searching for the truth, knowledge, goodness, and awareness to overcome endless suffering.

Just like how workers manage water, make straight arrows, and shape wood, good people control themselves.
