The Buddha talks about two main types of kamma, which means actions: unwholesome kamma, which comes from feelings like greed, hate, and confusion; and wholesome kamma, which comes from kindness, letting go, goodwill, and understanding.

The things we choose to do in life might be forgotten later, but they leave small marks on our mind. These marks are like seeds that can grow and affect us in the future when the right conditions happen.

These seeds grow in the process of rebirth, called samsara. According to Buddha, life is not just one time, starting at birth and ending at death. Instead, each life is part of a long chain of lives with no clear beginning. This continues as long as the desire to live stays strong. Rebirth can happen in different places. Besides being born as humans or animals, people can be born in happy, powerful heavenly worlds or in painful, suffering worlds below.

The Buddha says that the reason we are reborn in these places is because of kamma, the actions we choose.

Kamma mainly decides where we are reborn. Good actions lead to higher, better places, and bad actions lead to lower, worse places. Even after rebirth, kamma still affects how our life goes. For example, in the human world, good kamma can bring a long life, health, wealth, beauty, and success. Bad kamma can cause a short life, sickness, poverty, ugliness, and failure.
