It ends by saying that all parts of our body and mind, called “the aggregates of existence” (khandha), are always changing and don’t have any permanent substance, so they can’t really make us happy. The second truth explains that suffering happens because we want things too much (craving or tanha), like wanting pleasure and to keep living. This desire causes us to be stuck in a cycle of rebirths, which brings sadness, worry, and hopelessness.

The third truth says that if we stop craving, we can be free from suffering. The fourth truth tells us how to do this by following the Noble Eightfold Path: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.

At this point, the focus changes from karma and rebirth to these Four Noble Truths. Instead of just living morally to get a better rebirth, the goal becomes fully practicing the Noble Eightfold Path to stop craving and end rebirth altogether. The eight parts of the path are grouped into three main areas to make training easier to understand: moral discipline (right speech, action, and livelihood), concentration (right effort, mindfulness, and concentration), and wisdom (right understanding and thought).

By practicing moral discipline, we control bad habits that show up as harmful words and actions. By practicing concentration, the mind becomes calm, clear, and focused, without distracting thoughts.
