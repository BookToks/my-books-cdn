Hey, builder, people see what you do! You won't get to build this house again. Your rafters are broken and the main beam is smashed. My mind has reached a place with no limits; I have ended all my cravings.

Those who don’t live a good life or don’t get money when they’re young suffer later, like old cranes stuck in a pond without any fish.

Those who don’t live well or get money when they’re young spend time feeling sad about the past, like old arrows that have already been shot from a bow.
