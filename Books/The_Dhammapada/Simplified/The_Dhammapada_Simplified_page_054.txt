No amount of satisfying your physical desires can make you truly happy, even if you had a rain of gold coins. These pleasures give only a little happiness and a lot of pain. When a wise person understands this, they don’t get excited even by the best pleasures. A follower of the Supreme Buddha finds joy in getting rid of cravings.

People often run away from fear to many places—like hills, forests, groves, trees, and shrines.

But these places are not truly safe. They are not the best places to find peace. Going to these places won’t free someone from all their suffering.

Those who take refuge in the Buddha, his teachings, and his community understand the Four Noble Truths with deep wisdom. These truths are about suffering, how suffering ends, and the path that leads to the end of suffering.

This is the real safe place, the best refuge. When someone goes to this refuge, they can be free from all suffering.

It is very rare to find a true noble person like the Buddha. He is not born everywhere. Wherever such a wise person is born, that family or group lives happily.
