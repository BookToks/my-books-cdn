If you care about yourself, you should always watch your own behavior. A smart person stays alert during the whole night.

First, you should learn to do the right thing yourself before trying to teach others. That way, smart people wonâ€™t blame you.

You should do what you tell others to do. If you want to help others learn, you need to have control over yourself. But controlling yourself is really hard.

You are the only one who can protect yourself. If you control yourself well, you can become very powerful.

When a foolish person does bad things by themselves, it hurts them a lot, like a diamond scraping a hard stone.

Just like a vine can kill the tree it grows on, a very bad person only harms themselves, like an enemy would want.

Doing bad things that hurt yourself is easy. But doing good things that help you is very hard.

If someone hates the teachings of wise and good people because of wrong ideas, that person is like a bamboo that only grows fruit that destroys itself.
