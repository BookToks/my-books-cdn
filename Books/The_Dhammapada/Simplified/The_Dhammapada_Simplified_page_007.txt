In countries that follow Theravada Buddhism, like Sri Lanka, Burma, and Thailand, the Dhammapada is everywhere. It is a constant source of ideas for sermons and talks, a guidebook for solving everyday problems, and a beginner's book for new monks in the monasteries. Even experienced monks who live alone in forests or caves to meditate usually have a copy of this book with them.

But the respect for the Dhammapada is not just from people who follow Buddhism.

Wherever people have learned about it, its strong moral lessons, real understanding of life, short wise sayings, and inspiring message about how to be free from suffering have made many people admire and respect it.

The person who taught the verses in the Dhammapada is an Indian wise man called the Buddha, which means “the Enlightened One” or “the Awakened One.” His story has sometimes been mixed with legends and stories, but the basic facts are simple. He was born in the sixth century B.C. as the son of a king in a small kingdom near the Himalayas, in what is now Nepal. His real name was Siddhattha Gotama (or Siddhartha Gautama in Sanskrit). He grew up in luxury and was prepared by his father to become king. But when he was a young man, he saw the suffering in life, which shocked him so much that he lost interest in all the pleasures and power he was supposed to have.
