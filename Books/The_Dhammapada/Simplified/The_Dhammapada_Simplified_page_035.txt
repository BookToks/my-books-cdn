Nights feel really long when you can’t sleep, and a long journey feels even longer when you're tired. Life feels endless to people who don’t understand the deeper truth.

If someone looking for the right path can’t find a friend who is better or at least as good, they should keep going alone. There’s no point hanging out with a fool.

Fools worry because they think, “I have kids, I have money.” But if they don’t even have control over themselves, what good are their kids or money?

A fool who knows he’s foolish is at least somewhat wise. But a fool who thinks he’s smart is truly foolish.

Even if a fool spends his whole life with a wise person, he won’t understand the truth any more than a spoon can taste soup.

But if a smart person spends just a little time with a wise person, they quickly get the truth, like a tongue tasting soup.

Fools with little brains are their own worst enemies because they do bad things, and the results of those actions are bitter.

Doing something wrong and then feeling sorry for it later is a bad choice. When you cry over the consequences, it’s too late to fix it.
