It's good to control what you look at, and good to control what you listen to. It's good to control your sense of smell, and good to control what you say.

It's good to control your body, good to control your speech, and good to control your thoughts. Controlling yourself in every way is a good thing. A monk who controls himself everywhere is free from all suffering.

A person who controls their hands, feet, and tongue; who is fully in control, enjoys growing inside, focuses on meditation, keeps to themselves, and feels happy – people call that person a monk.

A monk who controls their tongue, speaks in a calm and humble way, and explains the teachings clearly and honestly – whatever they say sounds good.

A monk who lives by the teachings, loves the teachings, thinks about the teachings, and remembers the teachings well – they don’t turn away from the great teachings.

You should not look down on what you have or be jealous of what others get. A monk who is jealous of others can’t reach deep meditation.
