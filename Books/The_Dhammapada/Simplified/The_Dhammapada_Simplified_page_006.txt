I learned a lot from the great translations made by the late Venerable Narada Mahathera from Colombo, Sri Lanka, and Professor Bhagwat from Poona, India. I am very thankful to them. Some verses have puzzles, references, or comparisons that might be hard to understand. Their meanings are given in parentheses or notes, and I used explanations from Bhadantacariya Buddhaghosa’s commentary to help explain them.

Verses that are explained in the notes have an asterisk (*) at the end in the text.

The first version of this translation came out in 1959, and the second in 1966, both published by the Maha Bodhi Society in Bangalore, India. For this third version, I made many changes. The new subtitle, “The Buddha’s Path of Wisdom,” is not a direct translation, but it fits well because the verses of the Dhammapada come from the Buddha’s wisdom and guide anyone who follows them to live wisely.

I thank the editors of the Buddhist Publication Society for their helpful ideas and the Society for kindly publishing this book.

I offer this Dhamma in loving memory of my teachers, parents, and family, both those who have passed away and those still living. I hope they find peace in the Buddha’s teachings and reach Nibbana!

May everyone be happy!

From long ago until now, the Dhammapada has been known as the shortest and clearest way to show the Buddha’s teachings in the Pali Canon, and it is the most important spiritual guide of early Buddhism.
