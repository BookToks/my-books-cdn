Just like rain can’t get inside a house with a good roof, strong feelings like passion can’t mess with a mind that’s well-trained.

A bad person feels sad both now and after death. They feel upset in this life and the next because they remember all the wrong things they did.

A good person feels happy both now and after death. They feel joy in this life and the next because they remember all the good things they did.

A bad person suffers in this life and the next. Thinking “I did bad things” makes them feel worse, especially when they go to unhappy places after death.

A good person feels pleasure in this life and the next. Thinking “I did good things” makes them feel even better, especially when they go to happy places after death.

Someone who reads holy books a lot but doesn’t follow their lessons is like a person who counts other people’s cows but never gets to enjoy the benefits of having cows.

Someone who reads a little but actually lives by the teachings—giving up bad feelings like desire, anger, and confusion, and having real wisdom and a free mind—truly enjoys the blessings of a holy life.
