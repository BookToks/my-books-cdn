Passion doesn’t bother someone who has finished their journey, who feels no sadness, is completely free, and has let go of all attachments.

People who are aware work hard. They don’t stick to one place; like swans leaving a lake, they move on from one home to another.

Those who don’t keep wanting more and are careful about what they eat, aiming for emptiness and true freedom, leave no trace behind, like birds flying in the sky.

Someone who has gotten rid of bad habits and doesn’t crave food, focusing on emptiness and true freedom, also leaves no trail, just like birds in the air.

Even gods respect the wise person, whose senses are controlled like well-trained horses, whose pride is gone, and who is free from harmful desires.

The wise person no longer lives in the world of suffering, like the earth that feels no anger, steady like a tall pillar, and pure like a deep, clean pond.

Their thoughts, words, and actions are calm. Because they truly understand, they are completely free, peaceful, and wise.
