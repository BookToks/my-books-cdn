They are happy with just the basics, eat moderately, control their senses, use their energy well, stay mindful all the time, and calm their busy thoughts. With a clear and steady mind, they learn to watch how things come and go, and feel “a joy beyond any human happiness,” a deep happiness that comes before the ultimate peace after death.

The highest point of meditation is developing insight (vipassana). The Dhammapada explains important truths that insight reveals: everything that depends on something else is temporary, nothing is truly satisfying, and there is no real self or permanent “I” anywhere.

When someone truly understands these truths through experience, their desires, ignorance, and mental chains break free. The person then moves through different stages of awakening until they fully reach Nibbana.

The fourth part of the Dhammapada doesn’t teach new ideas but celebrates those who have reached the goal. According to the Pali Canon, there are four clear stages on the path to Nibbana. The first is called “Stream-entry” (sotapatti), where the person sees “the Deathless” for the first time and starts the path for sure, guaranteed to reach the goal within seven lives. This achievement is said to be greater than being a ruler of all worlds.

After Stream-entry, there are two more stages that reduce more mental impurities and bring the goal closer. One is “Once-returner” (sakadagami), when the person will be born as a human at most one more time. The next is “Non-returner” (anagami), when the person will not come back to human life but will be reborn in a heavenly place, where they will reach final freedom.
