Like an elephant in a battle that faces arrows coming from all sides, I will also endure harsh treatment. Many people don’t have good values.

A trained elephant is brought into a crowd, and the king rides a trained elephant. The best person is the one who controls themselves and accepts abuse.

Good animals like trained mules, strong Sindhu horses, and noble tusker elephants are great. But even better is a person who has control over themselves.

You can’t reach the Untrodden Land (Nibbana) by riding these animals. Instead, someone who has trained their own mind can reach it.

The tusker named Dhanapalaka is wild and hard to control during mating season. When it’s kept in captivity, it refuses to eat and only thinks about the elephant forest.

When a person is lazy and eats too much, sleeping and rolling around like a fat pig, they keep being reborn over and over.

Before, my mind wandered wherever it wanted and did what it pleased. But now, I will control it carefully with wisdom, like a mahout controls a wild elephant with a hook.
