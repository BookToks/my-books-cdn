Just like a person who makes arrows straightens the arrow’s shaft, a smart person straightens their mind – because the mind is always changing and hard to control.

When a fish is taken out of water and put on land, it shakes and moves a lot. The mind is like that too, restless and upset. That’s why you should stay away from bad influences.

It’s amazing to calm the mind. The mind is very hard to control, always moving fast and chasing what it wants. But when the mind is calm, it brings happiness.

A smart person watches over their mind carefully because it’s tricky and always trying to grab what it wants. A protected mind brings happiness.

The mind lives deep inside like in a cave, without a clear shape, wandering alone. People who control their minds are free from bad influences.

Wisdom can’t grow fully in someone whose mind isn’t steady, who doesn’t understand good teachings, and who isn’t sure about what they believe.

Someone who is truly awake doesn’t feel afraid. Their mind isn’t filled with desire or hate, and they have gone beyond good and bad actions.
