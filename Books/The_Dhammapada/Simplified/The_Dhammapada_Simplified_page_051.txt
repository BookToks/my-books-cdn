Don’t follow the crowd; don’t live carelessly; don’t believe in lies; don’t stay stuck in the world’s problems.

168. Wake up! Don’t be careless! Live a good and honest life.

People who live right are happy both now and after this life.

169. Live a good life; don’t live badly. Good people are happy both now and later.

170. If you see the world as something fake and not real, Death won’t catch you.

171. Look at this world like a fancy royal chariot. Foolish people get stuck in it, but smart people don’t get attached.

172. Someone who used to be careless but isn’t anymore shines bright like the moon when the clouds clear.

173. If you cover your bad actions with good ones, you shine bright like the moon after the clouds are gone.

174. Most people don’t understand the world well; only a few have true wisdom. Only a few, like birds escaping a trap, reach a happy place.

175. Swans fly toward the sun; people can rise using special powers; the wise leave the world after beating Mara and his followers.
