The second level of teaching in the Dhammapada is about how the law of kamma works in real life. It shows people, who want to be happy and free from sadness, the best way to reach those goals. The advice is the same as before: don’t do bad things and try to do good things.

The difference is in the way this advice is explained and why you should follow it. Now, the rules about being good are connected to a bigger, invisible law that affects all life. This law controls the cycle of being born, living, dying, and being born again.

Following these moral rules is important, even if it’s hard or seems like it doesn’t work sometimes, because it matches this big law. Our choices and actions shape our future—both in this life and in the lives to come. If you live by these rules, you grow inside, get better rebirths, and experience more happiness. But if you act selfishly or hatefully, you go downwards—feeling worse inside, suffering, and being born into unhappy places.

This idea is introduced right at the start of the Dhammapada and comes up many times throughout the book.

The advice about wanting better rebirths and happiness in future lives is not the final teaching of the Buddha. So, it can’t be the complete plan for personal growth that the Dhammapada recommends.
