Being careful and aware leads to living forever. Not paying attention leads to death. Those who are careful don’t really die.

People who aren’t careful are like they’re already dead. Knowing how important being careful is, smart people feel happy about it and enjoy being with wise people.

Wise people who keep thinking deeply and don’t give up are the only ones who reach Nibbana, which is the amazing freedom from being trapped.

The person who is hardworking, aware, behaves well, understands things clearly, controls themselves, does what’s right, and stays careful becomes more and more respected.

Through hard work, being careful, discipline, and control, a wise person should build a safe place for themselves that no problem can destroy.

Foolish people don’t pay attention, but wise people keep their carefulness as their greatest treasure.
