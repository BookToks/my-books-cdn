Just like a bee takes honey from a flower without hurting its color or smell, a wise person goes around the village quietly asking for food without causing any trouble.

No one should blame others or notice their mistakes. Instead, everyone should pay attention to what they themselves have done or left undone.

Words that sound nice but are not followed by actions are like a pretty flower that has no smell—they don’t really mean much.

But words that are followed by good actions are like a beautiful flower that also has a lovely fragrance—they really matter.

Just like many garlands can be made from a big bunch of flowers, a person should try to do many good deeds during their life.

The sweet smell of flowers or special scents like sandalwood, tagara, or jasmine can’t be carried by the wind far. But the good qualities of a virtuous person spread everywhere, just like a strong, pleasant fragrance.

Out of all smells—sandalwood, tagara, blue lotus, and jasmine—the smell of being a good person is the sweetest.
