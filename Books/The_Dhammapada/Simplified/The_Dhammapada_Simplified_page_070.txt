If giving up a smaller happiness can help you find a bigger happiness, a smart person will give up the smaller one to get the bigger one.

Someone who is stuck in hate and tries to be happy by hurting others will never really escape hate.

Problems only grow for people who are proud and careless, who don’t do what they should and do what they shouldn’t.

Problems stop for people who pay attention and understand clearly, who always try to be aware of their body, avoid bad actions, and keep doing the right things.

A wise person who has overcome craving (like a mother), self-importance (like a father), two wrong beliefs (like kings), and destroyed their attachments and desires goes on without sadness.

This wise person also overcomes the two extreme beliefs and five mental obstacles (like a tiger), and moves forward without grief.

The followers of Gotama are always happy when they practice remembering the Buddha’s good qualities all the time, day and night.
