If you meet someone who points out your mistakes and gives advice, follow them like they are a guide to hidden treasure. It’s always better to have friends like that.

Let them warn you, teach you, and protect you from doing wrong. Good people love them, but bad people don’t.

Don’t hang out with bad friends or look for company with mean people. Spend time with good friends and noble people.

Someone who learns deeply about the Dhamma (Buddha’s teachings) lives happily with a peaceful mind. Wise people always enjoy the Dhamma taught by the Buddha.

Irrigators control rivers, fletchers make arrows straight, carpenters shape wood, and wise people control themselves.

Just like a strong rock doesn’t move in a storm, wise people don’t get upset by praise or blame.

When wise people hear the Teachings, they become pure like a deep, clear, and calm lake.

Good people give up wanting everything.

Good people don’t talk just to chase fun. Wise people don’t get too happy or too sad when good or bad things happen.
