You can’t focus your mind well without understanding things clearly, and you can’t understand things clearly without being able to focus your mind. If someone has both focus and understanding, they are very close to reaching Nibbana (true peace).

A monk who lives alone and has calmed his mind, and who understands the teachings deeply, feels a happiness that is better than any other kind of happiness.

When he truly sees how things come together and fall apart, he feels joy and happiness. For someone who understands, this shows the way to something that never dies.

Controlling your senses, being happy with what you have, and following the rules of the monk’s life are the foundation for a holy life for a wise monk.

He should spend time with good friends who are energetic and live pure lives, and he should be kind and polite. By doing this, full of joy, he will end all suffering.

Just like a jasmine plant drops its old flowers, monks should completely get rid of desire and hate.

A monk who is calm in body, speech, and thoughts, who is peaceful and has let go of worldly things, is truly peaceful.

You have to judge yourself and watch yourself carefully. A mindful and careful monk will always live happily.
