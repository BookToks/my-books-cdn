Work hard, holy person! Stop wanting things and give up chasing after pleasures. Understand that everything that depends on something else will end or change. Become, holy person, someone who knows the unchanging truth (Nibbana)!

When a holy person masters two important paths—deep meditation and clear understanding—they see the truth and all their attachments disappear.

I call a holy person someone who doesn’t hold on to this world or the next, or even both. They are free from worries and completely free inside.
