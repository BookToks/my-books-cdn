The man who is without blind faith, who knows the Uncreate, who has severed all links, destroyed all causes (for karma, good and evil), and thrown out all desires – he, truly, is the most excellent of men.11 98. Inspiring, indeed, is that place where Arahats dwell, be it a village, a forest, a vale, or a hill.
 
 99. Inspiring are the forests in which worldlings find no pleasure. There the passionless will rejoice, for they seek no sensual pleasures.
 
 ___________________________ 11 In the Pali this verse presents a series of puns, and if the “underside” of each pun were to be translated, the verse would read thus: “The man who is faithless, ungrateful, a burglar, who destroys opportunities and eats vomit – he truly is the most excellent of men.” 38 Chapter 8 The Thousands 100.
