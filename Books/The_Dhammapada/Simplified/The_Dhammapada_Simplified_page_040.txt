A person who doesn’t just believe things blindly, who understands what is beyond creation, who has cut all ties, ended all causes of good and bad actions, and given up all desires – that person is truly the best kind of person.

It’s really inspiring to be in places where Arahats live, whether it’s a village, a forest, a valley, or a hill.

Forests where regular people don’t find fun are inspiring too. Those who have no strong desires feel happy there because they don’t look for fun in physical pleasures.
