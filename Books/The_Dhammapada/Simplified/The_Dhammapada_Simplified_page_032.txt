Who can beat this world, the place where Yama rules, and where both people and gods live? Who can finish the wise path perfectly, like a skilled garland-maker arranging flowers?

A person trying hard on this path can beat this world, Yamaâ€™s realm, and the place of men and gods. This person will make the wise path perfect, just like an expert who carefully makes a beautiful flower garland.

Understanding that the body is like foam, seeing through its fake nature, and stopping the arrows of desire from Mara, go beyond the sight of the King of Death!

Just like a big flood destroys a sleeping village, death takes away the person whose mind is distracted and only chases after pleasures.

The Destroyer controls the person with a distracted mind who always wants more and only goes after pleasures.
