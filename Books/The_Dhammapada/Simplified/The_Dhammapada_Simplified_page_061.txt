There has never been, and never will be, a person who is completely to blame or completely praised.

But the person that wise people admire, after watching them carefully every day, is someone with perfect character, wisdom, knowledge, and good qualities.

Who could blame someone like that? They are as valuable as pure gold. Even the gods and Brahma praise them.

A person should keep control over their body and not get angry or upset in their actions.

They should stop bad behavior and choose to do good things with their body.

A person should also control their words and not speak angrily.

They should stop saying bad things and practice speaking kindly.

A person should control their thoughts and not think in a harmful or angry way.

They should stop bad thoughts and practice good, positive thinking.

Wise people control their actions, speech, and thoughts. They are truly in control of themselves.
