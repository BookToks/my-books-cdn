A truly good and wise person doesn’t do wrong, not for themselves or for anyone else. They don’t want kids, money, or a kingdom, and they don’t try to succeed in unfair ways.

Only a few people manage to reach the far side of the river. Most people just stay near the shore, going back and forth.

But those who live by the true teachings can cross the hard-to-cross river of death.

Leaving behind the dark path, a smart person should follow the bright path. After leaving home and all attachments, they should want the happiness that comes from being free from things, even though it’s hard to feel.

By giving up pleasures and not holding on to anything, a wise person cleans their mind from bad habits.

People whose minds are fully awake and who have stopped wanting more, feeling happy without clinging to things, and free from bad habits, have reached Nibbana while still alive.
