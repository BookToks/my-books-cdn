A liar ends up in a bad place after death. Also, someone who does wrong but says, “I didn’t do it,” faces the same fate. People who do bad things both share the same destiny when they die.

There are many bad people who wear the saffron robe. These wicked monks will be born in unhappy places because of their bad actions.

It would be better to swallow a hot iron ball, burning like fire, than to be a bad and uncontrolled monk who takes food from others without respect.

Four bad things happen to a careless man who is with another person’s wife: he gets bad karma, loses sleep, gets a bad reputation, and is reborn in a terrible place.

Such a man gets bad karma and an unhappy rebirth. The short happiness he and the woman feel is scary, and the king punishes them heavily. So, no one should be with another person’s wife.

Just like kusa grass can cut your hand if you handle it wrong, living a bad life as a monk leads to a bad fate.

Any careless action, any wrong religious practice, or any life that breaks celibacy rules doesn’t bring good results.
