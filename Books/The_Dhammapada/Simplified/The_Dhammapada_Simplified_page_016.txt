In its own way, this teaching works well for people whose spiritual abilities aren’t fully grown yet and need more time to develop through many lives. But if you look closer, you’ll see that all kinds of existence in samsara, even the highest heavenly places, don’t have real value. They don’t last forever and don’t have a solid foundation. Because of this, if someone holds on tightly to them, it can cause suffering.

A student with more mature understanding, who has learned from past experiences, doesn’t even want to be born again in the gods’ world. They realize that everything that depends on conditions is not enough. Their main goal is to escape the endless cycle of birth and death. This is the ultimate aim the Buddha points to, both as the goal for those who are ready and the long-term hope for those who still need to grow: Nibbana, the Deathless, a state where there is no more birth, aging, death, or suffering.

The third level of teaching in the Dhammapada explains the ideas and practices that come from wanting this final freedom. The ideas come from the Four Noble Truths, which the Buddha first taught in his first sermon and talked about a lot. All schools of Buddhism use these truths as their base. The four truths focus on suffering (dukkha), which means not just pain or sadness, but the general feeling that nothing that depends on conditions is truly satisfying.

The first truth explains the different types of suffering – being born, getting old, being sick, dying, the pain of meeting bad situations, the hurt of losing good things, and the suffering of not getting what you want.
