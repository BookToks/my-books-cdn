How can you find the path to the Buddha who has no limits and can’t be caught, whose victory can’t be taken away, and who is never chased by bad feelings?

How can you find the path to that Buddha who has no limits and no longer has the craving that keeps us stuck in life?

People who love meditation and enjoy living simply and peacefully—these mindful ones, called Supreme Buddhas, are even loved by the gods.

It’s really hard to be born as a human; life is tough for all people. It’s also hard to get the chance to hear the great truth and even harder to meet Buddhas.

The Buddhas teach us to stay away from evil, do good things, and keep our minds pure.

Being patient is the greatest strength. The Buddhas say, “Nibbana (peace) is the best.” A true monk doesn’t hurt others, and a true person who gives up worldly things doesn’t bully anyone.

Not looking down on others, not hurting anyone, following the monk’s rules, eating just enough, living alone, and focusing on meditation—this is what the Buddhas teach.
