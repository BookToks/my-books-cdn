The work is part of the Khuddaka Nikaya (“Minor Collection”) in the Sutta Pitaka, but it has become much more popular than just a small part of the scriptures. It is now known as a famous religious classic around the world. Written in the old Pali language, this short collection of verses sums up the Buddha’s teachings perfectly. It includes all the important ideas that are explained in detail in the many volumes of the Pali Canon.

According to the Theravada Buddhist tradition, each verse in the Dhammapada was first spoken by the Buddha during a specific event. Stories about these events and explanations of the verses are kept in a classic commentary made by the scholar Bhadantacariya Buddhaghosa in the fifth century C.E. This commentary is based on very old material. But the meaning of the verses goes beyond their original situations. They speak to many different kinds of people in all kinds of life situations.

For people who want simple advice, the Dhammapada is like a kind helper. For those who think a lot and feel overwhelmed, its clear and direct lessons bring humility and thoughtfulness. For serious learners, it is a never-ending source of inspiration and practical guidance.
