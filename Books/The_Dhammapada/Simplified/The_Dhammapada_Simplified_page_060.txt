You should let go of anger, stop being proud, and break free from all things that hold you back. People who don’t get attached to their thoughts or bodies don’t suffer.

222. Someone who controls their anger like a driver controls a fast chariot is a real master. Others just hold the reins without control.

223. Beat anger with calmness; beat bad behavior with kindness; beat greed with sharing; beat lies with truth.

224. Always tell the truth; don’t give in to anger; and when asked, give even if you don’t have much. These three things can bring you closer to the gods.

225. Wise people who don’t hurt others and always control their actions reach a place where they never die and never feel sad again.

226. Those who stay alert, control themselves all the time, and focus on ending suffering will see their bad habits disappear.

227. Hey Atula! This isn’t something new; it’s been done for a long time. People always find something to blame—those who stay quiet, those who talk too much, or those who talk just right. Nobody escapes being blamed.
