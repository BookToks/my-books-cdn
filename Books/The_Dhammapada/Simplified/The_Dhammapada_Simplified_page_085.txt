A person who thinks deeply, stays pure, is calm, has finished their important work, and is free from bad habits – that person is what I call a holy man.

The sun shines during the day, and the moon shines at night.

A warrior shines in their armor, a holy person shines in their meditation. But the Buddha shines brightly all day and all night.

Because someone has given up doing wrong, they are called a holy person. Because they behave peacefully, they are called a recluse. And because they have let go of their impurities, they are called a renunciate.

You should never hit a holy person, and if a holy person is hit, they should not get angry. It’s shameful to hit a holy person and even worse to get angry when hit.

Nothing is better for a holy person than controlling their mind and staying away from things they like too much. The more they stop wanting to hurt others, the more their suffering goes away.

A holy person is someone who does no harm with their actions, words, or thoughts, and who controls all three.

Just like a brahmin priest respects his sacred fire, we should deeply respect the person who has taught us the Buddha’s teachings.

You don’t become a holy person because of messy hair, family background, or birth. You become holy when you live with truth and goodness – that’s when you are pure and holy.
