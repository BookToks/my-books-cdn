The fourth and last stage is called the Arahat, or the Perfected One. This is a wise person who has finished the spiritual path, gotten rid of all bad habits, and freed themselves from being reborn again and again. In early Buddhism, the Arahat is the best example and hero. In the Dhammapada, they are praised in Chapter 7 by their own name and in Chapter 26 as a “holy man.” The Arahat shows that it’s possible to be free from greed, hate, and confusion. They live in peace and prove that you can overcome suffering and reach Nibbana, or true freedom, while still alive.

The best example of an Arahat is the Buddha. He found the ancient path to freedom on his own and taught it to many people. Because he came into the world, we have the chance to learn and practice the great Dhamma.

The Buddha gives refuge and is the greatest teacher. He relies only on his own wisdom. Even though he was born a human, his Perfect Enlightenment makes him much greater than an ordinary person. We can’t fully understand him with our usual ideas because he is beyond the world, knows everything, and is not affected by anything bad.

The Buddha shines with the light of wisdom. He shows us that humans can become perfect. He completes the Dhammapada’s picture of the perfect person, the Arahat.
