When someone spends time on things they shouldn’t and doesn’t try hard where it matters, they just want fun and forget what’s really good for them. Then they get jealous of people who care about what’s really important.

Don’t get too close to people you love or hate, because not seeing someone you love or having to see someone you don’t like both hurt.

So, don’t get too attached to anyone or anything, because losing what you care about is painful. If you don’t have anyone or anything you love or hate, nothing can really hurt you.

When you care too much, it causes sadness and fear. But if you don’t care too much, you won’t feel sad or scared.

The same goes for affection and attachment—both can cause pain and fear. If you’re free from these feelings, you won’t have grief or fear.

Lust and craving also bring pain and fear. If you can let go of craving, you won’t feel sad or scared.

So, letting go of desires and attachments helps you avoid grief and fear.
