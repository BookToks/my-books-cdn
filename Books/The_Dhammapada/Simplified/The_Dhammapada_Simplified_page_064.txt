It's easy to see other people's mistakes, but hard to notice your own. Like when you separate wheat from chaff, people pick out faults in others but hide their own, just like a clever hunter hides behind fake branches.

Someone who always looks for other people's faults and criticizes them will only make their own problems worse. They won't be able to get rid of these problems.

There is no path in the sky, and no holy person outside the Buddha's teachings. People like to enjoy worldly things, but Buddhas are free from these worldly desires.

There is no path in the sky, and no holy person outside the Buddha's teachings. Nothing that is made lasts forever, and Buddhas do not change or become unstable.
