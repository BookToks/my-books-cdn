Just like a trader with a small group of guards and a lot of money would avoid a dangerous path, or like someone who wants to live would stay away from poison, people should stay away from doing bad things.

If you don’t have a wound, you can even hold poison without it hurting you. Poison doesn’t harm someone who is not hurt. For someone who does no bad things, nothing bad will happen to them.

If you throw dust against the wind, it blows back at you. In the same way, bad actions come back to the person who does wrong to someone innocent and pure.

Some people are born naturally, bad people come from a bad place, good people go to heaven, and those who are completely pure reach Nibbana (a peaceful state).

You can’t hide anywhere in the sky, the middle of the ocean, or inside mountains to escape the results of doing bad things.

No matter where you go—sky, ocean, or mountains—you can’t escape death.
