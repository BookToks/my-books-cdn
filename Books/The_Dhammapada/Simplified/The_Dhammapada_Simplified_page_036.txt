Doing something well means you don’t regret it later, and it makes you happy to see the good results.

69. Before a bad action causes trouble, a fool thinks it’s as sweet as honey. But when the bad results come, the fool suffers.

70. Even if a fool eats very little every month, he is still worth much less than someone who truly understands the Truth.

71. A bad action doesn’t cause problems right away, like milk that doesn’t spoil fast. But it quietly follows the fool like a fire hidden under ashes.
