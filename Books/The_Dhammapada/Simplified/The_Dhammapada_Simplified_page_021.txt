The four levels of teaching we just talked about help us understand the different ideas in the Dhammapada about Buddhist beliefs and its practical advice. Along with the verses about these four levels, there are many other verses that apply to everyone. Together, these verses show us the basic way early Buddhism sees the world.

The most important idea is that everything is always changing, not staying the same. The universe is like a huge river that never stops flowing, carrying everything with it—tiny dust particles, huge mountains, gods, people, animals, and countless worlds. No one made this process, and there isn’t a god controlling everything to reach a big goal. The universe has no beginning, and it keeps moving through different stages, following a law of things coming into being, changing, and disappearing.

But the Dhammapada doesn’t focus on the outside world. It focuses on people—their wants, their pain, and their complicated lives. People are always trying to rise above their problems. The starting point is what it means to be human, and a big part of this is the constant struggle between opposite things in life.

People want to be happy but are afraid of pain, losing things, and death. They try to balance between right and wrong, pure and dirty, getting better and getting worse. Their choices happen between these opposites, and since they can’t avoid making decisions, they have to take full responsibility for what they do.
