A person doesn’t become a real monk just by shaving their head if they are lazy and lie a lot. How can someone full of wants and greed be a monk?

A true monk is someone who completely controls all kinds of bad behavior, both big and small, because they have beaten all evil.

Living off others’ charity doesn’t make someone a monk. Just looking like a monk on the outside doesn’t make you a true monk.

Anyone who lives a pure life, going beyond good and bad, and understands the world clearly, is truly a monk.

Being quiet doesn’t make someone wise if they are still foolish and don’t understand. A wise person is like someone holding a scale who only accepts what is good.

A wise person rejects bad things and that’s why they are truly wise.

Because they understand both this world and the next, they are called wise.

Someone isn’t noble if they hurt living things. They are noble because they don’t harm any living being.

You shouldn’t be satisfied just by following rules, learning a lot, being deeply focused, living alone, or thinking “I feel the joy of giving up the world, which others don’t.” Keep working hard until all your inner problems are completely destroyed (this is called Arahatship).
