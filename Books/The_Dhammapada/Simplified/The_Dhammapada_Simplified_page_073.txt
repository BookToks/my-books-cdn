If you want to do something, do it with energy and focus. Being lazy only makes your bad feelings worse.

Doing something bad is better left undone because it will bother you later. But doing something good is better because you won’t regret it afterward.

Just like a city has guards inside and outside to keep it safe, you should protect yourself. Don’t miss the chance to grow and improve.

People who miss this chance feel really sad later, especially if they end up in a bad place.

Those who feel ashamed for no good reason, and don’t feel ashamed when they should, believe wrong things and end up in unhappy places.

People who are scared of things that aren’t scary, and not scared of things that are, believe wrong things and suffer.

Those who think there is bad where there isn’t, and don’t see bad where it really is, believe wrong things and have a hard time.

But those who know what’s right and wrong, and believe in the right things, go to happy places.
