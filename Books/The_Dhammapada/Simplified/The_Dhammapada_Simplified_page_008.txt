When he was twenty-nine, he left the royal city and went into the forest to live a simple life. He was determined to find a way to end suffering. For six years, he tried different kinds of meditation and tough self-discipline, but none of these helped him reach his goal.

Then, when he was thirty-five, while sitting deeply meditating under a tree in Gaya, he reached Supreme Enlightenment and became the Buddha, which means the Enlightened One. After that, for forty-five years, he traveled across northern India, sharing what he had learned and starting a group of monks and nuns to keep spreading his message. When he was eighty, after a long and meaningful life, he died peacefully in a small town called Kusinara, surrounded by many followers.

To his followers, the Buddha is not a god, a divine being, or a prophet with a message from a god. He was a human who, through his own effort and smart thinking, reached the highest spiritual level possible—complete wisdom, full enlightenment, and a perfectly pure mind. His role was as a teacher—a world teacher who, out of kindness, showed others the way to Nibbana (also called Nirvana), which means final freedom from suffering.

His teaching, called the Dhamma, gives clear instructions about the true nature of life and shows the path to freedom. The Dhamma is not based on blind faith or mysterious claims but on the Buddha’s clear understanding of reality. It helps anyone who follows it to reach the same understanding—the knowledge that removes the causes of suffering.
