We are truly happy when we live kindly, even around people who are not nice.

Even when people are mean, we can live without hate in our hearts.

We are happy when we stay calm around people who want more and more. Even if others are greedy, we don’t have to be.

We are happy when we don’t own anything.

We feed on joy, shining bright like gods.

Winning causes enemies, and losing brings pain.

Peaceful people are happy because they don’t care about winning or losing.

Nothing burns like desire, and nothing is worse than hate.

The worst suffering comes from being stuck in life’s struggles, and the greatest happiness is finding peace like Nibbana.

Hunger is the worst sickness. Knowing this truth, wise people find Nibbana, the highest happiness.
