Just like a storm can’t beat a strong mountain, Mara can’t beat someone who spends time thinking about their flaws, controls their desires, eats in moderation, and has strong faith and effort.

If someone is bad, doesn’t control themselves, and isn’t honest but still wears a monk’s yellow robe, they don’t deserve it.

But if someone is free from bad habits, lives with good qualities, controls themselves, and is honest, then they truly deserve the yellow robe.

People who mix up what’s important and what’s not, and keep having wrong thoughts, will never reach what really matters.

Those who understand what’s truly important and what isn’t, and think the right way, will reach what really matters.

Just like rain leaks through a badly made roof, strong feelings can get into a mind that isn’t strong or prepared.
