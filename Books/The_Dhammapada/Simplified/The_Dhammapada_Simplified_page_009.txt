The title “Dhammapada” means parts or sections of the Dhamma, which is the Buddha’s teaching. It is called this because its twenty-six chapters cover many different parts of what the Buddha taught, giving different ways to understand the main ideas.

The longer talks of the Buddha in the Buddhist scriptures usually follow a clear order, explaining the teaching step by step. But the Dhammapada does not have this kind of order. It is just a collection of inspiring or teaching verses about the basics of the Dhamma, meant to help people learn and grow.

In some chapters, several verses might have been said by the Buddha at the same time, so they connect and develop one idea together. But mostly, the chapters group verses by a common topic. The chapter titles help organize the different poems by their subject. Sometimes, like in chapters 4 and 23, the title might be a symbol instead of a direct teaching point.

There doesn’t seem to be a plan for the order of the chapters, but sometimes you can see a loose connection between them.

All of the Buddha’s teachings fit together into one complete system. This system is united by its goal: to help people end suffering and find true freedom.
