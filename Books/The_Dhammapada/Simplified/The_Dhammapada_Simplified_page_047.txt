When the world is burning, why are people laughing and celebrating? When everything seems dark, won’t you try to see the light?

Look at this body – it’s just a painted image, full of sores and pain, always wanting more – nothing about it lasts or stays the same!

This body is worn out, full of sickness, and very weak. It will break down because death ends life.

These white bones are like empty pumpkins scattered on the ground in autumn. After seeing this, how can anyone feel happy?

This body is like a city made of bones, covered with flesh and blood; inside, there is decay, death, pride, and jealousy.

Even fancy royal chariots get old and worn out, and this body does too. But the truth of goodness never gets old; that’s why good people share it with others.

A person with little knowledge gets old like a strong bull. They only get bigger, but their wisdom doesn’t grow.

I have been born many times, wandering without purpose, trying to find the builder of this life. Being born again and again is true suffering!
