You are like a dry, fallen leaf now; death is coming for you. You are about to leave this life, but you haven’t prepared for your journey!

Make a safe place for yourself! Work hard and become wise! Clean yourself from all bad things, and you will enter the special home of the Noble Ones.

Your life is ending now; you are going to meet Yama, the king of death. There is no rest on the way, but you still haven’t prepared for the trip!

Make a safe place for yourself! Work hard and become wise! Clean yourself from all bad things, and you will not be born again to suffer and die.

Little by little, every moment, a wise person should clean away their own faults, like a smith removes dirt from silver.

Just like rust slowly destroys iron, bad actions lead people to unhappy places.

Not repeating what you learn hurts the scriptures; ignoring things hurts a home; being messy hurts how you look; and not paying attention hurts a guard.
