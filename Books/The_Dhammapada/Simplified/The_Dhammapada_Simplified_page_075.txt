Be careful and pay attention! Protect your thoughts! Pull yourself out of bad situations, just like an elephant pulls itself out of mud.

If you find a wise and smart friend who lives a good life, do your best to spend time with them happily and carefully.

But if you can’t find a friend like that, then like a king leaving a conquered kingdom or a lone elephant in the forest, you should go your own way alone.

It’s better to be alone than to hang out with a fool. Live by yourself, don’t do bad things, and be free like an elephant in the forest.

Friends are helpful when you need them; being happy with what you have is good; doing good deeds at the end of life is good; and stopping all suffering is the best.

In life, it’s good to take care of your mom and dad, to help monks, and to respect holy people.

Being good until you die is important, having strong faith is good, gaining wisdom is good, and avoiding bad actions is good too.
