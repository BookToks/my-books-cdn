A holy person is someone who stays calm and doesn’t get angry even when they are treated badly, hit, or punished. Their real strength is being patient.

A holy person is also someone who doesn’t get angry, is kind, doesn’t want too much, controls themselves, and accepts their body as it is.

Like water that slides off a lotus leaf or a tiny seed that doesn’t stick to a sharp needle, a holy person doesn’t hold on to pleasure.

A holy person is someone who, in this life, understands how to stop suffering, has let go of heavy burdens, and feels free.

A holy person knows a lot, is wise, can tell what is right or wrong, and has reached the highest goal.

A holy person stays away from both regular people and monks, moves around without a home, and doesn’t want much.

A holy person has given up hurting any living thing, big or small, and doesn’t kill or make others kill.

A holy person is friendly even when others are mean, peaceful when there is violence, and doesn’t get caught up in attachments.

A holy person has let go of lust, hate, pride, and fake behavior, just like a tiny seed falling off a sharp needle.
