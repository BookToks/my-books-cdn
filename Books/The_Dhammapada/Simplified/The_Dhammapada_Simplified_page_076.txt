Wanting things all the time, without thinking, grows like a vine that spreads everywhere. Like a monkey jumping from tree to tree looking for fruit, a person keeps moving from one life to another, trying out the results of their actions.

If someone is stuck in this bad and sticky desire, their problems grow fast, like grass after rain.

But if someone can beat this tough craving, their problems disappear easily, like water sliding off a lotus leaf.

I tell you this: Good luck to everyone here! Find the root of your cravings, like someone searching for the sweet-smelling root of a special grass. Donâ€™t let the bad stuff (Mara) push you down again and again, like a flood crushing a reed.

Just like a tree that grows back if its roots are still strong, suffering will keep coming back until the cravings deep inside are completely removed.

A confused person whose many cravings pull them toward fun and pleasure is like someone caught in a flood of strong feelings that carry them away.
