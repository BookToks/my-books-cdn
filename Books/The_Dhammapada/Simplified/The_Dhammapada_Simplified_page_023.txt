Unlike the Bible, which starts by telling how God created the world, the Dhammapada begins by clearly saying that the mind is the source of everything we are. It shapes our character and creates our future. Buddha’s whole teaching, from basic rules to deep meditation, is about training the mind. A mind that is not controlled can cause more harm than any enemy, but a well-controlled mind can do more good than any friend or family member.

The mind is wild, changeable, and hard to control. But with effort, paying attention, and steady self-discipline, we can tame it. We can avoid getting swept away by strong emotions and find a safe place inside that nothing can destroy. The person who controls their own mind wins a victory that can never be taken away, a victory bigger than any battle won by a great warrior.

The most important thing to train and control the mind is called heedfulness (appamada). Heedfulness means being very aware of yourself and always watching your mind carefully to stop bad thoughts whenever they come up. Since we have no one else to save us, and the way to freedom is by cleaning our mind, heedfulness is key. It helps us stay on the right path and not get distracted by tempting pleasures or lazy habits.

Buddha says heedfulness is the path to life that never ends, while carelessness leads to death. Wise people who understand this stay careful and reach Nibbana, which means “freedom like no other.”

Because the Dhammapada is a great religious book and the main teaching of early Buddhism, you can’t really understand its full value by reading it just once, even if you read it carefully and with respect.
