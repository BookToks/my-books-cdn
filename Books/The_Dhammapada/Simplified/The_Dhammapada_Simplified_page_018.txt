Training in wisdom means focusing your attention on the parts of your mind and body to carefully study and think about what makes them special.

This wisdom grows over time and leads to a deep understanding that cleans and frees the mind completely.

Anyone can follow the path in all its stages, no matter who they are. The Buddha taught both regular people and monks, and many regular people reached high levels of progress. But it works best for those who give up all other distractions and fully commit to spiritual practice, living a “holy life” (brahmacariya).

To keep your behavior pure, and to have steady meditation and deep wisdom, you need to change your lifestyle. You have to avoid things that distract or make you want more, and organize your life around reaching freedom. That’s why the Buddha created the Sangha, a group of monks and nuns, for people ready to dedicate their lives to this path. The Dhammapada often invites people to join this monastic life.

Joining the monastic life means giving up a lot. People who understand that life is temporary and full of hidden suffering leave their families and everyday pleasures behind. They become homeless in a way, living simply and quietly.

They go to peaceful, quiet places, find wise teachers, and follow strict monastic rules. Then they focus all their energy on living a life of meditation.
