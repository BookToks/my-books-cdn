Being unfaithful is a flaw in a woman; being stingy is a flaw in someone who gives. All flaws are bad things, both in this life and the next.

A flaw worse than these is ignorance, the worst of all. Get rid of this flaw and become free from faults, monks!

Life is easy for someone who is shameless, bold like a crow, talks badly about others, is rude, and corrupt.

Life is hard for someone who is modest, always tries to be pure, stays away from bad things, is humble, lives cleanly, and understands well.

Someone who kills, lies, steals, cheats on others, and drinks too much is only hurting themselves even now.

Know this, good person: bad things are hard to control. Don’t let greed and evil make your life long and unhappy.

People give based on their feelings or respect. If you don’t like the food and drink others give, you won’t be able to focus or meditate, day or night.

But if you completely get rid of this unhappiness, you can focus and meditate anytime.

There is no fire like desire; no hold like hate; no trap like confusion; no river like craving.
