The followers of Gotama are always happy when they keep thinking about the good qualities of the Dhamma all day and night.

They are also happy when they remember the good qualities of the Sangha all the time.

Those who pay attention to their bodies and stay mindful are always happy.

People who enjoy practicing kindness and not hurting others all day and night feel happy too.

Those who love meditating every day and night also wake up happily.

Being a monk is hard, and it’s not easy to enjoy it. Life at home can be hard and sad too. Pain comes from being with people who don’t understand you and from being stuck in the cycle of suffering. So, don’t wander aimlessly or look for pain.

Someone who has strong faith, good behavior, a good reputation, and enough wealth is respected everywhere, no matter where they go.

Good people stand out clearly, like the tall Himalaya mountains. But bad people are hidden, like arrows shot in the dark.

A person who spends time alone, sleeps alone, walks alone, works hard, and controls themselves will find happiness in being alone in the forest.
