He who is meditative, stainless and settled, whose work is done and who is free from cankers, having reached the highest goal – him do I call a holy man.
 
 387. The sun shines by day, the moon shines by night.
 
 The warrior shines in armor, the holy man shines in meditation. But the Buddha shines resplendent all day and all night.
 
 388. Because he has discarded evil, he is called a holy man. Because he is serene in conduct, he is called a recluse. And because he has renounced his impurities, he is called a renunciate.
 
 389. One should not strike a holy man, nor should a holy man, when struck, give way to anger. Shame on him who strikes a holy man, and more shame on him who gives way to anger.
 
 390. Nothing is better for a holy man than when he holds his mind back from what is endearing. To the extent the intent to harm wears away, to that extent does suffering subside.
 
 391. He who does no evil in deed, word and thought, who is restrained in these three ways – him do I call a holy man.
 
 392. Just as a brahmin priest reveres his sacrificial fire, even so should one devoutly revere the person from whom one has learned the Dhamma taught by the Buddha.
 
 393. Not by matted hair, nor by lineage, nor by birth does one become a holy man. But he in whom 83 truth and righteousness exist – he is pure, he is a holy man.
