Not by shaven head does a man who is indisciplined and untruthful become a monk. How can he who is full of desire and greed be a monk?
 
 265. He who wholly subdues evil both small and great is called a monk, because he has overcome all evil.
 
 266. He is not a monk just because he lives on others’ alms. Not by adopting outward form does one become a true monk.
 
 267. Whoever here (in the Dispensation) lives a holy life, transcending both merit and demerit, and walks with understanding in this world – he is truly called a monk.
 
 268. Not by observing silence does one become a sage, if he be foolish and ignorant. But that man is wise who, as if holding a balance-scale accepts only the good.
 
 269. The sage (thus) rejecting the evil, is truly a sage.
 
 Since he comprehends both (present and future) worlds, he is called a sage.
 
 270. He is not noble who injures living beings. He is called noble because he is harmless towards all living beings.
 
 271-272. Not by rules and observances, not even by much learning, nor by gain of absorption, nor by a life of seclusion, nor by thinking, “I enjoy the bliss of renunciation, which is not experienced by the worldling” should you, O monks, rest content, until the utter destruction of cankers (Arahatship) is reached.
