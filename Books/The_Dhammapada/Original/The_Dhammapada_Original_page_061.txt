There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a person who is wholly blamed or wholly praised.
 
 229. But the man whom the wise praise, after observing him day after day, is one of flawless character, wise, and endowed with knowledge and virtue.
 
 230. Who can blame such a one, as worthy as a coin of refined gold? Even the gods praise him; by Brahma, too, is he praised.
 
 231. Let a man guard himself against irritability in bodily action; let him be controlled in deed.
 
 Abandoning bodily misconduct, let him practice good conduct in deed.
 
 232. Let a man guard himself against irritability in speech; let him be controlled in speech. Abandoning verbal misconduct, let him practice good conduct in speech.
 
 233. Let a man guard himself against irritability in thought; let him be controlled in mind. Abandoning mental misconduct, let him practice good conduct in thought.
 
 234. The wise are controlled in bodily action, controlled in speech and controlled in thought. They are truly well-controlled.
