Like a withered leaf are you now; deathâ€™s messengers await you. You stand on the eve of your departure, yet you have made no provision for your journey!
 
 236. Make an island for yourself! Strive hard and become wise! Rid of impurities and cleansed of stain, you shall enter the celestial abode of the Noble Ones.
 
 237. Your life has come to an end now; You are setting forth into the presence of Yama, the king of death. No resting place is there for you on the way, yet you have made no provision for the journey!
 
 238. Make an island unto yourself! Strive hard and become wise! Rid of impurities and cleansed of stain, you shall not come again to birth and decay.
 
 239. One by one, little by little, moment by moment, a wise man should remove his own impurities, as a smith removes his dross from silver.
 
 240. Just as rust arising from iron eats away the base from which it arises, even so, their own deeds lead transgressors to states of woe.
 
 241. Non-repetition is the bane of scriptures; neglect is the bane of a home; slovenliness is the bane of personal appearance, and heedlessness is the bane of a guard.
 
 60 242.
