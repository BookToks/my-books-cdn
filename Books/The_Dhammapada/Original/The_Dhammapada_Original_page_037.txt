 77. Let him admonish, instruct and shield one from wrong; he, indeed, is dear to the good and detestable to the evil.
 
 78. Do not associate with evil companions; do not seek the fellowship of the vile. Associate with the good friends; seek the fellowship of noble men.
 
 79. He who drinks deep the Dhamma lives happily with a tranquil mind. The wise man ever delights in the Dhamma made known by the Noble One (the Buddha).
 
 80. Irrigators regulate the rivers; fletchers straighten the arrow shaft; carpenters shape the wood; the wise control themselves.
 
 81. Just as a solid rock is not shaken by the storm, even so the wise are not affected by praise or blame.
 
 82. On hearing the Teachings, the wise become perfectly purified, like a lake deep, clear and still.
 
 83. The good renounce (attachment for) everything.
 
 The virtuous do not prattle with a yearning for pleasures. The wise show no elation or depression when touched by happiness or sorrow.
