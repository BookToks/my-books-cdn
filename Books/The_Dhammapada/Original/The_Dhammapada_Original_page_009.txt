The title “Dhammapada” which the ancient compilers of the Buddhist scriptures attached to our anthology means portions, aspects, or sections of Dhamma. The work has been given this title because, in its twenty-six chapters, it spans the multiple aspects of the Buddha’s teaching, offering a variety of standpoints from which to gain a glimpse into its heart.
 
 Whereas the longer discourses of the Buddha contained in the prose sections of the Canon usually proceed methodically, unfolding according to the sequential structure of the doctrine, the Dhammapada lacks such a systematic arrangement. The work is simply a collection of inspirational or pedagogical verses on the fundamentals of the Dhamma, to be used as a basis for personal edification and instruction. In any given chapter several successive verses may have been spoken by the Buddha on a single occasion, and thus among themselves will exhibit a meaningful development or a set of variations on a theme. But by and large, the logic behind the grouping together of verses into a chapter is merely the concern with a common topic. The twenty-six chapter headings thus function as a kind of rubric for classifying the diverse poetic utterances of the Master, and the reason behind the inclusion of any given verse in a particular chapter is its mention of the subject indicated in the chapter’s heading. In some cases (Chapters 4 and 23) this may be a metaphorical symbol rather than a point of doctrine.
 
 There also seems to be no intentional design in the order of the chapters themselves, though at certain points a loose thread of development can be discerned.
 
 The teachings of the Buddha, viewed in their completeness, all link together into a single perfectly 7 coherent system of thought and practice which gains its unity from its final goal, the attainment of deliverance from suffering.
