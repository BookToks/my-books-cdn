Just as a storm cannot prevail against a rocky mountain, so Mara can never overpower the man who lives meditating on the impurities, who is controlled in his senses, moderate in eating, and filled with faith and earnest effort.2 9. Whoever being depraved, devoid of self-control and truthfulness, should don the monkâ€™s yellow robe, he surely is not worthy of the robe.
 
 10. But whoever is purged of depravity, wellestablished in virtues and filled with self-control and truthfulness, he indeed is worthy of the yellow robe.
 
 11. Those who mistake the unessential to be essential and the essential to be unessential, dwelling in wrong thoughts, never arrive at the essential.
 
 12. Those who know the essential to be essential and the unessential to be unessential, dwelling in right thoughts, do arrive at the essential.
 
 13. Just as rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, so passion penetrates an undeveloped mind.
