I intended it to be the last offering I should make to my fellow-citizens of all nations, and that at a time when the purity of the motive that induced me to it could not admit of a question, even by those who might disapprove the work.
 
 The circumstance that has now taken place in France, of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest, in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
 
 As several of my colleagues, and others of my fellow-citizens of France, have given me the example of making their voluntary and individual profession of faith, I also will make mine; and I do this with all that sincerity and frankness with which the mind of man communicates with itself.
 
 I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
 
 I believe the equality of man, and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellowcreatures happy.
 
 But, lest it should be supposed that I believe many other things in addition to these, I shall, in the progress of this work, declare the things I do not believe, and my reasons for not believing them.
 
 I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the 4 Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of.
