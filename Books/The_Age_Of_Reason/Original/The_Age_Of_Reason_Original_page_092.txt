 • Name: Haggai Years before Christ: (after the year 588) • Name: Zechariah Years before Christ: (after the year 588) • Name: Malachi Years before Christ: (after the year 588) This table is either not very honourable for the Bible historians, or not very honourable for the Bible prophets; and I leave to priests and commentators, who are very learned in little things, to settle the point of etiquette between the two; and to assign a reason, why the authors of Kings and of Chronicles have treated those prophets, whom, in the former part of the Age of Reason, I have considered as poets, with as much degrading silence as any historian of the present day would treat Peter Pindar.
 
 I have one more observation to make on the book of Chronicles; after which I shall pass on to review the remaining books of the Bible.
 
 In my observations on the book of Genesis, I have quoted a passage from xxxvi. 31, which evidently refers to a time, after that kings began to reign over the children of Israel; and I have shewn that as this verse is verbatim the same as in 1 Chronicles i. 43, where it stands consistently with the order of history, which in Genesis it does not, that the verse in Genesis, and a great part of the 36th chapter, have been taken from Chronicles; and that the book of Genesis, though it is placed first in the Bible, and ascribed to Moses, has been manufactured by some unknown 93 person, after the book of Chronicles was written, which was not until at least eight hundred and sixty years after the time of Moses.
