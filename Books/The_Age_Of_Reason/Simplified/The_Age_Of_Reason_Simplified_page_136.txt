People who wrote the Gospels did so long after the apostles lived. These writers were unknown and worried that no one would believe their stories since they didn’t have firsthand knowledge. So, they put the apostles’ names on their writings. These stories are full of silly mistakes and don’t match up with each other at all.

In another part, someone talking to people who believe these books are God’s word says that earlier writers added many things that don’t fit with Jesus’ teachings. This isn’t surprising because those things weren’t written by Jesus or his apostles. Instead, they were mostly based on rumors and stories from people who didn’t really agree with each other. Still, they published these stories under the apostles’ names, making it seem like the apostles made mistakes or lied.

From these quotes, you can see that people back then didn’t believe the New Testament books were real or true. They thought of them as fake stories and lies when these books were first accepted as God’s word. But the church, with the help of force and punishment, stopped people from questioning this. They said miracles happened all the time, and people were told to say they believed, even if they didn’t.

However, since the French Revolution, the church hasn’t been able to perform any miracles. Even with all their saints, they haven’t done a single one since the revolution started. Because the church really needs miracles now, we can guess that all the old miracles were probably tricks or lies.

Also, think about the fact that more than 300 years passed between when Jesus supposedly lived and when the New Testament was put together as a book. Even without looking at history, this long time makes it really uncertain if the New Testament is authentic. The book of Homer, for example, has a better record of who wrote it, even though it’s 1,000 years older than the New Testament.
