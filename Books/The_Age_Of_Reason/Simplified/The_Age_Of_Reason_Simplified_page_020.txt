People often mix up the true Word of God with the many mistakes and problems that come with it in written form.

If we think clearly, we have to understand that the Word of God should never change, no matter what happens. Because of this, the Word of God can’t be in any human language or writing.

Words keep changing meaning, there is no one language everyone speaks, so we have to translate, and translations can have errors. Copyists and printers can make mistakes, and sometimes people might change things on purpose. All this shows that human language, spoken or written, can’t carry the true Word of God. The Word of God is something else.

Even if the Bible was written perfectly, I still wouldn’t trust it completely as the Word of God, because there’s always a chance it could trick me. But when I see that much of the Bible talks about bad behavior and silly stories, I can’t respect my Creator by calling it His Word.
