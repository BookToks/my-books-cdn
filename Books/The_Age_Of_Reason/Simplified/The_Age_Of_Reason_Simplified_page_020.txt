People often get confused between the real Word of God and the mistakes that come with it when it’s written down.

If we think about it, the Word of God should never change, no matter what. That means it can’t be in any human language or writing.

Words change meaning all the time, no one speaks the same language, so we have to translate. Translations can have mistakes. People who copy or print the text can make errors, and sometimes people change things on purpose. This shows that human language, spoken or written, can’t hold the true Word of God. The Word of God is something different.

Even if the Bible was written perfectly, I still wouldn’t fully trust it as the Word of God because it could still trick me. And when I see that a lot of the Bible talks about bad behavior and silly stories, I don’t feel like I’m respecting my Creator by calling it His Word.
