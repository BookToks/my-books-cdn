A priest lived at least 350 years after Moses, as I will explain in this work.

Now, I want to talk about the historical and time-related proof. The timeline I will use comes from the Bible itself. I don’t plan to use anything outside the Bible to prove that Moses did not write the books that are said to be written by him. It’s important to tell readers (especially those who might not know) that in bigger Bibles, and some smaller ones too, there are timelines printed in the margins of each page. These timelines show how long before Christ the events on that page happened, and how much time passed between different events.

I start with the book of Genesis. In Genesis chapter 14, the story is told about Lot being captured during a fight between four kings and five kings. When Abraham heard about Lot being captured, he armed his whole family and went to save Lot. He chased the enemies all the way to a place called Dan (verse 14).

To explain what “chasing them to Dan” means, I’ll give two examples: one from America, and one from France. The city now called New York was once called New Amsterdam. The town in France now called Havre Marat used to be Havre-de-Grace. New Amsterdam became New York in 1664, and Havre-de-Grace became Havre Marat in 1793. So, if you find a writing that mentions New York, but has no date, you know it must have been written after 1664 because before that, the city was called New Amsterdam. The same goes for Havre Marat—it had to be written after 1793.

Now, I’ll use these examples to show that the place called Dan did not exist until many years after Moses died. So, Moses could not have written Genesis, since it talks about chasing enemies to Dan.
