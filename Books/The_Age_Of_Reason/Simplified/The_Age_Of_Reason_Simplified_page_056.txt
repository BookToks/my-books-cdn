Religion is about believing in God and doing what is right, so it shouldn’t be confusing or mysterious. Believing in God is actually one of the easiest things because it comes naturally, like something we need. Doing what is right means acting kindly to others, just like God is kind to everyone. We can’t serve God the same way we serve people who need us; serving God means helping make the world a happier place. This doesn’t happen by hiding away and only thinking about ourselves.

The whole point of religion shows that it shouldn’t be full of mystery or confusing ideas. Religion is something everyone should understand, no matter who they are. People don’t learn religion the way they learn a skill or job secret. Instead, they understand it by thinking carefully about what they see, hear, or read, and then they try to live by it.

Sometimes, people create religious ideas that don’t match what we see in the world or what makes sense. These ideas can be confusing or impossible to understand. To stop people from asking questions, they use the word “mystery.” Because of that, religion, which should be simple, became full of confusing mysteries.

To help with this, “miracles” were added. Mysteries confuse the mind, and miracles confuse the senses. Mysteries are like a secret language, and miracles are like magic tricks.

Before talking more about this, it’s important to think about what a miracle really means. You could say everything is a mystery, and in the same way, everything is a miracle. An elephant isn’t more of a miracle than a tiny bug, and a huge mountain isn’t more of a miracle than a tiny particle. For an all-powerful being, making any one thing or even a whole universe is not harder than making something else.
