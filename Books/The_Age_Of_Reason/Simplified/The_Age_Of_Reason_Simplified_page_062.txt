Summary

I talked about this topic longer than I planned, so now I’ll finish by giving a quick summary.

First, the idea that the word of God exists just as a printed book, writing, or speech doesn’t really make sense. This is because there is no one language everyone understands, languages change over time, translations can have mistakes, the word of God could be completely hidden or changed, or even made up and forced on people.

Second, the world we see around us is the true and always existing word of God. It shows God’s power, wisdom, kindness, and generosity.

Third, our job as humans is to copy God’s kindness and goodness shown in creation and treat all living things well. Since we see God being good to everyone every day, that should inspire us to be good to each other. So, hurting people or animals is wrong and goes against what’s right.

I don’t worry about what happens after we die. I just believe strongly that the power that made me can keep me alive in any way it wants, with or without this body. It seems more likely that I will keep existing after this life than that I existed before I was born.

One thing all people and religions agree on is that there is a God. The differences are in the extra beliefs they add. If one religion ever becomes truly universal, it won’t be about believing new things but about letting go of extra ideas and believing like people did in the beginning. If Adam was a real person, he believed in God simply. But until then, everyone should follow whatever religion or worship they want.
