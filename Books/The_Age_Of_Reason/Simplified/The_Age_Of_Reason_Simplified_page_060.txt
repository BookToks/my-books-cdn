It’s not enough to just know what happened before; we also need to understand what will happen in the future. A so-called prophet is like someone who tries to guess what will happen in history. If they guess something kind of right after a thousand years, people might say they were exactly right. But if they are totally wrong, people just say God changed His mind, like in the story of Jonah and Nineveh. These weird ideas can make people look silly!

Earlier in this writing, it was shown that the original meaning of the words "prophet" and "prophesying" has changed. Today, a prophet is something made up by modern ideas. Because of this change, strange sayings and pictures used by Jewish poets long ago have been turned into prophecies. People who explain these texts make them mean whatever they want. Anything confusing is called a prophecy, and anything unimportant is seen as a symbol. Even a mistake could be called a prophecy, and something as useless as a rag could be a symbol.

If a prophet is supposed to be a person who gets messages from God about the future, then either these people exist or they don’t. If they do, it makes sense that their messages would be clear and easy to understand, not confusing and vague so they could mean almost anything. It’s disrespectful to think God would joke around like this with people. But all the things called prophecies in the Bible are confusing like this.

Prophecy is like miracles. Even if it were real, it wouldn’t help. People hearing a prophecy wouldn’t know if the person was telling the truth, lying, or just guessing. And if the thing they predicted happened, or something like it, there are so many things happening every day that no one could tell if it was really predicted or just a coincidence. So, prophets are useless and not needed. The best way to avoid being tricked is to not believe in stories like this.
