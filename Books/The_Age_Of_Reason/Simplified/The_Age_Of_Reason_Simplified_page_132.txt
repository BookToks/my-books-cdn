The devil argued about his body. If we believe stories like these, we don’t have a good opinion of God.

I have now looked closely at the four books called Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The time from the crucifixion to the ascension was only a few days, maybe three or four, and all the events happened near Jerusalem. I think it’s impossible to find a story with so many obvious mistakes, contradictions, and lies as these books have. There are more than I expected when I started this study, and way more than I thought when I wrote the first part of The Age of Reason. Back then, I didn’t have a Bible or Testament to check, and I couldn’t get one. My life was becoming risky, and I wanted to leave something about this topic, so I had to be quick and short. The quotes I made were from memory, but they are right. What I said in that book comes from a strong and long belief—that the Bible and Testament trick people—that the story of the fall of man, Jesus being God’s Son, dying to calm God’s anger, and salvation through that are all made-up stories that do not respect God’s wisdom and power. The only true religion is deism, which means believing in one God and copying His moral character, or living by moral virtues. That is the only thing I rely on for hope of happiness after life.

So, I say this now—and may God help me.

But back to the topic—It’s impossible to know for sure who wrote those four books, and that alone should make us doubt them. When we doubt, we don’t believe. It’s easy to prove that the people these books say wrote them did not actually write them. The contradictions show two things: First, the writers were not eyewitnesses or people who heard these events because if they were, they wouldn’t have made so many mistakes. So, the books were not written by the apostles, who are supposed to have seen or heard these events.
