The place called Dan in the Bible was originally a town belonging to non-Israelite people, called Laish. When the tribe of Dan took over this town, they changed its name to Dan, to honor their ancestor Dan, who was the father of their tribe and the great-grandson of Abraham.

To prove this, you can look from the book of Genesis to chapter 18 of the Book of Judges. It says (verse 27) that the Danites came to Laish, which was a peaceful and safe place. They attacked the people there with swords, burned the city, and built a new one. In verse 28, it says they lived there, and in verse 29, they named the city Dan after their ancestor. Before that, the city was called Laish.

This story about the Danites taking Laish and renaming it Dan is found in the Book of Judges right after the story of Samson’s death. Samson died around 1120 B.C., and Moses died around 1451 B.C. So, according to this timeline, the place wasn’t called Dan until 331 years after Moses died.

There is a confusing mix-up in the Book of Judges between the historical order and the timeline. The last five chapters (17, 18, 19, 20, 21) actually happen before all the earlier chapters. They are said to happen 28 years before chapter 16, 266 years before chapter 15, 245 years before chapter 13, 195 years before chapter 9, 90 years before chapter 4, and 15 years before chapter 1. This shows that the Bible can be confusing and sometimes unreliable.

If you follow the timeline, the taking of Laish and renaming it Dan happened 20 years after Joshua died. Joshua was Moses’ successor. But if you follow the order in the book, it happened 306 years after Joshua died and 331 years after Moses died. Both ways show that Moses couldn’t have written Genesis because the place called Dan didn’t exist when Moses was alive. So, the person who wrote Genesis must have lived after Laish was renamed Dan. We don’t know who that person was, so Genesis doesn’t have a known author and its authority is uncertain.

Now, I want to talk about another piece of historical and timeline evidence to show, like before, that Moses did not write Genesis.

In Genesis 36, there is a family tree of Esau’s sons and descendants, who were called Edomites. It also lists the kings of Edom by name. In verse 31, it says, "And these...
