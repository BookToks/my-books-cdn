The Psalms were written by different people, not just David. Calling them "David’s Psalms" is wrong because they are a mix of songs from many writers who lived at different times. For example, Psalm 137 couldn’t have been written until more than 400 years after David because it talks about the Jews being captured and taken to Babylon, which happened long after David’s time. It says, "By the rivers of Babylon we sat down; yes, we wept when we remembered Zion. We hung our harps on the willows because those who took us captive asked us to sing songs of Zion." This is like asking someone from America, France, or England to sing their country’s songs.

This example shows how people have been mistaken about who really wrote the Bible. They didn’t pay attention to when, where, or under what circumstances the books were written. Names were often added to books even when it was impossible for those people to have written them—like a man walking in his own funeral!

The Book of Proverbs is also a collection, made up of sayings from people outside the Jewish nation, like I explained when talking about the book of Job. Some proverbs said to be from Solomon didn’t show up until 250 years after he died. It even says in Proverbs 25:1 that these proverbs were copied by the men of Hezekiah, who lived 250 years later. When someone becomes famous, people often credit them with things they never actually said or did. This probably happened with Solomon. Back then, making proverbs was popular, kind of like how people today make joke books and put famous names on them even if those people had nothing to do with them.

The book of Ecclesiastes, or The Preacher, is also linked to Solomon, and maybe for a good reason, even if it’s not completely true. It sounds like the thoughts of a tired, worn-out person who has lived a wild life, like Solomon did. Looking back on things he can’t enjoy anymore, he says, "All is Vanity!" A lot of the meaning is hard to understand now, probably because of translation, but enough remains to show it was very meaningful in the original. From what we know about Solomon’s life, this fits him well.
