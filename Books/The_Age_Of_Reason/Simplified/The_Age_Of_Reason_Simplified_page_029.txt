I’m putting in the 19th Psalm here, as it was turned into English poetry by Addison. I don’t remember the original words, and I can’t check them right now.

The big sky above, with all its blue color,  
And the shining stars, shows us where it all came from.  

The tireless sun, day after day,  
Shows the power of its Creator,  
And tells every place on Earth  
About the work of an all-powerful hand.  

When evening comes, the moon tells the amazing story,  
And every night it shares how it was born;  
All the stars around it,  
And all the planets as they move,  
Help spread this message everywhere,  
From one side of the world to the other.  

Even though everything moves quietly around the dark Earth,  
And there’s no real sound from these shining lights,  
If you use your reason, you’ll understand they are happy,  
And they show us a glorious truth:  
The One who made us is divine.  

What else does a person need to know than that the power who made all this is divine and all-powerful?  
If someone believes this with clear thinking,  
Their way of living will naturally follow.  

The references in the Book of Job have the same goal as this Psalm:  
They try to prove a truth that we wouldn’t know otherwise,  
Using things we already understand.  

I don’t remember enough from Job to quote it exactly,  
But one part fits well here:  
“Can you find God by searching?  
Can you understand the Almighty completely?”
