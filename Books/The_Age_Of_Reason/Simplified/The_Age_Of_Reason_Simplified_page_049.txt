A long time ago, people named six planets, and we still use those names today: Mercury, Venus, Earth (our home), Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. These planets look bigger than stars because they are much closer to Earth than stars are. Venus is called the evening star or the morning star because sometimes you can see it right after sunset or just before sunrise, but never more than three hours away from the Sun.

The Sun is at the center of our solar system. The closest planet to the Sun is Mercury, which is 34 million miles away. It moves around the Sun in a circle, kind of like a spinning top moving in a circle. The second planet is Venus, 57 million miles from the Sun, so it moves in a bigger circle than Mercury. The third planet is Earth, 88 million miles away, moving in a circle larger than Venus's. The fourth planet is Mars, 134 million miles from the Sun, moving in an even bigger circle. The fifth planet is Jupiter, 557 million miles away, moving in a much bigger circle than Mars. The sixth planet is Saturn, 763 million miles from the Sun, moving in the biggest circle that surrounds all the other planets’ orbits.

The space where the planets travel around the Sun is huge. Saturn’s orbit alone is about 1,526 million miles wide, and the total distance around that circle is almost 5,000 million miles. The total space inside this area is almost 3,500 million times 3,500 million square miles. But even this huge space is just one solar system. Far beyond this, there are many stars called fixed stars because they don’t move like the planets do. These fixed stars always stay in the same place and distance from each other, just like our Sun stays at the center of our solar system. It’s likely that each fixed star is also a Sun with its own system of planets around it, but those planets are too far away for us to see.
