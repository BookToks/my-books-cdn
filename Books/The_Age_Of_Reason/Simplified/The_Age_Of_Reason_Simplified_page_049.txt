A long time ago, people gave names to six planets, and we still use those names today: Mercury, Venus, Earth (our world), Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. These planets look bigger than stars because they are much closer to Earth than the stars are. Venus is called the evening star or the morning star because sometimes it appears after sunset or before sunrise, never more than three hours away from the Sun.

The Sun is at the center of our solar system. The closest planet to the Sun is Mercury, which is 34 million miles away. It moves around the Sun in a circle, kind of like a spinning top moving in a circle. The second planet is Venus, 57 million miles from the Sun, so it moves in a bigger circle than Mercury. The third planet is Earth, 88 million miles away, moving in a circle larger than Venus's. The fourth planet is Mars, 134 million miles from the Sun, moving in an even bigger circle. The fifth planet is Jupiter, 557 million miles away, moving in a much bigger circle than Mars. The sixth planet is Saturn, 763 million miles from the Sun, moving in the biggest circle that surrounds all the other planets’ orbits.

The whole space that the planets travel in around the Sun is huge. The diameter of Saturn’s orbit alone is about 1,526 million miles, and the total distance around that circle is nearly 5,000 million miles. The total volume of this space is almost 3,500 million times 3,500 million square miles. But even this huge area is just one solar system. Far beyond this, there are many stars called fixed stars because they don’t move like the planets do. These fixed stars always stay in the same place and distance from each other, just like our Sun stays at the center of our solar system. It’s likely that each fixed star is also a Sun with its own system of planets around it, though those planets are too far away to see.
