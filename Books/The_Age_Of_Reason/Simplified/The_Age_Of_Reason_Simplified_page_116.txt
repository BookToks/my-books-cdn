They decided to follow the choice made by the lot and prayed to God, saying, "Please, Lord, don’t let us die because of this man’s life, and don’t make us guilty of innocent blood. You, Lord, have done what you wanted." This means they didn’t think Jonah was guilty since he might be innocent, but they believed the lot was God’s will. Their prayer shows that these people believed in one God and were not idol worshippers, like some Jews said.

But the storm kept getting worse, so they decided to throw Jonah into the sea. According to the story, a huge fish swallowed him whole and alive!

Now Jonah is safe inside the fish during the storm. The story says he prayed, but the prayer is made up from different parts of the Psalms, mixed together without making much sense for his situation. It seems like someone who knew a little about the Psalms just copied it for Jonah. This makes it clear the story might not be true. The prayer is said to have worked, and then the story says, "The Lord told the fish to spit Jonah out onto dry land."

Jonah got a second chance to go to Nineveh, and he started his mission as a preacher. You would think that after all he went through, he would be kind and caring. But instead, he came into the city yelling, "In forty days, Nineveh will be destroyed!"

At the end of his mission, Jonah shows a mean and angry attitude. The story says he moved to the east side of the city — but not to think about God’s mercy or to be thankful. Instead, he was waiting, angry and hoping Nineveh would be destroyed.

But the people of Nineveh changed their ways, and God, as the story says, decided not to bring the disaster he had planned.
