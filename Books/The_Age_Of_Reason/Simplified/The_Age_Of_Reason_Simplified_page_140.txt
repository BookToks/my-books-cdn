People who teach a certain idea often don’t give good reasons to support it. They usually go to extremes in what they do and what they believe.

The idea this person tries to prove is that the same body comes back to life after death. He says this shows that people live forever. But people think in different ways and come to different conclusions from the same facts. So, the idea that the same body rises again doesn’t really prove we live forever. To me, it actually suggests the opposite. If I die in this body and then come back in the same body, it means I will probably die again. This kind of coming back doesn’t stop death from happening again, like how getting over a fever doesn’t stop you from getting sick again. So, to believe in living forever, I need a better idea than just rising in the same body.

Also, if I had a choice, I would rather have a better body or a different form than the one I have now. Every animal is better than us at something. Small insects can fly farther and easier than we can run. Tiny fish swim with way more grace and don’t get tired. Even slow snails can climb places where people would die. Spiders can jump from high places just for fun. Our bodies are heavy and limited, so it’s hard to believe Paul’s idea is true. It’s too small and not grand enough for such a big topic.

But putting all other ideas aside, the only thing we can really think of when we imagine another life is being aware that we exist. This awareness is what living forever means. Being aware that we exist doesn’t have to happen in the same body or with the same matter, even in this life.

Our bodies now are not made of the same stuff they were 20 or 30 years ago, but we still know we are the same person. Even if we lose arms or legs, which are a big part of our body, we still know we exist. If those parts were replaced by wings or something else, it wouldn’t change our awareness of being alive. In short, we don’t really know how much or how little of our...
