Jonah was really upset and angry because his prediction didn’t come true. He wanted the whole city of Nineveh to be destroyed, with everyone, young and old, wiped out.

To show more about Jonah’s character, a plant called a gourd grew quickly overnight to give him shade from the hot sun where he was resting. But the next morning, it died.

Jonah got even angrier and said he’d rather die than live. Then God talked to Jonah and asked, “Is it right to be angry about the gourd?” Jonah said he was angry enough to die. God reminded him that he didn’t even take care of the gourd, which grew and died in one night. So, shouldn’t God care about Nineveh, a huge city with more than 60,000 people who don’t even know right from left?

This story is meant to criticize all Bible prophets and the harsh punishments they call for. It points out how unfair it is to judge everyone, including innocent kids, like in stories about Noah’s flood and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. It also questions the idea that God favors one nation over others.

The story teaches a lesson too: when someone predicts something bad, they often want it to happen. Being proud of their prediction can make them hard-hearted, whether it comes true or not. The book of Jonah ends with a strong message against prophets, predictions, and unfair judgments.

This is similar to how Benjamin Franklin’s chapter about Abraham and the stranger criticized religious intolerance. I’ve already talked about the poetic parts of the Bible and how “prophet” basically means poet, with lots of wild images and metaphors.
