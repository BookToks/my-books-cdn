Nehemiah also gives a list of the families who came back, along with the number of people in each family. He starts like Ezra did, saying (vii. 8): "The children of Parosh, two thousand three hundred and seventy-two," and keeps listing all the families. (This list is a little different from Ezra’s list.)

In verse 66, Nehemiah adds up the total and says, just like Ezra did, "The whole group was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty." But if you add up the numbers, the total is only 31,089, which means there’s a mistake of 11,271. These writers might be good at making Bible stories, but not so good when you need exact facts.

The next book is Esther. If Queen Esther thought it was cool to be a royal mistress to King Ahasuerus, or to compete with Queen Vashti—who refused to show up to a wild party with a drunk king and his guests (they had been drinking for seven days and having fun)—then that’s up to Esther and Mordecai. It’s not my business, at least. Also, the story seems kind of made up and we don’t even know who wrote it. So, I’ll move on to the book of Job.

The book of Job is very different from the other books we talked about. There’s no betrayal or murder. It’s about a person thinking deeply about the ups and downs of life, sometimes feeling crushed but also fighting back. The book is written in a dramatic way, showing someone who tries to accept his fate but also struggles with being upset. Job isn’t very patient; he often feels angry, but he tries to control his feelings and decides to force himself to be okay even when bad things keep happening.

I’ve talked respectfully about the book of Job before, but now I’ve learned more. From all the evidence, the book of Job is not really part of the Bible.

I’ve read what two Hebrew experts, Abenezra and Spinoza, say. They think the book of Job doesn’t feel like a Hebrew book. The style and story don’t seem Hebrew. They believe it was translated from another language into Hebrew and that the author wasn’t Jewish. The character called Satan shows up here for the first and only time in the Bible.
