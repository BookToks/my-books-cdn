The church works with the government and becomes part of the system. This is why church and state are connected, even though the church is about people and the state is often controlling.

If someone really believed in God, their moral choices would be guided by that belief. They would respect God and themselves and wouldn’t do anything they couldn’t hide from either. For this belief to be strong, it has to work on its own. This idea is called deism.

But in Christian beliefs, God is shown in strange ways, like part of God being a dying man and another part called the Holy Ghost being a flying dove. Because of these weird ideas, it’s hard for people to truly believe. The Christian church, like many religions, keeps people from really understanding God, just like governments keep people from knowing their rights. Both religion and government systems are false and support each other. Christian theology isn’t a real science because it has no solid principles, no real proof, and no clear conclusions.

Instead of studying theology based on the Bible and other books that people argue about and question, we should look at the Bible of creation—nature itself. The rules we find there are eternal and come from God. These rules are the base for all science and should also be the base for theology.

We can only understand God by looking at his work in the world. We can’t understand any part of God unless we follow the rules that show us how he works.

We only have a blurry idea of God’s power if we don’t understand how huge it really is. We can’t know his wisdom unless we see the order and way it works.
