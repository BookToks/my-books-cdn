People have twisted the meaning of the Bible, forcing ideas into it that just don’t fit. At the start of every chapter and page, you see the names of Christ and the Church, so readers might believe the message without thinking too much.

For example, the phrase "Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son" (Isaiah 7:14) has been taken to mean Jesus and his mother Mary. This idea has been repeated all over the Christian world for more than a thousand years. Because of this belief, many terrible things have happened, including violence and suffering. I’m not trying to argue about this belief here. Instead, I want to show that the Bible isn’t reliable, and if we do that, we can break down all the superstitions built on it. But first, I’ll explain why this passage is misunderstood.

It doesn’t matter if Isaiah was tricking King Ahaz of Judah—that’s not my point. What matters is that this verse doesn’t talk about Jesus or Mary any more than it talks about me and my mom. The real story is this: The kings of Syria and Israel (the Jews were split into two groups: Judah with Jerusalem as its capital, and Israel) teamed up to fight against King Ahaz of Judah. Ahaz and his people were very scared, and the Bible says their hearts shook like trees in the wind (Isaiah 7:2).

In this scary situation, Isaiah talks to Ahaz and tells him, in God’s name, that these two kings will not win. To prove this, Isaiah tells Ahaz to ask for a sign. Ahaz says no because he doesn’t want to test God. So Isaiah says in verse 14, “The Lord himself will give you a sign: a virgin will have a son,” and in verse 16, “Before this child can tell right from wrong, the land you fear (Syria and Israel) will be abandoned by its kings.” This was the sign and the time to trust the promise: before the child grows up enough to choose right from wrong, the threat will be gone.

Isaiah had to say this to avoid being called a false prophet, so he made this prediction to show the promise would come true.
