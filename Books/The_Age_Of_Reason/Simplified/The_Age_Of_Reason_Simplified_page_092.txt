This table doesn’t look very good for Bible historians or prophets. I’ll let the priests and experts, who know a lot about small details, figure out why the writers of Kings and Chronicles ignored these prophets. They also need to explain why these prophets, who I once thought of as poets, were treated so badly—like how a modern writer might ignore someone like Peter Pindar.  

I have one more thing to say about the book of Chronicles, then I’ll move on to talk about the other books of the Bible.  

When I looked at the book of Genesis, I found a part in chapter 36, verse 31, that clearly talks about a time after kings ruled Israel. I showed that this verse is exactly the same as in 1 Chronicles 1:43, where it fits the history properly. This means that the verse in Genesis, and much of chapter 36, was copied from Chronicles. Even though Genesis is first in the Bible and said to be written by Moses, it was actually put together by someone unknown.
