Science principles were found by studying and thinking carefully about the world. These principles are the base for most arts and skills that make life easier. Every important art or skill comes from some science, even if the person doing it doesn’t always know it.

It’s wrong to say sciences are made up by humans; only how we use science is created by people. Every science follows rules that are as steady and unchanging as the laws of the universe. Humans don’t make these rules; they discover them.

For example, when someone looks at a calendar, they can see when an eclipse will happen, and it always happens just like predicted. This shows humans understand the laws that control how planets and stars move. It would be very wrong for any church to say these laws were made up by humans.

It would also be wrong to say that the scientific rules used to predict eclipses are human inventions. People can’t invent things that last forever and never change. The scientific rules for predicting eclipses must be just as steady and unchanging as the laws that control how planets move, or else we couldn’t know when an eclipse will happen.

These scientific rules mostly come from a part of math called trigonometry, which deals with triangles. When trigonometry is used to study space, it’s called astronomy; when it helps guide ships at sea, it’s navigation; when it’s used to draw shapes with rulers and compasses, it’s geometry; when it’s used to design buildings, it’s architecture; and when it’s used to measure land, it’s called land-surveying. Basically, trigonometry is at the heart of science. It’s a timeless truth and has many uses we don’t even fully get.

Some might say that because humans can draw a triangle, triangles are human inventions.
