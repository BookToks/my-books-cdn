The principles in science were discovered by studying and thinking deeply about the world. These principles are the foundation for most of the arts and skills that make life easier. Every important art or skill comes from some science, even if the person doing the work doesn’t always realize it.

It’s wrong to say that sciences are inventions made by humans; only how we use science is created by people. Every science is based on rules that are as fixed and unchanging as the laws that govern the universe. Humans don’t create these rules; they find them.

For example, when someone looks at a calendar, they can see when an eclipse will happen, and it always happens just as predicted. This shows humans understand the laws that control how planets and stars move. It would be very ignorant for any church to claim these laws were invented by humans.

It would also be wrong to say that the scientific rules used to predict eclipses are human inventions. People cannot invent things that last forever and never change. The scientific rules used for predicting eclipses must be just as constant and unchanging as the laws that control the movement of heavenly bodies, or else we couldn’t use them to know when an eclipse will happen.

These scientific rules mostly come from a part of math called trigonometry, which deals with triangles. When trigonometry is used to study space, it’s called astronomy; when it helps guide ships at sea, it’s called navigation; when it’s used to draw shapes with rulers and compasses, it’s geometry; when it’s used to design buildings, it’s architecture; and when it’s used to measure land, it’s called land-surveying. Basically, trigonometry is at the heart of science. It’s a timeless truth and has many uses that we don’t even fully understand.

Some might say that because humans can draw a triangle, triangles are human inventions.
