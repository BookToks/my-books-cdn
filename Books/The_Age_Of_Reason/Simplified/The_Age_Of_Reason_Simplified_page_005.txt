Every country or religion says it started because God gave a special mission to certain people.

The Jews have Moses; Christians have Jesus Christ, their apostles, and saints; and the Turks have Mahomet. It’s like they think only those people have the right way to God.

Each religion has books they call revelations, or the Word of God. Jews say God gave their Word to Moses face to face. Christians say their Word came by divine inspiration. Turks say their Word, the Koran, was brought by an angel from heaven. Each group says the others don’t believe right, but I don’t believe any of them.

Before going further, I want to explain what “revelation” means.

In religion, revelation means something God tells a person directly.

Nobody will argue that God can do this if He wants. But if God tells one person something and not others, it’s only a revelation for that one person. When that person tells someone else, and then that person tells another, it’s no longer a direct revelation. It’s just a story or hearsay, so others don’t have to believe it.

It doesn’t make sense to call something a revelation if it comes to us secondhand, by talking or writing. Revelation only means the first time God tells someone. After that, it’s just a report of what the first person says God told them. Even if that first person believes it, I don’t have to believe it the same way because I didn’t hear it from God myself.
