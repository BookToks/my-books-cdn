The idea that everyone is doomed is silly because it makes God sound like he’s changing his mind just by messing with the meaning of the word "death." St. Paul, if he really wrote the books with his name, made it more confusing by talking about two Adams: one who actually sins and suffers for it, and another who sinned for everyone but suffers for everyone else. A religion full of these word tricks teaches people to use the same tricks without even realizing it.

If Jesus was really the person some stories say he was, and he came to this world to suffer (which sometimes just means to die), then the only real suffering he had was living here. Being on Earth was like being sent away from heaven, and the only way back was through death.

Basically, everything in this weird system is the opposite of what it claims to be. It’s not true, and I’m so tired of looking at all its problems and nonsense that I just want to finish talking about it and move on to something better.

We don’t really know how much of the New Testament was actually written by the people whose names are on it, or even what language it was first written in. The things in it fall into two groups: stories and letters.

The four books called Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are all stories. They tell what Jesus did and said, and what others did and said to him. Sometimes, they even tell the same event differently.

These stories can’t be called revelations because the writers didn’t agree, and you can’t call eyewitness accounts or conversations a “revelation.” The book called Acts of the Apostles (which no one really knows who wrote it) is also a story.

The rest of the New Testament, except for the mysterious book called Revelation, is a bunch of letters called epistles. Since people have often faked letters in history, it’s hard to tell if these are real or fake. But one thing is clearer: from the stuff in these books and some old stories, the church made a whole religion system.
