Over time, some old writings got mixed up and changed so much that people now call them prophecies, even though the original writers didn’t mean that. When a priest talks about these parts, he explains them in a way that fits his own ideas and makes people believe that’s what the writer really meant.

The "whore of Babylon" has been blamed on all the priests, and each group says the others are the bad ones. But they all seem to agree on their own explanations.

There are only a few books left called the books of the lesser prophets. Since I already showed that the bigger prophets are fake, I won’t bother with the smaller ones. Let them stay forgotten with the priests who take care of them.

I have now gone through the Bible like a man walking through a forest with an axe, cutting down trees. Here they are, lying on the ground. The priests can try to plant them again if they want, but they will never really grow. Now, I will move on to the New Testament books.

The story about Abraham and the Fire-worshipper, which Franklin said came from Saadi, is actually from Saadi’s work (see my "Sacred Anthology," p. 61). People often call Paine a "scoffer," but he was one of the first to treat the book of Jonah with respect, even though it’s easy to make fun of, and he saw it as showing the highest idea of God in the Old Testament.
