The authors of the Federalist Papers wanted to help people vote to approve the new government system. They also wanted to guide how the Constitution would be understood in the future. Historian Richard B. Morris said they explain the Constitution better than anyone else. This makes them very important in political science.

Henry David Thoreau wrote a famous non-fiction book called Walden, or Life in the Woods. It was published in 1854. The book talks about the two years and two months he spent living in a forest near Walden Pond. This was close to his friends and family in Concord, Massachusetts. Thoreau wrote it as if he stayed there for one year, showing the changes in seasons. He saw it as an experiment in simple living.

Walden is not a novel or a true autobiography. Instead, it criticizes Western society. Each chapter focuses on parts of humanity that should be either rejected or admired. The book is part personal freedom statement, social experiment, spiritual journey, and guide for being independent.

Thoreau also wrote an important essay called On the Duty of Civil Disobedience. He wrote it to protest against an unfair war and the immoral practice of slavery, even though both were popular at the time.

The United States Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. It announced that the thirteen American colonies at war with Great Britain were no longer part of the British Empire. Thomas Jefferson mainly wrote the Declaration. It explained why Congress decided on July 2 to declare independence. The U.S. celebrates Independence Day on July 4, the day the Declarationâ€™s words were approved.
