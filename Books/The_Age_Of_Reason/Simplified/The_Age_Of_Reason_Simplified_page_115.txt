What never happened isn’t true, just like the other books I already talked about. So, I’m finished with this part of the topic.

In the first part of The Age of Reason, I talked about Jonah and the story of him and the whale. It’s a funny story if people really believe it; or a joke if it was made to see how much people would believe. Because if someone can believe Jonah was swallowed by a whale, they can believe anything.

But like I said before when talking about the books of Job and Proverbs, it’s not always clear which books in the Bible were originally written in Hebrew or which ones were just translations from other people’s books. The book of Jonah doesn’t talk about Jewish stuff but mostly about non-Jewish people. So, it’s more likely that it was written by non-Jews as a made-up story to make fun of a Bible prophet or priest who predicted things.

Jonah is shown as a disobedient prophet who runs away from his job and hides on a ship full of non-Jewish people going from Joppa to Tarshish. It’s like he thought he could hide from God by just getting on that ship.

A big storm hits the ship, and the sailors, who are all non-Jews, think it’s a punishment because someone on the ship did something wrong. They decide to throw dice to see who is to blame, and it lands on Jonah. Before this, they threw their goods into the sea to make the ship lighter, while Jonah was asleep below deck.

When they find out Jonah is the problem, they ask who he is, and he says he’s a Hebrew. The story says he admits he’s guilty. But instead of killing him right away like some Bible priests would have done to a non-Jew, the sailors try to save him, even though it’s dangerous for them. The story says, "Even though Jonah was a Jew and the reason for their troubles and lost goods, the men rowed hard to get the ship to land, but the sea was too rough." Still, they didn’t want to give up on him.
