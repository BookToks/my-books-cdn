Back then, everyone would have known these people, and they would have been more popular and respected than all the other apostles. But instead, these saints just show up suddenly, like Jonah’s plant that grew overnight, only to die the next morning. That’s all for this part of the story.

The story of the resurrection comes after the crucifixion, but the writers don’t agree on many details, which shows that none of them were actually there.

The book of Matthew says that when Jesus was put in the tomb, the Jews asked Pilate to put a guard there to stop the disciples from stealing the body. Because of this, the tomb was sealed, and a watch was set to guard it. But the other books don’t mention any guard, sealing, or watch. According to them, none of this happened. Matthew also tells more about the guard later, which I will talk about in the conclusion because it shows that the other books might be wrong.

Matthew goes on to say that at the end of the Sabbath, just as dawn was breaking on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.

Mark says it was sunrise, and John says it was still dark. Luke says Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and some other women went to the tomb, while John says Mary Magdalene went alone. So, they don’t agree about who was there first! But they all talk a lot about Mary Magdalene; she knew a lot of people, so it’s not surprising she was there.

Matthew also says there was a big earthquake because an angel came down from heaven, rolled back the stone covering the tomb, and sat on it. But the other books don’t mention any earthquake or angel sitting on the stone. Mark says the angel was inside the tomb, sitting on the right side, and Luke says there were two angels.
