3 Chapter Conclusion

Earlier in The Age of Reason, I talked about three tricks: mystery, miracle, and prophecy. Since no one has shown anything that changes what I said about these, I won’t add anything extra in this second part.

I also talked about something called revelation and explained why it’s wrong to call the Old and New Testament books “revelation.” This is because revelation means something God shows to humans, but these books were written by people who saw or did things themselves.

If a person did or saw something, they don’t need a “revelation” to know it or to tell others about it. Calling these stories revelation is just wrong and misleading, but the Bible is still called that anyway.

So, revelation only means when God tells something to a person. Even though God can do this, no one can really prove if it ever happened. If it did happen, only the person who got the message really knows it’s true.

When that person tells others about it, it’s not the same as revelation anymore. People who believe the story are really trusting the person, who might be lying, dreaming, or tricking them. There’s no way to check if it’s true, even if the message sounds good.

In these cases, the right answer should be, “I will believe it when it’s revealed to me.” It’s not fair to believe it just because someone else says it’s true, or to treat a person’s word like God’s word. That’s how I think about it.
