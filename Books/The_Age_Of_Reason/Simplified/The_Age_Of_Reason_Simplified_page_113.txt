Here is what I think: First, those books don’t have any proof inside them to show they weren’t written by Ezekiel and Daniel, unlike other books like Moses, Joshua, and Samuel, which do show they weren’t written by those people.  

Second, these books were written after the Babylonian captivity started. It’s also likely that no book in the Bible was written before that time. In fact, from what the books themselves say, it’s clear they were written after the Jewish monarchy began.  

Third, the way the books by Ezekiel and Daniel are written fits with what was going on with them when they wrote it.  

If the many commentators and priests who tried to explain these books had been taken captive like Ezekiel and Daniel, they would have better understood why the writing is so strange. They wouldn’t have wasted so much time trying to figure it out because they would know they had to write about their own lives, their friends, or their country in a hidden way to stay safe.  

These two books are different from all the others because they are full of dreams and visions. This happened because Ezekiel and Daniel were prisoners of war in a foreign land. Because of that, they had to share even small news and their political ideas in secret, using symbols and hidden meanings. They said they dreamed dreams and saw visions because it wasn’t safe to speak plainly.  

We should assume that the people they wrote to understood their hidden messages, and that no one else was supposed to get it. But these commentators and priests have been trying hard to understand things they were never meant to know.  

Ezekiel and Daniel were taken prisoners to Babylon during the first captivity, under King Jehoiakim, nine years before the second captivity under King Zedekiah. At that time, many Jews still lived in Jerusalem and had some power. It makes sense to think that Ezekiel and Daniel were hoping to help their country get free again, so the dreams and visions in their books are...
