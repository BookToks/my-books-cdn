The phrase "children of Ammon" means that’s what they were called; the Bible often uses this way to explain something. But Moses couldn’t have said this because he didn’t know about Rabbah or what was there.

Rabbah wasn’t a city owned by the giant king, nor was it one of the cities Moses took. So, the information about the bed being in Rabbah and its size must come from the time when Rabbah was captured. This happened about 400 years after Moses died. You can see this in 2 Samuel 12:26, where it says Joab, David’s general, fought and took the city of Rabbah.

I’m not trying to point out every single mistake in time, place, and situation found in the books said to be written by Moses. These mistakes clearly show those books couldn’t have been written by Moses or during his time. Now, I’ll talk about the book of Joshua and show that Joshua didn’t write it either. The book’s author is unknown and has no real authority. The proof I give will come from inside the Bible itself; I won’t use anything outside the Bible to argue this. False statements are always proven wrong by themselves.

Joshua, according to Joshua chapter 1, took over right after Moses. He was also a military leader, unlike Moses. Joshua led the Israelites for 25 years, from when Moses died (around 1451 BC) until Joshua died (around 1426 BC). So, if the book of Joshua talks about events happening after Joshua died, that shows Joshua couldn’t have written it. The book must have been written after the latest event it talks about. The book’s content is horrible; it’s all about war, stealing, and murder, just like the books about Moses. These terrible acts are claimed to be ordered by God.

First, the book of Joshua, like the books before it, is written in the third person. It’s the historian telling the story, not Joshua himself. It would be strange and arrogant for Joshua to say things like how famous he was, which the book does in chapter 6, verse 27.

Now, here’s the proof. In Joshua 24:31, it says, “And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua.” Now, seriously, can Joshua be telling us what people did after he died?
