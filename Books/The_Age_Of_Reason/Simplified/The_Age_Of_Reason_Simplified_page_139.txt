This silly story has been turned into a prophecy, a symbol, and a promise all at once. The false message from Isaiah to Ahaz said that a virgin would have a son as a sign that Ahaz would win, but actually, he lost (as already explained in the notes on Isaiah). This has been twisted and used to confuse people.

Jonah and the whale are also made into a symbol. Jonah is like Jesus, and the whale is like the grave. It’s said (and people say Jesus said this about himself in Matthew 12:40), "Just as Jonah was in the whale for three days and three nights, the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for the same time." But, strangely, according to their own story, Jesus was in the grave for only about one day and two nights—around 36 hours—not the full 72 hours. They say he died Friday night and was up by Sunday morning. But this fits just as strangely as the other confusing stories about Genesis or Isaiah, so people just accept it as part of their beliefs.

Now, about the letters of Paul—there are fourteen of them, and they make up most of the rest of the Testament. It doesn’t really matter if Paul actually wrote all of them because whoever wrote them tries to prove their ideas by arguing. He never says he saw any of the events like the resurrection or ascension himself, and he admits that he didn’t believe in them at first.

The story about Paul being knocked to the ground on his way to Damascus isn’t really a miracle. He survived, which is good because many people struck by lightning don’t. Losing his sight for three days and not being able to eat or drink during that time is something that can happen in such situations. The people with him didn’t seem to have the same problem—they were fine and helped him finish the trip. They also never said they saw any vision.

The description of Paul shows he was very intense and extreme. He had been a harsh persecutor before he started preaching. What happened to him changed his mind but not his strong personality. Whether he was Jewish or Christian, he was still very passionate and extreme. People like that never change easily.
