If we want things to be thankful for and amazed by, don’t they show up all the time around us? When we are born, we come into a beautiful world that is ready for us—a world full of things we can use that didn’t cost us anything.

Do we make the sun shine, the rain fall, or fill the earth with plenty of food? Whether we are awake or asleep, the huge system of the universe keeps working. Aren’t these things, and the good things they promise for the future, important to us? Can we only get excited about sad things like tragedy and suicide? Or has people’s pride gotten so dark that the only thing that makes them feel special is to blame the Creator?

I know that asking these tough questions might scare some people, but it would be wrong to avoid them just because of that. The times we live in and the topic we are talking about need this kind of honest look. More and more people all over the world are starting to doubt the ideas taught by the Christian church. For those confused and unsure about what to believe, it might help to see the topic talked about openly. So, I will now start looking closely at the books called the Old and the New Testament.

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
