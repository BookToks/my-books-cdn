In the whole Bible, there isn’t a single word that means what we now call a poet or poetry. Back then, the word “prophet” actually meant a poet, and “prophesying” meant making poetry. It also meant playing poetry with music on instruments.

We read about people prophesying with pipes, drums, horns, harps, and cymbals—basically all the musical instruments they had at the time. If today someone said they were “prophesying” with a fiddle or a drum, it wouldn’t make sense or might even sound silly because the meaning of the word has changed.

The Bible tells us that Saul was with the prophets and that he prophesied too, but it doesn’t say what they said. That’s because these “prophets” were really just a group of musicians and poets, and Saul joined them in making music and poetry, which was called prophesying.

In the book of Samuel, it says Saul met a group of prophets coming down with instruments like psalteries, tabrets, pipes, and harps, and they prophesied together.

Some people think poetry only means rhyming, but it is really about two main things—imagery and how the words are put together. Poetry mixes long and short syllables in a special way. If you change these around, the line loses its rhythm and sounds off, kind of like playing a wrong note in a song.

The imagery in the books called the Prophets is all about poetry. It uses made-up and sometimes extreme images that don’t fit in normal writing, only in poetry.

To show that these writings follow poetic rules, I will take ten syllables from the book and make a line with the same number of syllables that rhymes with the last word. This will prove that the books were written in poetic style. The first example comes from Isaiah.
