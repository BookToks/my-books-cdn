The story says that Moses, Joshua, and others sneaked up on whole groups of people who had never hurt them. They killed all those people, including men, women, and even babies. They didn’t leave anyone alive. These scary details are repeated many times in those old books, and they seem proud of it. But are we really sure these things really happened? Are we sure that God told them to do this? Are we sure the books were written with God’s permission?

Just because a story is very old doesn’t mean it’s true. Actually, very old stories often sound like made-up fairy tales. Every country has old stories about how it began, and the Jewish stories are just as doubtful as any other.

Blaming God for terrible actions that are clearly wrong, like killing people in cold blood—especially babies—is a big problem. The Bible says God ordered these killings. If we believe the Bible is true, then we have to stop believing that God is fair and kind. How could innocent babies ever do anything wrong? To read the Bible without feeling upset, we’d have to shut off all feelings of kindness and sympathy. For me, just having to believe this part of the Bible would be enough to decide it isn’t true.

Besides these moral problems, I will also show other strong evidence later in this book that even priests can’t argue against. I will prove that the Bible should not be trusted as God’s word.

Before I do that, I want to explain how the Bible is different from other old books when it comes to proof that it is real. This is important because people who defend the Bible say it is just as trustworthy as any other ancient book. But just because we believe one old book doesn’t mean we have to believe all of them.

Actually, there is only one very old book that everyone agrees on, and that is Euclid’s Elements of Geometry. That’s because it is a book full of clear and obvious truths.
