Chapter 15: Why Having Many Worlds in Each Solar System Is Good

I’ve always thought that all our science comes from watching how the planets in our solar system move around the Sun.

If all the stuff from these six planets were squished into one big planet, we wouldn’t see much movement. Without that movement, we wouldn’t have the science knowledge we have now. And it’s from science that we get all the cool machines and tools that make our lives better and more comfortable.

Since the Creator doesn’t make things without a reason, we can believe that the universe is set up in the best way to help people. We see and feel the benefits of how our solar system is made. If it were just one planet, we wouldn’t get these benefits. This gives us a good reason to believe there are many worlds, and it makes us thankful and amazed.

But it’s not just us on Earth who get these benefits. The people living on all the other planets in our solar system get the same chances to learn and discover. They watch Earth move, just like we watch them move. All the planets can see each other as they go around the Sun, so everyone gets to learn the same science.

And it doesn’t stop there. The next solar system over also shows the same kinds of movements and science lessons to its planets.
