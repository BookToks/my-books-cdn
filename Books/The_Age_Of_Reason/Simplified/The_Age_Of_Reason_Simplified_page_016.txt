Revelation is when someone tells you something you didn’t know before. If I did something or saw something happen, I don’t need a special message to know about it or to tell others.

So, revelation can’t be about things people did or saw on Earth. That means most of the Bible, which is full of stories and history, isn’t really about revelation and isn’t the word of God.

For example, if Samson really took the gate-posts of Gaza, or visited Delilah, or caught foxes, what does revelation have to do with those stories? If they really happened, Samson or someone close to him could have told them. If they didn’t, a revelation wouldn’t make them true. Either way, knowing these stories doesn’t really help us or teach us much. When we think about the huge and amazing power that controls everything, it feels silly to call these small stories the word of God.

About the story of creation at the start of Genesis, it seems like an old story the Israelites already had before they went to Egypt. After leaving Egypt, they just put that story at the beginning of their history, probably without knowing where it really came from. The way the story starts is sudden and doesn’t have anyone speaking or listening. It doesn’t use “I,” “you,” or “he,” which shows it’s just a tradition. Moses doesn’t say he got this story from God like he does with other parts of the Bible. I don’t know why people call it Moses’ story of creation. Moses was smart and learned from the Egyptians, who knew a lot about science and stars. The fact that Moses never said this story was true makes me think he didn’t write it or really believe it. Actually, every group of people has their own creation story, and the Israelites were no different.
