I don’t know how the printers split this passage because I don’t own a Bible, but it has two different questions that need separate answers.

First, can you find God by searching? Yes. I know I didn’t make myself, but I exist. When I look at other things, I see they couldn’t make themselves either, yet millions of things exist. So, from this, I know there is a power greater than all these things, and that power is God.

Second, can you fully understand the Almighty? No. Not only because the power and wisdom shown in the world around me is hard to understand, but also because this is probably just a small part of the huge power and wisdom that made millions of other worlds I can’t even see.

It’s clear these two questions were meant to be thought about by the person they were asked. The first question has to be answered with yes before the second one makes sense. It would be pointless to ask a harder question if the first was answered no. The two questions are about different things; the first is about God’s existence, the second about His qualities. Reason can find the first but can’t fully understand the second.

I don’t remember any part in the writings by the apostles that explains what God really is. Those writings mostly argue about things, and the sad topic they focus on—a man dying in pain on a cross—fits better with a gloomy monk in a cell than with someone enjoying the open world. The only part I remember related to God’s works, which show His power and wisdom, is something Jesus said to stop people from worrying: "Look at the lilies in the field, they don’t work or spin." This is less powerful than parts in Job and Psalm 19, but it’s similar in idea and matches the humble nature of Jesus.
