I have to say, the guard who followed the order and the interpreter with the Committee of General Surety, who came to check my papers, treated me not just politely but with respect. Benoit, the keeper of the Luxembourg, was a good-hearted man who showed me all the kindness he could, and so did his whole family while he was in charge. Later, he was removed from his position, put under arrest, and taken to court because of a bad accusation, but he was found not guilty.

After I had been in Luxembourg for about three weeks, the Americans in Paris all went together to the Convention to ask for me because I was their countryman and friend. But the President, Vadier, who was also head of the Committee of Surety General and signed the order for my arrest, told them I was born in England. After that, no one outside the prison contacted me until Robespierre fell on July 27, 1794.

About two months before that happened, I got a fever that showed every sign it could kill me, and I still haven’t fully recovered from it. At that time, I felt happy and proud to have written the first part of The Age of Reason. I didn’t expect to live much longer, and neither did the people around me. So, I learned what it really means to stay true to my beliefs during hard times.

I was sharing a room with three friends: Joseph Vanheule from Bruges, Charles Bastini, and Michael Robyns from Louvain. These three friends took care of me all day and night, and I will always be thankful to them. At that time, a doctor named Dr. Graham and a surgeon named Mr. Bond, who were with General O'Hara, were also in the Luxembourg. I don’t care if they are under the English Government or not—I want to thank them, and also the Luxembourg’s doctor, Dr. Markoski.

I have a feeling, because I can’t think of any other reason, that this illness is what kept me alive.
