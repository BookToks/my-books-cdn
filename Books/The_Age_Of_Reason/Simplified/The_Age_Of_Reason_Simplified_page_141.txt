The way our mind works, and how tiny and delicate it is, makes us realize that we are alive. Everything else is like the soft part of a peach, separate from the little seed inside.

No one really knows exactly how a thought happens in our mind. But when a thought does happen, like the one I’m having right now while writing, it can last forever. It’s the only thing humans create that can do that.

Statues made of metal or stone will eventually break or disappear. Copies of statues or pictures aren’t the same as the original. But if you write down a thought again and again, or carve it in wood or stone, the thought stays exactly the same every time. It can live forever without changing, no matter what it’s written on. This shows that thoughts are very different from anything else we know. If what we create can live forever, it means the power that made it—our awareness that we exist—can live forever too. This idea isn’t harder to believe than others, and we can see that it’s true.

Our senses also show us that being aware of ourselves doesn’t depend on having the same body or form. Many animals show us this better than any speech or teaching. Their short lives are like a small version of earth and heaven, like a present life and a life after death, showing a tiny kind of forever life.

One of the most beautiful parts of nature to us are winged insects, but they aren’t born that way. They change over time. A slow, crawling caterpillar becomes still and seems almost dead for a while. Then it changes into a beautiful butterfly. Nothing about the old caterpillar looks the same; everything is new, and its life feels completely different. We can’t imagine that the butterfly doesn’t know it exists just like the caterpillar did before. So, why would...
