It doesn’t really matter if Paul wrote the fourteen letters (called epistles) that are said to be his. These letters are either trying to argue something or just stating opinions without proof. Since the arguments are weak and the opinions are just guesses, it doesn’t matter who actually wrote them. The same thing goes for the rest of the New Testament.

The important part of the Christian Church’s beliefs comes from what’s called the Gospel. This is found in the four books named after Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and also from the supposed prophecies. The letters depend on these stories and have to follow their truth. If the story of Jesus isn’t true, then all the arguments based on it fall apart too.

We know from history that Athanasius, a main leader of the early church, lived when the New Testament was being put together. We can also see from the confusing statements he left behind, called a creed, what kind of people helped create the New Testament. History also tells us that even back then, some people didn’t believe these books were real. It was because of votes from people like Athanasius that the Testament was declared to be the word of God. It’s pretty strange to think that something so important could be decided by a vote.

If people believe in this just because of that vote, they are putting humans above God, and their faith doesn’t have a solid base for true happiness. Believing without proof isn’t a crime, but ignoring clear evidence is. It’s like stopping your own mind from finding the truth. We should never force ourselves to believe something without good reason.

I’m ending my talk on the Old and New Testaments here. The proof I shared shows that they are fake, and this proof comes from the books themselves. This proof works both ways. If you deny the proof, you also deny that the Scriptures are real. If you accept the proof, then the books can’t be true. The Old and New Testaments contain impossible contradictions, like someone swearing both for and against something. Either way, it shows dishonesty and ruins their trust.

If the Bible and the Testament lose their status in the future, it’s not because of me. I only took out the proof hidden in the confusing mix of stories and showed it clearly, so it can be easy to understand.
