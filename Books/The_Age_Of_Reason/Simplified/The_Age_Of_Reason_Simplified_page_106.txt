Jeremiah was accused of being a traitor who was helping Nebuchadnezzar, who Jeremiah called the servant of God.

In chapter 37, verses 11-13, it says that when the Chaldean army left Jerusalem because they were scared of Pharaoh’s army, Jeremiah left Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to stay away from the people. But when he got to the gate of Benjamin, a guard captain named Irijah stopped him. Irijah said Jeremiah was running away to join the Chaldeans, but Jeremiah said that wasn’t true. Even so, Jeremiah was arrested and put in prison because people thought he was a traitor. He stayed in prison, as the last verse of that chapter tells us.

The next chapter talks about Jeremiah’s imprisonment too, but it tells a different story. To understand this, we have to go back to chapter 21. There, King Zedekiah sent Pashur and Zephaniah to ask Jeremiah about Nebuchadnezzar, whose army was outside Jerusalem. Jeremiah told them that the Lord said there were two choices: if the people stayed in the city, they would die by sword, hunger, and disease; but if they went out to the Chaldeans who were attacking, they would live and be safe.

This talk stopped suddenly at the end of chapter 21, verse 10. The book is a bit mixed up, so you have to skip sixteen chapters to find what happened next. That’s at the start of chapter 38. It says that Shaphatiah, Gedaliah, Jucal, and Pashur heard Jeremiah telling everyone that staying in the city meant death, but going to the Chaldeans meant life. They told King Zedekiah to kill Jeremiah because his words were making the soldiers and people lose hope. They said Jeremiah wasn’t trying to help the people.
