It would be really silly to say someone could predict something that already happened in the past.

But there are other parts in those books that all show the same idea. In Exodus, which is another book said to be written by Moses, it says, "The children of Israel ate manna until they came to a land where people lived; they ate manna until they reached the borders of Canaan."

Whether the children of Israel actually ate manna or what manna really was—maybe just a kind of fungus, small mushroom, or some other plant common in that area—doesn’t matter for my point. What I want to show is that Moses couldn’t have written this because the story goes past his lifetime. The Bible (which has many lies and contradictions, so it’s hard to know what to believe) says Moses died in the wilderness and never reached the borders of Canaan. So, he couldn’t have said what the children of Israel did or ate when they got there.

The story about eating manna, which they say Moses wrote, actually continues until the time of Joshua, who took over after Moses. This is clear in the book of Joshua, after the Israelites crossed the Jordan River and entered Canaan. Joshua 5:12 says, "The manna stopped the day after they ate the old grain from the land; the Israelites didn’t eat manna anymore but ate the fruit of Canaan that year."

An even more interesting example is in Deuteronomy. It shows not only that Moses couldn’t have written that book but also the weird ideas people had back then about giants.

In Deuteronomy 3:11, it talks about Moses’ victories and mentions taking over Og, king of Bashan: "Only Og, king of Bashan, was left from the race of giants. Look, his iron bedstead is in Rabbath of the Ammonites. It was nine cubits long and four cubits wide, according to the length of a man’s cubit."

A cubit is about 1 foot 9.888 inches, so the bed was about 16 feet 4 inches long and 7 feet 4 inches wide. That’s a huge bed for a giant!

Now, about the history part: even though the proof isn’t as clear as in the other examples, it still makes a strong case. The writer points to this giant’s bed as an old relic and asks if it’s not in Rabbath (or Rabbah).
