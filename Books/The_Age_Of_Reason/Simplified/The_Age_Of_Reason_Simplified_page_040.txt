Ignorance began with the Christian system. There was more knowledge in the world before that time than for many centuries after. About religion, the Christian system was just another kind of mythology. The mythology before it was a messed-up version of an old belief in one God.

Because science didn’t progress during that long time, we now have to look back hundreds of years to the ancient thinkers we respect. If knowledge had kept growing from before, that long gap would be filled with people getting smarter and smarter. The Ancients we admire now would just be in the background.

But the Christian system destroyed a lot of that. If we think about the early 1500s, the time before the Ancients seems like a huge empty desert with nothing in between to block the view of better times ahead.

It’s hard to believe, but there really was a religion that said it was wrong to study and think about the universe God made.

This fact is well known and can’t be denied. The event that helped break this control over knowledge more than any other is important to understand.
