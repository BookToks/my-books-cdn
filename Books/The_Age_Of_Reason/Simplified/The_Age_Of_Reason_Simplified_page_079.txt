This story might be true. It talks about an order to kill the boys, massacre the mothers, and hurt the daughters.

Imagine being a mom in that situation—losing one child to murder, another about to be hurt, and facing death yourself. Or imagine being one of those daughters, targeted after your family is attacked. How would you feel? You can't force nature to change, and a religion that breaks all family bonds is a fake one.

After this terrible order, the story talks about the loot taken and how it was shared. Here, the fake kindness of priests adds more crimes. Verse 37 says, "The Lord's share of the sheep was 675; the cattle were 36,000, with the Lord's share being 72; the donkeys were 30,000, with the Lord's share being 61; and there were 16,000 people, with the Lord's share being 32." Basically, this chapter, like many others in the Bible, is too horrible for people to read or hear about. Verse 35 shows that 32,000 women and children were handed over to be abused because of Moses' order.

Most people don’t realize how much evil is in this so-called word of God. Raised with superstitions, they just assume the Bible is true and good. They never question it and believe that God, who is kind, wrote it. But honestly, it’s the opposite. It’s a book full of lies, evil, and disrespect to God. What could be worse than blaming God's commands for human cruelty?

Now, back to my point. I want to prove that Moses didn’t write the books credited to him and that the Bible is fake. The two examples I already gave are enough to show this. They talk about events that happened hundreds of years before the book was written. In cases like chasing enemies to Dan or talking about the kings of Israel, the Bible doesn’t even pretend to be a prophecy. It talks about these things as if they already happened, using past tense.
