Prophets were like poets, musicians, magicians, dreamers, and wanderers, and that's the kind of people they were known to be. But besides being like that, all prophets also had a special role. They belonged to groups and would predict things for or against the group they supported. This is similar to how writers today defend the side they agree with and argue against the other side.

After the Jews split into two nations, Judah and Israel, each nation had its own prophets. These prophets would insult and accuse each other of being fake or lying prophets. The prophets from Judah spoke against the prophets from Israel, and the prophets from Israel spoke against those from Judah.

This fighting between prophets started right after the split, during the time of the first two kings, Rehoboam and Jeroboam. For example, a prophet from Judah cursed a special altar that Jeroboam built in Bethel. On his way home, a prophet from Israel stopped him and pretended that God told him to bring the Judah prophet back home to eat and drink. But this was a lie. According to the story, the Judah prophet never made it back because the Israel prophet tricked him and he was found dead on the road. Each side called their own prophets true and the other side’s prophets liars.

There is another story in 2 Kings, chapter 3, that shows what prophets were like. Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and Joram, king of Israel, had stopped fighting for a while and teamed up with the king of Edom to fight the king of Moab. When their armies ran out of water, Jehoshaphat asked if there was a prophet they could ask for help. One of the Israel king’s servants said Elisha was there. Elisha was from Judah. Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the Lord is with him.” So, the three kings went to see Elisha. When Elisha saw the king of Israel, he said, “What do I have to do with you?”
