That means from the death of Joshua in 1426 B.C. to the death of Samson in 1120 B.C., and just 25 years before Saul went looking for his dad’s donkeys and became king. But there’s a good reason to believe the book wasn’t written until David’s time, or at least around then, and that the book of Joshua wasn’t written before that either.

In Judges chapter 1, after saying Joshua died, the writer talks about what happened between the people of Judah and the people living in the land of Canaan. The writer suddenly mentions Jerusalem in verse 7, and right after, in verse 8, says, “Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem and taken it.” So, this book couldn’t have been written before Jerusalem was taken.

You might remember from Joshua 15:63 that the Jebusites lived with the people of Judah in Jerusalem at that time, which means when the book of Joshua was written.

I’ve already shown lots of proof that the books I talked about before were not written by the people they say wrote them, and were written many years after those people died, if they even existed. So, I don’t need to rely too much on this passage. The Bible’s history says Jerusalem wasn’t taken until David’s time. That means the books of Joshua and Judges were probably written after David started to rule, which was 370 years after Joshua died.

The city later called Jerusalem was first called Jebus or Jebusi, and it was the capital of the Jebusites. The story of David taking the city is told in 2 Samuel 5:4 and 1 Chronicles 14:4. Nowhere in the Bible does it say Jerusalem was taken before that, or give any reason to think it was. It doesn’t say David destroyed everyone there like he did in other places. The silence means the city was probably given up without a fight, and the Jebusites still lived there after David took it.

So, the story in Joshua that says “the Jebusites live with the children of Judah” in Jerusalem fits only the time after David took the city.

Now that I’ve shown that every book from Genesis to Judges isn’t really true, I come to the book of Ruth, which is a silly, badly told story about a wandering woman, and nobody really knows who wrote it.
