The Christian way of believing seems to me like a kind of not really believing in God. It acts like it believes more in a man than in God. It is mostly about humans, with just a little about God, and it’s almost like not believing in God at all. It puts something between people and God, called a redeemer, like how the moon gets between the earth and the sun. This causes a kind of blocking or darkening of the truth. Because of this, reason and clear thinking are covered up.

This confusion has flipped everything around and made people see things the wrong way. One big change it caused is in theology, which is the study of God.

What people now call natural philosophy, which includes all science like astronomy, is actually the study of God’s works and shows God’s power and wisdom. This is the true way to study God.

The theology taught today is mostly about what humans think and imagine about God, not about God himself through his creations. One bad thing the Christian system has done is to leave the old, beautiful way of studying God to make room for superstition.

The Book of Job and the 19th Psalm, which are older than many parts of the Bible, are examples of the original way to study God. These writings show that long ago, people’s religious devotion was based a lot on looking at and thinking about God’s creation and his power revealed through it.
