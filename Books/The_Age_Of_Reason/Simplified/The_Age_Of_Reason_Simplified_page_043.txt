I wanted to make a system for myself that matched the moral and philosophical ideas I was taught. I thought there was a big chance for the world because of what was happening in America. It seemed to me that if the Americans didn’t change how they were dealing with England and didn’t declare independence, they would have a lot of new problems and miss a chance to help the world.

Because of this, I wrote a pamphlet called Common Sense. It was the first thing I ever published, and I think I wouldn’t be known as a writer if it weren’t for what was happening in America. I wrote Common Sense at the end of 1775 and published it on January 1, 1776. Independence was declared on July 4 of that year.

Anyone who thinks about their own thoughts can see there are two kinds: ones we create by thinking carefully, and ones that just pop into our minds without us trying. I always try to respect these sudden thoughts and check if they are worth keeping. Most of what I’ve learned comes from these thoughts.

What we learn in school is just a starting point that helps us learn more on our own later. In the end, every smart person teaches themselves because ideas are different from facts you just memorize—they stay in your mind in a special way.
