The principles of science help us understand the world because the Creator of humans is also the Creator of science. Through science, people can, in a way, see God directly.

Imagine if someone could look at the whole universe all at once. They could watch the planets move, see why they look different, and understand how they follow perfect rules, even faraway comets. They would see how everything is connected and controlled by laws set by the Creator. This would help them understand God's power, wisdom, and generosity much better than any church teaching.

Then, they would realize that all scientific knowledge and tools that make life easier come from God. Their mind would feel thankful as they learned more. Their faith would grow along with their knowledge. Any job linked to nature, science, or technology would teach them more about God and thankfulness than any church sermon. Big ideas make people think deeply, and great generosity makes people feel grateful. But the simple stories and rules from the Bible used by churches often seem silly or unimportant.

Even though people can’t see the whole universe at once, they can prove how it works because they understand the basic rules of creation. Big things can be shown with models, and the universe can be understood the same way. The way we measure small things, like inches or acres, works just as well for huge things. A tiny circle has the same math rules as a giant circle around the universe. The math used to plan a ship’s path on paper can also be used to predict eclipses in space, even though those things are millions of miles away. This knowledge comes from God, and it comes from studying nature, not just from church teachings. All the science and machines that make life better come from this understanding.
