About Paine: Thomas Paine (January 29, 1737 – June 8, 1809) was an English writer, rebel, inventor, and thinker. He lived in Britain until he was 37, then moved to the American colonies just in time to join the American Revolution.

His most famous work was a pamphlet called Common Sense (1776), which said the colonies should break away from Great Britain. He also wrote The American Crisis (1776–1783), a series of pamphlets that supported the revolution.

Later, Paine played a big role in the French Revolution. He wrote Rights of Man (1791), explaining important ideas about rights and freedom. Even though he didn’t speak French, he was elected to the French National Convention in 1792. The Girondists saw him as a friend, but the Montagnards, especially Robespierre, saw him as an enemy. In December 1793, he was arrested and put in jail in Paris but was freed in 1794.

Paine became famous for his book The Age of Reason (1793–94), which supported deism (the belief in a creator but not in organized religion) and criticized Christian beliefs. In France, he also wrote Agrarian Justice (1795), which talked about property and suggested everyone should get a guaranteed minimum income.

He stayed in France when Napoleon started to rule but hated Napoleon’s dictatorship, calling him a total fraud. In 1802, Paine went back to America after President Thomas Jefferson invited him.

Thomas Paine died at 72 years old on June 8, 1809, in Greenwich Village, New York City. He was buried in New Rochelle, New York, where he lived after coming back to America. Later, someone took his body to try to bring it back to England, so we don’t know exactly where he is buried now.
