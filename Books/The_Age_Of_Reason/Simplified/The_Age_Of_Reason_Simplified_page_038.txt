Setting those things aside for a moment, let's think about how unfair it is to believe that God would make innocent people suffer for the guilty. Also, it seems strange and kind of dishonest to think that God would turn into a man just to avoid punishing Adam. 

Putting those ideas aside as separate issues, it’s clear that what’s called the Christian faith—like the weird story of how the world was made, the story of Eve, the snake, and the apple, the idea of a man who is also God, the idea of a god who can die, the story of a family of gods, and the confusing idea that three can be one and one can be three—doesn’t match up with the natural ability God gave humans to think and reason. It also doesn’t fit with what we learn about God’s power and wisdom by studying science and looking at how the universe works.

So, the people who started and supported the Christian faith probably knew that as humans learned more about science and the universe, their faith’s stories would be questioned. Because of this, they wanted to limit learning to things that wouldn’t threaten their beliefs. They did this by focusing only on studying old, dead languages instead of science.

Not only did they keep science out of Christian schools, they also punished people who studied it. It’s only in the last couple of hundred years that science started to be accepted again. For example, in 1610, Galileo from Florence made telescopes and used them to study the stars and planets, helping us understand the universe better. Instead of being praised for this, he was forced to give up his discoveries or be punished for heresy.

Before that, a man named Virgilius was sentenced to be burned for saying the Earth was round and could be lived on everywhere there was land. Now, of course, everyone knows this is true. If believing wrong things that aren’t harmful didn’t cause problems, it wouldn’t be our responsibility to fight against them. There was no moral harm in thinking the Earth was flat, just like there was no special goodness in thinking it was round.
