Moses told the children of Israel that he got the two tablets with the commandments straight from God. But they didn’t have to believe him because the only proof was what he said. I only hear about it from some historian, and the commandments don’t really prove they came from God. They have some good rules, but anyone who knows about making laws could come up with them without needing a miracle.

When I hear that the Koran was written in Heaven and brought to Muhammad by an angel, that story is kind of like the one about Moses. It’s just secondhand information. I didn’t see the angel myself, so I don’t have to believe it.

Also, when I hear that a woman called the Virgin Mary said she was pregnant without being with a man, and that Joseph, her fiancé, said an angel told him this, I can choose whether to believe it or not. This kind of story needs way stronger proof than just their word. But we don’t even have that because neither Joseph nor Mary wrote about it themselves. It’s just reported by others, which is like hearsay on top of hearsay. So I don’t want to believe it based on that.

It’s not hard to understand why people believed Jesus was the Son of God. Back then, stories about gods having kids with humans were common in pagan myths. Lots of famous people were said to be born from gods. So believing Jesus was born from God wasn’t new or strange to those people. Their gods, like Jupiter, were said to have been with many women. This was normal for them, so the story didn’t seem weird or wrong. Only the Gentiles, who believed these myths, accepted the story. The Jews, who believed in one God and didn’t follow these myths, never believed it.

One thing to note is that the idea that God punishes children for their parents’ sins doesn’t seem fair or right.
