Both were standing up; but John says they were both sitting down, one at the head and the other at the feet.

Matthew says that the angel who was sitting on the stone outside the tomb told the two Marys that Christ had risen, and the women left quickly. Mark says the women saw the stone rolled away and were surprised. They went into the tomb, and the angel sitting on the right side inside told them this. Luke says there were two angels standing up, and John says Jesus Christ himself told Mary Magdalene. She didn’t go into the tomb but just leaned in and looked inside.

Now, if these four writers had gone to court to prove they weren’t lying (because they were trying to prove the body was gone in a supernatural way), and if they gave their stories as differently as they do here, they could have been punished for lying and deserved it. But this is the evidence and these are the books that people say are inspired by God and are the unchangeable word of God.

The writer of Matthew’s book, after telling this story, adds something that none of the other books have, which I mentioned before. He says that after the women talked to the angel sitting on the stone, some guards went into the city and told the chief priests everything that happened. The priests and elders met and gave the soldiers a lot of money to say that Jesus’ disciples came at night and stole his body while they were sleeping. They promised to protect the soldiers if anyone found out. The soldiers took the money and lied like they were told. This story that the disciples stole the body is still told among the Jews to this day.

The phrase “to this day” shows that the book called Matthew was not actually written by Matthew himself and was made long after the events it talks about. The phrase means a lot of time has passed. We wouldn’t say that about something happening right now. So, to really understand what “to this day” means, we have to think about a long time passing.
