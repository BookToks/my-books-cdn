To believe something, the proof and evidence should be the same for everyone and obvious to all. Since the only proof given was a public event, and that proof never actually happened, the whole story falls apart.

Instead, only a few people, about eight or nine, are said to have seen it, and everyone else is asked to believe them. But Thomas did not believe the resurrection until he saw it himself. So, I won’t believe it either, and my reason is just as good as Thomas’s or anyone else’s.

You can’t hide or excuse this problem. The story about the supernatural part looks like a trick or a lie. We don’t know who really wrote it, just like we can’t be sure the books were written by the people whose names are on them. The best proof we have now comes from the Jews, who are the descendants of people from that time, and they say it’s not true. It’s strange to use the Jews as proof that the story is true, like trying to prove something by showing people who say it’s false.

It’s likely that Jesus Christ existed and was crucified, which was how people were executed back then. He taught good morals and that everyone is equal. But he also spoke out against the greed and corruption of the Jewish priests, which made them hate him. The priests accused him of trying to cause trouble and rebel against the Roman government, which ruled the Jews then. The Romans might have been worried about his ideas too. Jesus probably wanted to free the Jewish people from Roman rule. Because of this, he lost his life, caught between the priests and the Roman rulers.
