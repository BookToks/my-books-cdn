To believe something, the proof should be the same for everyone and easy to see. Since the only proof was supposed to be a public event, and that event never really happened, the whole story doesn’t make sense.

Instead, only about eight or nine people said they saw it, and everyone else is asked to just trust them. But Thomas didn’t believe the resurrection until he saw it himself. So, I won’t believe it either, and my reason is just as good as Thomas’s or anyone else’s.

You can’t ignore or explain away this problem. The story about the supernatural part seems like a trick or a lie. We don’t even know who really wrote it, just like we can’t be sure the books were written by the people named on them. The best proof now comes from the Jews, who are the descendants of people from that time, and they say it’s not true. It’s weird to use the Jews as proof that the story is true, like trying to prove something by showing people who say it’s false.

It’s likely that Jesus Christ existed and was crucified, which was how people were executed back then. He taught good morals and that everyone is equal. But he also spoke against the greed and corruption of the Jewish priests, which made them hate him. The priests accused him of trying to cause trouble and rebel against the Roman government, which ruled the Jews then. The Romans might have been worried about his ideas too. Jesus probably wanted to free the Jewish people from Roman rule. Because of this, he lost his life, caught between the priests and the Roman rulers.
