Thomas Paineâ€™s pamphlet, Common Sense, was very popular and read by many people. It was first published in January 1776.  

The pamphlet clearly and strongly argued that America should separate from Great Britain. It helped prepare the way for the Declaration of Independence.  

This important document criticized the monarchy and pointed out the problems with the government. It mixed big ideas about freedom with practical worries about money and the economy.
