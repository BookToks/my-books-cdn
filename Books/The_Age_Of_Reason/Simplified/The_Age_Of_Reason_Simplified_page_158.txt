Thomas Paineâ€™s pamphlet, Common Sense, was really popular and lots of people read it. It first came out in January 1776.

The pamphlet explained clearly and strongly why America should break away from Great Britain. It helped get people ready for the Declaration of Independence.

This important paper criticized the king and showed the problems with the government. It combined big ideas about freedom with real concerns about money and the economy.
