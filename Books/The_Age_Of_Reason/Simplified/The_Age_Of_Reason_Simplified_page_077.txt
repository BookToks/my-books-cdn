The kings who ruled Edom did so before any king ruled the children of Israel. Now, if you found writing without a date that said something happened before there was a Congress in America or a Convention in France, it would mean the writing was made after those events happened. So, it couldn’t have been written by someone who died before those events.

It’s very common, both in history and in everyday talk, to use an event instead of a date. This makes sense because people remember events better than dates. Also, the event tells you when it happened, so it gives you two ideas at once. When someone says something happened "before I was married," or "before my son was born," it means they are married or have a son. Language only works this way, so when you see a phrase like this, you have to understand it how it was meant.

That means the sentence I shared—“these are the kings who ruled Edom before any king ruled over the children of Israel”—must have been written after Israel had its first king. So, the book of Genesis couldn’t have been written by Moses. It had to be written at least by the time of King Saul. The phrase “any king” means more than one king, so it could even mean the time of King David or later, covering all the time of the Jewish monarchy.

If we found this verse in any part of the Bible written after kings ruled Israel, it would be obvious what it means. This actually happens to be true. The two books of Chronicles tell the history of all the kings of Israel and were written after the Jewish monarchy began. The verse I mentioned and all the rest of Genesis chapter 36 are copied exactly in 1 Chronicles chapter 1, starting at verse 43.
