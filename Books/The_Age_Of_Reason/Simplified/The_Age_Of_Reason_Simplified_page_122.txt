From the birth of David to the birth of Christ is more than 1,080 years. Since Christ’s life is not counted here, there are only 27 full generations.

To find the average age of each person when their first son was born, you just divide 1,080 by 27. That means each person was about 40 years old.

People didn’t live much longer back then than they do now, so it doesn’t make sense that 27 generations waited until they were really old to have kids. This is even more unlikely because Solomon, who came right after David, had many wives and girlfriends before he was 21.

So, this family tree isn’t really true, and it’s not even a believable fake.

Luke’s list shows an average age of about 26 years, but even that seems too high.
