Everything is a miracle in one way, but in another way, there are no miracles at all. Something seems like a miracle when we compare it to what we can do or understand. But it’s not a miracle when you think about the power that actually makes it happen. Since this idea doesn’t really match what most people think a miracle is, we need to look deeper.

People have made up certain rules about how nature works. They say a miracle is something that breaks these rules. But unless we know all the rules and powers of nature, we can’t really say if something amazing is a miracle or just part of how nature works.

For example, if a man floated miles up in the air, it would seem like a miracle. But we know that special kinds of air, lighter than normal air, can lift balloons because they stop the balloon from being crushed by the heavier air outside.

Also, sparks coming from the human body or metal moving by itself would look like miracles if we didn’t know about electricity and magnets. Many science experiments can seem like magic to people who don’t understand them. Bringing someone back to life who looks dead, like saved drowning victims, would be a miracle if we didn’t know that life can pause without really ending.

Besides these, there are magic tricks and shows where people work together to create amazing effects that seem impossible but aren’t. There are also tricks with machines and optical illusions. In Paris, there’s a show with ghosts that look very real, even though the audience knows it’s just a show. Since we don’t know all the limits of nature or art, we can’t really say what a miracle is. People often believe things are miracles just because they look unbelievable, and this can trick them.

Because appearances can easily fool us, and fake things can look a lot like real things, it doesn’t make sense to think that God would use tricks or illusions...
