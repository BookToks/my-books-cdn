Now, if Matthew and Luke started their story about Jesus with a lie about who he was and where he came from (like these two versions show), then why should we believe the other strange things they say later? If they can’t be trusted about his family tree, how can we trust them when they say he was the son of God, created by a ghost, and that an angel told his mother about it in secret? 

If they lied about one part, why should we believe the rest? If his family tree was made up, then maybe his heavenly family story is made up too, and the whole story could be fake. Can anyone serious risk their future happiness on a story that doesn’t make sense, goes against common decency, and is told by people already caught lying? Isn’t it safer to believe in just one God, which is called deism, than to believe in a bunch of crazy, impossible, rude, and conflicting stories?

The first question about the New Testament books, like the Old Testament ones, is: Are they real? Were they actually written by the people they say wrote them? We only believe the strange stories because we think the authors were who they claim to be. But there is no clear proof for or against this. This means we should be doubtful, and doubt is the opposite of belief. So just this fact alone makes the books questionable.

Besides this, people think the books called the Gospels, named after Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were not actually written by those four. They probably were written by other people.
