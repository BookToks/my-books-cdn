The solar system is the part of the universe that includes our Earth and other planets, all moving around the Sun. The Sun is at the center. Besides the Sun, there are six main planets and smaller bodies called moons or satellites. Earth has one moon that moves with it as it travels around the Sun, just like the moons of other planets do. You can see these moons with a telescope.

The Sun is in the middle, and the six planets move around it at different distances, each following its own circular path.

Each planet stays on almost the same path around the Sun and also spins around itself, like a spinning top that leans a little to the side.

Earth’s tilt, which is about 23½ degrees, causes summer and winter and makes the days and nights different lengths. If Earth spun straight up and down, like a top standing perfectly, days and nights would always be 12 hours long, and the seasons would never change.

Every time Earth spins once, we get day and night. And every time Earth goes all the way around the Sun, we get a year. So, Earth spins about 365 times while it makes one trip around the Sun.

Some people used to think the Sun went around the Earth every 24 hours, but that’s wrong. It’s like thinking the fire should move around the meat when cooking, instead of the meat turning toward the fire.
