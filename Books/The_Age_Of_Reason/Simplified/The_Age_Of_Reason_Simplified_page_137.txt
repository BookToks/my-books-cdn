Only a few really great poets could have written the book of Homer. Someone who wrote it wouldn’t have given credit to anyone else because they wanted to be famous. In the same way, only a very skilled mathematician could have written Euclid’s Elements.

But for the books of the New Testament, especially the parts about Jesus rising from the dead and going to heaven, anyone who could tell a simple ghost story or talk about someone walking could have made up these stories. The way these stories are told is really bad. So, it’s much more likely these books are fake than the works of Homer or Euclid.

Today, many priests and bishops can give a sermon or translate some Latin, especially if it’s been translated many times before. But can any of them write poetry like Homer or do math like Euclid? Most priests only know very basic stuff, like simple letters or easy math, and that would have been enough for them to write all the New Testament books if they had lived back then.

Boulanger, who wrote about Paul’s life, collected stories from church history and early Christian writers about what different Christian groups believed when the New Testament was chosen as the word of God. For example, the Marcionists said the gospel writers lied. The Manichæans, a big early group, rejected all the New Testament and used other books instead.

The Cerinthians didn’t accept the Acts of the Apostles. The Encratites and the Sevenians didn’t accept the Acts or Paul’s letters. Around the year 400, Chrysostom said many people didn’t even know who wrote the Acts or what the book was about.

St. Irene, who lived earlier, said the Valentinians and some other groups thought the scriptures had mistakes and contradictions. The Ebionites or Nazarenes, the first Christians, rejected all of Paul’s letters and thought he was fake. They said he was originally a pagan who came to Jerusalem, lived there, and wanted to marry the high priest’s daughter. He got circumcised but couldn’t marry her, so he fought with the Jews and wrote against rules like circumcision and the Sabbath.
