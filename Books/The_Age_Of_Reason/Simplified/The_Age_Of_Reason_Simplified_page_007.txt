It's cool to see that the idea of the Christian Church actually came from old pagan stories. At first, they copied these stories by saying the church’s founder was born from heaven.

The idea of three gods in Christianity came from an older idea of having lots of gods—like twenty or thirty thousand. The statue of Mary replaced the statue of Diana of Ephesus.

Heroes who were once seen as gods became saints instead. In old myths, there were gods for everything; in Christianity, there are saints for everything. The church became just as full of saints as the old religions were full of gods, and both were centered in Rome.

The Christian ideas are mostly just the old gods’ stories changed to fit new goals like power and money. It’s up to reason and thinking to get rid of this mix-up.
