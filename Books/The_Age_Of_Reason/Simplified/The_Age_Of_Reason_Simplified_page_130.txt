It can’t be true that the people who wrote these books were any of the eleven disciples unless we believe they lied on purpose. Matthew says the eleven disciples went to a mountain in Galilee to meet Jesus the day he rose. But Luke and John say the meeting happened the same day in a house in Jerusalem. So, if Luke and John were two of the eleven, then Matthew must be too. But Matthew says the meeting was in Galilee, which doesn’t match Luke and John’s story. This means the stories don’t agree and cancel each other out.

The writer of Mark doesn’t mention any meeting in Galilee. Instead, he says Jesus appeared in a different form to two disciples walking to the countryside, and those two told the others, but they didn’t believe them. Luke tells another story where Jesus stayed busy all day after rising, going with two disciples to a village called Emmaus, about seven and a half miles from Jerusalem. Jesus stayed with them until evening, ate dinner, then disappeared and later showed up at the meeting in Jerusalem.

These stories about Jesus’s reappearance don’t match up. The only thing they agree on is that it happened in secret. Whether it was on a mountain in Galilee or in a locked house in Jerusalem, it was hidden. Why was it so secret? It doesn’t make sense if the goal was to prove Jesus was alive. But if they said it happened in public, the writers might have been caught lying. So, they made it a private event.

About Jesus being seen by more than 500 people at once, only Paul says this. The 500 people themselves don’t say it. So, it’s just one person’s story, and that person is Paul.
