Matthew — This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.  
Mark — The king of the Jews.  
Luke — This is the king of the Jews.  
John — Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the Jews.  

From these small details, we can guess that the people who wrote these stories, whoever they were and whenever they lived, were not actually there when it happened. The only apostle who seemed close to the scene was Peter. But when Peter was accused of being one of Jesus’s followers, it says (in Matthew 26:74) that "Peter began to curse and swear, saying, I don’t know the man." So, we are supposed to believe Peter even after he lied about knowing Jesus. But why should we believe him?

The stories about what happened during the crucifixion are told differently in these four books.  

Matthew’s book says there was darkness over the whole land from noon to 3 p.m., the temple’s curtain tore from top to bottom, there was an earthquake, rocks broke apart, graves opened, and many dead holy people came back to life and appeared to many in the city after Jesus rose. This is what Matthew says, but the other books don’t agree with him.  

Mark’s book doesn’t mention any earthquake, rocks breaking, graves opening, or dead people walking out.  

Luke’s book also says nothing about these things.  

John’s book gives details about the crucifixion and burial of Jesus, but he doesn’t talk about the darkness, the temple curtain, the earthquake, rocks, graves, or dead people at all.  

If these things really happened, and if these four men—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—were actually there at the time, it would be impossible for them not to mention these events if they were telling the truth.  

According to John (19:14), the sentence was passed around noon, so the execution could only happen in the afternoon. But Mark (15:25) says Jesus was crucified at 9 a.m. — the third hour.
