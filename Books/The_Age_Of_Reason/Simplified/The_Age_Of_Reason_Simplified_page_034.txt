If someone can change how a lever works, they can also change how a triangle works. For example, a special kind of lever called a steel-yard makes a triangle shape when it moves. The line it moves down from (with one point on the fulcrum), the line it moves down to, and the curved path the lever’s end makes in the air all form the three sides of a triangle. The other side of the lever makes another triangle too. When you measure these triangles carefully, the sides and angles relate to each other the same way different weights balance on the lever, ignoring the lever’s own weight.

People can also make wheels and axles. They can connect wheels of different sizes to make machines like mills. But in the end, it all comes back to the same idea: people didn’t create the rule that gives wheels their power. This rule is still unchangeable or it might just look different to us.

The power between two wheels of different sizes is in the same ratio as if you connected their half-widths and made a lever from them, hanging at the point where the half-widths meet. Basically, two wheels can be thought of as two circles made by the movement of a special lever.

All our science comes from studying true theology (the study of God). From that knowledge, all the arts and skills have started.

God, the great teacher, shows us the principles of science through how the universe is made. He invites people to learn and copy these ideas. It’s like He says to everyone on Earth, “I made this world for you to live on, and I made the stars in the sky so you can learn science and arts. You can take care of yourselves and learn from my kindness to be good to each other.”

What’s the point of having eyes that can see far into space, full of countless worlds? Or what good is it to see stars like the Pleiades, Orion, Sirius, the North Star, or the planets named Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and Venus?
