Chapter 13: Comparing Christianity with Religious Ideas Inspired by Nature

I’ve already talked about why people started caring more about old languages instead of science. Now, I want to compare what the universe shows us with the Christian religion.

I can’t start better than by sharing some thoughts I had when I was younger. I think a lot of people have had similar thoughts at some point. So, I’ll explain what I thought and add other ideas that come up, starting with a short introduction.

My dad was a Quaker, so I was lucky to have a good moral education and learn useful things. I went to grammar school but didn’t learn Latin. This was partly because I didn’t want to learn languages and partly because Quakers didn’t like the books used to teach Latin. Still, I knew about the topics in all those Latin books.

I was naturally interested in science. I also had some skill in poetry, but I tried not to focus on it too much because it felt too much like daydreaming. As soon as I could, I bought a pair of globes and went to lectures by Martin and Ferguson. Later, I met Dr. Bevis, a great astronomer who was part of the Royal Society and lived in the Temple.

I wasn’t interested in politics. To me, politics just meant people fighting for power. So, when I thought about government, that’s all I could picture.
