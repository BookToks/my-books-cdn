Why do we see Mercury and other stars if there’s no use for them being visible? Humans wouldn’t need such strong eyesight if it was just to look at a huge empty space full of shiny things.

When we see it this way, we realize that nothing was made without a purpose. Our strong eyesight wouldn’t make sense if it didn’t teach us anything.
