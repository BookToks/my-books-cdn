Why do we see Mercury and other stars if there’s no point in them being visible? People wouldn’t need such good eyesight just to look at a big empty space full of shiny things.

But if we think of the starry sky like a book or a science lesson, we find a reason for seeing it. It helps us learn and understand stuff.

When we see it like this, we understand that nothing was made without a purpose. Our sharp eyesight wouldn’t make sense if it didn’t teach us anything.
