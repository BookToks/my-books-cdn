They wrote down these things. If they were true, everyone would have known about them because they were so important and obvious. All the supposed apostles must have seen the earthquake if it really happened, since they couldn’t have missed it. The opening of the graves and dead people walking around the city is even more important than the earthquake.

An earthquake can happen naturally and doesn’t prove anything. But dead people coming back to life is supernatural and directly supports their beliefs and mission. If it were true, it would have been a big part of their stories and talked about a lot by all the writers. Instead, only small, unimportant things and silly conversations are described in detail, while this huge event is barely mentioned by just one writer.

It’s easy to tell a lie but hard to keep it believable afterward. The writer of Matthew should have told us who the saints were that came back to life, what happened to them, and who saw them. He doesn’t even say he saw them himself. Did these saints come out naked or fully dressed? Where did their clothes come from? Did they go back home and get their families and things? Were there fights over their property? Did they keep working or preaching? Or did they die again or go back to their graves?

It’s really strange that a whole group of saints came back to life and no one knows who they were or saw them, and no one talks more about it. If these were famous prophets who predicted this, they would have had a lot to say. We would have had more prophecies with explanations, better than what we have now. If it were important people like Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Samuel, or David, no non-believers would have been left in Jerusalem. If it was John the Baptist and other saints...
