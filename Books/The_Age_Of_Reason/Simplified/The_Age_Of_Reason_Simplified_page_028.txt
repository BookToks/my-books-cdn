Chapter 10 About God and What the Bible Says About Him

The only idea people have about God is that He is the first cause—the reason everything exists. Even though it's really hard to understand what a "first cause" means, people believe in it because it is even harder to believe there isn't one.

It's really hard to imagine that space goes on forever, but it's even harder to imagine that space has an end. It's impossible for us to understand forever lasting time, but it's even more impossible to think about a time when time itself stops.

In the same way, everything we see shows us that it didn’t make itself. Every person knows they didn’t make themselves, and neither did their parents or grandparents. Neither could any tree, plant, or animal make itself. Because of this, we are convinced that there must be a first cause that has always existed. This cause is very different from anything we know, and it’s by its power that everything exists. This first cause is what people call God.

We can only understand God by using reason—our ability to think. Without reason, we wouldn’t understand anything at all. If that were true, reading the Bible to a horse would make as much sense as reading it to a person. So, how can some people say they don’t believe in reason?

Almost the only parts of the Bible that give us any idea about God are some chapters in Job and Psalm 19. I don’t remember any others. These parts talk about God by looking at His works. They treat the world itself as God’s book and don’t refer to any other book. All the ideas they share come from the world around us.
