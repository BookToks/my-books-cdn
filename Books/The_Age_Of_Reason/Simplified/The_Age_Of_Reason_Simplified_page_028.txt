Chapter 10 About God and What the Bible Says About Him

People usually think of God as the first cause—the reason why everything exists. Even though it’s really hard to understand what a "first cause" means, people believe in it because it’s even harder to believe there isn’t one.

It’s hard to imagine space going on forever, but it’s even harder to imagine space having an end. It’s impossible for us to understand time lasting forever, but it’s even more impossible to think about time stopping completely.

In the same way, everything we see shows us it didn’t make itself. Everyone knows they didn’t make themselves, and neither did their parents or grandparents. Trees, plants, and animals didn’t make themselves either. Because of this, we believe there must be a first cause that has always existed. This cause is very different from anything we know, and it’s by its power that everything exists. People call this first cause God.

We can only understand God by using reason—our ability to think. Without reason, we wouldn’t understand anything at all. If that were true, reading the Bible to a horse would be just as useful as reading it to a person. So, how can some people say they don’t believe in reason?

Almost the only parts of the Bible that give us ideas about God are some chapters in Job and Psalm 19. I don’t remember any others. These parts talk about God by looking at what He has made. They treat the world itself like God’s book and don’t mention any other book. All the ideas they share come from the world around us.
