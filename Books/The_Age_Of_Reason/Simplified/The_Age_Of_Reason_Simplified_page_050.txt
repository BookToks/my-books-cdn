Far away from us, a planet goes around its own sun, just like our planets go around our Sun.

If we think about it step by step, we can see that space is full of different systems like ours. No part of space is empty, just like no part of Earth is left unused.

Now, I want to explain why it’s good that the Creator made many worlds like our solar system, with one big Sun and six planets plus moons, instead of making just one huge world.

You might ask, how do we know all this? The answer is simple. People can figure out when an eclipse will happen. They can even tell exactly when Venus will move in a straight line between the Earth and the Sun, looking like a big pea crossing the Sun’s face.

This only happens twice every hundred years, about eight years apart, and it already happened twice in our lifetime. People knew when it would happen because they calculated it. They can also predict when it will happen for thousands of years in the future.

Since people can do these calculations, it proves we understand how the solar system works and how planets move. And being off by a few thousand or even a few million miles doesn’t really matter when the distances are so huge.
