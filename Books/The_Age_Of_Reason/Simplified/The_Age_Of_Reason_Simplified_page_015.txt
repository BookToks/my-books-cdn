Chapter 7: Looking at the Old Testament

These books start with Genesis and end with Revelations, which is a tricky book that needs a special explanation. People say these books are the word of God. So, it’s important to ask: who told us that? That way, we know how much to trust them. The answer is, no one really knows—people just tell each other that it’s true.

Here’s what seems to have happened: a long time ago, church leaders gathered all the writings they could find and organized them however they wanted. We don’t know if the books we now call the Old and New Testament are exactly the same as when those leaders found them, or if they changed or edited them.

Anyway, these leaders voted on which books should be called the Word of God and which should not. They left out some books, called some doubtful (like the Apocrypha), and agreed that the ones with the most votes were the true Word of God. If they had voted differently, Christians today would believe something else, because what people believe comes from what those leaders decided. We don’t really know much about who these leaders were, just that they called themselves the Church.

Since there’s no real outside proof that these books are the word of God—only what I just said, which isn’t real proof—I’m going to look next at what the books themselves say to see if they give any clues.

Earlier, I talked about revelation. Now, I’ll keep going with that idea to see how it relates to these books.
