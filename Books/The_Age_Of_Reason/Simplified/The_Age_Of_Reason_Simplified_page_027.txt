There is no one universal language that everyone understands. Because of this, no language can be used to share true, unchanging information with everyone. This means God doesn’t use any human language to show himself to all people.

The only thing that connects all our ideas about God is Creation. Creation speaks a language everyone can understand, no matter what human language they speak. It’s always there for everyone to see. It can’t be faked, lost, changed, or hidden. It doesn’t need people to share it—it shares itself all over the world. It speaks to all nations and even beyond, showing us everything we need to know about God.

If we want to see God’s power, we can look at how huge Creation is. If we want to see God’s wisdom, we can see it in the way everything in the universe follows a perfect order. If we want to see God’s kindness, we can see it in how much the earth gives us. And if we want to see God’s mercy, we notice that he shares all this even with people who don’t appreciate it.

In the end, if we want to understand what God is, don’t just read books made by humans. Instead, look at the book called Creation.
