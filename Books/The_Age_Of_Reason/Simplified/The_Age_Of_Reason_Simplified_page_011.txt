He convinces her to eat an apple, and because of that apple, all humans are doomed.

After Satan wins this big victory over everything, youâ€™d think the church storytellers would put him back in the pit or at least bury him under a mountain to stop him from causing more trouble with women. They say their faith can move mountains, right? But instead, they just let him roam free without even making him promise to behave.

The reason is they actually need him. After making him, they paid him off to stay. They promised him all the Jews, all the Turks ahead of time, most of the rest of the world, and even Muhammad too. After that, who could doubt how generous Christian stories are?

After making a big fight in heaven where nobody could get hurt, putting Satan in the pit, letting him out again, giving him a win over all creation, and blaming all humans for eating an apple, Christian storytellers tie it all together. They show Jesus Christ as both God and man, the Son of God, born in heaven on purpose to be sacrificed because Eve wanted to eat an apple.
