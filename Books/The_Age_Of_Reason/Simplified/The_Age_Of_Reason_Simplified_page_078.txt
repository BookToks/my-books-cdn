The writer of the Chronicles said in 1 Chronicles 1:43 that these were the kings who ruled Edom before any king ruled Israel. He said this because he was about to give a list of Israel’s kings. But since that phrase couldn’t have been used before that time, it’s very likely that part of Genesis actually comes from Chronicles. This means Genesis is probably not as old as Chronicles, and maybe not as old as the book of Homer or Aesop’s Fables. Homer is thought to have lived around the same time as David or Solomon, and Aesop lived near the end of the Jewish kingdom.

If you stop believing Moses wrote Genesis, which is the main reason some people think it’s the word of God, then Genesis is just a book full of stories, fables, and made-up or silly things, or even lies. The stories about Eve and the serpent, and Noah and his ark, become just like the Arabian Nights stories, but not even as fun. The idea that people lived 800 or 900 years is just as fake as the stories about giants in mythology.

Also, the Bible’s description of Moses shows him as a terrible person. If those stories are true, he was the first to start wars in the name of religion and did some of the worst crimes ever recorded in history. For example, when the Jewish army came back from a violent raid, Moses was angry because some women were still alive. He told the soldiers to kill all the male children and any women who had been with men, but to keep the young girls alive for themselves (Numbers 31:13-18). It’s hard to find anyone worse than Moses in history if these stories are true.
