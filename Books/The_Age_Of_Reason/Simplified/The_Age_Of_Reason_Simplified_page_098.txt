The people who made the Bible and decided when each part happened seemed unsure about where to put the book of Job. This book doesn’t talk about any real events or give clues about when it was written. But these Bible experts didn’t want to admit they didn’t know, so they said it was from around 1520 B.C., when the Israelites were in Egypt. They don’t really have proof for this, just like I could say it was a thousand years earlier and be just as right. Most likely, Job is older than any other book in the Bible, and it’s the only one you can read without feeling angry or upset.

We don’t know much about the ancient non-Jewish people, who are often called Gentiles, before the time of the Jews. The Jews often said bad things about other nations, so it’s from their stories that we learned to call these people “heathens.” But as far as we can tell, these Gentiles were fair and moral, not cruel or revengeful like the Jews sometimes were. We don’t know what they believed, though. They often made statues and images to show good and bad qualities, like how we use art today, but that doesn’t mean they worshipped these statues any more than we do.

Next is the book of Psalms. There’s no need to say much about it. Some Psalms teach good morals, but others are full of anger and revenge. Most of them are about specific events that happened to the Jewish people back then.
