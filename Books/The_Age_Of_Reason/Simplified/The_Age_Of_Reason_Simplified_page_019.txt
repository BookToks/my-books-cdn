Saul was said to have prophesied with others. But later, it says he did it badly because an "evil spirit from God" came upon him, and he prophesied. If this was the only part of the Bible we had, it would already show us that the original meaning of "prophesy" is different from what we think today. 

Back then, the word "prophesy" didn’t mean what it means now. It didn’t always have a religious meaning. It was more like saying someone was a poet or a musician, no matter if they were good or bad people. The word was used for poetry and music, not just for predicting the future or religious talks.

Deborah and Barak were called prophets, not because they predicted stuff, but because they wrote a poem or song to celebrate something that already happened. David is also called a prophet because he was a musician and probably wrote the Psalms. But Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob aren’t called prophets because there’s no record that they sang, played music, or wrote poetry.

The Bible talks about greater and lesser prophets. But this is strange because if prophesying means predicting the future, you can’t really have levels or degrees of it. However, you can have better or worse poets. So it makes more sense to think of "prophets" as poets with different skills.

Because of this, we don’t really need to argue about what the prophets wrote. The real issue is that people misunderstood the word “prophesy” from the start. So, all the respect and deep study given to their writings might be based on a mistake. Still, many writings by Jewish poets deserve to be appreciated for what they really are.
