This is what Cyrus, king of Persia, says: The Lord God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He told me to build a house for Him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. If you are part of His people, may the Lord be with you, and let you go there.

In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, the Lord’s promise spoken through Jeremiah started to happen. The Lord made Cyrus take action.

The last verse in Chronicles ends suddenly in the middle of a sentence with the word “up,” without saying where. This sudden stop and the fact that the same verses appear in different books show that the Bible was put together in a messy way. The people who put it together didn’t have proper authority, and there is no real proof that what they did is fully trustworthy.

I also found other confusing and broken parts in the Bible but didn’t think they were important enough to mention before. For example, in 1 Samuel 13:1, it says, “Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel, Saul chose three thousand men.” This doesn’t make sense because it first says Saul reigned one year, then says he reigned two years, which is impossible.

Another example is in Joshua chapter 5, where a story is told about an angel appearing to Joshua. The story ends suddenly without a clear ending. It says Joshua saw a man with a sword, asked if he was for them or their enemies, and the man said he was the captain of the Lord’s army. Joshua worshiped him, and then the angel told Joshua to take off his shoe because the ground was holy. And then the story just stops.

Either the story is cut off, or it was meant as a joke about Joshua’s mission from God. The people who put the Bible together didn’t realize this and told it as a serious story. If it was a joke, it’s funny because it builds up this important angel with a sword, but the message ends with Joshua just needing to take off his shoe, which is a small, silly thing. The Jews didn’t believe everything their leaders said either, shown by how they spoke casually about Moses when he went up the mountain, saying, “We don’t know what happened to him.”
