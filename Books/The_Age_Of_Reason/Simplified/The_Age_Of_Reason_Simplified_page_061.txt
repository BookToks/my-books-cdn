Overall, Mystery, Miracle, and Prophecy are parts of made-up stories, not real religion. They are ways that many "Look here!" and "Look there!" moments have been spread around the world.

Because of this, religion turned into a business.

When one fake person succeeded, it gave hope to another fake person. They felt okay about tricking others because they thought doing some good while pretending was not so bad.
