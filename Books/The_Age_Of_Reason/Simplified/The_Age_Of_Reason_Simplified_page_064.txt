Preface  

I said earlier in The Age of Reason that I wanted to share my ideas about Religion someday, but I planned to do it later in life as my last project. However, things happening in France at the end of 1793 made me decide to go ahead and publish now.  

The fair and kind ideas of the Revolution, which came from Philosophy, were being ignored. The belief that priests could forgive sins—an idea that’s always risky for society and disrespectful to God—seemed gone but actually made people less caring and ready to do terrible things. The church’s intolerance turned into political cruelty. The Revolutionary courts acted like the Inquisition, and the Guillotine was like the old Stakes for punishment. I saw many close friends killed, others sent to prison every day, and I believed I was in danger too.  

Despite all this, I started writing the first part of The Age of Reason. I didn’t have a Bible or Testament to check, even though I was arguing against them, and I couldn’t find any to use. Yet, I made a book that no Bible believer, even with all their church books, can prove wrong.  

Near the end of December that year, a rule was passed to kick foreigners out of the Convention. Only two of us were foreigners—Anacharsis Cloots and me—and I noticed Bourdon de l'Oise specifically called me out in his speech about it.  

After that, I thought I only had a few days left of freedom. So I quickly finished the work. I had just finished it for about six hours when, around three in the morning, a guard came with an order from the Committees of Public Safety and Surety General to arrest me as a foreigner and take me to Luxembourg prison. On the way, I managed to visit Joel Barlow and gave him the manuscript, thinking it would be safer with him than in prison. Not knowing what would happen to me or my work in France, I asked the people of the United States to protect it.
