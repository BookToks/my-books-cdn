Prophecies are often seen as predictions about the future. I believe this because the books called prophecies are written like poems. Also, in the Bible, the only word that means something like a poet is "prophet."

The word "prophet" originally meant someone who played musical instruments. For example, groups of prophets sang and played instruments like harps and pipes. Even Saul, a king, did this. From these stories, it seems that prophets were more about poetry and music.

People who actually saw visions or had insights into hidden things were called "seers," not prophets. This changed later when the word "seer" stopped being used, probably when Saul got rid of people he called wizards. After that, the idea of seeing the future got mixed into the meaning of "prophet."

Today, we think of prophets as people who predict events far in the future. This new meaning was needed to make old prophecies fit with the stories in the New Testament. But in the Old Testament, prophets and seers only talked about things happening around their own time, like battles, trips, or problems they were facing.

This kind of prophecy is more like fortune-telling, where people predict things like wealth, marriage, or finding lost items. It's not the fault of the Jewish people but of the Christian church and modern superstition that these old prophecies were made to seem like predictions of far-off events.
