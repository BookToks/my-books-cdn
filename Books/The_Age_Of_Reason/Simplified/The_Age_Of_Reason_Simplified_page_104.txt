People back then could easily find a girl who was pregnant or even get her pregnant, so it wasn’t hard to make a sign like the one Isaiah talked about. Maybe Isaiah already knew a pregnant woman. I don’t think the prophets back then were any more honest than the priests today.  

Anyway, Isaiah says in the next chapter, verse 2, "I found some trustworthy people to watch this, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah, and I went to a prophetess who got pregnant and had a son." So, this is the full story, even if it sounds silly, about the child and the virgin.  

Later, the book of Matthew and some priests took this story and made a whole idea called the gospel. They said it was about a person named Jesus Christ, who was born from a ghost they called holy, with a woman who was married and called a virgin, and this happened 700 years after Isaiah’s story. I personally think this story is just made up and not true at all.  

To see how wrong Isaiah’s story is, we just need to look at what happened next. The book of Isaiah doesn’t say much about it, but 2 Chronicles chapter 28 tells us that the two kings actually won their fight against Ahaz, king of Judah, which Isaiah said wouldn’t happen. Ahaz was defeated, 120,000 people were killed, Jerusalem was robbed, and 200,000 women and children were taken away as prisoners.  

So that shows Isaiah was lying and the book with his name is full of false stories. Now, about the book of Jeremiah: he lived during the time when Nebuchadnezzar attacked Jerusalem, under King Zedekiah, Judah’s last king. People thought Jeremiah might have been a traitor helping Nebuchadnezzar.  

Everything about Jeremiah shows he was a tricky guy. In his story about the potter and the clay (chapter 18), he made sure his predictions were vague so he could avoid blame if things didn’t happen as he said.
