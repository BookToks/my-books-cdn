The people living in their own systems are like us living in ours. This happens all over the huge space around us.

When we think about how big and well-made the universe is, we understand better how powerful, smart, and kind the Creator is. Instead of just thinking about one lonely world floating in space, we start to imagine many worlds working together like a big group. They move in ways that teach us things.

We see that our Earth has a lot of resources, but we often forget that this is because of the scientific knowledge we have gained from understanding how the universe works.
