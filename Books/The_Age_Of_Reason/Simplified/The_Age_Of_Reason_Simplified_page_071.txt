Historians also talk about some miracles. For example, Josephus tells a story about the sea of Pamphilia opening up to let Alexander and his army pass, kind of like how the Red Sea parted in the Bible’s Exodus story. These miracles are just as well proven as the ones in the Bible, but people don’t believe them. This shows that we need a lot of strong proof to believe things that seem impossible, no matter if they come from the Bible or somewhere else.

Because of this, people who support the Bible can’t just expect us to believe it because we believe other old writings. We believe those old writings only when they seem likely, make sense, or are obvious, like math by Euclid. Sometimes we like them because they are beautiful, like Homer’s stories, or smart, like Plato’s or Aristotle’s ideas.

Now, I want to look at how real the Bible is. I’ll start with the first five books, called the five books of Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. My goal is to show that these books aren’t real works by Moses. They were not written when Moses lived but hundreds of years later. They are just an attempt to tell the story of Moses and his time, written by people who were not very smart, long after Moses died. It’s like how people write about old stories today, even if those stories happened a long time ago.

I will only use the Bible itself to prove this. If I used old writers that Bible supporters call non-believers, they would argue against those sources just like I argue against theirs. So, I’ll keep the argument inside the Bible.

First, there is no real proof that Moses wrote these books. Saying Moses did write them is just a guess that spread around for unknown reasons. The way these books are written doesn’t sound like Moses wrote them. They sound like someone else telling the story about Moses. In Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, everything is written in the third person, like “the Lord said to Moses,” or “Moses said to…” In Genesis, which tells about times before Moses, Moses isn’t mentioned at all.
