Since it was easier to fake things, there were also more reasons to do it. Someone wouldn’t get anything by writing under names like Homer or Euclid. If they were as good as those writers, it would be better to use their own name. If they were worse, they wouldn’t do well anyway. Pride stopped people from pretending to be those writers, and it was impossible to copy perfectly.  

But with books like those in the New Testament, there were lots of reasons to fake them. Even the best fake story made hundreds of years later couldn’t pass as the real thing written by the original author. The only way to trick people was to pretend it was a forgery. The church needed fake stories to support its new ideas because truth and skill didn’t matter.  

Back then, it was normal to tell stories about people walking after they died, ghosts, and spirits of those who died violently. People believed in angels, devils, and even that devils could get inside people and shake them like a bad fever before being forced out. For example, Mary Magdalene was said to have seven devils inside her. So, it wasn’t weird that stories like this spread about Jesus Christ. These stories became the basis for the four books named after Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Each writer told the story as they heard it and named their book after the person tradition said saw it happen. This is why the stories don’t always match up. If this isn’t true, then the books are just lies and fake stories.  

It’s clear these books were written by people who were partly Jewish. They often mention Moses, who is called a killer and trickster, and the prophets. The church accepted this fake history by making the Bible and the New Testament respond to each other. Christians who were Jewish and those who were not tried hard to connect prophecies and their meanings, signs and what they stood for, like matching old locks and keys. The story about Eve and the serpent is silly but makes sense because snakes always bite near the heel since they can’t reach higher, and people hit snakes on the head because it’s the best way to stop them.
