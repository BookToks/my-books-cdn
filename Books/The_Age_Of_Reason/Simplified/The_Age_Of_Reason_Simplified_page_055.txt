Chapter 17: Ways People Have Always Used to Trick Others

I’ve already shown that the real word of God found in the universe doesn’t match the so-called word of God written in books made by people. Now, I want to talk about the three main ways people have always used to fool others.

These three ways are Mystery, Miracle, and Prophecy. The first two don’t fit with real religion, and the last one should always make us question things.

About Mystery: everything around us is kind of a mystery. We don’t really understand how we exist or how plants grow. For example, we don’t know how an acorn turns into a big oak tree. We don’t know how a tiny seed grows so much.

But even though we don’t know exactly how it happens, the fact that it does isn’t a mystery. We see it happen, and we know what to do—just plant the seed in the ground. We know enough. The part we don’t understand is done by the Creator for us. So, it’s better we don’t know everything because we wouldn’t be able to do it ourselves.

Even though everything is a mystery in this way, the word “mystery” shouldn’t be used for moral truth, just like you can’t call light “obscure.” The God we believe in is about truth, not mystery or confusion. Mystery hides the truth and twists it. Truth never covers itself with mystery. When something is mysterious, it’s because someone is trying to hide the truth, not because truth itself is mysterious.
