A country girl quietly sneaks to bed with her cousin Boaz. It feels pretty cool to be called the word of God. This book is one of the best in the Bible because it doesn’t have any murder or violence.

Next, I talk about the two books of Samuel. These books were not written by Samuel, and they were written long after he died. Like the earlier books, they don’t say who wrote them and don’t have official approval.

To see that these books were written much later than Samuel’s time, just read the story about Saul looking for his father’s lost donkeys and meeting Samuel. Saul asks Samuel about the donkeys, kind of like how people today go to a fortune teller to find lost things.

The writer tells this story not like it just happened, but like it was an old story in the writer’s own time. The writer uses the old language from Samuel’s time and then explains it using the language people spoke when the writer lived.

In the first book of Samuel, chapter 9, Samuel is called “the seer.” Saul asks, “Is the seer here?” when he meets some girls at a well. Saul follows their directions and meets Samuel without knowing who he is. Saul asks, “Where is the seer's house?” and Samuel answers, “I am the seer.”

Because the writer tells this story using the old way of talking, which was no longer used when the book was written, he explains it in verse 9. He says that long ago, people said “seer” when they wanted to ask God something. Now, they say “prophet.” This shows the story about Saul, Samuel, and the donkeys was an old story when the book of Samuel was written. So, Samuel didn’t write it, and the book is not really trustworthy.
