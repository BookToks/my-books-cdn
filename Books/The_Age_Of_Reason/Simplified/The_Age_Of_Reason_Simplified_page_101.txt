Those songs were supposed to be holy, but Solomon was actually living a wild life back then.

Also, if Solomon really wrote the book of Ecclesiastes later, he said everything, including those songs, was meaningless and frustrating. This makes sense because in Ecclesiastes 2:8, he talks about having men-singers and women-singers, probably singing those songs, then says everything was just vanity and trouble.

The people who put the songs together didn’t finish their job right—they gave us the songs but didn’t include the tunes, so we can’t even sing them.

The rest of the Bible has books called the Prophets—there are sixteen of them, starting with Isaiah and ending with Malachi. I already listed them when talking about Chronicles. Out of these sixteen, only Isaiah and Jeremiah are mentioned in the history books of Kings and Chronicles. I’ll start with those two and talk about what kind of people the prophets were later.

If you read Isaiah’s book, you’ll find it really confusing and messy. It doesn’t have a clear beginning, middle, or end. Except for a small history part and some notes in the first few chapters, it’s mostly loud and crazy writing, full of wild comparisons that don’t really mean much. Even a school kid wouldn’t write something like this. It’s basically writing that’s lost its way.

The history part starts at chapter 36 and goes to chapter 39. It talks about events during King Hezekiah’s time, when Isaiah lived. This part starts and ends suddenly and doesn’t connect to the chapters before or after it, or anywhere else in the book. Isaiah probably wrote this part himself because he was involved in those events. But other than this, almost no chapters connect with each other. Some chapters are called things like “the burden of Babylon,” “the burden of Moab,” “the burden of Damascus,” and “the burden of Egypt.”
