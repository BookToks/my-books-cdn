Imagine a long time has passed, at least a few generations, because this way of talking takes you back to really old times.

The story is pretty silly, and it shows that the writer of the book of Matthew wasn’t very smart. He tells a story that doesn’t make sense. He says the guards were asleep when Jesus’ body was taken, so they couldn’t stop it. But if they were asleep, they wouldn’t know how or who took the body. Still, the story says it was the disciples who did it. If someone said they saw something happen while they were asleep, no one would believe them. This kind of story might work in a religious book, but not if you want the truth.

Now, let’s talk about the part in these books where Jesus is said to have appeared after he came back to life.

The writer of Matthew says an angel sitting on a stone told two women, the Marys (Matthew 28:7), “Jesus has gone ahead of you to Galilee; you will see him there.” Then, right after the angel spoke, Jesus himself told the same thing to these women. They ran quickly to tell the disciples. Later, it says (verse 16) that the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to a mountain where Jesus had told them to meet, and when they saw him, they worshiped him.

But the writer of John tells a very different story. He says (John 20:19) that on the same day Jesus rose, in the evening, when the doors were locked because the disciples were scared of the Jews, Jesus appeared among them. According to Matthew, the eleven disciples were going to Galilee to meet Jesus on a mountain, but John says they were all together in a different place, hiding, without any plan.

The writer of Luke (24:13, 33-36) disagrees with Matthew even more clearly. He says the meeting happened in Jerusalem on the evening of the same day Jesus rose, and that the eleven disciples were there.
