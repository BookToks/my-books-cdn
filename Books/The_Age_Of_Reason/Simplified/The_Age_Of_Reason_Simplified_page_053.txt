Chapter 16: Applying What We’ve Learned to Christianity

So, when we think about the Christian belief, it’s based on the idea that there’s only one world—our Earth—and it’s not even that big. It’s about 25,000 miles around. Imagine someone walking 3 miles every hour for 12 hours a day, just going in circles—they’d walk all the way around the Earth in less than two years. But that’s nothing compared to the huge space out there and the incredible power of God!

Then, where did the strange idea come from that God, who has millions of worlds to care for, would leave all those other worlds alone and come to die here on Earth just because, they say, one man and one woman ate an apple? And if that’s true, are we supposed to believe every world out there had an Eve, an apple, a snake, and a savior? If so, then the Son of God—or God himself—would have to keep traveling from world to world, dying over and over again without much rest.

Many weird religious ideas started because people ignored the clear evidence from God’s creation that we can see and understand using our reason. There might be many religions that are good in some ways, but there can only be one true religion. That true religion has to agree with what we see in God’s creation. But the way Christian faith is often explained, everything we see in the universe either goes against it or makes it seem ridiculous.

I like to believe—and it makes me happy to think—that there have been people in the world who truly understood...
