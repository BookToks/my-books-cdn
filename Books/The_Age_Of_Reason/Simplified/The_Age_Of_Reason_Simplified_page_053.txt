Chapter 16: Applying What We’ve Learned to Christianity

When we think about Christian beliefs, they are based on the idea that there is only one world—our Earth—and it’s not even that big. The Earth is about 25,000 miles around. Imagine someone walking 3 miles every hour for 12 hours a day, just going around in circles—they’d walk all the way around the Earth in less than two years. But that’s nothing compared to the huge space out there and how powerful God is!

So, where did the strange idea come from that God, who has millions of worlds to take care of, would leave all those other worlds alone and come to die here on Earth just because one man and one woman ate an apple? And if that’s true, are we supposed to believe every world out there had an Eve, an apple, a snake, and a savior? If so, then God’s Son would have to keep traveling from world to world, dying over and over without much rest.

Many weird religious ideas started because people ignored the clear proof from God’s creation that we can see and understand using our reason. There might be many religions that are good in some ways, but there can only be one true religion. That true religion has to match what we see in God’s creation. But the way Christian faith is often explained, everything we see in the universe either goes against it or makes it seem silly.

I like to believe—and it makes me happy to think—that there have been people in the world who truly understood...
