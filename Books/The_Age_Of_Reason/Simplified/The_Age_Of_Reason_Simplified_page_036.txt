The Christian faith changed not only religion but also the way people learn. What we call learning today wasn’t always seen that way. Learning isn’t just about knowing languages, but about understanding the things those languages talk about.

The Greeks were very smart people, but they didn’t think being smart meant just speaking Greek. It’s the same for Romans with Latin, or French people with French, and English people with English.

From what we know, the Greeks only knew their own language. This helped them focus more on important subjects. Their schools taught science and philosophy, not languages. Real learning came from understanding science and philosophy.

Most of the science we have now came from the Greeks or people who spoke Greek. So, people from other countries had to learn Greek to read and translate these important books into their own languages.

Learning Greek or Latin was hard work and was just a tool to get the real knowledge from those books. Knowing the language wasn’t the same as understanding the ideas inside. It’s very likely that some people who learned enough Greek to translate books like Euclid’s Elements didn’t really understand the science in them.
