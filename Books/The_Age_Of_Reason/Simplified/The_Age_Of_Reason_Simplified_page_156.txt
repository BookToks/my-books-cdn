The Discourse on the Method is a book about philosophy and math written by René Descartes in 1637. Its full title is Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason, and Searching for Truth in the Sciences. The book is famous for the quote "I think, therefore I am," which appears in Part IV. A similar phrase in Latin, "Cogito ergo sum," is in another of Descartes' works called Principles of Philosophy. Also, in one of its extra sections called La Géométrie, Descartes first introduced the Cartesian coordinate system.

The Discourse on the Method is super important in the history of modern science. It shows a way of thinking that helped modern science grow. In the book, Descartes deals with the idea of doubting everything, a problem that had been talked about by older thinkers like Sextus Empiricus, Al-Ghazali, and Michel de Montaigne. Descartes changed this idea by finding one truth he couldn't doubt. He started by doubting everything to see the world with fresh eyes, without any old ideas.

The book was first published in French in Leiden, along with some of Descartes' other works. Later, it was translated into Latin and published in Amsterdam in 1656.

Together with Descartes' other writings—Meditations on First Philosophy, Principles of Philosophy, and Rules for the Direction of the Mind—this book forms the base of a way of thinking called Cartesianism.

The Federalist Papers are a set of 85 essays written to support the approval of the United States Constitution. Seventy-seven of these essays were first published one by one in newspapers called The Independent Journal and The New York Packet from October 1787 to August 1788. All of the essays, plus eight more, were put together in a book called The Federalist in 1788.

The Federalist Papers help explain the Constitution because they show the ideas and reasons behind it.
