At first, this world might seem really big to us. But if we compare it to the huge space it floats in, like a bubble in the air, it’s actually much smaller than even a tiny grain of sand is to the whole Earth, or a drop of dew to the ocean. So, it’s really small. And, as we will see later, it is just one of many worlds that make up the whole universe.

It’s not hard to get a rough idea of how huge space is if we think step by step. When we think about a room, we imagine walls that stop us. But when we look up at the open sky, we can’t imagine any walls or edges. If we try to imagine an edge, we immediately wonder what’s beyond it, and then what’s beyond that, and keep asking until we get tired and realize there is no end. So, the Creator didn’t need a small space when making this world. We need to look for another reason why the world is the size it is.

If we look at our world, or the part of it given to us by the Creator, we find every part—land, water, and air—is full of life. From the biggest animals we know, to tiny insects we can just see, and even smaller creatures too small to see without a microscope. Every tree, plant, and leaf is home to many living things, even so small that a tiny blade of grass could feed thousands of them.

Since no part of our Earth is empty, why would we think that the huge space out there is just empty and useless? There is room for millions of worlds as big or bigger than ours, and they are millions of miles apart from each other.

Now, if we think one step further, we might understand a good reason why we are happy. The Creator didn’t make just one world...
