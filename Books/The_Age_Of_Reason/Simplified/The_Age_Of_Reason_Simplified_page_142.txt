Do I really have to believe that my exact same body has to come back for my mind to keep living after death?

Earlier in The Age of Reason, I said nature is the true and only real word of God. This part of nature not only suggests but proves that this could be true. Believing in an afterlife makes sense because we see clues in nature. It’s no harder to believe that we will exist later in a better form than it is to believe that a worm can turn into a butterfly and leave the dirt for the sky, especially since we know that really happens.

As for the confusing words Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 15, which some Christian groups use at funerals, they don’t make sense. They don’t explain anything or help us imagine anything. They just leave you guessing. Paul says, "Not all flesh is the same flesh. There is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for fish, and another for birds." So what? That tells us nothing. He also says, "There are bodies in heaven and bodies on earth; the glory of heavenly bodies is different from earthly ones." And again, so what? He doesn’t explain what the difference really means. He says, "There is one glory of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars." What does that mean? Just that stars shine differently, which we already know. This sounds like nonsense a magician might say to confuse people who believe in fortune telling. Priests and magicians are kind of the same in this way.

Sometimes Paul tries to sound like a scientist and uses plants to explain resurrection. He says, "You fool, what you plant doesn’t come to life unless it dies." But you could answer him with his own words and say, "You fool, what you plant doesn’t come to life unless it doesn’t die," because seeds that die in the ground never grow. Only the living seeds grow into new plants. So his example doesn’t really work. It’s about one thing following another, not about coming back to life.

The way animals change from one form to another, like a worm into a butterfly, fits this idea better. But the example of the seed doesn’t work and shows Paul’s mistake, like he calls others fools.
