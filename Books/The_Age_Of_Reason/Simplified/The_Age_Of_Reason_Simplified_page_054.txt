People might have thought that a "pious fraud"—a lie told for a good reason—could sometimes do some good. But once the lie started, it couldn’t be explained or stopped. A pious fraud is like a bad action; it forces you to keep going with it.

The first people who taught the Christian faith, and mixed it with the morals Jesus talked about, might have believed it was better than the old myths people believed before. The lie passed from the first teachers to the next ones, and then to others, until people forgot it was a lie and really believed it was true. This belief was also helped by people who made money by preaching it.

Even though most regular people believed this way, it’s hard to explain why the church kept attacking science and scientists for hundreds of years. The church must have known, from records or stories, that it started as a pious fraud or at least knew it couldn’t hold up against proof about how the universe really works.
