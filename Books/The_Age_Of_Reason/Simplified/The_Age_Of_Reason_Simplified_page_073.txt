The story talks about Moses speaking through the whole first verse and the first line of the second verse. It introduces Moses for the last time and shows him still talking until the end of chapter 33.

After finishing Moses’ part, the writer talks in the last chapter. He says Moses went to the top of Pisgah and saw the land that was promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Moses died there in the land of Moab. The writer says Moses was buried in a valley in Moab, but no one knows where his grave is, even up to the time when the writer lived and wrote the book of Deuteronomy. The writer also says Moses was 110 years old when he died, and his eyes were still clear and strong. The writer ends by saying no prophet in Israel was ever like Moses, who knew God face to face.

From the way the story is told, it looks like Moses didn’t write these books. I will soon talk about some mistakes in the book of Deuteronomy and then explain, based on history and timelines, why Moses couldn’t have written them. Because of this, there’s no reason to believe that the terrible killings of men, women, and children in those books really happened as they say God ordered them to do. Every true believer in God should defend God’s fairness against the bad things said in the Bible.

The person who wrote the book of Deuteronomy is unknown. The story about Moses is unclear and even contradicts itself.

The writer says Moses went to the top of Pisgah and never came down again. Then he says Moses died there in Moab and was buried in a valley there. But it’s not clear who buried Moses. If the writer means God buried him, how would the writer know that? Why should we believe it if we don’t even know who the writer is? Moses himself couldn’t have told anyone where he was buried.

The writer also says that no one knows where Moses’ grave is, even in the writer’s own time. So how would the writer know that Moses was buried in a valley?
