Everyone has the right to make up stories about how the world started, just like anyone else. Since Moses wasn’t an Israelite, he might not have wanted to go against their traditions. Still, this story doesn’t hurt anyone; that’s more than you can say for many other parts of the Bible.

When we read the dirty stories, the crazy parties, the harsh punishments, and the angry feelings that fill more than half of the Bible, it makes more sense to call it the word of a demon instead of the Word of God. It’s a history full of bad stuff that has helped make people cruel and tough. For me, I really hate it, just like I hate anything mean.

Most of the Bible, except for a few parts, is something we should either hate or look down on until we get to the confusing parts. In the anonymous writings, like the Psalms and the Book of Job, especially Job, we find many respectful thoughts about God’s power and kindness. But these writings aren’t any better than many other works on the same topics, both before and after that time.

The Proverbs, said to be Solomon’s but probably a collection from different people, give good advice about life. They aren’t as sharp as Spanish sayings and not wiser or more practical than those by the American Franklin.

The rest of the Bible, mostly called the Prophets, was written by Jewish poets and traveling preachers who mixed poetry, stories, and religious feelings. Even in translation, these works still sound like poetry. For example, one line says, “Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth! It is God himself who calls for attention.”

Another example is from the sad prophet Jeremiah, with these lines added to explain the meaning:  
“O, that mine head were waters and mine eyes  
Were fountains flowing like the liquid skies;  
Then would I give the mighty flood release  
And weep a deluge for the human race.”
