Everyone has the right to create stories about how the world began, just like anyone else. Since Moses wasn’t an Israelite, he might not have wanted to go against the tradition. Still, this story doesn’t do any harm; that’s more than can be said for many other parts of the Bible.

When we read the dirty stories, the wild partying, the cruel punishments, and the unforgiving anger that fill more than half of the Bible, it makes more sense to call it the word of a demon rather than the Word of God. It’s a history full of evil that has helped to corrupt and harden people. For me, I really hate it, just like I hate anything cruel.

Most of the Bible, except for a few parts, is something we should either hate or look down on until we reach the mixed-up parts. In the anonymous writings, like the Psalms and the Book of Job, especially the latter, we find many respectful thoughts about God’s power and kindness. But these writings are no better than many other works on the same subjects, both before and after that time.

The Proverbs, said to be Solomon’s but probably a collection from different people, show good advice about life. They are not as sharp as the Spanish proverbs and not wiser or more practical than those by the American Franklin.

The rest of the Bible, mostly called the Prophets, was written by Jewish poets and traveling preachers who mixed poetry, stories, and religious feelings. Even in translation, these works still sound like poetry. For example, one line says, “Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth! It is God himself who calls for attention.”

Another example is from the sad prophet Jeremiah, with these lines added to explain the meaning:  
“O, that mine head were waters and mine eyes  
Were fountains flowing like the liquid skies;  
Then would I give the mighty flood release  
And weep a deluge for the human race.”
