There’s a story in the second chapter of the book of Kings about some kids who called Elisha “bald head.” Elisha, who was a man of God, turned around, looked at them, and cursed them in God’s name. Then, two female bears came out of the woods and attacked forty-two of the kids.

Another story from 2 Kings 13 is about a man being buried in the same tomb as Elisha. When they lowered the dead man into the tomb, he touched Elisha’s bones and came back to life, standing up on his feet. The story doesn’t say if they buried him again or took him out.

The writer of Chronicles doesn’t tell these stories at all. It’s like how some writers today might skip stories that seem unbelievable or made up.

Even though these two histories sometimes tell different stories, both don’t talk much about the prophets whose writings fill much of the later Bible. Isaiah, who lived during King Hezekiah’s time, is mentioned a few times in Kings and Chronicles, but most other prophets are hardly mentioned or even hinted at, even though they lived during the same time or earlier.

If these prophets were really important, like the Bible and later teachers say, why don’t these histories mention them?

The books of Kings and Chronicles cover history up to around 588 B.C., so it’s good to check which prophets lived before then.

Here’s a list showing when the prophets lived before Christ, based on the dates in their books, and how long before Kings and Chronicles were written: For example, Isaiah lived around 760 B.C., which is 91 years before the books of Kings and Chronicles were written.
