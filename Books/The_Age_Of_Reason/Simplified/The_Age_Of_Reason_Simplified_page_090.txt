There is a story in the second chapter of the same book of Kings about some kids who called Elisha "bald head." Elisha, who was a man of God, turned around, looked at them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. Then, two female bears came out of the woods and attacked forty-two of the kids. 

Another story from 2 Kings 13 tells about a man who was being buried in the same tomb as Elisha. When they lowered the dead man into the tomb, he touched Elisha’s bones and came back to life, standing up on his feet. The story doesn’t say if they buried him again or pulled him out.

The writer of Chronicles doesn’t mention these stories at all. It’s like how some writers today might avoid telling stories that seem unbelievable or like made-up tales.

Even though these two histories sometimes tell different stories, both stay quiet about the prophets whose writings fill much of the later Bible. Isaiah, who lived during King Hezekiah’s time, is mentioned a few times in Kings and Chronicles, but most other prophets are hardly mentioned or even hinted at, even though they lived during the same time or earlier.

If these prophets were really important, as the Bible and later priests and teachers say, why don’t the histories mention them?

The books of Kings and Chronicles cover history up to around 588 B.C., so it’s good to check which prophets lived before then.

Here’s a list showing when the prophets lived before Christ, based on the dates given in their books, and how long before Kings and Chronicles were written: For example, Isaiah lived around 760 B.C., which is 91 years before the books of Kings and Chronicles were written.
