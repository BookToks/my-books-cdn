The Bible doesn’t include Hebrew ideas about God having two meetings with the "sons of God," or about Satan being near God.

Also, the book seems to be written by someone who knew a lot about science. The Jews didn’t know much about science back then. The book talks a lot about natural science, but in a different way than Hebrew books.

The names for stars like Pleiades, Orion, and Arcturus are Greek, not Hebrew. The Bible doesn’t show that the Jews studied astronomy. They just used these Greek star names from the poem without changing them into Hebrew.

It’s clear that the Jews translated stories from other countries into Hebrew and mixed them with their own stories. For example, Proverbs 31:1 says, "The words of King Lemuel, which his mother taught him." Lemuel wasn’t a king of Israel or Judah but from another country, so he wasn’t Jewish. Yet, the Jews accepted his sayings.

Also, no one knows who wrote the book of Job or how it became part of the Bible. It is very different from Hebrew writings and doesn’t connect with other Bible books. This suggests it originally came from non-Jewish people.
