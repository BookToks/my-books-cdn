The Bible does not have any Hebrew ideas about the two meetings God is said to have with the "sons of God," or about Satan being close to God.

Also, the book shows that it was written by someone who knew a lot about science. The Jews were not known for this and didn’t know much about science. The book talks a lot about natural science, but in a way different from Hebrew books.

The names for stars like Pleiades, Orion, and Arcturus are Greek, not Hebrew. The Bible doesn’t show that the Jews knew or studied astronomy. They just used these Greek names from the poem without changing them into Hebrew.

It’s clear that the Jews translated stories from other nations into Hebrew and mixed them with their own. For example, Proverbs 31:1 says, "The words of King Lemuel, which his mother taught him." Lemuel was not a king of Israel or Judah, but from another country, meaning he was not Jewish. Yet, the Jews accepted his sayings.

Also, no one knows who wrote the book of Job or how it became part of the Bible. It is very different from Hebrew writings and does not connect with other books in the Bible. This suggests it originally came from non-Jewish people.
