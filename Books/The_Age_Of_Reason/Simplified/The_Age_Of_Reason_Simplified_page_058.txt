Miracles are things that seem amazing and impossible. But if someone says they did a miracle, people might think they’re lying or trying to trick others. Also, the idea behind the miracle might seem made up or fake.

Out of all the ways people try to prove religious ideas, miracles are the most confusing. First, if you need a miracle to make people believe, it shows that the idea isn’t very strong on its own. Second, it makes God look like a performer who does tricks just to impress people. Also, believing in a miracle depends on trusting the person who says they saw it, so even if it really happened, it might not be believed and could be seen as a lie.

Imagine I said that when I wrote this book, a hand appeared out of nowhere and wrote everything. Would anyone believe me? No, they wouldn’t. Even if it was true, it wouldn’t make people believe me more. So, if real miracles don’t get believed any more than lies, it doesn’t make sense that God would use miracles that don’t really help people believe.

If a miracle means something totally against how nature works, and someone says they saw one, you have to ask: is it more likely that nature broke its rules, or that the person lied? We’ve never seen nature break its rules, but we know people lie all the time. So, it’s way more likely the person lied about the miracle.

The story of Jonah being swallowed by a whale is really amazing, even though whales can be big enough to do that. It would be even more unbelievable if Jonah swallowed the whale. This kind of story can help explain all miracles.
