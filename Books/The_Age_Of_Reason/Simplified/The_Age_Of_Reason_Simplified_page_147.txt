Some Christians act like Christianity was never started with violence or force, but when are they talking about? At first, the twelve apostles couldn’t use force because they didn’t have power. But once Christians got strong enough, they did use force, even burning people alive. Even Muhammad didn’t do that earlier. If the story about Peter cutting off the ear of the high priest’s servant is true, Peter would have done worse if he could.

Christianity is based on the Hebrew Bible, which was made through violence—not just to scare people, but to completely destroy others. The Jews didn’t try to make people join them; they killed those who didn’t agree. The Bible is the source of the New Testament, and both are called the word of God. Christians read both and use them to teach. So, it’s wrong to say Christianity wasn’t started by violence.

The only group that didn’t hurt others were the Quakers. This is probably because they are more like Deists than Christians. They don’t believe much about Jesus and think the scriptures are useless. If they had said worse things about the Bible, they might have been closer to the truth.

Anyone who respects God and wants to stop the suffering caused by people should reject revealed religion. It’s a harmful lie. What have we learned from revealed religion? Nothing helpful for humans, and a lot that makes God look bad. What does the Bible teach? Violence, cruelty, and murder. What does the New Testament teach? Believing that God acted immorally with a woman who was engaged to be married, and calling this faith.

The small good morals in these books aren’t really part of revealed religion. They come from basic human conscience, which helps keep society together and is found in all religions and societies. The New Testament doesn’t teach anything new about morals, and when it tries, it often sounds silly or weak. For example, the idea of not fighting back.
