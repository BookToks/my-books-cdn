Putting aside anything that might make us laugh because it’s silly or hate it because it’s offensive, and just looking at the parts carefully, it’s hard to imagine a story more disrespectful to God, less sensible about His wisdom, and more against His power than this one.

To make this story work, the people who made it up had to give Satan, the character they talk about, power that’s just as big, or even bigger, than God’s. They say Satan could free himself from a pit after his fall, and then his power kept growing without limit. Before the fall, Satan was just like any other angel with limited power. But after, he supposedly became everywhere at once, filling all space.

Not happy with making Satan god-like, they also say he tricked God, even appearing as an animal, and beat all of God’s power and wisdom. They say Satan forced God to either give him control over everything or to come down to Earth and show himself on a cross as a man to save the world.

If the story was told the other way — with God forcing Satan to show himself on a cross as a snake to punish him — it would make more sense and seem less ridiculous. But instead, they made the bad guy win and God lose.

Many good people have believed this strange story and lived good lives because of it (believing something doesn’t make you a bad person). First, they were taught to believe it, and they would have believed anything told to them in the same way. There are also...
