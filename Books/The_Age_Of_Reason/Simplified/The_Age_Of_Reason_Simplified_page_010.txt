Chapter 4: The Basics of Christianity

This simple story, along with another one I will tell you about, is what Christian storytellers, who call themselves the Christian Church, have based all their beliefs on. Their story is just as strange and hard to believe as the old myths from long ago.

The old myth stories say that a group of Giants fought against Jupiter. One Giant even threw a hundred rocks at him all at once! But Jupiter beat him with thunder and trapped him under Mount Etna. Every time the Giant moves, the mountain spits out fire because it’s a volcano. You can see how the mountain being a volcano helped create this story.

Christian storytellers say that Satan fought against God, who beat him and locked him in a pit—not under a mountain like in the old story. You can tell that the old story about Jupiter and the Giants inspired the new one about Satan because the old story came first by hundreds of years.

So far, the old myths and Christian stories are pretty similar. But Christian storytellers went even further. They mixed the made-up parts of Jesus’s story with the old volcano myth. To make the whole story fit, they also used Jewish traditions. So, Christian stories come partly from old myths and partly from Jewish stories.

After locking Satan in a pit, the Christian storytellers had to let him out again to keep the story going. He shows up in the Garden of Eden as a snake and talks to Eve. And Eve isn’t even surprised that a snake can talk! What happens next is...
