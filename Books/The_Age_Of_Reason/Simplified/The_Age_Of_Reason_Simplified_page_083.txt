The next day, or the next week, or the next month, or the next year; to really understand this time period, which seems amazing and very old, it must mean hundreds of years. Saying less than that wouldn't make sense, and saying less than two hundred years would be hard to believe.

A long time ago is also mentioned in chapter 8. After talking about the city of Ai being taken, verse 28 says, "And Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever, a desolation to this day." Then, in verse 29, it talks about the king of Ai, who Joshua hanged and buried near the city gate, and says, "He raised a big pile of stones there, which is still there today." This means the stones were still there when the person writing the book of Joshua was alive.

Also, in chapter 10, after mentioning five kings Joshua hanged on trees and then threw in a cave, it says, "He put big stones on the cave’s entrance, and these stones are still there today."

When listing Joshua’s battles and the places the tribes conquered or tried to take, it says in chapter 15, verse 63, "The Jebusites, who lived in Jerusalem, were not driven out by the people of Judah; so the Jebusites lived with the people of Judah in Jerusalem until today." The question is, when exactly did the Jebusites and Judahites live together in Jerusalem?

Since this comes up again in Judges chapter 1, I will talk more about it later.

I have shown from the book of Joshua itself, without using any other evidence, that Joshua did not write this book. It has no author named, so it has no real authority. Now, I will move on to the book of Judges.

The book of Judges also doesn’t say who wrote it. So, there’s no reason to call it the word of God because it doesn’t have an author or anyone to back it up.

This book starts just like the book of Joshua. Joshua starts with, “Now after the death of Moses,” and Judges starts with, “Now after the death of Joshua.” Because of this and the similar writing style, it seems both books were written by the same person. But who that person was is totally unknown. The only thing we know for sure is that the writer lived long after Joshua’s time.

Even though Judges starts like it happened right after Joshua died, the second chapter sums up the whole book, which according to the Bible’s timeline, covers about 306 years.
