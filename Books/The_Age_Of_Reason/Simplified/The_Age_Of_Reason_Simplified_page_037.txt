Dead languages don’t teach us anything new, and all the important books have already been translated. So, learning and teaching them is a waste of time. When you learn a language to get or share new knowledge (since languages don’t create knowledge), only living languages can help. Usually, a young person learns more in one year of a living language than in seven years of a dead one. Also, teachers often don’t know much about dead languages themselves.

Dead languages are hard to learn not because they are more difficult, but because no one knows how to say the words right anymore. It would be the same for any language that dies. Even the best Greek expert today doesn’t understand Greek as well as a regular Greek farmer or milkmaid did long ago; the same goes for Latin compared to ancient Romans. Experts today don’t know how words were said and used better than the animals the Romans worked with. So, it would be better to stop studying dead languages and focus on real science, like people did long ago.

Some people say we keep teaching dead languages because kids can only remember things well at that age. But this isn’t true. Kids naturally want to learn about science and how things work. Before they even start playing, kids like to copy things people make. They build houses with cards or sticks, sail paper boats in water, or block streams to make little mills. They really care about these projects. But when they go to school, their curiosity dies because they have to study dead languages that don’t help them think deeply. The smart thinker gets lost inside the language learner.

The real reason we still teach dead languages isn’t because of memory. The true reason must be something else. The best way to figure this out is by looking closely at the situation and its details. In this case, it’s not hard to find those clues.
