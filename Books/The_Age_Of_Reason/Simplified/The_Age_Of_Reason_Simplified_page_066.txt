Robespierre wrote a note saying, "Demand that Thomas Paine be accused, for the good of America as well as France." I don’t know why this didn’t happen, but I think it was because of his illness.

The Convention wanted to fix the unfair treatment I got. They invited me back, and I agreed to come to show that I could handle being wronged without losing my beliefs or attitude. Just because right ideas are attacked doesn’t mean we should give them up.

Since I’ve been free, I’ve seen some books written in America and England responding to the first part of "The Age of Reason." If those writers want to spend time doing that, I won’t stop them. They can say whatever they want about the book or me. Actually, they help me more than they realize. But with this second part, they will have to go back and rethink what they said. The first part was knocked down by chance.

Now, I have read the Bible and the Testament myself, and I can say they are worse books than I thought before. If I made a mistake in the first part of "The Age of Reason," it was by saying some parts were better than they really are.

I’ve noticed that all my critics use what they call "Scripture Evidence" and Bible authority to defend themselves. They mix up arguing about whether the Bible is real with arguing about its teachings. I will explain this clearly, so if they want to write more, they’ll know how to start.

Thomas Paine.
