Desert of the Sea; another, the burden of the Valley of Vision: like you would say the story of the Knight of the Burning Mountain, the story of Cinderella, or the glass slipper, the story of the Sleeping Beauty in the Wood, and so on.

I have already shown, using the last two verses of 2 Chronicles and the first three in Ezra, that the people who put the Bible together mixed up writings from different authors. This alone is enough to question if this collection is really authentic because it shows the compilers didn’t know who the real authors were.

A clear example of this is in the book called Isaiah: the later part of chapter 44 and the start of chapter 45 couldn’t have been written by Isaiah himself because the writer must have lived at least 150 years after Isaiah died.

These chapters praise Cyrus, who allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem from Babylonian captivity and rebuild the city and the temple, as mentioned in Ezra. The last verse of chapter 44 and the first of chapter 45 say things like: "He says of Cyrus, he is my shepherd and will do all I want; telling Jerusalem she will be built and the temple’s foundations laid. This is what the Lord says to his chosen one, Cyrus, whose right hand I hold to defeat nations before him. I will open gates for him that won’t be closed; I will go ahead of you," and so on.

It’s crazy how the church and priests ignore this and say this book was written by Isaiah, when their own timeline shows Isaiah died soon after King Hezekiah, around 698 B.C., but Cyrus’s decree letting the Jews return happened in 536 B.C., which is 162 years later.

I don’t think the Bible compilers wrote these books themselves; they probably just found some random, unnamed writings and put them together under names that fit their purpose. They allowed this trick to happen, which is almost like making it up, because they must have noticed it.

When we see how carefully the scripture makers shaped every part of this story to fit the crazy idea of a Son of God, born from a ghost inside a virgin, it’s easy to suspect they tricked people.

Every phrase and detail shows the rough work of...
