They have limited themselves too much by leaving out God’s works from their ideas. Even though I respect their kindness, I can’t help but smile at the thought that if a Quaker had been asked during creation, the world would be dull and quiet! No flowers would bloom brightly, and no birds would be allowed to sing.

Putting these thoughts aside, I move on to other things. After I learned how to use globes and the orrery, and understood the endless space and the tiny parts matter can be divided into, I got a general idea of what natural philosophy means. Then, I started to compare what I learned with the Christian faith.

Even though Christianity doesn’t directly say that this world is the only one, the way the Bible talks about creation, Eve and the apple, and Jesus’s death, makes it hard to believe that God made many worlds as many as stars. Believing both ideas at the same time makes the Christian faith seem small and silly, and it confuses the mind. You can’t truly believe both, and anyone who thinks they do probably hasn’t thought much about either.

People long ago believed in many worlds, but only in the last 300 years have we really figured out the size of Earth. Ships have sailed all the way around the world, like walking in a circle and ending up where you started. The widest part of Earth is about 25,020 miles around, like measuring the biggest round part of an apple or ball. You can sail all around it in about three years.

The orrery, by the way, is a clock-like machine that shows a small model of the universe. It shows how the Earth spins on its axis, goes around the sun, how the moon goes around the Earth, and how the planets move around the sun. It also shows their distances and sizes as they really are in space.
