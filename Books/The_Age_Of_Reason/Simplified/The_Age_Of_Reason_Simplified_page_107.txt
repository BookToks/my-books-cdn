There are two different and opposite stories about why Jeremiah was put in prison. One says it was because he tried to run away from the city. The other says it was because he was preaching and telling prophecies inside the city. One story says the guards caught him at the gate. The other says he was accused in front of King Zedekiah.

In the next chapter of Jeremiah, chapter 39, the book seems mixed up again. Even though earlier chapters already talked about Nebuchadnezzar’s army surrounding Jerusalem, chapter 39 starts like it’s the first time we hear about the attack. It says, “In the ninth year of King Zedekiah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with his army to Jerusalem and attacked it.”

I also noticed two chapters in 1 Samuel (16 and 17) that don’t match about how David met King Saul. In chapter 16, it says Saul was troubled by an evil spirit, and his servants told him to find someone who plays the harp well. They suggested David, a skilled harp player and warrior. Saul sent for David, and he became Saul’s armor-bearer. When Saul felt bad, David played the harp and made him feel better.

But in chapter 17, the story is different. It says David met Saul after he fought the giant Goliath. David was sent by his dad to bring food to his brothers in the army. After David killed Goliath, the army captain Abner brought David to Saul, who asked whose son David was. David said he was the son of Jesse from Bethlehem.

These two stories don’t fit because both assume Saul and David didn’t know each other before. The Bible sometimes has confusing parts like this.
