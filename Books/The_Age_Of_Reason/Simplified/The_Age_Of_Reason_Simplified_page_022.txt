Jesus Christ was born in a stable, and Muhammad was a mule driver. The first and last of these men started different religions, but Jesus didn’t create a new religion. He asked people to be good and believe in one God. The most important thing about him was that he cared a lot about others.

How Jesus was caught shows that not many people knew him at that time. It also shows that his meetings with followers were secret, and he had stopped preaching openly. Judas could only betray him by telling the officers where Jesus was and pointing him out. Judas was paid to do this because Jesus was hiding and not well known.

The idea that Jesus was hiding doesn’t fit well with people saying he was divine. It makes him seem scared. The fact that one of his own followers helped catch him shows Jesus didn’t want to be caught or crucified.

Christians say Jesus died for the world’s sins and came to die for that reason. But would it have been any different if he died from a fever, smallpox, or old age?

When Adam was told he would die if he ate the apple, the punishment wasn’t that he would be crucified but that he would die. The sentence was death, not how he would die. So, even in their story, Jesus didn’t have to die on a cross instead of Adam. A fever could have worked just as well.

The sentence on Adam meant either natural death or what these storytellers call damnation. So, Jesus dying was supposed to stop one of these things from happening to Adam and us.

But it doesn’t stop us from dying because everyone still dies. If their stories about people living longer before Jesus are true, then people have been dying faster since then. Also, if Jesus’s death was supposed to stop eternal death, it didn’t work that way.
