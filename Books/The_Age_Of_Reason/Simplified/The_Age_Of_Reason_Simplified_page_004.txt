No church, not Protestant or any other that I know, controls my beliefs. My mind is my own church.

All national church groups—whether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish—seem to me like human-made systems designed to scare and control people, and to keep power and money for themselves.

I’m not trying to say that people who believe differently are wrong; they have the right to their own beliefs just like I do. But for people to be happy, they need to be honest with themselves. Being unfaithful doesn’t mean believing or not believing; it means pretending to believe something you don’t.

It’s hard to say how much damage lying to yourself has done to society. When someone lies about what they believe, they open the door to doing all kinds of wrong things. For example, someone might become a priest just to make money, but to do that, they first lie about their true beliefs. Can you imagine anything worse for morality than this?

After I wrote the pamphlet Common Sense in America, I realized that if the government changes, the religious system would probably change too. When church and state are mixed, like in Jewish, Christian, or Turkish systems, people are often punished for questioning religious ideas. So, until the government changes, these ideas can’t be openly discussed. But once the government changes, religion will change too. People will see that religion is just made up by humans and priests, and they will go back to simply believing in one true God, without any extra stuff.
