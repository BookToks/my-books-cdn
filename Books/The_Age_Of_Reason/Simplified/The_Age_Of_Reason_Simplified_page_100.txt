He was smart, flashy, wild, and in the end, sad. He lived a fast life and died feeling tired of the world at fifty-eight years old.

Having seven hundred wives and three hundred girlfriends is worse than having none. Even though it might seem more fun, it stops real love from happening because you can't focus your feelings on just one person. Loving many people at once never makes you happy. This was true for Solomon. If he couldn’t figure this out, even though he thought he was wise, then he deserved the pain he later felt.

Because of this, his advice isn’t really needed. To understand what happens, you just need to know the cause. Having seven hundred wives and three hundred girlfriends says it all. After that, saying that everything is meaningless and frustrating is not necessary. You can’t be happy when you make others unhappy.

To be happy when you’re older, you need to get used to things that can stay with you your whole life, and accept the rest as good for their time. People who only chase fun end up unhappy when they get old, and those who only work hard for money aren’t much better. But studying nature, math, and machines gives calm and lasting joy. Despite scary ideas from priests and superstitions, learning about these things is really learning about God. Science helps us understand and admire the Creator because the laws of science come from the world and never change—they are divine.

People who knew Benjamin Franklin remember that his mind was always young and calm. Science, which never gets old, was always his passion. He always had a goal because when we stop having goals, we become like sick people waiting to die.

Solomon’s Songs are romantic and silly, but some people have called them sacred. The people who put together the Bible placed these songs after Ecclesiastes. They say Solomon wrote them around 1014 B.C., when he was nineteen and starting to gather his many wives and girlfriends. The Bible writers and historians should have handled this better. They either should have left out the time or picked a time that made more sense.
