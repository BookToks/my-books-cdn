Ignorance is what people call the Reformation by Luther.

From that time, even though it wasn’t really Luther’s or the Reformers’ main goal, science started to come back, and freedom of thought began to show up too.

This was the only good thing the Reformation did for the public. When it comes to religion, it didn’t really make a difference. The old religious stories stayed the same, and many new national Popes appeared after the main Pope of Christendom lost power.
