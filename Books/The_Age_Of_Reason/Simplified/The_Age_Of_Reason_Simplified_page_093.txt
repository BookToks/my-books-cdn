The book of Chronicles was written at least 860 years after Moses lived.

First, the passage in Genesis points to Chronicles for the timeline. Second, the book of Chronicles itself wasn’t started until at least 860 years after Moses. To prove this, look at 1 Chronicles chapter 3, verse 15. It talks about Zedekiah, who lived when Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem in 588 B.C. That’s way after Moses’ time.

People who brag about how old the Bible is, especially the parts said to be written by Moses, did so without really checking facts. The oldest book in the Bible is actually about 300 years younger than Homer’s works and is about the same age as Æsop’s Fables.

I’m not saying Homer’s stories are good. Actually, I think they promote bad ideas about honor. Æsop’s stories usually have good lessons, but sometimes they’re cruel, and that cruelty can hurt feelings, especially for kids, more than the lesson helps their thinking.

Now, moving past Kings and Chronicles, let’s look at the book of Ezra.

One proof that the Bible was put together in a messy way and that we don’t really know who wrote parts of it is in how the first three verses of Ezra are exactly the same as the last two verses of 2 Chronicles. How did that happen? Either the writers didn’t know their own work or the people who put the books together didn’t know who wrote what.

Here are the last two verses of 2 Chronicles:

Verse 22: In the first year of Cyrus, King of Persia, so that what the Lord said through Jeremiah would happen, the Lord moved Cyrus to make a proclamation throughout his kingdom and put it in writing.
