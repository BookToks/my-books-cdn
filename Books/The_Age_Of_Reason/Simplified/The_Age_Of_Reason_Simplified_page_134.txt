The story goes on a little more and more until it becomes something that people believe for sure. Once you start talking about a ghost, people fill in the details of its life and explain why it appeared. One person tells one story, another tells a different story, so there end up being as many stories about the ghost and its owner as there are about Jesus Christ in these four books.

The story of Jesus Christ’s appearances is told with a strange mix of real and impossible things, which makes it more like a legend than real fact. He is shown as suddenly coming in and going out when the doors are shut, disappearing and appearing again like a ghost. But then he is also hungry, sits down to eat, and has supper. The storytellers didn’t think of everything: they say he left his grave clothes behind when he rose, but they never say what clothes he wore after that or what happened to those old clothes when he went up to heaven. In the story of Elijah, they made sure to mention that he threw down his cloak, but they didn’t say how it didn’t burn in the fiery chariot. Imagination fills in these gaps, and we might as well think the cloak was made of fireproof material.

People who don’t know church history might think the New Testament has existed since Jesus’s time, just like some think the books Moses wrote have been around since his time. But actually, that’s not true. The New Testament didn’t exist until more than 300 years after Jesus is said to have lived.

No one really knows when the books named Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were written. There is no real proof about who wrote them or when. They could have been named after any of the other supposed apostles just as easily. None of the original copies belong to any Christian Church today, just like the two stone tablets that God supposedly wrote with his finger and gave to Moses aren’t owned by the Jews now. Even if the originals did exist, we couldn’t prove who wrote them. When those four books were made, there was no printing press, so the only way to share them was by hand-copying. Anyone could have copied or changed the text and called their copy the original. Can we really think it is smart for God to rely on this?
