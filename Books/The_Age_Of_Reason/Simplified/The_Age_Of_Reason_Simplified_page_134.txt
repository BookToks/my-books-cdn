The story keeps going and growing until people start to believe it for sure. When someone talks about a ghost, others add details about its life and explain why it showed up. One person tells one story, another tells a different one, so there are as many stories about the ghost and its owner as there are about Jesus in these four books.

The story of Jesus showing up mixes real things with impossible things, making it more like a legend than a fact. He comes in and out even when doors are shut, disappearing and showing up like a ghost. But he also feels hungry, sits down, and eats dinner. The storytellers didn’t think of everything: they say he left his grave clothes behind when he rose, but they never say what clothes he wore after or what happened to the old ones when he went to heaven. In Elijah’s story, they say he threw down his cloak, but don’t say how it didn’t burn in the fiery chariot. People use imagination to fill in these gaps, maybe thinking the cloak was fireproof.

People who don’t know church history might think the New Testament has been around since Jesus’s time, like some think Moses’s books have been around since he lived. But that’s not true. The New Testament didn’t exist until over 300 years after Jesus is said to have lived.

No one really knows when the books called Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were written. There’s no proof about who wrote them or when. They could have been named after any of the other supposed apostles just as easily. None of the original copies belong to any Christian Church today, just like the two stone tablets God supposedly wrote on and gave to Moses aren’t owned by the Jews now. Even if the originals did exist, we couldn’t prove who wrote them. When those four books were made, there was no printing press, so the only way to share them was by copying by hand. Anyone could have copied or changed the text and said their copy was the original. Can we really think it’s smart for God to trust this?
