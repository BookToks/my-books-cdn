Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother.  

But the king of Israel said, "No, the Lord has brought these three kings together to hand them over to the king of Moab," (because they were really struggling for water). Then Elisha said, "As the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, if it weren't for Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, I wouldn’t even look at you or pay attention to you." This shows how rude and mean some prophets could be.

Now we are going to see how the prophecy was done.  

Elisha said, "Bring me a musician." When the musician played, the power of the Lord came on Elisha. This was like a magic trick. Then Elisha said, probably singing along with the music, "This is what the Lord says: Make this valley full of ditches." He was basically just telling them to dig ditches to find water, something any farmer would have known without any music or tricks.

Not all prophets were good at the same things. They were mostly known for lying, but some were better at cursing. Elisha, who I just talked about, was famous for cursing. He cursed 42 children in the name of the Lord, and two female bears came and attacked them. We are supposed to believe those kids were from Israel’s side, but since people who curse often lie, this story about Elisha and the bears is just as believable as the story of the Dragon of Wantley, who supposedly ate three kids like apples in one meal.

There were other prophets who spent their time dreaming and having visions, though we don’t know if these happened during the day or night. These prophets were mostly harmless, or at least not very dangerous. Ezekiel and Daniel were part of this group.  

The first question about their books, and all other prophetic books, is: Are they real? Were they really written by Ezekiel and Daniel?  

There is no proof either way, but I personally think they probably were written by them. My reasons for this are...
