When historians write about someone’s life, they usually say things like “Moses said to the people” or “the people said to Moses.” This is how they talk about the person they are writing about. Some people think Moses might have talked about himself in the third person, but just guessing that doesn’t prove anything. If people who believe Moses wrote these books only have guesses, then they shouldn’t say anything at all.

Even if we accept that Moses could talk about himself in the third person because anyone can, it still doesn’t make sense to believe Moses really did it in these books. For example, in Numbers 12:3 it says, “Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were on the face of the earth.” If Moses said this about himself, instead of being humble, he would actually sound super full of himself. So, people who support these books have a problem no matter what: if Moses didn’t write them, the books don’t have authority; but if he did, then he sounds braggy and not honest about being humble.

In the book of Deuteronomy, it’s even clearer that Moses didn’t write it. The style is like a play. The writer starts by talking a bit, then brings Moses in as if he is speaking, then after Moses finishes, the writer talks again until Moses speaks once more. At the end, the writer tells about Moses’s death, funeral, and what kind of person he was.

This back-and-forth between the writer and Moses happens four times in the book. From the first verse of chapter 1 to the fifth verse, the writer speaks. Then Moses speaks until the end of chapter 4, verse 40. After that, the writer talks about what happened because of what Moses said when he was alive. The writer starts again in chapter 5 by saying Moses gathered the people, then Moses talks until the end of chapter 26. The same thing happens at the start of chapter 27, with Moses speaking until the end of chapter 28. Then at chapter 29 the writer...
