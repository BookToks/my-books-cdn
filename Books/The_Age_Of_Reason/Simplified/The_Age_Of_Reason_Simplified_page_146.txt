I have talked about revelation earlier in The Age of Reason. While I respect the idea that revelation might be possible—because with God, anything is possible—I want to stop anyone from tricking others by pretending to have a special message from God.

Personally, I do believe revelation could happen, but I don’t think God has ever actually spoken to people through words, visions, or anything our senses can notice. Instead, I think we see God’s presence in the world around us and in the way we feel inside—like knowing right from wrong and wanting to do good things.

The worst cruelty, evil, and suffering in human history have come from what people call revelation or revealed religion. It has been a terrible belief that has hurt both God’s reputation and people’s happiness and morality since the beginning of time. It would be better, even if it meant letting a thousand devils preach their lies, than to believe in false prophets like Moses, Joshua, Samuel, and the Bible prophets who claimed to speak God’s word and were trusted.

Where did all the horrible murders of entire nations, including women and children, in the Bible come from? What about the bloody wars, persecutions, and tortures that have destroyed much of Europe? They all came from this terrible thing called revealed religion and the crazy idea that God has talked directly to humans. The lies in the Bible caused much of this pain, and the lies in the New Testament caused more.

A similar idea was shared by Kant, who said two things fill the soul with wonder: the starry sky above and the moral law inside us. Kant’s ideas about the moral law inside people were like those of Paine, who talked about the “inner light” in everyone. Around the same time, both Kant and Paine faced trouble because of their ideas about human equality and reason.
