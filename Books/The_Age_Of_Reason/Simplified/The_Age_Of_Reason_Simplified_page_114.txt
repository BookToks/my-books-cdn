They were actually using a secret code to communicate and achieve their goals. It was like a secret alphabet or cypher. If it wasn’t that, then these stories would just be random dreams or nonsense, or maybe just a way to pass time while being held captive. But most likely, it was the secret code.

Ezekiel starts his book by talking about a vision of cherubims and a wheel within a wheel, which he saw by the river Chebar while he was captive. It makes sense to think that by cherubims, he meant the temple in Jerusalem, since it had pictures of cherubims. And the wheel within a wheel, which usually means some kind of political plan, could be the plan to get Jerusalem back. Later in his book, he imagines himself in Jerusalem and the temple, and he says that this vision is like the one by the river Chebar. This shows that these dreams and visions were really about getting Jerusalem back, and nothing else.

Some people, like priests and commentators, have tried to make these books into prophecies about things happening far in the future, even today. But that’s really silly or dishonest. It’s crazy to think that guys like Ezekiel and Daniel—whose country was taken over, whose friends and family were either captured, slaves, killed, or in danger—would waste their time thinking about what would happen to other countries thousands of years later. It makes way more sense that they were focused on getting Jerusalem back and freeing themselves. That was the real point of all the weird and confusing writing in their books.

So, the way these books were written was because they had to, not because they wanted to. That’s not crazy at all. But if you try to use these books as predictions of the future, they don’t make sense and aren’t true. For example, in Ezekiel 29:11, it says about Egypt, “No person or animal will walk there, and no one will live there for forty years.” This is 115...
