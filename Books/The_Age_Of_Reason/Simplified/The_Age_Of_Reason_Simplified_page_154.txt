Life, whether from animals, plants, or things that aren’t alive, can teach us a lot about faith and clear thinking. It can help us feel grateful and also help us become better people. Some people say that if religion changes a lot, then every preacher should also be a thinker. And every place where people pray should also be a place to learn about science.

People have often ignored the unchanging rules of science and logic. Instead, they made up something called "revealed religion." Because of this, many strange and disrespectful ideas about God have come up. For example, the Jews made God seem like someone who kills people to make room for their religion. Christians said God killed himself to start a new religion that replaces the Jewish one. To believe these things, they had to think God’s power or wisdom was not perfect, or that His will could change. But if God’s will changes, that means His judgment is not perfect. Philosophers know that God’s laws have never changed, whether about science or matter. So why would His rules about humans change?

I will stop talking about this now. Earlier in this work, I showed that the Bible and Testament are fake and made up. I challenge anyone to prove me wrong. I leave these ideas for you to think about, sure that when people can freely share their opinions, whether about government or religion, the truth will win in the end.

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
