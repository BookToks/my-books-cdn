Second, the writers, whoever they were, didn’t work together to trick people. Each one wrote on their own, without knowing about the others.

The same proof that shows one writer wasn’t an apostle also shows that the books weren’t a group trick. When it comes to inspiration, it doesn’t make sense to say these stories are both inspired and full of contradictions.

If four people saw the same event, they would all agree on when and where it happened without planning it. Each person knows the facts on their own, so they wouldn’t say different things like one saying it happened on a mountain and another saying it was in a house. They all know the same time and place.

On the other hand, if four people planned a fake story, they would make sure their parts match to support the whole story. Planning a story fills in for real facts, but knowing the facts means there’s no need to plan. So, the arguments that prove there was no planning also prove the writers didn’t really know what happened. This shows their stories are false. So, these books were not written by the apostles or by a group of people working together to trick others. Then, who wrote them?

I don’t think many people lie on purpose, except maybe those claiming to be prophets, like in the Old Testament. Being a prophet is basically lying as a job. In most other cases, lies start as guesses or beliefs that grow over time until people tell them as facts. When we can find a kind reason for this, we shouldn’t be too harsh.

The story of Jesus coming back after he died is like a ghost story that scared or hopeful people imagined and believed. Stories like this happened before, like after Julius Caesar was killed. These stories often come from violent deaths or innocent people being executed. In these cases, people’s kindness makes the story bigger than it really is.
