There are twenty-eight generations listed in one family tree. The book of Luke also gives a family tree, starting from Christ through Joseph, Mary's husband, going back to David. This one has forty-three generations. The only names that appear in both lists are David and Joseph. 

I have put both family trees here so you can easily compare them. Both are shown in the same order, from Joseph going down to David.
