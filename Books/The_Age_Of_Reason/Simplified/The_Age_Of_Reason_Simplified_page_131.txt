There was a man who, according to the story, didn’t believe any of it when it supposedly happened. If he really wrote Corinthians 15, where this story is told, then his evidence is like someone going to court and saying their previous statement was a lie. People can change their minds about opinions, but not about facts.

Now, let’s talk about the last part—the ascension into heaven. If this really happened, everyone should have no doubt about it. It was supposed to prove the disciples' future mission was real. Private words said on a mountain in Galilee or inside a locked house in Jerusalem wouldn’t be enough proof for the public. So, this last event had to be so clear and visible that no one could deny it, like the crucifixion was said to be.

But here’s the problem. The writers of Matthew and John don’t mention the ascension at all. If it really happened, wouldn’t they have talked about it, since they were usually very detailed? The writer of Mark barely mentions it, like he’s tired of telling the story or embarrassed. Luke also tells the story, but he and Mark don’t agree on where it happened. Mark says Jesus appeared to the eleven disciples while they were eating in Jerusalem, then suddenly says Jesus went up to heaven. Luke says the ascension happened in Bethany, where Jesus led them out before leaving. Even other famous religious figures like Mahomet and Moses have similar stories about going up somewhere.

(Note: The last part of Mark’s story about the ascension might not be genuine, and some old versions of the Bible don’t even include the words about Jesus going up to heaven.)
