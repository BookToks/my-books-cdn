When you draw a triangle, it shows an idea called a principle. The triangle helps you see this idea with your eyes and understand it in your mind. But drawing the triangle doesn’t create the idea, just like turning on a light in a dark room doesn’t create the chairs and tables you couldn’t see before. All the qualities of a triangle existed before anyone ever drew one or thought about it. People didn’t make these qualities any more than they made the laws that control how planets move. So, both must come from the same divine source.

Just like people can make a triangle, they can also make a tool called a lever. But the rule that makes the lever work is different from the lever itself and would exist even if the lever didn’t. The lever works the way it does because of this rule, and no amount of human invention can change that. What people see as the lever’s effect is really just the rule made visible.

Since people can’t create these rules, where did they learn about them? How do they use these rules not just for things on Earth, but also to understand how faraway planets move? The answer is from studying true theology, or the study of God.

The universe’s design teaches people these rules. This design always shows every principle that math is based on. From math comes mechanics, which is just using those rules in real life. For example, someone building a mill uses the same rules as if they were building the whole universe. But unlike the universe, where parts can affect each other without touching (like gravity), people have to make parts touch, like with gears and teeth. If people could understand and use that invisible force, it would be like discovering another holy book from God.
