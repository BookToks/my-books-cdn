The way this church acts doesn’t match the person it claims to follow. It created a fancy religion focused on money, copying someone who lived a simple and poor life.

They made up the idea of purgatory, where souls can be freed if people buy prayers from the church. They also sell pardons, special permissions, and indulgences, which are really just ways to make money without saying so openly. These ideas come from the belief that one person can take the place of another and do good deeds for them.

It’s likely that the whole idea of redemption—where one person saves another—was made up to support these money-making practices. The parts of the holy books about redemption might have been created for this reason. Why should we trust the church when it says these books are real, just like we don’t believe all the other things it claims, including miracles? The church could write these texts if it wanted to, and it’s not less believable than the miracles it says it performed.

Since no real proof from long ago can show whether the church made up redemption or not (because any proof could be fake), we have to look at the idea itself. And the idea feels like it was made up because it’s based on money justice, not real moral justice.

If I owe someone money and can’t pay, another person can pay for me. But if I do something wrong, moral justice doesn’t let someone innocent take the blame, even if they want to. To think justice would do that is to destroy what justice really is. Then it’s not justice anymore, just unfair revenge.
