The New Testament is said to be based on the old prophecies, so if those prophecies aren’t true, the New Testament might not be either.

It’s not weird for a woman to be pregnant before marriage or for her son to be unfairly punished. Because of that, I don’t see a problem believing that Mary, Joseph, and Jesus existed. Whether they really did or not doesn’t really matter, and there’s no strong reason to believe or disbelieve it. It’s possible they were real, or at least there were people like them, since many stories come from some real events. For example, the story of Robinson Crusoe was inspired by a real person, Alexander Selkirk, even though the story itself isn’t true.

What really bothers me isn’t whether these people lived, but the story about Jesus in the New Testament and the strange ideas that come with it. The story, as it’s told, is shocking and hard to believe. It says a young woman, who was promised to be married, was basically taken advantage of by a ghost claiming to be the Holy Spirit. Then Joseph marries her and lives with her like a husband, even though the ghost is supposed to be involved. Saying it like this makes the story sound really strange, and I think any priest would feel embarrassed to admit it.

When stories about faith sound like this, it’s usually a sign that they aren’t true. To really believe in God, we can’t connect Him with stories that are so unbelievable and strange.
