The event was not what he had expected. In verses 7 and 8, God says, "The moment I say something about a nation or kingdom—to destroy it—if that nation stops doing bad things, I will change my mind about harming them." This is one condition. 

Now for the other condition. Verses 9 and 10 say, "The moment I say something about a nation or kingdom—to build and help it—if it does evil and doesn’t listen to me, then I will change my mind about helping them." 

So, with this way of predicting, a prophet could never be wrong, even if God seemed to change His mind. This way of talking about God like He’s a regular person is just silly and doesn’t make sense.

About the book itself, if you read it, you’ll see that although some parts might have been spoken by Jeremiah, he didn’t write the whole book. The historical parts are very messy. The same events are told several times but differently each time, sometimes even contradicting each other. This confusion continues until the last chapter, where the story starts over and ends suddenly.

The book looks like a mix of random stories about people and things from that time. It’s put together like a bunch of newspapers thrown in a pile without dates, order, or explanation. I will give a few examples.

In chapter 37, it says that Nebuchadnezzar’s army, called the army of the Chaldeans, had been attacking Jerusalem for a while. When they heard that Pharaoh of Egypt’s army was coming against them, they stopped the attack and left for a time. 

To understand this confusing story, it helps to know that Nebuchadnezzar had already attacked and taken Jerusalem during the rule of Jehoakim, who was king before Zedekiah. Nebuchadnezzar made Zedekiah king or ruler after that. The second attack, which Jeremiah talks about, happened because Zedekiah rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. This helps explain why there is some doubt about the story.
