The event was not what he thought it would be. In verses 7 and 8, God says, "When I say I’m going to destroy a nation or kingdom, if that nation stops doing bad things, I will decide not to harm them." This is one rule.

Now, there’s another rule. Verses 9 and 10 say, "When I say I’m going to help and build up a nation or kingdom, if it starts doing evil and doesn’t listen to me, then I will decide not to help them."

So, with this way of predicting, a prophet could never be wrong, even if God seemed to change His mind. Talking about God like He’s just a normal person is weird and doesn’t make sense.

About the book itself, if you read it, you’ll see that even though some parts might have been said by Jeremiah, he didn’t write the whole thing. The history parts are really messy. The same events are told many times but in different ways, and sometimes they even contradict each other. This confusion keeps going until the last chapter, where the story starts over and ends suddenly.

The book looks like a mix of random stories about people and things from that time. It’s put together like a pile of newspapers thrown together without dates, order, or explanations. I will give a few examples.

In chapter 37, it says that Nebuchadnezzar’s army, called the army of the Chaldeans, had been attacking Jerusalem for a while. When they heard that Pharaoh of Egypt’s army was coming against them, they stopped attacking and left for a time.

To get this confusing story, it helps to know that Nebuchadnezzar had already attacked and taken Jerusalem when Jehoakim was king, before Zedekiah. Nebuchadnezzar made Zedekiah king after that. The second attack, which Jeremiah talks about, happened because Zedekiah rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. This helps explain why the story is a bit unclear.
