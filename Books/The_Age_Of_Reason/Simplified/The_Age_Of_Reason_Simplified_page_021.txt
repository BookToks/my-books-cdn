Chapter 8 of the New Testament

Now that I've talked about the Bible, I'll move on to the book called the New Testament. The New Testament means the new Will, like a new set of rules from God, but it’s strange to think there could be two wills from the Creator.

If Jesus Christ wanted to start a new religion, he would have written it himself or had it written while he was alive. But there’s no book with his name that was published then. All the books called the New Testament were written after he died. Jesus was born a Jew and lived as one. He was called the son of God like everyone else, because the Creator is the Father of all people.

The first four books—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—don’t tell the full life story of Jesus. They only share small stories about him. From these books, it looks like Jesus was a preacher for only about eighteen months, and that’s when people got to know him.

They say he was twelve years old when he sat with Jewish teachers, asking and answering questions. This happened years before the writers met him, so they probably heard this story from his parents. After that, there’s no information about him for about sixteen years. We don’t know where he lived or what he did during that time. Most likely, he worked as a carpenter like his father.

It seems he didn’t go to school, and he probably couldn’t write because his family was very poor. For example, they couldn’t even pay for a bed when he was born. It’s interesting that three famous people—like Moses—came from really simple families.
