The idea of redemption is kind of like money—like a debt that someone else can pay for you. This money idea fits with a system where people gave money to the church to get pardons. It’s probably the same people who made up both ideas. Actually, redemption might not even be real. It could just be a made-up story. People have always been in the same situation with their Creator since forever, and thinking this way can help them feel better.

If someone believes this, they will live in a more honest and good way than with any other belief. When people are told they are outlaws, outcasts, beggars, or worthless, far away from their Creator, they either stop caring about religion, don’t care much, or pretend to be very religious. If they choose to pretend, they waste their life feeling sad or acting sad. Their prayers become complaints. Their humility turns into ungratefulness. They call themselves worms and the earth a dump, and they say all good things in life are useless. They ignore the greatest gift from God to humans, which is Reason. They try to force themselves to believe in a system that their reason says is wrong, and then they blame human reason, like people made reason up themselves.

Even with this weird humility and disrespect for human reason, they still act very boldly. They complain about everything. Their selfishness never ends, and they’re always ungrateful. They try to tell God what to do, even with running the whole universe. They pray like they are the boss. When it’s sunny, they pray for rain; when it rains, they pray for sunshine. This shows all their prayers are really just trying to make God change His mind and do things differently. It’s like saying, “You don’t know as well as I do.”
