This idea of redemption is based on a simple money idea, like a debt someone else can pay. This money idea matches a system where people gave money to the church to get pardons. It’s likely the same people made up both ideas. Actually, redemption might not be real at all. It could be a made-up story. People have always been in the same position with their Creator since they existed, and thinking this way can actually make them feel better.

If someone believes this, they will live in a more honest and moral way than with any other belief. When people are taught to see themselves as outlaws, outcasts, beggars, or worthless, far away from their Creator, they either stop caring about religion, become indifferent, or pretend to be very religious. If they choose the last option, they waste their life feeling sad or acting like they are sad. Their prayers become complaints. Their humility turns into ungratefulness. They call themselves worms and the earth a dump, and they call all good things in life useless. They ignore the greatest gift from God to humans, which is Reason. They try to force themselves to believe in a system that their reason rejects, and then they blame human reason, as if humans created reason themselves.

Even with this strange humility and disrespect for human reason, they still act very boldly. They complain about everything. Their selfishness never ends, and they are always ungrateful. They try to tell God what to do, even in running the whole universe. They pray like they are bosses. When it’s sunny, they pray for rain; when it rains, they pray for sunshine. This shows that all their prayers are really just trying to make God change His mind and do things differently. It’s like saying, “You don’t know as well as I do.”
