Moab? The writer lived long after Moses did, which you can tell because he uses the phrase "unto this day," meaning a long time after Moses died. So, he definitely wasn’t at Moses’ funeral. Also, Moses himself couldn’t have said that no one knows where his grave is "unto this day." Saying Moses said that is like a child hiding and saying, "Nobody can find me."

The writer never tells us where he got the speeches he puts in Moses’ mouth. So, we can guess he either made them up himself or got them from stories people told. One of these is more likely because, in chapter five, there’s a list of commandments that’s different from the ones in chapter twenty of Exodus.

For example, in Exodus, the reason for keeping the seventh day is because God made the world in six days and rested on the seventh. But in Deuteronomy, the reason is that the Israelites came out of Egypt on that day. It doesn’t talk about creation or coming out of Egypt in the same way.

There are also many laws in this book that aren’t in any other books. One is a cruel law in chapter 21, verses 18 to 21, that lets parents have their children stoned to death for being “stubborn.” Priests have always liked preaching from Deuteronomy because it talks about tithes (giving money to the church). They even use a verse from chapter 25, verse 4, about not muzzling an ox while it’s working, to support tithing. They make sure people notice this verse by listing it at the start of the chapter, even though it’s just one short line. Oh priests! You’re happy to be compared to an ox, just for the sake of tithes.

We can’t know exactly who wrote Deuteronomy, but we can tell he was probably a Jewish religious leader.
