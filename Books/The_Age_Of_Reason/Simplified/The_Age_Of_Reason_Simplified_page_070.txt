A book can be important and true on its own, no matter who wrote it or where and when it was written. The things in that book would still be trusted even if we didn’t know who the author was or if the author never became known. Knowing exactly who wrote it doesn’t change how much we believe the facts inside.

But it’s different with books said to be written by Moses, Joshua, Samuel, and others. These books are like eyewitness reports that tell us about things that seem unbelievable. So, to trust these books, first we have to be sure that Moses, Joshua, or Samuel really wrote them. Second, we have to believe that what they say is true. We can believe the author wrote it but not believe what they claim, just like we might trust someone was a witness in a trial but not believe their story.

If it turned out that these books weren’t written by Moses, Joshua, or Samuel, then we can’t trust them at all. You can’t have fake or made-up eyewitness stories, especially about things that seem impossible—like talking with God face to face or the sun and moon stopping because a man told them to.

Most other old books are creative works by smart people like Homer, Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero. In these cases, the author doesn’t matter so much. The books would still be great even if we didn’t know who wrote them. For example, no one thinks the Trojan War story by Homer is true, but we still admire him as a poet. But if we don’t believe the Bible stories told by Moses like we don’t believe Homer’s stories, then we think Moses was just lying.

For old historians like Herodotus and Tacitus, we only believe what sounds likely and reasonable. If we believed everything, we’d have to believe the miracles Tacitus said happened with Emperor Vespasian, like curing a lame man and a blind man, just like the miracles told about Jesus Christ.
