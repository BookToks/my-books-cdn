If we look closely at those books, it’s clear that Samuel didn’t write them. They talk about things that happened many years after Samuel died. Samuel died before Saul. For example, in 1 Samuel 28, Saul and the witch of Endor call up Samuel’s spirit after he was already dead. But the stories go on through the rest of Saul’s life and even into David’s life, who came after Saul.

The story about Samuel’s death and burial (which he couldn’t have written) is in 1 Samuel 25. This part happened around 1060 B.C. But the book covers history all the way to 1056 B.C., the year Saul died—four years after Samuel died.

The second book of Samuel starts with events that happened four years after Samuel’s death. It begins with David becoming king after Saul and tells about David’s 43 years as king. So, it’s clear Samuel didn’t write these books.

I have now checked all the early Bible books named after people like Moses, Joshua, and Samuel. The Christian church says these people wrote those books, but I’ve shown that’s not true.

So, to the priests and religious leaders who have argued against the Age of Reason, what do you say now? With all this clear proof, how can you still stand in your churches and tell people these books were written by inspired authors and are the word of God? It’s obvious the people you say wrote them didn’t write them—and you don’t even know who did.

What excuse do you have for keeping up this dishonest trick? What can you say against the honest and good religion of deism to support your false system full of lies, idol worship, and fake messages?

If the cruel and violent orders in the Bible, and the many terrible killings of men, women, and children because of those orders, had been blamed on someone you loved and respected, you would want to prove that wrong and defend their good name. But because you’re stuck in superstitions or don’t care...
