Cyrus, the king of Persia, felt inspired to make a big announcement to everyone in his kingdom. He also wrote it down. He said, “I, Cyrus, king of Persia, have been given all the kingdoms on Earth by the Lord God of heaven. He told me to build a house for Him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.”

He asked, “Who among you is loyal to God? Let him go to Jerusalem in Judah and build the Lord God of Israel’s house there.”

The only thing we know for sure about the book of Ezra is when it was written—right after the Jews came back from being held in Babylon, around 536 B.C. Ezra, who some Jewish scholars say is the same person as Esdras in other old writings, was one of the people who returned. He probably wrote down what happened.

Nehemiah, whose book comes right after Ezra’s, was another person who came back. He likely wrote about the same events in his own book.

But these stories mostly matter only to the Jewish people as part of their history. They are just like history books about France or England and don’t necessarily have special religious importance for everyone.

Even as historical records, these books aren’t completely trustworthy. For example, in Ezra chapter 2, the writer lists all the tribes and families and counts how many people came back from Babylon. This list was supposed to be very important.

But there’s a big mistake. The writer starts counting like this: “The children of Parosh, 2,174” and “The children of Shephatiah, 372,” and so on for all the families.

At the end, he says the total number of people was 42,360. But if you add up all the numbers yourself, it only comes to 29,818. That’s a difference of 12,542 people!

So, if there can be a big mistake like this, how can we be sure the Bible is always accurate?
