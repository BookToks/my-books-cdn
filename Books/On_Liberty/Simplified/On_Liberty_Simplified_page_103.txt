Whenever the ruler makes a decision, the officials can quietly stop it by just not doing it. In more developed countries, where people expect the government to do everything for them or at least to ask the government’s permission before acting, they blame the government for all their problems. When things get too bad, they rebel and start a revolution. Then someone new takes over, gives orders to the officials, and things keep going like before because the officials stay the same and no one else can replace them.

But things are different among people who are used to handling their own affairs. In France, many people have served in the military, and some have been officers. So during uprisings, there are always some capable leaders who can come up with a decent plan. The French are good at military stuff, and Americans are good at managing everyday business. If Americans had no government, they could easily create one and run things smoothly with enough intelligence and order. This is how every free society should be.

A people who can do this will stay free. They won’t let anyone control them just because that person can take over the government. No group of officials can force such a people to do something they don’t want. But when everything depends on officials, nothing they really don’t like can happen. The government system in these countries is a way to organize the nation’s skills and experience into a strong group that rules the rest. The better this system is at choosing smart people from all parts of society, the tighter its control becomes, including over the officials themselves.

The rulers are just as controlled by the system as the people they govern. A Chinese official is as much a tool of a harsh government as the poorest farmer. A Jesuit priest is completely controlled by his religious order, even though the order itself exists to give power to its members.
