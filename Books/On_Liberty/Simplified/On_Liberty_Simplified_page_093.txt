Taxing things like stimulants (like alcohol) up to the point where the government makes the most money from it is okay, especially if the government needs all that money.

Deciding who gets to sell these things depends on why you want to limit the sellers. Public places need rules and police because crimes often start there. So, it makes sense to let only trustworthy people sell these drinks for people to use right there. There should be rules about when these places can open and close so police can keep an eye on things. If a place causes trouble or breaks the law often, their license to sell should be taken away. 

But making even stricter rules, like having fewer bars or liquor stores just to make it harder to get these drinks, isn’t fair. It makes everyone deal with the inconvenience just because some people might misuse them. This kind of rule treats working-class people like kids who can’t handle freedom, which isn’t how free countries usually work. In free countries, people are supposed to be treated like adults and trusted to make good choices after they’ve been taught to do so. 

Saying people need strict control unless proven they can’t be trusted is silly because no one really tries hard enough to teach them first. Our country’s system is full of mixed ideas—some rules act like a strict government while the country as a whole is supposed to be free. Because of this, strict control doesn’t really work well as a way to teach people to behave better.
