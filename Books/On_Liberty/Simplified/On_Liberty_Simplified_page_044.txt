People often believe things that they can’t see or touch, and these beliefs are sometimes true but never the whole truth. They are only part of the truth—sometimes a big part, sometimes a small part—but they are often stretched out, twisted, or separated from other truths that should be connected to them.

On the other hand, unpopular or strange opinions usually contain some of the hidden truths that people have ignored. These opinions break free from being ignored and either try to work together with the common beliefs or fight against them, acting like they are the only truth. More often, they act like enemies, being just as one-sided as the popular opinions. This happens because people usually think in a one-sided way, and thinking in many different ways is rare. So, even when opinions change, one part of the truth fades while another part grows.

Even progress, which should add new ideas, usually just replaces one incomplete truth with another. The new idea is often better because it fits the needs of the time more than the old one did. Since popular opinions are only partly true, every opinion that shows some of the missing truths should be valued, even if it has some mistakes or confusion mixed in. A smart person won’t get angry just because others point out truths we might have missed while ignoring some we already see. Instead, they will understand that as long as popular opinions are one-sided, it’s good to have unpopular opinions that are also one-sided. These unpopular views are often strong and make people pay attention to the important parts of truth they share, even if they act like it’s the whole truth.

For example, in the 1700s, most educated people and those who followed them admired what they called civilization and the amazing achievements of modern science, literature, and philosophy. They thought that modern people were very different from ancient people and believed that this difference was all good for modern times. But then, the surprising ideas of Rousseau shocked everyone, breaking apart the simple, one-sided beliefs and forcing people to rethink and mix their ideas in a better way with new parts added.
