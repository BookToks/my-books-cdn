The idea that the gods care about injuries done to them is not proven. No one has shown that society or its leaders have the right to punish people for offending an all-powerful being, unless that offense also harms other people. The belief that one person must force another to be religious is what caused all the religious fights and punishments in history, and if we accept that idea, it would make those actions okay.

Even though people today don’t act as cruelly as before, they still try to stop things like traveling by train on Sundays or opening museums. This shows the same attitude: they don’t want others to do what their religion allows just because it’s not allowed by their own religion. They believe God hates what people of other faiths do and that we would be guilty if we don’t stop them.

I also want to talk about how little people respect freedom when it comes to the religion of the Mormons. It’s strange and interesting that a new religion, based on a clear fake story and without a famous or special leader, is believed by hundreds of thousands and has created a community, even in our modern world of newspapers, trains, and telegraphs. What matters here is that this religion, like others, has martyrs: its leader was killed by a mob for his teachings, and others died from violence too. They were forced to leave their home country and now live in a remote desert. Some people in this country even say it would be okay to send soldiers to force them to follow other beliefs, but only because it’s not convenient.

The main reason people hate the Mormon religion so much is because they allow polygamy—having more than one wife. This is allowed in some other religions like Islam, Hinduism, and Chinese traditions, but when English-speaking Christians do it, it causes a lot of anger. I strongly disapprove of polygamy too, because it is unfair and takes away freedom from women, making them less equal, while giving men more power without responsibility.
