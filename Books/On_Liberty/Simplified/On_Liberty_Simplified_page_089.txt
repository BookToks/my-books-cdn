The only way I can see to stop crimes done using this method, without seriously limiting the freedom of people who want the poisonous substance for other reasons, is to use what Bentham called “preappointed evidence.” This idea is common in contracts. 

When people make a contract, the law usually requires certain rules to be followed, like signing and having witnesses. This is so if there’s a fight later, there will be proof that the contract is real and legal. This makes it hard to fake contracts or make contracts that wouldn’t be valid if the truth came out. 

Similar rules could be used for selling things that might be used for crimes. For example, the seller might have to write down the exact time of the sale, the buyer’s name and address, what and how much was sold, and ask why the buyer wants it, then record the answer. If there’s no doctor’s note, maybe a third person should be there to watch, so if the item is used for a crime later, it can be traced back to the buyer. These rules wouldn’t make it too hard to get the item, but would make it much harder to use it for bad things without getting caught.

Society has the right to prevent crimes before they happen, which shows that the idea that people can do whatever they want as long as it only hurts themselves isn’t always true. For example, being drunk usually isn’t something the law should control. But if someone has been caught being violent to others while drunk, it’s fair to put special rules on them. If they get drunk again, they should be punished, and if they do something wrong while drunk, the punishment should be harsher. Getting drunk to harm others is a crime against society.
