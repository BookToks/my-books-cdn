Unless a society is really behind and can’t set up good schools on its own, the government might have to run schools and universities. This is like a last resort, kind of like when the government steps in to do big projects if private businesses won’t.

But usually, if there are enough qualified people in the country, they could provide good education voluntarily, as long as there’s a law that makes education compulsory and helps those who can’t afford it.

To make sure kids actually learn, there should be public exams for all children starting when they’re pretty young.

There could be a certain age when every child has to take a test to see if they can read. If a child can’t, the father might have to pay a small fine or work it off, and the child would have to go to school at his expense. Every year, the tests would cover more subjects so that everyone learns and remembers at least some basic knowledge. After that, kids could choose to take more exams on other subjects and earn certificates if they do well. To keep the State from influencing opinions too much, tests beyond basic skills would only cover facts and science. If religion, politics, or other tricky topics are tested, the questions would just check if students know what different opinions exist and why, not whether those opinions are right or wrong.

With this system, kids would grow up much like they do now, either following their family’s religion or beliefs. The State would just make sure they get proper instruction. Nothing would stop parents from having their kids learn religion at the same schools where they learn everything else.
