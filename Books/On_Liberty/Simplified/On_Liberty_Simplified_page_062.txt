But people usually just follow the crowd, meaning most people are pretty average. What’s new is that they don’t get their ideas from church leaders, government officials, or books anymore. Instead, people like themselves tell them what to think, often through newspapers, in the moment.

I’m not saying this is bad. I don’t think anything much better can happen when most people’s minds are not very sharp. But this means when average people run the government, the government ends up being average too. No democracy or large group of rulers has ever been better than average by itself, unless the many listened to a few smarter and more knowledgeable people. All great ideas start with individuals, usually just one person.

The good thing about regular people is that they can follow these great ideas and understand them. I’m not saying we should blindly follow strong leaders who force their will on everyone. Such control takes away freedom and hurts both the people and the leader. But when average people’s opinions become the main force, it’s important for smart and unique individuals to stand out even more.

In times like these, people who think differently shouldn’t be stopped; they should be encouraged. Before, it wasn’t enough to just be different—you had to be better too. Now, just being different and not following the crowd is helpful. Because society often punishes people who act differently, it’s important to have those “eccentric” people to break that control. Usually, places with strong characters also have lots of eccentric people. The amount of eccentricity in a society shows how much genius, energy, and courage it has.
