If this is true, the sooner this kind of civilization is told to leave, the better. It will only get worse until it is destroyed and rebuilt by strong outsiders, like what happened to the Western Empire.

The ideas explained here need to be accepted by more people before we can use them properly in all parts of government and morals. The few points I will make are meant to show these ideas clearly, not to explain everything fully. I’m giving examples to help understand the two main rules that make up this whole essay. These examples will help decide which rule fits best when it’s not clear.

The two main rules are: First, a person is not responsible to society for what they do if it only affects themselves. Society can only respond with advice, teaching, or choosing to avoid that person if it wants. Second, if a person’s actions hurt others, they are responsible and can be punished socially or legally if society thinks it’s needed to protect itself.

But just because someone’s actions might hurt others doesn’t always mean society should get involved. Sometimes, when someone tries to reach a fair goal, they might cause pain or loss to others without meaning to.

These conflicts between people often happen because of bad social systems, but while those systems exist, they can’t be avoided. Some problems would happen no matter what system is in place. For example, when someone wins a crowded job or a tough test, or is chosen over someone else for something both want, they benefit because others lose or feel disappointed.
