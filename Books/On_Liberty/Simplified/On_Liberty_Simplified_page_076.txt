Sometimes, a person might do things that don’t really hurt anyone else, but might cause some small problems for society. These problems aren’t serious and society can handle them because it’s more important to keep people free to make their own choices.

If adults want to take care of themselves, they should do it for their own good, not because society is trying to stop them from messing up and not helping others. Society shouldn’t punish people just because they don’t act perfectly all the time.

Society already has control over people when they are kids. It has plenty of time to teach them how to act reasonably. The current generation is in charge of raising the next one. Even though society isn’t perfect and can’t make everyone wise and good, it can still help most people grow up to be better than before.

If society lets many people grow up without learning to think carefully about their actions, then society is to blame for what happens. Society has education, rules, and the influence of what most people believe to guide young people. It shouldn’t claim it needs more power to control personal choices, especially when those choices mainly affect the people making them.

Trying to force people to be careful or moderate by using strict control often backfires. Strong, independent people will resist being controlled. They won’t accept others telling them what to do unless it’s to stop them from hurting someone else. Sometimes, people even act rebellious on purpose just to show they won’t be controlled, like what happened during the time of King Charles II.
