If people have strong characters and break free from the usual rules, society often singles them out and calls them "wild" or "weird," like complaining that the Niagara River doesn’t flow smoothly like a calm canal.

I really want to stress how important genius is and why we should let it grow freely in both ideas and actions. I know most people agree with this in theory, but in real life, many just don’t care.

People think genius is cool if it helps someone write a great poem or paint a nice picture. But true genius means being original in thinking and doing things. Almost everyone says that’s admirable, but deep down, they believe they don’t really need it.

Unfortunately, this makes sense. People who aren’t original can’t understand why it’s useful. They can’t see what it would do for them—how could they? If they could, it wouldn’t be original anymore. The first thing originality does is open their eyes, and only then can they start being original themselves.

Remember, nothing new was ever done without someone being the first to do it. All good things come from originality. People should be humble and believe there’s still more to create. The less they realize they need originality, the more they actually do.

Honestly, even if people say they respect intelligence or talent, the world tends to favor average people. In the past—ancient times, the Middle Ages, and a bit less now—individuals with talent or high status were powerful. Today, individuals get lost in the crowd. Public opinion rules the world, especially in politics. True power belongs to large groups and governments that represent them. This is true not just in politics but also in everyday life. The people who shape “public opinion” aren’t always the same everywhere: in America, it’s mostly white people; in England, mostly the middle class.
