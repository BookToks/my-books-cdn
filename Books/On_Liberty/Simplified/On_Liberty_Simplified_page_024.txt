You can't just say that someone who believes differently can keep their opinion if it’s useful or harmless, but can’t say it’s true. The truth is part of how useful an opinion is. If we want to decide whether people should believe something, can we really ignore if it’s true or not? Even the best people think that a belief that’s not true can’t really be helpful. And if someone refuses to believe a popular idea because they think it’s false, can you stop them from saying why?

People who support popular ideas always use this argument. They don’t separate usefulness from truth. They say their ideas are important because they are “true.” So, you can’t have a fair talk about usefulness if one side can argue truth but the other can’t. Also, when the law or society won’t allow anyone to question if an opinion is true, they usually won’t accept anyone saying it’s not useful either. At best, they might say it’s not absolutely necessary or that rejecting it is wrong.

To explain why it’s harmful to stop people from sharing opinions just because we disagree, let’s look at a specific example. I’ll pick one that’s not easy for me — ideas that most people believe in, like belief in God, life after death, or common moral rules. Arguing about these gives an unfair advantage to someone against free speech because they can say, “Are these really the ideas you don’t think are certain enough to protect by law? Do you think you’re always right about belief in God?”

But I want to say that being sure about a belief isn’t the same as being infallible. The real problem is deciding what others can or can’t hear, without letting them see the other side. I strongly reject this kind of control, even if it’s about something I believe in deeply.
