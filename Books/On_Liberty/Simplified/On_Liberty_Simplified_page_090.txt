Being lazy can’t be punished by law unless someone is supported by the government or breaks a contract. But if a person doesn’t do their legal duties, like taking care of their kids, it’s not unfair to force them to do it, even if that means making them work, when there’s no other way.

There are many things people do that only hurt themselves, so the law shouldn’t stop them. But if they do these things in public, it can be rude or offensive to others, and then it’s okay to stop them. For example, actions that go against good manners or decency can be banned, even if they don’t harm anyone directly.

Another question is about people doing things that are seen as wrong but only hurt themselves. Society can’t stop or punish them because it respects personal freedom. But should people be allowed to advise or encourage others to do these things? This is tricky. Telling or encouraging someone to do something is a social action and might affect others, so it could be controlled. But since people are free to do what they want for themselves, they should also be free to talk and share ideas about it. So, if it’s okay to do something, it should also be okay to suggest it.

The only tricky part is when someone gives advice for their own benefit, like making money by promoting things society sees as harmful. This creates a problem because some people make their living by going against what’s good for everyone.
