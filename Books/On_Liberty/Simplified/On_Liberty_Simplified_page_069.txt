If people only start to resist when everyone is almost the same, then any differences will seem wrong, bad, or even unnatural. People quickly stop imagining different ways of being when they haven’t seen them for a while.

About How Much Control Society Should Have Over a Person.

So, where should a person have control over themselves, and where should society have control? How much of life belongs to the individual, and how much belongs to society?

Each should get what fits them best. The individual should control the parts of life that mainly matter to themselves. Society should control the parts that mainly matter to everyone.

Even though society isn’t based on a formal agreement, and it’s not useful to pretend it is, anyone who gets protection from society must give something back. Living in society means everyone has to follow certain rules about how to treat others. First, people should not harm each other or take away rights that are protected by law or general understanding. Second, everyone should help share the work and sacrifices needed to protect the society and its members from harm.

Society can make sure these rules are followed, no matter what. But society can do more than that. Sometimes a person’s actions may hurt others or show no care for their well-being without breaking any laws. In that case, the person can be criticized by public opinion but not punished by law. Whenever a person’s behavior harms others, society has the right to step in and decide if stopping it helps everyone. But if a person’s actions only affect themselves, or only affect others who are adults and able to understand, then society should not interfere.
