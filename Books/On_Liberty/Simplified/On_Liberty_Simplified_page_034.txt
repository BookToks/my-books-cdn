In each case, old ways of thinking that controlled people were thrown off, but no new control took their place yet. The energy from these three times helped shape Europe into what it is now. Every improvement in how people think or how societies work comes from one of these moments. Lately, it seems like these energies are almost used up, and we won’t get a fresh start until we stand up for our mental freedom again.

Now, let’s move to the next part of the argument. Let’s forget for a moment that any popular ideas might be wrong and assume they are true. Then, we should look at what happens when people believe these ideas without talking about them openly. Even if someone strongly believes something, they should realize that no matter how true their idea is, if it isn’t talked about openly and often, it will just become a lifeless rule, not a real truth.

There are some people (not as many as before) who think it’s enough if someone agrees with their beliefs without really understanding why. These people believe that if their ideas are taught by authority, questioning them does more harm than good. Where these people have power, it becomes almost impossible to reject the accepted ideas carefully and wisely, though people might still reject them without thinking. It’s hard to stop all discussion, and when discussion happens, beliefs that aren’t based on real understanding often fall apart when challenged. But even if the true opinion stays in someone’s mind as just a blind belief, not open to argument, this isn’t how a smart person should hold the truth. That’s not really knowing the truth. Holding truth like this is just another superstition stuck to words that sound true.

If people’s thinking and judgment should grow—which even Protestants agree with—what better way is there to practice this than by learning about the things we care most about and have to have opinions on? If growing the mind means anything, it means understanding why we believe what we believe.
