Almost everyone believes in certain ideas just because they are used to them. This is an example of how habits can feel natural, even though they are learned. People don’t usually question the rules about how we should behave because they think these rules don’t need explanations.

Many people think, and some so-called philosophers agree, that feelings are better than reasons when it comes to these rules. They believe feelings make reasons unnecessary. Most people decide how others should act based on what they themselves like or what their friends like. No one admits that their judgment is just based on their own likes. But if opinions don’t have good reasons, they are just personal preferences. Even if many people share the same preference, it’s still just a group liking, not a solid reason.

For most people, their own likes, backed up by others’ likes, are enough reasons for their ideas about right and wrong, good taste, or proper behavior. These ideas aren’t usually explained by religion, but religion also influences how people think about these things. People’s opinions on what is good or bad are shaped by many things that affect what they want others to do. Sometimes it’s their logic, other times their biases or superstitions. Often it’s their feelings about society, sometimes their jealousy or pride. Most of all, it’s their own hopes or fears, or what benefits them.

When there is a dominant social class, much of a country’s ideas about right and wrong come from that class’s interests and feelings of being better than others. The rules between different groups—like Spartans and Helots, masters and slaves, rulers and subjects, nobles and commoners, men and women—mostly come from these class feelings. These ideas also affect how people in the powerful class treat each other.
