Do the rewards of winning completely disappear because the victory is so total?

I don’t agree with that. As people get smarter, more ideas become accepted without question. The happiness of people can almost be measured by how many important truths everyone agrees on. When serious arguments stop happening about different topics, it means people’s opinions are coming together. This is good when the opinions are true, but it can be bad when the opinions are wrong. 

Even though having fewer different opinions is necessary and unavoidable, not all the results are good. One big loss is that when no one argues against a truth anymore, people don’t have to explain or defend it. This makes understanding it less active and less thoughtful. I wish teachers would find a way to help students feel the same challenges as if someone was arguing with them, so they have to think harder about the truth.

But instead of doing that, teachers have stopped using ways to do this. The Socratic method, shown perfectly in Plato’s dialogues, was a way to make people question what they thought they knew. It helped people realize they didn’t really understand something, so they could learn better and believe in ideas for the right reasons. 

In the Middle Ages, students debated each other for a similar reason. They had to know their own opinion and the opposite one well, and be able to support their side and argue against the other. These debates had a problem because they were based on authority, not reason, so they weren’t as good for training the mind as the Socratic method. Still, both these ways helped people think better, and today’s education doesn’t have anything that even comes close.
