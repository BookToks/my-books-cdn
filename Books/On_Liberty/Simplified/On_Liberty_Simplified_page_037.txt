If we agree with this way of thinking, the most that people who are happy with just a little understanding of the truth can say is that it’s still important to have free discussion. Even this idea admits that people should be reasonably sure that all questions and doubts have been properly answered. But how can those questions be answered if no one is allowed to ask them? And how can we know the answers are good if people aren’t allowed to say if they’re not satisfied?

At least, the thinkers and religious leaders who try to solve these problems need to know about the hardest questions. They can’t do that unless those questions are openly talked about and shown in the strongest way possible. The Catholic Church deals with this problem in its own way.

It separates people into two groups: those who can believe its teachings because they are convinced, and those who have to believe on trust. Neither group gets to pick what to accept. But trusted clergy members are allowed to learn about the arguments against the Church, so they can respond to them. They can read books considered heretical. Regular people usually can’t do this unless they get special permission, which is hard to get. This approach lets teachers know the other side’s ideas but stops most people from seeing them. This way, the leaders have more knowledge but not more freedom to think than everyone else. This helps the Church keep control. Even though knowing a lot without freedom doesn’t create a broad, open mind, it can make someone good at defending a cause. 

In Protestant countries, this doesn’t happen because Protestants believe everyone is responsible for choosing their own religion, not just the teachers. Also, today it’s almost impossible to stop people from reading what educated people read. If those who teach others are to know what they need to, everything must be free to write and publish without limits.

If the problem with no free discussion was only that people didn’t know the reasons behind their beliefs, it might seem like just an intellectual problem. It wouldn’t be a moral problem and wouldn’t change how those beliefs affect people’s character.
