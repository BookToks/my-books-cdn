Second, this idea says everyone should be free to like what they want and live their life in a way that fits who they are. People should be able to do what they want, as long as it doesn’t hurt others, even if others think their choices are weird or wrong.

Third, because each person has this freedom, people should also be free to join together with others for any reason that doesn’t harm anyone. The people joining must be adults and not forced or tricked.

A society that doesn’t respect these freedoms isn’t really free, no matter what kind of government it has. True freedom means being able to follow your own path as long as you don’t stop others from doing the same. Everyone is responsible for taking care of their own body and mind. People are better off if we let each other live how we want instead of forcing everyone to live the same way.

Even though this idea isn’t new and might seem obvious, it actually goes against what most people think and do. Society has spent a lot of effort trying to make people follow what it thinks is right for personal and social behavior. Long ago, some city-states and philosophers believed the government should control every part of private life because they thought the state needed to keep everyone disciplined. This way of thinking made sense back then because those small states faced many dangers and couldn’t risk people acting freely.

Today, countries are bigger, and religious and political powers are separated, so governments don’t control private life as much. But moral pressure to follow popular opinions is still very strong, especially about personal choices. Religion, which shapes many people’s morals, has often been controlled by leaders wanting power or by strict groups like the Puritans.
