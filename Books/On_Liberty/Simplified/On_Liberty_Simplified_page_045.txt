The current opinions today are actually closer to the truth than Rousseau’s ideas were. They have more real facts and fewer mistakes. But Rousseau’s ideas still included important truths that people needed to hear. These ideas stuck around even after the main excitement died down. For example, the idea that living simply is better, and that the fake rules and lies in society can make people weak and bad, has been in smart people’s minds ever since Rousseau wrote. These ideas will eventually make a difference, even though right now they still need to be spoken about clearly and shown by actions, because just talking about them isn’t enough anymore.

In politics, it’s pretty normal to think that a group wanting order and stability and a group wanting change and progress are both needed for a healthy government. Neither side is perfect alone. The best situation is when one side understands that it needs both order and progress, knowing what should stay the same and what should change. Each way of thinking is useful because the other side has problems. Also, their conflict helps keep both sides reasonable. If ideas supporting democracy and aristocracy, property and equality, working together and competing, luxury and self-control, social life and being independent, freedom and rules, and other opposing ideas aren’t all freely shared and strongly defended, one side will take over and the other will lose out. 

Truth in big life issues is mostly about balancing opposite ideas. Very few people can do this fairly and correctly, so it usually happens through a tough fight between opposing groups. On these big questions, if one opinion is better than the other, the one that matters most is the one that is in the minority at that time and place. That opinion shows the side of people’s well-being that is being ignored and might not get its fair share.
