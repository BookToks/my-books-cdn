This is how sure a person who can make mistakes can be, and this is the only way to be sure.

It’s weird that people agree free discussion is important but don’t like it when it goes too far. They don’t realize that if the reasons for free discussion aren’t good in extreme cases, they aren’t good at all. It’s also strange that people think they aren’t acting like they know everything when they say some ideas shouldn’t be questioned because they are “certain.” They believe something is certain just because they are sure it is. Saying something is certain while stopping others from questioning it means they think they, and people who agree with them, are the only ones who can decide what’s true, without hearing other opinions.

Today, many people feel like they don’t really believe in much but are scared of doubting everything. They don’t feel sure their opinions are true; they just feel they can’t live without them. Because of this, some say certain beliefs are so important for society that governments must protect them, just like they protect other important things. They argue that governments don’t need to be perfect to act on what most people believe is right. It’s also often said that only bad people want to weaken these helpful beliefs, so it’s okay to stop bad people from spreading ideas that only they would support. This way of thinking says it’s not about whether beliefs are true but about whether they are useful, so they don’t have to admit they think they are always right.

But people who think this don’t see that they are still acting like they know everything, just in a different way. Whether an opinion is useful is also just an opinion—it can be argued about and needs discussion just like any other idea. You need someone who knows everything to decide if an opinion is harmful or false, unless the opinion can fully defend itself.
