In all these situations, people should be totally free, both by law and in society, to do what they want and accept the results.

It would be wrong to think this idea means people don’t care about others or shouldn’t get involved in each other’s lives unless it affects them. Actually, we need to care more and try harder to help others without expecting anything in return. But kindness and care should use gentle ways to encourage people, not harsh punishments or threats.

I don’t think selfish qualities are unimportant; they matter a lot, maybe just a bit less than caring about others. Education should help us develop both kinds of qualities. Even when we’re done learning, we should still focus on teaching ourselves to care about ourselves through understanding and choice, not force.

People should help each other see what’s better or worse and support each other to choose the good things and avoid the bad ones.

We should always encourage each other to use our best abilities and guide our feelings and goals toward smart, uplifting things instead of foolish or harmful ones. But no one, not even a group of people, has the right to tell an adult that they can’t live their life how they want if it only affects themselves. A person cares most about their own life, and others usually don’t have as much interest or understanding about it. Society’s interest in a person’s life, except how they treat others, is small and indirect. People know their own feelings and situations way better than anyone else.

So, when it comes to decisions that only affect ourselves, society shouldn’t interfere based on general guesses that might be wrong or wrongly applied. In this part of life, everyone should have the freedom to be themselves.
