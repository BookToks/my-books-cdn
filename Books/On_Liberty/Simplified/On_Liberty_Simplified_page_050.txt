First, if someone is forced to keep quiet about their opinion, that opinion might actually be true. To say otherwise is like thinking we can never be wrong.

Second, even if the opinion that’s silenced is wrong, it often still has some truth in it. Since most popular opinions don’t tell the whole story, hearing different ideas helps us get closer to the full truth.

Third, even if the common opinion is completely true, it needs to be challenged and debated seriously. Otherwise, people just accept it without really understanding why. 

Fourth, if no one argues about an idea, its meaning can get lost or weakened. The idea then becomes just words people say without really believing them or letting them change how they act.

Before finishing, it’s important to talk about those who say all opinions should be allowed only if they’re shared politely and stay within “fair” limits. It’s hard to decide exactly what those limits are, because people often get offended when their ideas are strongly challenged. Anyone who argues passionately might seem rude to the people they’re debating.

But this problem is less important than a bigger one. Even if someone shares a true opinion in a bad way, this can be criticized. But the worst problems—like twisting facts, ignoring important points, or misrepresenting the other side—are often done honestly by people who aren’t trying to cheat. Because of that, it’s hard to say they are morally wrong, and the law shouldn’t try to punish these kinds of mistakes in arguments.
