Some modern thinkers who strongly disagree with old religions have also pushed hard for society to control people’s beliefs. One example is M. Comte, who wants society to have a lot of power over individuals, more than even the strictest ancient philosophers imagined. He believes this control should come more from morals than laws.

Besides these individual ideas, many people today want society to have more control over individuals, using both public opinion and laws. Since the world is changing in a way that makes society stronger and individuals weaker, this control is not going away but actually getting worse. People, whether leaders or regular citizens, often want others to follow their own beliefs and ways of living. This urge is backed by both good and bad parts of human nature and is only stopped when people don’t have enough power. But since power is growing, unless we strongly believe in protecting freedom, this control will keep increasing.

To make the discussion easier, let’s focus first on one part of this idea that most people already agree with to some extent. That part is the Freedom of Thought, which includes the freedom to speak and write what you think. These freedoms are part of the rules in countries that allow religious tolerance and free government. However, the reasons behind these freedoms, both in theory and in real life, are not well understood or fully appreciated by many people, even some leaders.
