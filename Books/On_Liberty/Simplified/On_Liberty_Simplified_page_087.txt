But most people agree it’s better for everyone if people go after what they want without worrying too much about the negative results. In other words, society doesn’t think that people who lose out have the right to avoid feeling pain from losing. Society only steps in when someone tries to win by doing things that hurt the common good, like cheating, tricking others, or using force.

Also, trading is something we do together as a society. When someone sells stuff to the public, it affects other people and society as a whole. Because of this, society can have a say in how people act when trading. In the past, governments even set prices and controlled how things were made for important cases. But now, after a lot of debate, people understand that the best way to get cheap and good products is to let sellers and producers be free, while buyers also have the freedom to buy from others. This idea is called Free Trade.

Free Trade is based on different reasons from the idea of personal freedom, but both are strong ideas. Rules that limit trade or production are restrictions, and all restrictions are generally bad. But these rules only limit parts of behavior that society can control, and they’re wrong only if they don’t actually do what they’re supposed to do.

The idea of personal freedom isn’t really involved in most questions about Free Trade, like how much the government should control to stop cheating by mixing bad stuff into products, or how much they should protect workers in dangerous jobs. These questions only involve freedom because it’s usually better to let people make their own choices, but it’s okay for the government to step in for these reasons.

On the other hand, some cases about controlling trade are really about freedom. For example, laws that ban alcohol (like the Maine Law), stopping the import of opium into China, or limiting the sale of poisons. These rules are a problem, not because they limit the freedom of the sellers or producers, but because they limit the freedom of the buyers to get those things.
