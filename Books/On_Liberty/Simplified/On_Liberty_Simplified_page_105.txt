This central office would gather all the different information and experiences from running this part of public work everywhere, including what other countries do and general political ideas. This main office should have the right to know everything that happens, and its special job would be to share useful knowledge from one place with others.

Because it looks at things from a higher and broader view, without being stuck in local biases, its advice would be very respected. But its real power, as a permanent group, should only be to make sure local officials follow the laws set for them. In cases not covered by general rules, those officials should use their own judgment but still be responsible to the people they serve. If they break the rules, they should face legal consequences. The rules themselves should be made by lawmakers, and the central office's job is to watch that the rules are followed. If they are not, the office should either ask the courts to enforce the law or ask the voters to remove officials who don’t do their job properly.

This is the basic idea behind the central control the Poor Law Board is supposed to have over those managing the Poor Rate across the country. Any extra powers the Board has were needed to fix long-standing bad management that affected not just local areas but the whole community. No one area has the right to cause widespread poverty that spills over and harms the wellbeing of all workers.

The powers the Poor Law Board has to force rules and make some laws (though they don’t use them much because of public opinion) are okay when something is very important for the whole nation. But these powers wouldn’t work for purely local matters. Still, having a central office to share information and give guidance to all local areas would be very useful in all parts of government work.
