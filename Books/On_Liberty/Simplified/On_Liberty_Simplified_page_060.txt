First of all, I think people could learn something from others. Everyone agrees that being original is important in life. We always need people who discover new ideas, show when old ideas no longer work, start new habits, and act in smarter, better ways. No one can really say the world is perfect and doesn’t need change.

It’s true that not everyone can do this. Only a few people, compared to everyone else, try new things that actually improve how we live. These few people are really important; without them, life would get boring and stop growing.

These people don’t just bring new good things; they also keep old good things alive. If there was nothing new to do, would our minds still matter?

Would it make sense for people to do old things without thinking, like robots? Even the best ideas and habits can become dull and automatic. If there weren’t some people who keep finding new ideas, those old ways would become useless and life could fall apart, like what happened to the Byzantine Empire. 

People with genius are rare, but we need to protect the environment where they can grow. Genius needs freedom to be itself. These people are different from everyone else and don’t fit easily into the usual roles society offers. If they give in to pressure and hide their true selves, society won’t really benefit from their talents.
