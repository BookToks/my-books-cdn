In the beginning of this essay, it was said that when a person is only involved in something by themselves, they have the freedom to do what they want. This also means that a group of people can agree with each other about things that only affect them, and no one else.

This is easy to understand as long as everyone involved agrees. But since people can change their minds, sometimes they need to make promises or agreements with each other. When they do, it’s usually right that they should keep those promises.

However, almost every country’s laws have some exceptions. People don’t have to keep promises that hurt other people who are not involved. Sometimes, if a promise is harmful to the person who made it, they can be freed from it.

For example, in most modern countries, a person cannot promise to sell themselves as a slave. Such a promise would not be allowed or supported by law or society. This limit exists because it’s clear that no one should lose their freedom completely by their own choice.

The reason we don’t stop people from making their own choices is to respect their freedom. If someone chooses something, it usually means it’s good or okay for them. But if someone sells themselves into slavery, they give up their freedom forever. This goes against the main idea of freedom — to be free to make your own choices in the future.

Freedom doesn’t mean you can give up your freedom forever. You can’t be free by choosing to be not free. This example shows why there are important limits on freedom.

Still, in real life, we often have to accept some limits on our freedom. The rule that says people should be free to do what only affects themselves also means that when people make agreements with each other about things that don’t affect others, they should be able to end those agreements if they all agree.

Even without everyone agreeing to end a deal, most promises can be changed or canceled, except for those that involve money or something worth money. Those usually need to be kept.
