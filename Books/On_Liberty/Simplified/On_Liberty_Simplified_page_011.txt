When a group that used to be in charge loses its power, or when people don’t like that group being on top, the common feelings often show a strong dislike for anyone who seems better or more important.

Another big reason for the rules about how we act, which are made by law or what people think is right, comes from how people obey the likes or dislikes of their leaders or gods. This obedience is selfish but not fake; it leads to real feelings of hate. For example, it made people burn magicians and heretics.

Besides these bad reasons, what’s good for society also helped shape these feelings, but more because of the likes and dislikes they caused, not just because of reason. Many feelings had nothing to do with what was best for society but still helped create the rules we follow.

What society or a powerful part of it likes or dislikes mostly decides the rules everyone has to follow, with punishments if they don’t.

Usually, people who think ahead of their time don’t try to change this basic idea, even if they disagree with some rules.

Instead, they try to change what society likes or dislikes on certain things they don’t agree with, rather than fight for everyone’s freedom to think differently. The only time people seriously stood up for the right to believe differently was about religion, which shows how tricky our sense of right and wrong can be because religious hatred is a strong example of moral feeling.

The first people who broke away from the Universal Church didn’t want others to have different religious opinions either. But after the fighting died down, no side fully won, and each group just tried to keep what they had. Minorities, knowing they couldn’t become the majority, had to ask the others to let them have different beliefs.
