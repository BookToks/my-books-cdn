People only use their skills like noticing things, making choices, feeling differences, thinking, and knowing what’s right when they actually have to make a decision. If someone does something just because everyone else does it, they’re not really choosing. They don’t get better at figuring out what’s best or wanting the right things.

Our minds and feelings, like our muscles, get stronger only when we use them. Doing things just because others do, or believing things just because others believe them, doesn’t make our minds stronger. If you accept an idea that doesn’t make sense to you, your thinking won’t get better—it might even get worse. And if you do something that doesn’t match how you feel or who you are, it can make your feelings and character weak instead of strong.

If someone lets others decide how they live, they’re just copying like a monkey. But if they choose their own path, they use all their skills. They have to watch carefully, think ahead, work hard to get information, decide wisely, and then stay strong and control themselves to stick with their choice. The more they decide for themselves, the more they use these abilities. Maybe someone could be kept safe and on a good path without these skills, but what kind of person would they really be?

It’s not just important what people do, but what kind of people they are when they do it. Among all the things humans make better and more beautiful, the most important is human beings themselves. Imagine if machines could build houses, grow food, fight battles, hold trials, build churches, and say prayers. Even then, it would be a big loss to replace real men and women with machines, because people now are already just weak versions of what humans can truly be.

Human nature isn’t like a machine built to do one job exactly. It’s like a tree that needs to grow and develop in all directions, following the natural forces that make it alive.
