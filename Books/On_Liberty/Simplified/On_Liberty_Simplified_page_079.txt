People don’t like to eat animals they consider “unclean.” This feeling is like a natural dislike that comes from believing something is dirty or wrong. For example, Hindus feel very strongly that some things are religiously impure. 

Now, imagine a country where most people are Muslims, and they don’t allow pork to be eaten there. This happens in many Muslim countries. Is it okay for the public to make this rule? People think eating pork is disgusting and believe their God forbids it. This rule wouldn't be religious persecution because no religion says you must eat pork. The only real problem would be if the government tried to control what people like or want for themselves.

Closer to home, most Spaniards think it’s very wrong to worship God in any way other than the Roman Catholic way. In Spain, only Catholic public worship is allowed. People in Southern Europe also think priests should not be married, seeing it as wrong and offensive. Protestants don’t agree with these strong feelings and the rules that force them on others.

But if people are allowed to interfere with others’ freedom for what they think is right, then it’s hard to say these cases are different. People want to stop what they see as wrong or offensive to God and society. There is no better reason to ban something than if it is seen as immoral or disrespectful by others. Unless we accept the idea that it’s okay to force others only when we think we are right, and not when others think they are right, we should be careful about accepting rules that we would hate if they were used against us.

Some might say these examples don’t really apply to us because in this country, people don’t try to stop others from eating certain foods, worshipping differently, or choosing whether to marry based on their beliefs.
