I know that in this country, people don’t usually get angry or shut down others just because they have different opinions on most topics. These examples show that having different opinions is normal and important because it gives every side a fair chance to be heard and understood.

When someone disagrees with what most people think, even if most people are right, it’s likely that the person who disagrees has something important to say. If we don’t listen to them, we might miss out on some truth.

Some might say, “But some beliefs, like Christian morals, are totally true. If someone teaches different morals, they are completely wrong.” Since this is a very important topic, it’s a good example to test this idea. But before deciding what Christian morals really are, we need to agree on what we mean by that.

If Christian morals mean the rules in the New Testament, it’s surprising that anyone who reads it carefully would think it is a complete set of moral rules. The Gospel refers to a moral code that already existed and only points out where it needs to be fixed or improved. It speaks in very general and sometimes poetic ways, not like clear laws.

Trying to make a full moral guide from the New Testament alone has never worked without adding parts from the Old Testament. The Old Testament has many rules that are strict and sometimes harsh, meant for people living in a rough time. St. Paul, who didn’t agree with using Jewish laws this way, assumed that people already had morals from Greek and Roman culture. His advice to Christians mostly fits with those morals, even accepting things like slavery.

What we now call Christian morality wasn’t created by Jesus or his followers but was built later by the Catholic Church in the first five centuries. Even though modern Christians and Protestants don’t fully accept it, they haven’t changed it as much as you might think. Usually, they have just removed some changes made in the Middle Ages and added their own ideas instead.
