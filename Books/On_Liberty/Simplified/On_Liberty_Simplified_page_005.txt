Dedication The main idea that runs through everything I’ve written here is how important it is for people to grow and develop in many different ways.

Wilhelm von Humboldt: Sphere and Duties of Government.

I dedicate this book to the memory of my dear wife and friend, who inspired me and helped create the best parts of my work. Her strong sense of truth and fairness pushed me to do better, and her approval was my greatest reward. 

Like everything I’ve written over the years, this work belongs to both of us. But she didn’t get to review it as much as she should have, because some important parts were saved for her to look over carefully—a chance that will never come. 

If I could share even half of the amazing thoughts and feelings she had, I believe it would help the world much more than anything I can write alone, without her incredible wisdom to guide me.
