Sometimes, we meet people who are really careful and thoughtful. They spend their whole lives trying to figure out how to balance what their conscience and reason tell them with traditional beliefs. But even after all that effort, they might not fully succeed.

No one can be a great thinker if they don’t follow their mind wherever it leads. Truth is gained more from the mistakes of someone who studies and thinks for themselves than from the correct ideas of people who never question anything.

Freedom to think isn’t just for making great thinkers. It’s even more important for regular people to reach their full mental potential. There have been great thinkers in times when most people couldn’t think freely. But there has never been a whole society of actively thinking people without freedom.

When people stop questioning big ideas, their minds don’t get excited or grow. This stops them from becoming better thinkers. We saw this happen in Europe after the Reformation, in the late 1700s with some educated people on the Continent, and in Germany during the times of Goethe and Fichte. These times were different in their ideas but similar because people were free from strict control.
