A group of people can keep getting better and changing for a while, but then they might stop. When do they stop? When they lose what makes them unique. If the countries in Europe go through this, it won’t happen in exactly the same way. The strict rules they face don’t mean they can’t change; they just can’t be different from each other.  

We don’t wear the old clothes our ancestors did anymore, but everyone still has to dress the same way. The style might change once or twice a year, but that’s just for the sake of change, not because it’s better or more comfortable. Everyone changing at the same time means no one really chooses what looks or feels best for them.  

We do like progress and new ideas. We keep inventing new machines and improvements in politics, school, and even in how we act morally. But often, when we talk about being better morally, it just means trying to make other people act like us. We don’t mind progress; in fact, we think we are the most progressive people ever.  

What we don’t like is individuality. We think it’s great if everyone is the same. But being different is usually what helps people notice their own flaws or see how someone else might be better. Combining the good parts of different people can create something even better.  

China is an example to think about. It’s a smart nation with some wise traditions created by thoughtful leaders. They made sure everyone learned the best ideas and those who knew the most got important jobs. You might think they figured out how to keep improving forever and stay ahead of everyone else.  

But actually, China stayed the same for thousands of years. If they want to get better in the future, it might be because of help from other countries.
