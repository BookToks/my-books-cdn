Prejudice or mistakes like this are really bad, but we can’t expect to avoid them all the time. They are kind of the price we pay for something really valuable. When one part of the truth tries to act like it is the whole truth, we should speak up against that. And if people react too strongly and are unfair in return, that one-sidedness is also sad but has to be accepted. If Christians want non-Christians to be fair to Christianity, they should also be fair to non-Christian beliefs. It doesn’t help the truth to ignore the fact that a lot of the best moral lessons come from people who either didn’t know about Christianity or didn’t believe in it.

I’m not saying that letting everyone say what they want will stop all the problems between different religious or philosophical groups. People who strongly believe in one truth often act like no other truth matters or exists. I admit that when everyone talks freely, opinions can sometimes become even more divided and angry. People reject ideas more fiercely when their enemies support them. But this fighting doesn’t help the angry people as much as it helps calm, open-minded observers.

The real problem isn’t when different parts of the truth clash loudly, but when half of the truth is quietly ignored. There’s hope when people have to listen to both sides. But if they only hear one side, mistakes turn into strong biases, and what was true can become false by being exaggerated. It’s very rare for someone to be fair and smart enough to judge between two sides when they only hear one side speak. So, the truth only stands a chance when every side, every opinion that holds some truth, not only has people to support it but is supported well enough to be heard.

We now understand that human mental health (which everything else depends on) needs freedom to have opinions and to express them. There are four main reasons for this, which we will quickly go over next.
