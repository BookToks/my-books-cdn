Even though people aren’t used to ideas like Von Humboldt’s and might be surprised that individuality is so important, the real question is about how much individuality matters. No one thinks that being excellent means just copying everyone else. People shouldn’t live without using their own judgment or showing their own character in how they live and make decisions.

But it also wouldn’t make sense to act like no one before you ever learned anything. Experience has shown that some ways of living or acting are better than others. Everyone agrees that young people should be taught to learn from what others have already figured out.

Still, when a person grows up, it’s their right and responsibility to understand and use that experience in their own way. They need to decide which parts of what’s been learned before really fit their own situation and personality. Traditions and customs show what other people have learned, so they deserve some respect. But those lessons might be limited or misunderstood.

Also, even if others’ experience is correct, it might not work for you. Customs fit usual situations and typical people, but your life or personality might be different. Finally, even if customs are good and fit you, just following them without thinking doesn’t help you grow or develop the unique qualities that make you truly human.
