John Stuart Mill knew it’s impossible to argue that punishment should be used to control people’s religious beliefs without also supporting harsh rulers like Marcus Antoninus. Sometimes, people who don’t believe in religious freedom admit this and say, like Dr. Johnson did, that those who punished Christians were actually right. They think that persecution is a kind of test that truth has to go through and that truth always wins in the end. They also say that legal punishments don’t really hurt the truth but can stop harmful mistakes. This is a strange way to argue against religious freedom and deserves attention.

This idea says it’s okay to punish the truth because punishment can’t really harm it. That means it’s not trying to stop new ideas from being accepted. But it’s not very kind to the people who bring these new ideas to the world. Finding and sharing important new truths that people didn’t know before is one of the greatest things a person can do. For example, early Christians and Reformers gave the world very important new ideas, and some people like Dr. Johnson think these were the best gifts anyone could give.

According to this idea, people who bring these important new ideas should be punished by being treated like the worst criminals or even killed. This isn’t a mistake or something sad that we should mourn, but something normal and fair. It’s like in ancient laws where someone who suggested a new law had a noose around their neck, ready to be tightened if everyone didn’t agree with them right away. People who support this way of treating those who help us don’t seem to care much about the help they get. I think this way of thinking is mostly held by people who believe new ideas were useful once but that we don’t need any more now.

But the saying that truth always beats persecution is one of those nice lies people keep repeating until it sounds true, even though experience shows it’s not. History is full of examples where truth was stopped by punishment. Even if it’s not destroyed forever, it can be pushed back for hundreds of years. For example, the Reformation happened at least twenty times before Luther, but it was stopped each time.
