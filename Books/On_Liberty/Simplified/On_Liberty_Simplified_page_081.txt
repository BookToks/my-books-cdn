Even though these statements are probably exaggerated and not completely true, the situation they describe could actually happen. It’s likely to happen because people in a democracy might feel they have the right to control how others spend their money.

If many people start believing in Socialist ideas, it could become shameful to own more than a little property or to earn money without doing manual work. Similar ideas are already common among workers, especially among less skilled workers who think everyone should get the same pay, no matter how good or hard-working they are. Sometimes, they even pressure skilled workers and employers to stop paying more for better work. If the public can control private matters, then these workers are just acting like the public does, trying to control others’ actions.

But even without imagining these cases, there are already serious intrusions on people’s private freedom happening today. Worse restrictions are also being suggested, with the idea that the public has unlimited power to ban anything it thinks is wrong—even if that means banning many things that are actually harmless.

For example, to stop people from drinking too much, some places in England and almost half the United States have made laws banning all use of alcoholic drinks except for medicine. Banning the sale basically means banning the use too. Although these laws have been hard to enforce and some states have repealed them (including the one that gave the idea its name), many well-meaning activists are still pushing for similar laws in other countries.
