John Stuart Mill said that most political thinkers in Europe didn’t believe governments should have limits, except for governments they thought shouldn’t exist at all. People in our own country might have felt the same way if things had stayed the same.

But when ideas or people succeed, their problems become clearer, which failure might hide. The idea that people don’t need to limit their own power seemed obvious when popular government was just a dream or something from long ago. Even the messy French Revolution didn’t change this idea much because its worst parts were caused by a small group trying to take over, not by regular popular governments. 

Later, democratic republics took over large parts of the world and became powerful countries. Because of this, people started to look closely at governments chosen by the people. They realized that words like “self-government” and “power of the people” don’t really tell the whole story.

The “people” who have power aren’t always the same as the people they control, and “self-government” doesn’t mean each person governs themselves, but that everyone is governed by the rest of the group.

Also, the “will of the people” usually means the will of the largest or most active group. This majority might want to control or even hurt a smaller group. So, just like with any other power, governments need limits to protect individuals. These limits are still important even when those in power have to answer to the community or the strongest group.

This idea makes sense to smart thinkers and to people who don’t like democracy because they think it might hurt their interests. Now, many political thinkers agree that “the tyranny of the majority” is a real problem society must watch out for.
