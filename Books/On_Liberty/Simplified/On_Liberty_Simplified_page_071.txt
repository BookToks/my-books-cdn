When people act towards each other, it's important to mostly follow general rules so everyone knows what to expect. But when it comes to a person’s own life, they should be free to make their own choices. Others can give advice or try to encourage them, but in the end, they have to decide for themselves. Making mistakes after hearing advice is better than letting others force them to do what those people think is best.

I don’t mean that how others feel about someone shouldn’t be affected by that person’s good or bad qualities. That’s just not possible or even a good idea. If someone has good qualities that help them in life, it’s natural to admire them because they seem closer to the ideal human. If they lack those qualities a lot, people will naturally feel the opposite of admiration. There’s a certain level of foolishness or bad taste that, while it doesn’t mean we should harm the person, makes us dislike or even look down on them. You can’t have strong good qualities without feeling this way about those who don’t.

Even if a person isn’t hurting anyone, they can act in a way that makes others see them as foolish or less important. Since most people don’t want to be seen that way, it’s actually helpful to warn them about it, just like any other bad outcome. It would be great if people could honestly tell each other when they think someone is wrong, without it being seen as rude or disrespectful.

We also have the right to act based on our opinions about others, without trying to control them. For example, we don’t have to spend time with someone we don’t like, although we shouldn’t make a show of avoiding them. We have the right to choose who we want to be around. Sometimes, it might even be our responsibility to warn others if we think someone could have a harmful influence. We can also prefer others over that person when we offer help or kindness, except when it comes to things that could help improve them.
