The problem gets worse the better and more organized the government system is, especially when the smartest and most skilled people are chosen to run it. In England, there was a recent idea to pick all government workers by testing them, so the most intelligent and educated people would get these jobs. Many people have argued for and against this idea.

One big reason some people don’t like it is that government jobs don’t pay enough or seem important enough to attract the best talent. Those top people usually find better and more exciting work in other fields or companies. It would have made more sense if the supporters of the idea said this to explain why it’s hard to get top talent for government jobs.

It’s strange that the opponents say this. The fact that the best talent doesn’t want to work in government is actually a good thing for the plan. If all the smartest people joined the government, it might be a problem. If the government controlled every important part of society and all top jobs were filled by the smartest people, then all the knowledge and skill would be in a big government group. Everyone else would depend on this group for everything: regular people would take orders, and ambitious people would just want to join this group and move up.

In this system, ordinary people wouldn’t know enough to question or stop the government group. Even if a leader wanted to make changes, they couldn’t do anything that went against what this group wanted.

This is the sad situation in Russia, according to people who have studied it well. The Czar can’t control the government workers; he can punish them, but he can’t rule without their help or against their wishes.
