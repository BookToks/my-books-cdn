There was a time when people acted a lot on their own feelings and ideas, and society had a hard time controlling them. The problem was getting strong people to follow rules that stopped them from doing whatever they wanted. To fix this, laws and discipline took over, trying to control every part of a person’s life to shape their character, because society had no better way to keep order.

But now, society has mostly won over individuality. The real problem today isn’t too much personal freedom, but not enough. Things have changed a lot since powerful people often rebelled against laws and had to be tightly controlled so others could be safe. Today, everyone, no matter their social class, feels like they’re always being watched and judged.

People don’t ask themselves what they really want or what fits their true personality. Instead, they wonder what’s normal for their social status or what people richer or higher up do. They don’t choose what they like; they only think about what’s usual. Even in fun or hobbies, fitting in is the most important thing. Being different or acting weird is avoided just like breaking the law. Because they don’t follow their own nature, they end up not really having one. Their abilities and desires shrink, and they lose their own opinions and feelings.

Is this the kind of life people should have?

According to Calvinism, it is. This belief says the worst thing a person can do is to follow their own will. All the good in humanity comes from obeying rules.
