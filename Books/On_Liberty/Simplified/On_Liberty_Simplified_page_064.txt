But a man, and even more a woman, who is accused of doing something that nobody else does, or not doing what everyone else does, gets talked about badly as if they did something really wrong. People need to have a title or some kind of special status to be able to do what they want without losing respect. I say “a little bit” because if someone does too much of that, they risk something worse than just mean comments—they might be declared crazy and lose their property to their family.

One thing about today’s public opinion is that it doesn’t like people who show strong individuality. Most people are not very smart or passionate; they don’t have strong tastes or wishes to do anything unusual. So, they don’t understand people who do, and they group them with wild and reckless folks they usually look down on.

Besides this, imagine there is a strong movement to improve morals. We can guess what will happen. Today, there is such a movement; many people behave more properly and avoid excesses. There is a kind spirit to help others improve morally and wisely, and people want everyone to follow general rules and fit into the approved way of living.

That approved way, whether spoken or not, is to not want anything too strongly. The ideal person is one without a strong character; it’s like squeezing a Chinese lady’s foot to make it small—this means cutting down every part of human nature that stands out and makes someone different from normal people.

As with most ideals that leave out half of what’s good, this standard only creates a weak copy of the other half.
