When people talk about harsh arguments—like name-calling, sarcasm, or attacking someone's character—complaining about these would make more sense if both sides had to follow the same rules. But usually, only those who disagree with the popular opinion are told to stop using these attacks. If you support the popular view, you can use them without much criticism, and people might even praise you for being passionate and right.

The real damage happens when these harsh words are used against people who don’t have much power to defend themselves. Most of the time, the popular opinions get the biggest advantage from using mean attacks. The worst thing someone arguing can do is call the other side’s supporters bad or immoral people. People with unpopular opinions face this a lot because they are usually few and don’t have much influence, so no one else tries to protect them. On the other hand, people attacking popular opinions can’t safely use these attacks—they would only hurt their own cause. Usually, unpopular opinions can only be heard if their supporters speak calmly and avoid offending others. If they don’t, they lose support. But when popular opinions use harsh insults, it often scares people away from even listening to the other side.

Because of this, protecting truth and fairness means it’s way more important to stop harsh attacks on unpopular views than on popular ones. For example, it’s more important to stop rude attacks on people who don’t believe in religion than on religion itself.

Still, laws or rules shouldn’t try to control this. Instead, people should judge each situation carefully. They should criticize anyone—no matter which side they’re on—who shows dishonesty, meanness, close-mindedness, or intolerance. But they shouldn’t assume someone is bad just because they have different opinions. People deserve respect when they calmly and honestly explain what their opponents believe, without exaggerating or hiding anything that might make the other side look better.
