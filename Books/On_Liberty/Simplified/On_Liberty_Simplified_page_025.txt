No matter how sure someone is that an idea is wrong and harmful—or even immoral and disrespectful—if they stop others from sharing that idea, they are acting like they can never be wrong. 

This is especially dangerous when the idea is called immoral or disrespectful, because those are the times when people make the biggest mistakes that future generations look back on with shock and sadness. History shows many times when laws were used to punish great people and important ideas, often with bad results. Some ideas survived and were later used to justify punishing others who disagreed.

People should often remember Socrates, a man who lived long ago and clashed with the laws and opinions of his time. He lived in a place and time full of great people and was known as the most virtuous man. He was the teacher who inspired famous thinkers like Plato and Aristotle, who shaped ethics and philosophy. Despite this, his own people put him to death after a trial, accusing him of disrespecting the gods their state believed in and corrupting young people with his teachings. The court believed these charges and sentenced him, even though he probably deserved to be remembered as one of the best people to ever live.

After Socrates, the only other famous example of unfair judgment like this is the event at Calvary over eighteen hundred years ago.
