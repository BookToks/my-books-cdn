But when a belief is just something you inherit from your family and accept without really thinking about it, the mind stops working hard on the questions that come with that belief like it did at first. Over time, people tend to forget everything about the belief except the basic rules, or they agree with it in a boring, lazy way, like trusting it without really understanding or trying it out for themselves. Because of this, the belief almost stops connecting with a person's inner feelings or thoughts.  

This is why we often see people who keep the belief like it’s just something outside their mind, making it hard for anything new or exciting to get in. The belief acts like a guard, stopping any fresh ideas from coming in, but it doesn’t actually do anything to help the mind or heart.  

To show how much beliefs that should really affect us deeply can sometimes just stay as empty ideas, look at how most Christians treat the teachings of Christianity. By Christianity here, I mean what all churches and groups agree on—the lessons and advice in the New Testament. Everyone who says they are Christian thinks these are important and follows them as rules.  

But honestly, hardly any Christian uses these rules to decide what to do in real life. Instead, they usually follow the habits of their country, social group, or church. So, they have this set of moral rules they believe come from perfect wisdom, but they also have everyday habits and opinions that partly agree with these rules, partly don’t, and mostly mix the Christian ideas with what’s convenient or popular in the world.  

They respect the Christian rules on the surface, but in real life, they follow their daily habits and social pressures more.
