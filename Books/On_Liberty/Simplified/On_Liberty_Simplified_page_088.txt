One example is the sale of poisons, which brings up a new question: how far should the police or government go in controlling people’s freedom to stop crimes or accidents? It is clear that the government should try to stop crimes before they happen, not just catch and punish criminals afterwards.

But trying to prevent crimes can sometimes take away people’s freedom more easily than punishing crimes does. Almost anything a person does could be seen as helping some kind of wrongdoing. Still, if someone clearly looks like they are about to commit a crime, others don’t have to just watch—they can step in to stop it.

If poisons were only ever used for murder, banning them would make sense. But poisons can also be used for good and innocent reasons, so rules that stop poison sales can also cause problems for those good uses.

It is also right for the government to protect people from accidents. If someone was about to cross a broken bridge that could collapse, and there wasn’t time to warn them, someone could grab them and stop them without really taking away their freedom. After all, freedom means doing what you want, and no one wants to fall into a river.

However, if there is only a chance of danger, not a sure one, only the person involved can decide if the risk is worth it. So, unless the person is a child, very sick in the mind, or not thinking clearly, they should just be warned about the danger—not physically stopped.

Using these ideas for poison sales can help us decide which rules are fair and which are not. For example, putting a warning label on a poison is okay because the buyer should know if something is dangerous. But always needing a doctor’s note to buy poison would make it too hard or expensive to get it for okay reasons.
