The real problem with stopping someone from sharing their opinion is that it hurts everyone—people living now and those in the future. It’s especially bad for people who don’t agree with the opinion. If the opinion is true, they miss the chance to replace wrong ideas with the truth. If the opinion is wrong, they miss out on understanding the truth better because arguing with wrong ideas helps make the truth clearer.

We need to think about two separate ideas here, because each one has its own part in the argument. First, we can never be 100% sure that the opinion we want to silence is wrong. Even if we were sure, stopping it would still be bad.

First: the opinion someone tries to shut down might actually be true. People who want to stop it usually say it’s false, but they aren’t perfect and don’t have the right to decide for everyone else. Saying "we won’t listen because we’re sure it’s false" means acting like you know everything for sure. Stopping any discussion assumes you can’t be wrong. This is a strong reason to oppose silencing opinions, even if it’s a common one.

Sadly, even though people know they can be wrong, they don’t always act like it. Most people don’t think they need to be careful about their own mistakes or admit that an opinion they believe strongly could be wrong. Kings or powerful leaders often believe they are right about everything. People who are better off and sometimes have their opinions challenged only fully trust the ideas shared by the people around them or those they respect. The less someone trusts their own judgment, the more they blindly trust “the world” around them. For each person, “the world” means their group—like their friends, church, class, or social circle. Someone is pretty open-minded if “the world” means something as big as their whole country or time period.
