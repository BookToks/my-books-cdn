The truth is, when people stop talking about an opinion, they forget not only why they believed it but also what it really means.

The words used to explain it stop bringing ideas to mind, or only remind people of a small part of the original meaning.

Instead of having a strong and clear understanding, people only remember a few phrases by memory; sometimes, they keep just the outer parts of the idea, while the deeper meaning is lost. This is a big part of human history that deserves serious thought.

This happens with almost all moral beliefs and religions. They mean a lot and feel alive to the people who started them and their first followers. Their meaning stays strong and might even become clearer as they fight to become more popular than other beliefs. Eventually, the belief either wins and becomes widely accepted, or it stops spreading but still stays around.

When this happens, people stop arguing about it. The belief becomes one of the common views, and those who follow it usually inherited it rather than chose it. Changing from one belief to another becomes rare, so followers don’t think about it much. Instead of defending their belief or trying to convince others, they accept it quietly and avoid arguing against or for it. This is usually when the belief starts to lose its real power.

Teachers of all beliefs often say it’s hard to keep people truly understanding and feeling the truth they claim to believe, so it affects how they act. But when a belief is still fighting to survive, even the weaker supporters know exactly what they believe and why it’s different from others. At that time, many people fully understand the main ideas, think about them deeply, and feel the strong effect the belief should have on someone who really accepts it.
