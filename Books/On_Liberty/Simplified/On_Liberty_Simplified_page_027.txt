Marcus Aurelius was very smart and had a strong sense of right and wrong. He tried to live by Christian values in his moral writings but didn’t understand that Christianity could be good for the world. He knew society was in bad shape. But he thought it was held together by respect for the gods people already believed in. As a leader, he felt it was his job to keep society from falling apart. He didn’t see how new ideas, like Christianity, could help bring people together again.

Christianity wanted to break down those old ties. So, unless he had to accept Christianity himself, he felt he had to stop it. Since he didn’t believe Christian ideas were true, especially the story of Jesus dying on the cross, he couldn’t see how Christianity could fix society. Because of this, even though he was kind and fair, he allowed Christians to be punished.

To me, this is one of the saddest things in history. It’s hard to imagine how different Christianity might have been if Marcus Aurelius had supported it instead of Emperor Constantine. But it wouldn’t be fair to blame him or say he was wrong to punish Christians. Marcus Aurelius believed just as strongly as any Christian that his own beliefs were true and that Christianity was dangerous. He was probably the best person at the time to understand Christianity, but he didn’t accept it.

If anyone today thinks it’s okay to punish people for sharing their beliefs, they should remember that Marcus Aurelius thought the same thing—and he was a very wise and serious thinker. So, don’t assume you know better than he did, because his decision had very serious consequences.
