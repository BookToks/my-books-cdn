The next example is about people’s freedom being limited, which is still a risk today. Where Puritans were strong, like in New England and Great Britain during the Commonwealth, they tried hard to stop almost all fun activities. They banned music, dancing, public games, gatherings for fun, and theaters.

Even now, there are many people in this country who think these kinds of entertainment are wrong because of their religious and moral beliefs. Most of these people are middle-class, and since they have a lot of power in society and politics, it’s possible they could get a majority in Parliament someday. How would the rest of us feel if these strict religious groups decided what fun we could have? Most would probably want them to just mind their own business.

This is exactly what should be told to any government or group that tries to control what people enjoy because they think it’s bad. But if we accept their idea, then no one can complain if the majority forces everyone to follow their rules. People would have to live under a strict Christian system like the early New England settlers if those religious ideas ever became popular again, which can happen since old religions sometimes come back.

Now, let’s think about a different possibility, which might be more likely. Today, many societies are moving toward democracy, where people have more say in how things are run. In the United States, which is very democratic, most people don’t like seeing others live in a flashy or expensive way that they can’t match. This feeling acts like a rule about spending money, making it hard for rich people to spend a lot without others judging them.
