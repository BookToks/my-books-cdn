Many people won’t agree with the idea that some parts of a person’s life only affect themselves, while other parts affect others. They might ask, how can anything a person does not matter to the people around them? No one lives completely alone; if someone hurts themselves in a serious or lasting way, it usually causes problems for their family, friends, or even more people. 

If a person damages their belongings, it hurts those who depend on those things, and usually makes the community worse off. If they harm their body or mind, it not only makes their loved ones unhappy but also stops them from helping others. Sometimes, they might even become a burden on others' kindness. If many people acted like this, it would make the world a much worse place. Also, even if a person’s bad habits don’t directly hurt others, they can still be harmful by setting a bad example. So, people should control themselves to avoid leading others the wrong way.

Even if bad behavior only harmed the person doing it, should society just leave people who can’t take care of themselves alone? We protect kids because they can’t make good decisions, so shouldn’t we also help adults who clearly can’t manage themselves? Things like gambling, drinking too much, being lazy, or not staying clean can hurt happiness and stop people from getting better, just like many things the law already bans. So, why shouldn’t the law try to stop these things too, as much as it can without causing problems? Also, society should work together to discourage these bad habits and punish people who are known to do them.

This isn’t about stopping people from being themselves or trying new ways of living. It’s only about stopping things that have been proven wrong and harmful since forever, things that don’t actually help anyone be themselves or live better.
