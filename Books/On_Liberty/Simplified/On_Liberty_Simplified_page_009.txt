Like other kinds of unfair control, the power of the majority was first, and still is, mostly feared because of what the government does. But smart people realized that when society itself is the boss—when the group controls the individuals—it doesn’t just use government actions to control people.

Society can control people by its own rules. And if it makes wrong rules or gets involved in things it shouldn’t, it creates a kind of social control that’s even scarier than some political control. This is because it doesn’t usually use harsh punishments, but it affects many parts of life and controls people’s minds and feelings.

So, protecting people from unfair government power isn’t enough. We also need protection from the pressure of popular opinions and feelings. Society often forces its own ideas and ways of living on people who think differently. It stops people from being themselves unless they follow the group’s rules.

There is a limit to how much society’s opinions should interfere with a person’s freedom. Finding and keeping that limit is just as important as protecting people from unfair government control.

Even though most people agree with this idea, it’s still hard to figure out exactly where to draw the line between personal freedom and social control. Life depends on some rules that stop people from harming others. So, some rules must be made by law, and others by public opinion for things that laws can’t cover.

Deciding what these rules should be is one of the biggest questions in life. But except for some clear cases, very little progress has been made in solving it. Different times and places have made different decisions, and what seems right in one place surprises people in another.

Still, people in any time or place usually don’t see this as a problem. The rules they live by seem obvious and fair to them.
