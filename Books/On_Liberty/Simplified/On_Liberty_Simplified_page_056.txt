People agree that it’s good for people to think for themselves. Following traditions in a smart way, or sometimes choosing to do things differently on purpose, is better than just doing things blindly without thinking.

Most people agree that our thoughts should be our own. But they don’t always agree that our feelings and wants should be our own too. They often think having strong feelings is dangerous or a problem.

But feelings and wants are just as important as beliefs and rules in a complete person. Strong feelings only cause problems if they aren’t balanced. If some feelings get too strong while others stay weak, that’s when trouble happens. People don’t do bad things because they have strong feelings. It’s because their conscience—the part that tells them right from wrong—is weak. Strong feelings don’t go with a weak conscience naturally; it’s usually the opposite.

Having strong feelings just means a person has more energy and more of what makes us human. This energy can be used for good or bad, but it’s better to have energy than to be lazy and not care.

People who feel things deeply can also develop strong kindness and self-control. These strong feelings can help us love doing the right thing and control ourselves. Society depends on this to work well. It doesn’t help to reject people with strong feelings just because society doesn’t know how to handle them.

Someone whose feelings and wants are truly their own has what we call character. Someone who just copies others doesn’t have character, like a machine that just follows orders. If their feelings are strong and they can control them well, they have a strong, energetic character.

If you think people shouldn’t develop their own strong feelings and wants, you’re saying society doesn’t need strong people with character. But having lots of people with strong energy and character is actually a good thing.

In some early societies, people’s strong feelings were too powerful for the society to control or guide properly.
