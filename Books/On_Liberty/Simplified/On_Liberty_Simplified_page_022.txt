If someone’s judgment is really trustworthy, it’s because they have kept an open mind about their opinions and actions. They listen to all the criticism against them, learn from what’s true, and understand why the rest is wrong.

They believe the only way to really understand a subject is by hearing what everyone thinks about it, no matter their opinion or way of thinking. No wise person ever got smart without doing this, and human minds can’t get wise any other way. Regularly checking and improving their own opinions by comparing them with others’ doesn’t make them unsure; instead, it helps them trust their judgment more. They know all the obvious arguments against them and have faced those challenges, so they can be more confident than anyone who hasn’t done the same.

It’s fair to expect the public—made up of some smart and many not-so-smart people—to follow what the wisest people do before trusting their own opinions.

Even the strictest churches, like the Roman Catholic Church, allow a “devil’s advocate” to speak against someone before declaring them a saint. They make sure all criticisms are heard and considered first. If even Newton’s ideas weren’t allowed to be questioned, people wouldn’t trust them as much as they do now. The beliefs we trust most are only safe because we always invite others to try and prove them wrong. If no one succeeds, or no one tries, we still aren’t 100% sure, but we’ve done everything we can with the knowledge we have. By keeping an open challenge, we hope to find better truths when we’re ready, and for now, we can trust that we’ve reached the best understanding possible today.
