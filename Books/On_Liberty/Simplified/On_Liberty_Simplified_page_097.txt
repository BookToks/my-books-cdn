Everyone agrees that a father should take care of his child, but in this country, hardly anyone wants to force him to do it. Instead of making him work or sacrifice to get his child an education, it’s left up to him to accept it or not when it’s offered for free! People don’t realize that having a child without a good chance to provide not just food but also learning and training is a serious wrong against both the child and society. If a parent doesn’t do this, the government should step in and make sure it happens, and the parent should pay for it if possible.

If everyone agreed that education must be made compulsory, then there wouldn’t be so many arguments about what and how the government should teach. Right now, these fights waste time and energy that should be spent on actually teaching kids. If the government decided every child must get a good education, it might not even have to provide it all by itself.

The government could let parents choose where and how their kids learn and just help pay for school fees for poorer children or cover all the costs for kids whose parents can’t pay. People who don’t like state education usually don’t mind the government making sure kids get educated; they just don’t want the government to control what that education is. It’s important to have different kinds of education because everyone has their own character and opinions. A single state-run education makes everyone the same, which is bad. The state’s version usually reflects the ideas of whoever’s in power, whether that’s a king, priests, nobles, or the majority. If the state controls education too much, it can control minds and then bodies too.

If the state does run schools, it should only be one option among many, used as an example to encourage all schools to do a good job.
