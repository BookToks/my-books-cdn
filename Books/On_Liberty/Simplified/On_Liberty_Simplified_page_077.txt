Some people say we need to protect society from bad examples set by people who behave badly or only think about themselves. It’s true that bad examples can be harmful, especially when someone does wrong and doesn’t get punished. But here, we’re talking about behaviors that don’t hurt others but might hurt the person doing them. If people believe these behaviors are harmful to the person, then seeing these actions and their negative results might actually teach others a lesson instead of causing harm.

The strongest reason against the public interfering in personal choices is that when they do, they often get it wrong or interfere in the wrong way. When it comes to social rules or duties to others, the majority’s opinion is more likely to be right because they are judging how things affect themselves. But when the majority tries to control personal behavior that only affects the individual, their opinion is just as likely to be wrong as right. This is because public opinion usually means some people deciding what’s good or bad for others, often ignoring the feelings or convenience of the people being judged.

Many people take offense to behaviors they don’t like and feel personally hurt by them, even if those behaviors don’t harm anyone else. For example, a religious person might feel offended by others’ beliefs, just like others are offended by theirs. But there’s no real comparison between someone wanting to keep their own opinion and someone feeling upset just because of that opinion—just like there’s no comparison between a thief wanting to steal a purse and the owner wanting to keep it safe.
