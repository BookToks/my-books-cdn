All Christians believe that the poor and humble, and those treated badly by the world, are blessed. They believe it’s harder for a rich person to enter heaven than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. They think people shouldn’t judge others or swear, and that they should love their neighbors like themselves. If someone takes their cloak, they should give their coat too. They believe in not worrying about tomorrow, and if they want to be perfect, they should sell everything they have and give the money to the poor.  

They really do believe these things because they have always heard them praised, even if they never talk about them much. But in real life, they only follow these ideas as far as it’s normal to go. These beliefs are often used to argue with others or to explain good behavior. But if someone pointed out that living by these rules means doing lots of things they never even think about, most people would just ignore them or think that person is trying to be better than everyone else.  

For most believers, these ideas don’t deeply affect their minds or actions. They respect the words but don’t really feel them in a way that changes how they live. When it comes to acting, they look to others to tell them how far they should follow what Christ said.  

But things were very different for early Christians. If early Christians had acted the way most do now, Christianity would never have grown from a small group of hated Jewish people to the main religion of the Roman Empire. Back then, even their enemies noticed how much Christians loved each other—a thing hardly anyone says today. Early Christians really understood and felt their beliefs deeply.  

This is probably why Christianity doesn’t grow much anymore and is still mostly followed by Europeans and their descendants. Even the most serious religious people today usually focus more on the ideas of leaders like Calvin or Knox, who are more like themselves, than on the original teachings.
