As a person grows and becomes more unique, they become more valuable to themselves and can also be more helpful to others. Their life feels fuller, and when many people are full of life, the whole group becomes stronger. Some rules are needed to stop stronger people from hurting others, but these rules actually help everyone grow. When someone is stopped from doing things that hurt others, they don’t lose much because those things only help themselves at the cost of others. Also, following fair rules helps people develop kindness and care for others. But if people are stopped just because others don’t like what they do, without a good reason, it doesn’t help anyone grow. Instead, it just makes people less lively. To let everyone grow in their own way, people need to be allowed to live different kinds of lives. The more freedom people have to be themselves, the more interesting and important that time is remembered later.

Even harsh rulers don’t do as much harm if people can still be themselves. But anything that destroys individuality is a kind of harsh rule, no matter what it’s called or why it says it’s doing it.

Since individuality is the same as growing and becoming better, and only by being yourself can you become a better person, I could stop here. After all, what’s better than helping people become the best they can be? And what’s worse than stopping that? But some people still won’t be convinced. So, it’s important to show that these better people can help those who haven’t grown yet. Even people who don’t want freedom or wouldn’t use it can still benefit when others are free to grow and live their own lives.
