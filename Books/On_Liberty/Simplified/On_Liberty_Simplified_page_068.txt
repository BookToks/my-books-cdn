Today, people read the same books, listen to the same music, watch the same shows, visit the same places, and have similar hopes and fears. They also have the same rights and freedoms, and the same ways to stand up for them. Although there are still differences between people, they are much smaller than before. This process of becoming alike is still going on.

Political changes help this happen because they try to lift up those who are lower and bring down those who are higher. Education helps too, since it teaches everyone the same things and gives them access to common knowledge and ideas. Better communication connects people from faraway places and makes it easier to move around. More trade and factories spread wealth and open up opportunities for everyone, so wanting to get ahead isn’t just for a few people but for everyone.

Even more important than all these things is how public opinion—what most people think—has become very powerful in free countries. As social ranks that let some people ignore what most want disappear, politicians stop trying to go against what the public wants. There’s no real support left for people who don’t follow the crowd or have different opinions.

All these reasons make it really hard for people to be truly unique or different. It will only get harder unless smart people realize why being different is important. They need to understand that having differences is good, even if some differences seem bad. If we want to protect individuality, now is the time to do it, before everyone becomes the same. It’s easier to stand up against this when the process is just starting. The more people want everyone to be the same, the stronger that desire becomes.
