Should people be stopped from doing certain things, or not? For example, things like sleeping around or gambling have to be allowed. But what about being a pimp or running a gambling place? This is a tricky question because it’s right on the line between two different ideas, and it’s not clear which one fits best.

There are good reasons for both sides. One side says that just because someone does something as a job and makes money from it, that doesn’t make it bad if the action itself is okay. Either the action should be allowed or not allowed, but not both. Also, if the ideas we believe in are true, society shouldn’t decide that something is wrong if it only affects the person doing it. Society can try to convince people not to do it, but everyone should be free to try and persuade others either way.

On the other hand, some argue that even if the government can’t officially say something is bad just because it affects one person, it’s okay for them to try to stop people who push that behavior for their own gain. These people aren’t neutral—they want to make money or benefit themselves by encouraging others to do bad things. So, it’s fair for the government to block these influences. This way, people can make their own choices without being tricked or pushed by people who only want to profit. For example, even if laws against illegal gambling are unfair—since people should be free to gamble at home or with friends—public gambling places shouldn’t be allowed. True, these places will still exist and the police can’t fully stop them, but they can make sure these places are secret and only known to those who want to be there. And that’s all society should try to do.
