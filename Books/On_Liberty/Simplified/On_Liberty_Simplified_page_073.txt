Duties to ourselves are not something society makes us do, unless they also affect others. When we talk about duty to ourselves, it usually means taking care of ourselves or growing as a person. No one else can make us responsible for these things because it doesn’t help anyone else if they do.

There is a big difference between losing respect because we made bad choices or acted badly, and being punished because we hurt other people. It changes how we feel and act toward someone depending on whether they did something we can control or something we can’t. If someone bothers us by making bad choices, we might not like it and keep our distance, but we won’t try to make their life worse. We know they will face the consequences of their own mistakes. If they mess up their life, we don’t want to make it worse; instead, we try to help them fix their problems. We might feel sorry for them or not like them, but we won’t be angry or mad. We don’t treat them like enemies. At worst, we ignore them unless we want to help.

But it’s different if someone breaks rules that protect others. Then, the bad results affect other people, not just themselves. Society has to step in to punish them and make sure the punishment is strong enough.

In the first case, we judge the person but don’t have to punish them ourselves. In the second case, it’s our job to punish them to keep everyone safe.
