Sometimes, people can face really bad consequences from others because of mistakes or problems that only affect themselves. But these consequences happen naturally because of their actions, not because others want to punish them on purpose. For example, if someone is reckless, stubborn, or full of themselves; if they can’t live within their means or control harmful habits; or if they choose fun things that hurt their feelings or brain instead of more meaningful ones—they should expect others to think less of them and like them less. But they can’t really complain about this unless they have earned others’ respect by being good in social situations, which isn’t changed by their personal faults.

What I’m saying is that the only troubles a person should face for things that only affect themselves are the natural results of how others judge them. But if someone’s actions hurt other people, that’s a whole different issue. If they take away others’ rights, cause them harm without a good reason, lie or cheat, use unfair advantages, or selfishly refuse to help others when they can—they deserve to be judged badly and sometimes even punished. Not just their actions, but also the feelings behind them, like being cruel, mean, jealous, fake, angry without a good cause, wanting to control others, or always putting themselves first—these are serious moral wrongs.

These bad feelings and actions show a nasty character and are truly wrong. Unlike the personal faults I talked about earlier, which aren’t really evil no matter how bad they get, these are real moral mistakes. The earlier faults might just show someone is foolish or lacks self-respect, but they only become a moral problem if they hurt others, because everyone should take care of themselves for the sake of others too.
