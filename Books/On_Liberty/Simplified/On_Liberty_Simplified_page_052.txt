This is the true way people should behave during public discussions. Even though it’s often broken, I’m glad there are many people who mostly follow it, and even more who try really hard to.

Chapter 3.

Being yourself is an important part of feeling good and happy.

Since it’s so important for people to freely think and share their ideas without holding back, and because stopping this hurts both our minds and morals, we should also think about whether people should be free to live how they want based on their ideas.

Of course, this has limits. No one says actions should be as free as thoughts. In fact, even opinions can lose protection if saying them causes harm. For example, saying “corn sellers are starving the poor” or “private property is theft” is okay in a newspaper. But saying this to an angry crowd in front of a corn seller’s house or on signs might cause trouble and should be punished.

Actions that hurt others without a good reason must be controlled by people’s disapproval or even by stopping those actions. A person’s freedom should stop where they start bothering others. But if someone doesn’t bother others and just lives how they want, the same reasons that allow free opinions mean they should be free to live out their ideas, even if it’s risky for them.
