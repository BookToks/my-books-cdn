This situation makes some people happy because it keeps all popular ideas the same on the surface, without having to punish anyone by fining or putting them in jail. People who think differently are still allowed to use reason, even if they have the “problem” of thinking for themselves. This is a simple way to keep peace in the world of ideas and keep things mostly the same as they are now.

But the cost of this peace is that people lose their moral bravery. Many smart and curious people feel they have to keep their true beliefs to themselves. When they talk to others, they try to make their ideas fit with beliefs they no longer really believe. This stops us from having honest, brave thinkers who are clear and logical. Instead, we get people who just follow the crowd or say what they think others want to hear, not what they truly believe.

Some people avoid this problem by only thinking about small, safe topics that won’t challenge big ideas or principles. These small problems might solve themselves if people’s minds were stronger and more open. But real growth won’t happen until people start thinking freely and boldly about important issues, which right now is being given up.

People who don’t see this silence from free thinkers as a problem should remember that it means heretical ideas are never fully discussed. Some of these ideas might not survive a real debate, but they don’t just disappear. The biggest damage is to those who follow the usual ideas because they are scared of being different. Many smart people hold back from thinking boldly because they are afraid their ideas might be seen as wrong or bad.

No one can guess how much the world loses when many talented but shy thinkers are too scared to explore new and strong ideas.
