We are not talking about kids or young people who are still under the age that the law says makes someone an adult. Those who still need to be looked after by others must be protected from hurting themselves and from outside harm. For the same reason, we can ignore societies that are very backward, where the whole group is still like children. In those early stages, it’s really hard to improve on their own, so there usually aren’t many choices for how to make progress. A leader who wants to help can use any methods needed to reach a goal that might not be possible otherwise. Having a strict ruler is okay when dealing with people who are not yet ready to govern themselves, as long as the goal is to help them improve and the methods actually work.

Freedom, as an idea, doesn’t make sense before people are ready to improve themselves by talking and sharing ideas equally. Until then, they must follow the orders of a strong leader, if they are lucky enough to have one. But once people are able to learn and improve by understanding and agreeing with ideas (which has happened long ago in all the countries we care about), forcing them to do things or punishing them for not doing things for their own good is no longer acceptable. Force is only okay to keep others safe.

I want to say that I don’t use the idea of “rights” by itself to support my argument. I believe that usefulness, or what helps people in the long run, is the most important thing when deciding what is right or wrong. This usefulness should be based on what helps a person grow and improve over time. Because of this, controlling what people do is okay only when their actions affect other people’s interests. If someone does something that harms others, there is a good reason to punish them by law or, if that’s not possible, by letting others disapprove of their actions. There are also many good things that people should be forced to do for others, like giving evidence in court, helping defend the community, or doing things that benefit society. This includes acts like saving someone’s life or protecting someone who can’t defend themselves—if it’s clearly a person’s duty to do these things, society can hold them responsible if they don’t.
