We shouldn’t forget that if all the smartest people in a country are stuck working only in the government, it will eventually harm the government’s ability to think and improve. Since they work together following set rules, government officials might get lazy and just do the same things over and over. Or sometimes, they might try new ideas without fully thinking them through, just because someone in charge likes them. The only thing that stops these problems is having smart people outside the government watching and giving feedback. 

So, it’s really important to have ways outside the government to develop smart people and give them chances to learn and understand big issues. If we want a skilled and effective government team that can come up with new ideas and accept changes, the government can’t take over every job that helps people grow the skills needed to run things well.

Figuring out when the problems caused by too much government control start to outweigh the good things it can do is one of the hardest parts of running a country. It’s a tricky issue that depends on many small details, so there’s no one rule that works for everything. But the main idea to keep in mind is this: power should be shared as much as possible while still getting things done well. At the same time, information should be gathered and shared from a central place.

For example, in local government, like in the New England States, lots of small jobs are handled by people chosen by local communities. But at the same time, there’s a central office in each area that helps supervise these local jobs and connects them to the larger government.
