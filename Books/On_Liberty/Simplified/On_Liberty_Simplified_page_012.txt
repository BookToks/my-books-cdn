This is mostly where people have fought for their individual rights against society’s control, especially about big ideas and beliefs. Many important writers who helped create religious freedom said that believing what you want is a basic right, and no one should be forced to answer to others about their religion. But people are naturally not very tolerant when it comes to things they care about, so real religious freedom is rare. It usually only happens where most people don’t really care much about religion and don’t want to get involved in religious arguments.

Almost everyone who is religious agrees that people should tolerate others, but usually with some limits. One person might accept different church rules but not different beliefs. Another might accept everyone except certain religions. Some are okay with anyone who believes in God and life after death. Where most people still strongly believe in their religion, they usually want others to follow their rules too.

In England, because of its unique political history, the law doesn’t control people’s private actions as much as in other European countries, but public opinion can be stronger. People often dislike the government interfering in their personal lives, not because they care about individual freedom, but because they see the government as opposing the public’s interests. Most people don’t feel like the government represents them or their views yet. When they start feeling that way, the government might control individual freedoms as much as public opinion does now.

Right now, many people feel strongly against the law trying to control things they’re not used to it controlling. This feeling is usually good but sometimes it’s applied in the wrong situations. There isn’t really a clear rule to decide when the government should or shouldn’t interfere with people’s lives.
