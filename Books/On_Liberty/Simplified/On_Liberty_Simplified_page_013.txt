People make choices based on what they like.

Some people want the government to step in whenever there’s a problem or something good to do. Others would rather deal with problems themselves than have the government get involved. People usually decide which side to take based on how they feel about the issue, how much it matters to them, or whether they think the government would handle it the way they want. Rarely do they decide based on a clear rule about what the government should or shouldn’t do. Because of this, both sides are often wrong. Sometimes people want the government to help when it shouldn’t, and sometimes they don’t want the government to help when it should.

This essay wants to explain a simple idea that should guide how society controls individuals, whether by laws or by social pressure. The idea is that the only reason anyone should interfere with someone else’s freedom is to protect others from harm. Power can only be used against someone’s will to stop them from hurting other people. It can’t be used just because it might be better for them, make them happier, or because others think it’s the right or smart thing to do. Those are good reasons to talk to someone or try to convince them, but not good reasons to force them or punish them if they don’t listen. To justify forcing someone, their actions must harm someone else.

The only part of a person’s actions that society can control is the part that affects other people. When it comes to things that only affect themselves, a person has complete freedom. Each person is the boss of their own body and mind.

This idea is meant to apply only to adults who are capable of making their own decisions.
