The man who left a strong memory in the minds of those who saw his life and heard his words was so respected for his goodness that people have honored him as God for eighteen hundred years. But he was cruelly killed, accused of what? Blasphemy. People didn’t just misunderstand their helper; they thought he was the complete opposite of who he really was and treated him as if he were a terrible sinner. Now, looking back, we feel sorry about these events, especially the later one, and realize that the people involved were judged unfairly. They didn’t seem like bad people—not worse than usual—but actually had strong religious, moral, and patriotic feelings like most people of their time. These kinds of people often live their lives without blame and with respect. The high priest who tore his clothes when he heard the words he thought were the worst crime was probably just as sincere in his shock and anger as many good people today are about their beliefs. Most who are shocked by his actions would likely have done the same if they lived back then and were born in his culture. Christians who think the people who killed the first martyrs were worse than themselves should remember that one of those killers was Saint Paul.

Here’s one more example, the most important one if we judge a mistake by how wise and good the person making it was. If anyone had a reason to think he was the best and smartest of his time, it was Emperor Marcus Aurelius. He ruled the whole known world and was not only fair all his life but also had a kind heart, which was unusual for someone taught by Stoic philosophy. The few faults he had were mostly about being too lenient. His writings, which are some of the best ancient thoughts on ethics, are almost the same as the main teachings of Christ. This man, who was better at living Christian values than many rulers who later claimed to be Christians, still persecuted Christianity.
