The group, called the “Alliance,” was made for a specific reason. It became well-known because its secretary wrote letters to one of the few English politicians who believes that politicians should base their opinions on strong principles. Lord Stanley’s part in these letters gives hope to people who think he has rare and good qualities that are hard to find in politics today.

The Alliance’s leader says they are against using any principles to support unfairness or hatred. He explains that there is a clear line between their beliefs and others. He thinks that things like thoughts, opinions, and conscience should not be controlled by laws. But actions that affect society, like habits or relationships, can be controlled by the government, not by individuals. He doesn’t talk about a third group, which is actions and habits that are personal and don’t affect society, like drinking alcohol.

Selling alcohol is a business, and business is a social activity. But the problem isn’t about the seller’s freedom; it’s about the buyer’s and drinker’s freedom. The government could stop people from drinking wine just as easily as making it hard to buy. The secretary says, “I have the right to make laws when my social rights are hurt by someone else’s actions.”

He explains these “social rights”: if something harms my social rights, like the alcohol trade, it’s wrong. It harms my safety by causing social problems. It’s unfair because it makes money from problems that the public has to pay for. It also stops me from growing morally and mentally by making life harder and weakening society, which I depend on for support. This idea of “social rights” means everyone has the right to expect others to act perfectly, and if someone doesn’t, I can ask the government to fix it.
