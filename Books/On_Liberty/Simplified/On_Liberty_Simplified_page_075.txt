There has to be some time and experience before a moral or practical truth can be accepted as true. The goal is to stop generation after generation from making the same mistakes that hurt those before them.

I agree that when someone harms themselves, it can also affect the people close to them and, to a smaller extent, society. But if someone’s actions break a clear responsibility they have to others, it’s not just about themselves anymore. Then, it becomes something that people can judge as right or wrong.

For example, if a man drinks too much or spends too much money and can’t pay his debts, or if he can’t take care of his family because of it, people have a right to blame him and he might even be punished. But it’s not because he drank or spent money—it’s because he didn’t do his duty to his family or creditors. Even if he used the money for something smart instead of wasting it, he would still be at fault. George Barnwell killed his uncle to get money for his girlfriend, but if he had done it to start a business, he still would have been punished. 

Also, if a man’s bad habits cause his family pain, he deserves blame for being unkind or ungrateful. But he can also be blamed if he has habits that aren’t bad by themselves but still hurt the people who depend on him. Anyone who doesn’t think about other people’s feelings and needs—unless they have a very good reason—is rightly criticized for that, but not for the reasons that caused it or for personal mistakes that led to it.

Similarly, if someone harms themselves in a way that stops them from doing a clear duty to the public, that’s a social problem. No one should be punished just for being drunk, but a soldier or policeman should be punished if they are drunk while on duty. In short, whenever someone causes clear harm or risk of harm to another person or to the public, it’s not just about freedom anymore—it becomes a matter of right and wrong or the law.
