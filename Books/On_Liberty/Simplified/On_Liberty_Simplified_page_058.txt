You have no choice; so you must do what’s right, and nothing else: “if it’s not your duty, it’s wrong.” Human nature is deeply flawed, and no one can be truly saved until their old selfish nature is gone. People who believe this think it’s not bad to destroy any human abilities or feelings. They say people only need to give up control and follow God’s will. If someone uses their abilities for anything else, it’s better if they didn’t have those abilities at all. This idea comes from Calvinism, but many people who don’t call themselves Calvinists still believe a softer version of it. They think God wants people to enjoy some things, but only in the way that authority says is okay, not how they want.

Right now, this strict way of thinking is becoming more popular, pushing people to live very limited and controlled lives. Some honestly believe that people made to be this way are just as God intended, like how some think trees look better when trimmed into shapes rather than growing naturally. But if religion says God is good, it makes more sense to believe God gave us all our abilities to grow and use, not to destroy them. God would be happy when we get better at understanding, acting, or enjoying life.

There’s a different idea of what makes a good person than the Calvinist view. Humanity isn’t just about giving up yourself. Standing up for yourself, like in “pagan self-assertion,” is also important, just like “Christian self-denial.” The Greek idea of growing and improving yourself mixes with Christian ideas of controlling yourself, but doesn’t replace them. It might be better to be like John Knox, a strict religious leader, than Alcibiades, a wild person. But it’s best to be like Pericles, a great leader who had qualities of both.

People don’t become great by making everyone the same and losing their uniqueness. Instead, they become great by developing their own talents and personalities, as long as they respect others’ rights. This makes people interesting and beautiful to watch. Since the things people create reflect who they are, this way of living also makes life richer, more varied, and inspiring. It helps people think deeply, feel strongly, and feel connected to all humanity, making the whole human race better and more worthwhile.
