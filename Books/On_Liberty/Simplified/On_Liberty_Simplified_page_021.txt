Should we then never have taxes or go to war, no matter what happens? People and governments have to do their best. Nothing is 100% certain, but we can be sure enough to live our lives. We have to believe our own opinions are true to guide what we do. It’s not wrong to stop bad people from spreading ideas we think are false and harmful.

But I say that’s asking too much. There’s a big difference between thinking an opinion is true because no one has proven it wrong, and stopping anyone from proving it wrong. Being free to argue against and disprove opinions is what lets us trust them enough to act on them. Without this freedom, no one can reasonably be sure they are right.

When we look at history and everyday life, why aren’t things worse than they are? It’s not because people are super smart. For every person who can really judge something well, there are many who can’t. Even the smartest people in the past believed things we now know are wrong and did things we don’t approve of. So why do most people’s opinions and actions make sense overall? It’s because humans can fix their mistakes. We learn from talking things over and from experience.

Experience alone isn’t enough. We need discussion to understand what experience means. Wrong ideas slowly change when facts and arguments are shared. But facts don’t explain themselves; they need people to explain their meaning. Human judgment is valuable because we can correct it when it’s wrong, but only if we always have a way to fix it.
