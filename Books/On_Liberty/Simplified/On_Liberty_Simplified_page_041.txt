The sayings of Christ just sit quietly in people’s minds, not really changing much except from hearing nice and gentle words.

There are many reasons why beliefs that belong to a specific group seem stronger than those shared by all groups, and why teachers work harder to keep their special meanings alive. One big reason is that these special beliefs get questioned more and have to be defended more often against people who disagree.

Both teachers and students stop paying attention as soon as there are no opponents challenging them.

This is true for all old beliefs about life, whether about being wise, moral, or religious. All languages and stories are full of common ideas about life and how to live it. Everyone knows these ideas, repeats them, or agrees with them, but most people only really understand them after going through hard experiences.

Many times, when someone is hurt by something unexpected, they remember a saying they have known forever. If they had truly understood it before, it might have helped them avoid the problem. There are reasons for this besides not talking about it enough; some truths only make sense after personal experience. But people would understand more and remember better if they heard these ideas debated by people who truly get them.

People often stop thinking about something once they believe it for sure, and this causes many mistakes. A writer once called this “the deep sleep of a decided opinion.” But you might ask, is disagreement necessary for real knowledge? Do some people have to be wrong for others to understand the truth? Does a belief stop being real and alive when everyone agrees on it? When all people accept a truth, does it disappear? The main goal of smarter thinking has always been to bring people together in agreement on important truths. Does intelligence only exist when it hasn’t reached that goal yet?
