Not many people today are brave enough to be different, and that’s a big problem.

I’ve said it’s important to allow unusual ideas and ways of living because, over time, we might find some that are better and should become common. But being independent and ignoring what’s usual isn’t just good because it helps find better ways. It’s also because everyone deserves to live their life their own way, not just the smartest people. There’s no reason everyone should live the same way or follow just a few patterns.

If someone has some common sense and experience, the way they choose to live is the best for them—not because it’s the best overall, but because it’s their own way. People aren’t like sheep, and even sheep aren’t all exactly the same. You can’t get clothes that fit unless they’re made just for you or you have many choices. It’s even harder to fit a life to a person than clothes, since people are very different inside and out. Just having different tastes is enough reason to not force everyone to live the same way.

Also, different people need different things to grow and be happy. They can’t all live healthily in the same kind of moral or emotional environment any more than different plants can grow in the same climate. What helps one person become better might hold another back. A way of living that excites and motivates one person might feel like a heavy burden to someone else, stopping them from enjoying life or growing inside.

People differ a lot in what they enjoy, what hurts them, and how outside things affect them. So, if everyone lived the same way, many wouldn’t be as happy or reach their full potential mentally, morally, or artistically. So why should society only accept ways of life that lots of people like? Everywhere except some strict religious places, people accept that tastes are different. For example, no one blames you for liking or disliking rowing, smoking, music, sports, chess, cards, or studying, because there are plenty of people on both sides.
