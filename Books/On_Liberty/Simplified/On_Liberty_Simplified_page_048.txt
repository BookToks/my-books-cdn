I’m not saying that all the problems with Christian ethics are always part of it, or that the things missing from it can’t be combined with it. I definitely don’t mean this about the teachings of Christ himself. I believe Christ’s words are exactly what they were meant to be. They don’t go against any good moral ideas, and everything good in ethics can fit with them without twisting their meaning more than others have done when trying to make a clear set of rules from them.

But I also think that Christ’s teachings were meant to show only part of the truth. Many important parts of the best morals aren’t included or meant to be included in what Christ said, and the Christian Church has left these out in the moral system it created based on His teachings. Because of this, I think it’s a big mistake to keep trying to find a complete guide for how to live just from Christian teachings, since they were only meant to give part of that guidance.

I also believe this limited view is causing real problems. It’s hurting the moral education that many people are trying hard to improve. I worry that focusing only on religious ideas and ignoring other moral ideas that used to go along with and support Christian ethics is creating a weak, low-minded way of thinking. Even if people accept what they see as God’s will, they can’t reach or understand the idea of the highest goodness.

I think other moral ideas besides those from only Christian sources need to exist alongside Christian ethics to truly improve humanity’s morals. The Christian system, like any other, needs different opinions because the human mind isn’t perfect.

Stopping ignoring the moral truths outside of Christianity doesn’t mean we have to ignore the truths inside it.
