That’s not the right way to really understand arguments or connect them with your own thoughts. You need to hear these arguments from people who truly believe in them, who defend them seriously and do their best to explain them. You have to know the arguments in their strongest and most convincing form. You also need to understand the biggest problems the true view faces and how it deals with them. Otherwise, you’ll never fully grasp the part of the truth that solves those problems.

Most educated people—99 out of 100—even those who argue well for their opinions, are like this. Their conclusion might be right, but it might also be wrong because they’ve never really put themselves in the shoes of people who think differently. They don’t know what those people might say. Because of this, they don’t truly understand the ideas they support. They miss the parts that explain and defend the rest, the reasons that show how two conflicting facts can fit together, or why one strong reason should be chosen over another. The part of the truth that finally tips the balance and decides what a fully informed person thinks is unknown to them. Only those who fairly and carefully consider both sides, trying to see the strongest reasons for each, really know this. This kind of thinking is so important for understanding moral and human issues that if there aren’t real opponents to important ideas, you have to imagine them and come up with the best possible arguments against your own view.

To weaken these points, someone against free discussion might say that most people don’t need to know all the arguments for or against their beliefs, especially those made by philosophers or religious thinkers. They might say it’s not necessary for regular people to spot every mistake or trick in an opponent’s argument. It’s enough if there is always someone who can answer those arguments, so nothing wrong or misleading is left unchallenged. Simple people, once they’ve learned the basic reasons for the truths they believe, can trust experts for the rest. Knowing that they don’t have the skill or knowledge to solve every problem, they can feel confident that all the difficult questions have been or can be answered by those trained to do so.
