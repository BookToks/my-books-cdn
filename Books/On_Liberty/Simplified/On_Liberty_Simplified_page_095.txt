Baron Wilhelm von Humboldt, in a great essay I already mentioned, believes that promises involving personal relationships or services shouldn’t be legally binding for too long. He thinks that marriage, which only works if both people feel the same way, should end whenever either person wants it to.

This topic is really important and complicated, so I’ll only talk about it briefly to explain. If Baron Humboldt had more space, he would probably agree that the issue is more complex than he says.

When someone makes a promise or acts in a way that makes another person trust them to keep doing something, they have new moral duties to that person. These duties might sometimes be ignored, but not easily.

Also, if the relationship affects other people—like in marriage, where kids might be involved—both people have responsibilities to those others. How they handle these responsibilities depends a lot on whether the relationship continues or ends.

This doesn’t mean people should stay in a contract if it makes them unhappy, but these responsibilities are important. Even if, like Von Humboldt says, these responsibilities shouldn’t affect the legal right to end the relationship, they still matter a lot morally.

Before deciding to end something that affects others, a person has to think about all these things. If they don’t care about others’ interests, they are morally wrong.
