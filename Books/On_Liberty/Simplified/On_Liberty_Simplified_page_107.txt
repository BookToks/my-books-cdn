I believe that encouraging someone to do something wrong can be punished, but only if they actually do something after that, and there’s a clear link between the encouragement and the action. Even then, it’s not a foreign government, but the very government being attacked, that has the right to punish those attacks in order to defend itself.

Thomas Pooley was tried at Bodmin Assizes on July 31, 1857. A few months later, in December, he was given a free pardon by the Crown.

George Jacob Holyoake was involved on August 17, 1857, and Edward Truelove in July 1857.

Baron de Gleichen appeared at Marlborough Street Police Court on August 4, 1857.

We can learn a lot from how angry and unfair people became during the Sepoy rebellion. Sometimes, crazy or dishonest preachers might say things that don’t matter much. But the leaders of the Evangelical group said that no schools paid for by public money should teach anything unless it includes the Bible. They also said only real or fake Christians should get public jobs. 

An important government official said in a speech on November 12, 1857, that allowing the faith of hundreds of millions of British subjects to exist had slowed down British power and stopped Christianity from growing. He said that “toleration” means freedom for Christians who believe in the same basic Christian ideas. He believed that anyone who doesn’t believe Jesus is divine should not be tolerated.

I want to point out that this man, who held a high government position during a liberal government, thought that people who don’t believe in Christ’s divinity should not be tolerated.
