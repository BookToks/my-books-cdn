A second way, which came later, was setting up rules called constitutional checks. These rules made sure that important decisions by the government needed the agreement of the people or a group representing them.

In most European countries, the rulers had to follow the first kind of limits to some extent. But they didn’t always have to follow the second kind. People who loved freedom worked hard to get these checks in place or make them stronger. For a long time, people were okay with being ruled by a master, as long as they had some protection from unfair treatment.

But then, as time went on, people stopped thinking it was natural for rulers to be completely separate from them and have their own interests. They thought it was better if government leaders were like their servants or representatives, who could be fired whenever the people wanted.

Slowly, wanting leaders who were chosen and could be removed by the people became the main goal for those who wanted more freedom. This idea became more important than just limiting rulers’ power. Some people even started to think that focusing too much on limiting power wasn’t the best way, because that only worked when rulers had different interests from the people.

What people really wanted now was for rulers to be just like the people, sharing the same goals and wishes. The nation didn’t need to protect itself from its own choices.

There was no worry that the nation would be unfair to itself. If rulers were responsible to the people and could be quickly removed by them, the people could trust them with power and tell them exactly how to use it.

The rulers’ power was really just the people’s power, gathered together and made easier to use. This way of thinking was common among European liberals of the last generation, especially in mainland Europe.
