These are not really questions about freedom, but about how people grow and develop. This topic is better saved for another time, when we talk about national education. Education helps citizens learn to think beyond just themselves and their families. It teaches them to understand shared interests and work together on common problems. It helps people act with public goals in mind, so they feel connected to others instead of isolated.

Without these habits and skills, a free government can't work or last. We see this happen in countries where freedom doesn’t have a strong base in local self-rule. Local governments handling local matters, and groups working together to run big businesses, are better for encouraging individuality and different ways of doing things. Governments usually do things in the same way everywhere. But with individuals and voluntary groups, there are lots of different experiments and experiences. The government’s job should be to collect and share these experiences so everyone can learn from each other, instead of only allowing its own way.

The third and strongest reason to limit government interference is that giving it more power is dangerous. Every new job the government takes on spreads its influence more widely. This makes the most active and ambitious people depend on the government or the party trying to control it. If things like roads, railways, banks, insurance, big companies, universities, and charities were all run by the government; and if local councils and boards became part of the central government; and if all employees were hired and paid by the government and depended on it for promotions, then no amount of free press or elected officials would make the country truly free.
