The reasons I’m going to explain apply to more than just one part of this topic, and thinking carefully about this will help understand the rest better. If you already know what I’m going to say, I hope you’ll forgive me for adding one more discussion on something that’s been talked about for hundreds of years.

Chapter 2.

About Freedom of Thinking and Talking.

Hopefully, we don’t need to defend the “freedom of the press” anymore, since everyone now agrees it helps stop bad or unfair governments. No one should argue that a government, or any group not connected to the people, should decide what opinions people can have or which ideas they’re allowed to hear. Other writers have already made this point very clear, so I won’t spend much time on it here.

Even though English laws about the press are still strict like they were hundreds of years ago, it’s rare that these laws are used against political talks, except during scary times when leaders panic and act wrongly. Usually, in countries with fair governments, it’s not expected that the government will try to stop people from sharing their opinions, unless it’s following what the majority of people want.

Let’s imagine the government always agrees with the people and only acts when it thinks it’s what most want. But I say the people don’t have the right to force others to agree with them, either by themselves or through the government. That power is wrong. The best government has no more right to do it than the worst one. It’s just as harmful, or even more harmful, when done with the support of most people than when done against them.

If everyone in the world but one person believes something, they have no right to silence that one person. And that one person wouldn’t be right to silence everyone else if they had the power. If an opinion only mattered to the person who has it, and stopping them from having it was just a personal hurt, it would matter if only a few or many people were hurt.
