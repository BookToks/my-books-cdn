They have done something amazing that English helpers have been trying hard to do—making people all the same, all thinking and acting by the same rules. This is the result. Today's public opinion, even though it isn’t organized, is like the Chinese education and political systems, which are organized. If people don’t fight to be different, Europe, even with its proud history and Christianity, will end up like China.

What has kept Europe from this? What made European countries get better instead of staying the same? It’s not because they are better, but because they are very different from each other. People, groups, and countries have been very different. They have tried many different ways, each leading to something good. Even though they didn’t like each other’s ways and wanted everyone to follow their own, they usually didn’t stop each other forever. Over time, they accepted the good things from others. Europe’s progress and growth come from these many different ways. But now, this is happening less. Europe is starting to make people more alike, like China. M. de Tocqueville said that French people today are more similar than those a generation ago. The same is true for English people, even more so.

Wilhelm von Humboldt said two things are needed for people to be different: freedom and different life situations. In this country, the second one is shrinking every day. The lives of different classes and people are becoming more similar. Before, different ranks, neighborhoods, jobs, and trades lived in very different worlds, but now, they are mostly living in the same world.
