No matter what people believe, when it really matters to believe the right thing, they should be able to defend their ideas against common arguments. But someone might say, “Let them learn the reasons for their opinions. Just because they never hear arguments against their beliefs doesn’t mean they only repeat what they’re told.”

People who study geometry don’t just memorize theorems; they understand the proofs too. It wouldn’t make sense to say they don’t know why the theorems are true just because no one ever tries to prove them wrong. That’s true for math because there’s no real argument against it. Math has only one side, and no one can really argue against its truths.

But for other subjects where people can disagree, the truth depends on weighing two sides with different reasons. Even in science, there are often different explanations for the same facts. For example, some used to think the Earth was the center of the universe instead of the sun. Or people believed in phlogiston instead of oxygen. You have to explain why those ideas are wrong to understand why the correct idea makes sense.

When it comes to more complicated things like morals, religion, politics, social life, and daily matters, most arguments try to show why the other side is wrong. One of the greatest speakers in history said he always studied his opponent’s ideas as hard as his own. What Cicero did to win arguments should be copied by anyone who wants to find the truth. If you only know your own side, you don’t really know much. Your reasons might be good, and no one may have disproved them, but if you can’t argue against the other side, or don’t even know their reasons, you have no real reason to believe your opinion more.

The smart choice would be to wait before deciding. If you don’t, you might just follow authority or pick the side you like best, like most people do. Also, it’s not enough to hear the other side’s arguments only from your own teachers, even if they try to explain and reject them.
