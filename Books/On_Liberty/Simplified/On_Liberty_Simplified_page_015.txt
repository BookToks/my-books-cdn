A person can hurt others not just by what they do, but also by what they don’t do. In both cases, they are responsible for the harm caused. It’s easier to say someone is responsible for doing something wrong than for not stopping something wrong. But there are many clear and serious cases where people should be held responsible for not preventing harm. When it comes to how people affect others, they should be accountable to those affected, and if needed, to society as a whole. Sometimes, there are good reasons not to make someone responsible. This might be because they will probably do better if left alone, or because trying to control them would cause bigger problems. When these reasons apply, the person’s own conscience should guide them to protect others, especially when no one else can.

There is a part of life where society only has a small or no real interest. This includes everything a person does that only affects themselves, or affects others only if those others agree freely and understand what’s happening. When I say “only themselves,” I mean directly at first, because what affects one person can sometimes affect others too. This area is where people should have freedom. It includes freedom of thought and belief, feeling, and opinion about anything—whether it’s about science, morals, religion, or anything else. Speaking or sharing opinions might seem different because it affects other people, but it’s almost as important as thinking freely and is connected to the same reasons. So, it’s basically part of the same freedom.
