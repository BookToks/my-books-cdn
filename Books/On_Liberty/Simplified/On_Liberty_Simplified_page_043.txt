A person who learns only from teachers or books, even if they avoid just memorizing without understanding, doesn’t have to listen to both sides of an argument. Because of this, it’s rare, even among smart people, to really know both sides of a story. The weakest part of what people say to defend their opinions is usually what they say to answer those who disagree.

Right now, it’s common to look down on negative logic—this means pointing out mistakes or problems without giving new answers. While just criticizing without offering solutions isn’t great in the end, this kind of criticism is very important for gaining real knowledge or strong beliefs. Until people learn how to do this kind of thinking again, there won’t be many great thinkers, and most people won’t be very sharp except in math and science. In most subjects, no one truly “knows” something unless they’ve gone through the mental process of arguing with someone who disagrees. So when this kind of thinking is hard to create but important, it’s crazy to ignore it when it naturally happens! If there are people who challenge popular ideas, or who would if they could, we should thank them, listen carefully, and be happy someone is doing the hard work of questioning for us. Otherwise, we would have to do it ourselves to make sure our beliefs are strong and alive.

There is another main reason why having different opinions is good, and this will stay true until people become much smarter, which seems very far away right now. So far, we’ve thought about only two options: either the common opinion is wrong and another opinion is right, or the common opinion is right and arguing with the opposite wrong opinion helps us understand and feel sure about the truth. But there is a more usual case than either of these: when both ideas share some truth, and the unpopular opinion is needed to complete the truth that the popular idea only shows part of.
