It’s wrong for the government to try to make people believe a certain way about things that are still debated. But it’s okay for the government to check if someone knows enough about a topic to have an opinion that matters. For example, a philosophy student would do better if they could pass tests on thinkers like Locke or Kant, or even if they didn’t study either. It’s also fair to test an atheist on the reasons for Christianity, as long as they don’t have to say they believe it. But these tests for advanced knowledge should always be optional.

It would be too risky to let the government stop someone from working in a job, even teaching, just because they don’t have certain qualifications. I agree with Wilhelm von Humboldt that anyone who wants to take a test should get a certificate if they pass. But these certificates shouldn’t give them special advantages over others, except that people might respect their skills more.

Not just in education, but also when it comes to parents’ responsibilities, some wrong ideas about freedom stop people from seeing what parents must do. Having a child is one of the biggest responsibilities in life. Bringing a life into the world that could be a curse or a blessing is serious. If a child won’t have a fair chance at a good life, it’s wrong to have that child. In places where there are already too many people, having lots of kids can make it harder for workers to earn a living. Laws in some countries don’t allow people to marry unless they can prove they can support a family. These laws don’t take away freedom unfairly. Instead, they stop harmful actions that hurt others. Even if these laws aren’t always the best choice everywhere, they are not wrong for limiting freedom when it’s to prevent harm.
