Instead of having strong energy guided by clear thinking, and powerful feelings controlled by a responsible will, the result is weak feelings and weak energy. This means people can follow rules on the outside without really having strong willpower or clear reasoning. People with big energy and strong character are becoming rare and just follow traditions. Now, in this country, the only real way to use energy is through business. The energy used in business is still pretty big. After work, the little energy left goes into hobbies. These hobbies might be helpful or good for others, but they are usually small and focused on just one thing.

England’s greatness now comes from working together as a group. As individuals, we seem small and only look capable of great things because we team up. Moral and religious helpers are happy with this. But it was different kinds of people who made England great in the past, and different kinds will be needed to stop its decline.

The strict control of tradition is everywhere a big problem for progress. It fights against the desire to reach for something better than what is usual. This desire is called, depending on the situation, the spirit of liberty, or the spirit of progress or improvement.

Wanting improvement is not always the same as wanting freedom because sometimes people try to force improvements on others who don’t want them. And sometimes, people who want freedom will work with those who don’t want change. But the only real and lasting source of improvement is freedom, because it allows many independent places of improvement through many individuals. The idea of progress, whether it is about loving freedom or loving improvement, fights against the rule of tradition. This fight between tradition and change is the main story of human history.

Most of the world doesn’t really have history because tradition controls everything. This is true in the entire East. There, tradition is the final answer in all things. Justice and fairness mean following tradition. No one, except cruel rulers drunk on power, thinks about fighting tradition. And we see what this causes. These nations must have once been original and creative. They didn’t start out full of people with knowledge and many skills. They made all that for themselves and were once the greatest and most powerful nations. What are they now? They are followers or dependents of tribes whose ancestors lived in forests when these nations had huge palaces and beautiful temples. Back then, tradition shared power with freedom and progress.
