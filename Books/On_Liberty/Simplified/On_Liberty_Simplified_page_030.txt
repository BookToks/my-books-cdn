This refusal to help happened because of a law that says no one can give evidence in court unless they believe in a god (any god is okay) and in life after death. This rule basically says that people who don’t believe these things are outlaws and can’t get protection from the courts. They could be robbed or hurt without consequences if only they or people like them are around. Also, anyone else could be robbed or hurt without punishment if the only proof depends on the unbeliever’s testimony.

The idea behind this is that a person who doesn’t believe in life after death can’t be trusted to tell the truth. But this shows a big misunderstanding of history because many unbelievers have been honest and honorable people. Also, a lot of well-respected people who are known for their good qualities and achievements don’t believe in God, at least their close friends know that.

This rule is also self-defeating. It assumes atheists must lie, so it accepts the testimony of atheists who are willing to lie but rejects those who are honest about their beliefs and refuse to lie. A rule like this can only exist as a way to show hatred and as a leftover from times when people were persecuted for their beliefs. The strange thing is that this persecution happens to people who are proven not to deserve it.

This rule and the idea behind it insult both believers and unbelievers. If someone who doesn’t believe in life after death always lies, then those who do believe only tell the truth because they are afraid of hell. We won’t assume that the people who made this rule think that way based on their own sense of Christian goodness.

These are just small leftovers of old persecution. They might not show a real desire to punish people, but instead show a strange habit among English people of enjoying saying something bad even when they don’t really want to put it into action.
