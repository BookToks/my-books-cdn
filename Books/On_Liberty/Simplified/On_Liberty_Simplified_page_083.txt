A rule like this is way more dangerous than any one limit on freedom. It would allow any loss of freedom and doesn’t accept any real rights to freedom, except maybe keeping your opinions secret. But as soon as someone says an opinion that others don’t like, it breaks all the “social rights” the group gives me. This idea says everyone has a say in making others perfect in mind, morals, and even body, based on what each person thinks is right.

Another clear example of unfair limits on personal freedom, which is already happening, is laws about the Sabbath day of rest. Taking one day off work each week, when life allows, is a good habit, even though it’s only religiously required for Jews. Since this habit works only if most working people agree, it’s okay for the law to protect it by stopping big industries on that day. But this reason doesn’t apply to the hobbies or free activities a person picks for their own time, and it definitely doesn’t justify laws banning fun activities on that day.

It’s true that some people’s fun is another person’s job, but many people’s enjoyment is worth the work of a few, as long as the job is chosen freely and can be given up freely. Workers are right to worry that if everyone worked on Sunday, they’d have to work seven days but get paid for six. But since most jobs stop on Sunday, the few who do work get paid more, and they can choose not to do those jobs if they want more free time instead of more money. If a change is needed, it could be a custom to have a day off on a different day for those workers. So, the only real reason to ban fun on Sundays is if it’s seen as religiously wrong—and laws based on religion like that should always be strongly opposed.
