People owe a lot to this kind of morality and its early teachers, and I would never deny that. But I’m not afraid to say that it is incomplete and one-sided in many important ways. If other ideas and feelings that this morality didn’t approve of hadn’t helped shape European life and character, things would be worse than they are now.

Christian morality (as it’s called) mostly reacts against Pagan beliefs. Its focus is more about avoiding bad things than actively doing good things. It values being innocent more than being noble. It tells people to avoid evil instead of encouraging them to chase after good. Its rules mostly say “don’t do this” instead of “you should do this.” Because it’s scared of pleasure, it made self-denial very important, which later turned into strict rules.

It promises heaven and warns about hell as reasons to live a good life. This is different from the best ancient beliefs and makes morality seem selfish because it links doing your duty to what’s good for you only, not really caring about others unless it benefits you. 

Christian morality teaches people to obey all authorities without question. You shouldn’t follow orders that go against religion, but you also shouldn’t fight back, even if the leaders treat you badly. 

While ancient Pagan morals focused a lot on duty to the State, even more than personal freedom, Christian ethics hardly mention this at all. In fact, the Koran, not the New Testament, says that a leader who picks someone less qualified for a job is doing wrong to God and the State.

The small amount of respect for public duty we see in modern morals actually comes from Greek and Roman ideas, not Christian ones. Even in private life, qualities like pride, honor, and dignity come from human, not religious, teachings. These things couldn’t have come from a moral system that values only obedience.
