Who, after seeing such a silly and foolish show, can still believe that religious persecution is gone forever and will never come back?

There is something both awful and shocking about how, these days, anyone can be legally declared unable to manage their own life. After they die, their property can be taken away if there’s enough money to cover legal costs—which come out of the property itself.

Every small detail of their daily life is examined, and anything that seems unusual to the lowest and most ignorant people is used as proof that they are insane. Often, the jury believes this because they are just as uneducated as the witnesses. The judges, who often don’t understand people or life well, sometimes make things worse. These trials show how little ordinary people value freedom. Instead of respecting each person’s right to live as they want in matters that don’t really matter, judges and juries can’t even imagine that a sane person would want such freedom. In the past, when people wanted to burn atheists, kind people suggested putting them in asylums instead. Nowadays, it wouldn’t be surprising if people actually did this and praised themselves for being more humane and Christian by treating these unlucky people that way—while secretly feeling they got what they deserved.

The story of the Bombay Parsees is an interesting example. This hardworking and smart group, who came from Persia and worshipped fire, escaped their homeland to avoid the Caliphs. When they arrived in Western India, Hindu rulers allowed them to live peacefully as long as they didn’t eat beef. Later, when Muslim conquerors took over, the Parsees were allowed to keep living there if they stopped eating pork.
