He doesn’t lose trust in the group he belongs to, even though he knows that people in other times, places, religions, and social groups have believed the exact opposite.  

He thinks his own group is right and the others are wrong. It doesn’t bother him that just by chance, he ended up in this group. If he had been born somewhere else, he might believe something totally different. But it’s clear that no time period is always right. Every age has believed things later seen as wrong or silly. And many things people believe now will probably be rejected by future generations, just like old beliefs are rejected today.  

Some people might argue against this by saying that stopping false ideas from spreading isn’t acting like you’re always right. Everyone has to make judgments, even if they can be wrong. Should people just never use their judgment because they might mess up? Saying no to ideas you think are harmful is not about being perfect; it’s about doing what you believe is right—even if you might be wrong. If we never acted on our opinions because they might be wrong, nothing would ever get done.  

This kind of argument applies to everything we do, so it can’t be a good reason to stop any specific action. Governments and people should try to have the best opinions they can, think carefully, and only force their views on others if they’re really sure they’re right. But if they are sure, then it’s not being careful to avoid acting. Letting ideas they honestly think are dangerous spread without stopping them is wrong, even if people in the past made mistakes by punishing different opinions. We should be careful not to repeat those mistakes, but governments have made other mistakes too—like unfair taxes or bad wars—and we still expect them to use their power to fix those.
