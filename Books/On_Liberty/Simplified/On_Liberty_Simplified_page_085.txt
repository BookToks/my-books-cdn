Still, it’s important to remember that the women involved in this situation choose to be part of it, just like in any other kind of marriage. Even if it seems strange, this happens because many women have been taught that marriage is the most important thing. So, it makes sense that some women would rather be one of several wives than not be married at all.

Other countries don’t have to accept these types of marriages or change their own laws because of Mormon beliefs. But when these people have already accepted a lot of criticism, left countries that didn’t accept their ideas, and settled in a faraway place they made livable, it’s hard to see why they can’t live there by their own rules. As long as they don’t attack other countries and let anyone leave if they don’t like it, they should be free to live how they want.

A recent writer suggested something like a “civilisade” (not a crusade) against this group to stop what he thinks is a step backward for society. I agree it seems like a step backward, but I don’t think any group has the right to force another group to change. If the people affected by the law don’t ask for help, outsiders shouldn’t step in just because they don’t like it from far away. If people want, they can send missionaries to talk against it, and they can try to stop similar ideas from spreading among their own people—but they shouldn’t silence those they disagree with.

If civilization beat barbarism when barbarism ruled the world, it shouldn’t be afraid that barbarism might come back and take over again. If civilization can be defeated by its old enemy, it means civilization has become weak, and no one—teachers or anyone else—has the strength or will to defend it.
