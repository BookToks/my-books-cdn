A person’s taste is their own business, just like their opinions or money. It’s easy to imagine a society that lets people make their own choices in uncertain matters and only asks them to avoid actions that everyone agrees are wrong. But has there ever been a society that limits its judgment like this? Or one that really cares about what everyone agrees on? Usually, when society judges how people act, it mostly dislikes anyone who acts or feels differently. Most moral teachers and thinkers say things are right just because we feel they are. They tell us to look inside ourselves for rules that everyone must follow. So, what can the public do but make their own feelings about right and wrong into rules for everyone?

This problem isn’t just an idea; it happens in real life. I should give examples where today’s society wrongly treats its own likes and dislikes as moral laws. I’m not writing a full essay on the mistakes in today’s morals—that’s a big topic to cover here. But examples are needed to show that this issue really matters and it’s not just about made-up problems. It’s not hard to find many examples where people want the “moral police” to control even the basic freedoms of individuals, and this is something people do all the time.

For example, think about how people hate others just because they have different religious beliefs and don’t follow the same religious rules, especially about what they don’t eat. A simple example is how Muslims hate Christians for eating pork. Christians and Europeans find this disgusting too, but Muslims see it as a serious offense against their religion. But this doesn’t fully explain how strongly Muslims feel about it. For instance, Muslims also aren’t allowed to drink wine, and they agree it’s wrong, but they don’t find it disgusting like eating pork.
