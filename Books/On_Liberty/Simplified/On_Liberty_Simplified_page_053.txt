People are not perfect, and what they believe is usually only partly true. It’s not good to have everyone agree unless they have really talked through all the different opinions. Having different opinions is not a bad thing but a good one, at least until people get better at understanding all sides of the truth. This idea applies not just to what people think but also to how they act.

Since people are imperfect, it’s helpful to have different ways of living. Everyone should be free to show their own personality, as long as they don’t hurt others. People should be able to try out different lifestyles to see what works best for them. Basically, when it doesn’t affect others, people should be themselves. If people just follow old traditions or what others expect, they miss out on one of the main parts of being happy and improving as individuals and as a society.

The biggest problem with this idea isn’t figuring out how to reach this goal, but that most people don’t really care about the goal itself. If people understood that being free to be yourself is super important for living well, and that it’s just as important as things like education and culture, then no one would take freedom for granted. It would also be easier to balance personal freedom with rules for society.

But the problem is most people don’t see being spontaneous and true to yourself as valuable. Most are happy with how things are because they are the ones who keep them that way. They don’t understand why things should be different for everyone. Also, many social reformers don’t support individuality. They see it as a problem that makes it harder for everyone to agree on what’s best for people. 

Few people outside Germany really understand the idea that Wilhelm von Humboldt, a famous thinker and politician, talked about. He said that the main goal for humans, based on reason and not just random wishes, is to develop their abilities fully and consistently. So, everyone should always work toward growing their own unique powers. For this to happen, two things are needed: freedom and different situations to live in. When these come together, people become strong and diverse, which leads to originality.
