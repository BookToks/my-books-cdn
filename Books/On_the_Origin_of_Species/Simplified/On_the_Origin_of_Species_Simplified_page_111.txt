I’m talking about neuters or sterile females in insect groups. These neuters often act and look very different from both males and fertile females, but since they are sterile, they can’t have babies.

This topic is really interesting and could be talked about a lot, but I’ll just focus on one example: worker ants. It’s hard to explain how these workers became sterile, but it’s not harder than explaining other big changes in animals. Sometimes, insects and similar animals naturally become sterile. If it helped the group for some to be born able to work but not have babies, natural selection could make this happen. But I’ll skip that part for now. The bigger problem is that worker ants look very different from males and fertile females—they have different body shapes, no wings, sometimes no eyes, and different instincts. If a working ant was just an ordinary animal, I’d say these changes happened bit by bit through natural selection, with helpful changes being passed down from parent to child.

But worker ants are sterile and can’t have babies, so they can’t pass on these helpful changes. So how does this fit with natural selection?

First, remember that many animals show differences that depend on age or sex. For example, some birds have special feathers only during mating season, or male salmon have hooked jaws. Even in cattle, horn size can change depending on whether the animal is male or female, or if it’s a castrated male (like an ox). So, it’s not hard to believe that some traits could be linked to the sterile condition of some insects. The real challenge is understanding how these traits could slowly build up by natural selection.

This problem seems really hard, but it gets easier when we realize that natural selection can work on families, not just individuals. For example, when a tasty vegetable is cooked and eaten, it’s gone, but the farmer plants seeds from the same kind of vegetable to get more like it. Cattle breeders want animals with well-marbled meat; even if the animal is slaughtered, breeders breed its family to get the same traits. I believe that if breeders always picked bulls and cows that had oxen with the longest horns, they could create a breed with very long horns, even though no single ox could have babies.

So, I think it works the same way with social insects: a small change linked to being sterile helped the group, so the fertile males and females who carried genes for this change did better and passed on the tendency to produce sterile workers with those helpful traits.
