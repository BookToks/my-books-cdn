In the picture, each letter on the top line stands for a group called a genus, which includes many different species. All these genera together make one big group called a class because they all came from one ancient ancestor and share some things in common.

The three genera on the left side share a lot and form a smaller group called a sub-family. This sub-family is different from the next two genera on the right, which split off from a common ancestor at an earlier time. These five genera have some things in common but less than the three on the left, so they make a family that is different from another group of three genera further to the right, which split off even earlier. All these genera that come from (A) form a group called an order, which is different from the genera that come from (I). 

So, many species that came from one ancestor are grouped into genera, and these genera are part of sub-families, families, and orders, all joining into one class. This shows a big idea in natural history: groups fit inside bigger groups, which helps us understand how living things are connected.

Scientists try to organize species, genera, and families in each class using what they call the Natural System. But what does this system really mean? Some people think it’s just a way to put together living things that look alike and separate those that don’t. It’s like a shortcut to describe groups, for example, by one sentence describing all mammals, another for all carnivores, then one for dogs, and finally a full description of each kind of dog. This way is clever and useful.

But many scientists believe the Natural System means more than just grouping by looks. They think it shows the Creator’s plan. However, unless we explain what we mean by the Creator’s plan, this doesn’t really add to what we know. Some famous ideas say that the genus doesn’t come from shared features, but the genus actually gives those features. This means our classification includes more than just similarity. I believe it includes how closely related species are by descent—how they come from common ancestors—even though this connection can be hidden by changes over time. Our classifications help us see this connection a little.

Now, let’s look at the rules for classifying and the problems that come up if classification is just about showing a Creator’s plan or grouping similar things. People once thought that parts of an animal’s body that show how it lives would be very important for classification. But this is not true.

For example, no one thinks a mouse looking like a shrew, or a dugong looking like a whale, or a whale looking like a fish is important for classification. These similarities are called ‘adaptive’ or ‘analogical’ characters because they relate to how animals live, not how they are truly related. We will talk more about these later.

Generally, the less a body part is connected to an animal’s special habits, the more important it is for classification. For example, Owen said that reproductive organs are the best clues to an animal’s real relationships because they are least affected by life habits like food or habitat. The same happens in plants. The parts that help plants grow are not very important for classification, except for the biggest groups. But the parts used for reproduction, like seeds, are super important!
