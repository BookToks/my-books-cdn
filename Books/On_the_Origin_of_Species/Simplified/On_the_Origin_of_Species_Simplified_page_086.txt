Just because a squirrel looks the way it does now doesn’t mean it’s the absolute best design for all situations in nature. If the climate or plants change, or if new animals move in or old ones change, some squirrels might die out or become fewer in number—unless they also change and get better suited for their new life. So, it’s easy to imagine that squirrels with bigger skin flaps on their sides, which help them glide, would survive better. Over time, natural selection would keep improving these flaps until a perfect flying squirrel was made.

Now, think about the Galeopithecus, or flying lemur. People used to think it was a kind of bat, but it’s not. It has a really wide skin flap that stretches from its jaw to its tail, covering its arms and long fingers. This flap even has muscles to help it stretch out. Even though we don’t see any animals today that connect the flying lemur to other lemurs by having parts for gliding, it’s easy to believe that such animals existed before. Each step in their development helped them glide better.

It’s also not hard to believe that the flying lemur’s fingers and arms could get longer through natural selection. If that happened, it could turn into a bat. Bats have wing membranes that stretch from their shoulders to their tails, covering their back legs too. This might have started as a gliding tool before becoming true wings for flying.

Imagine if a bunch of bird types disappeared and no one knew about them. Who would guess that birds use their wings in such different ways? Some, like the logger-headed duck, flap their wings to fly. Penguins use their wings like fins in water and legs on land. Ostriches use their wings kind of like sails, and the Apteryx’s wings don’t really do much at all. Each bird’s wing suits the way it lives and fights to survive, but that doesn’t mean their wings are the best possible for every situation. These examples don’t show exactly how birds learned to fly, but they do show the many ways wings can change.

We know that some water animals like crabs and snails can live on land, and that birds, bats, insects, and even some extinct reptiles can fly. So it’s possible that flying fish, which now glide through the air a bit using their fins, could have changed over time into animals with real wings. If that had happened, no one would have guessed that these animals once lived in the open ocean and only used their gliding to escape from predators.

When we see a body part perfectly made for something, like bird wings for flying, we should remember that animals with early, less perfect versions usually don’t survive today. That’s because natural selection helps the best ones take over and replace the less advanced forms.
