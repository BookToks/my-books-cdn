Newman says that near villages and small towns, he found more humble-bee nests than in other places. He thinks this is because there are many cats that catch mice there. So, it makes sense that having lots of cats in an area could affect how many bees live there, which then affects how many flowers grow in that area!

For every kind of animal or plant, many different things control how many survive. These things can act at different times in life, or in different seasons or years. Usually, one or a few of these things have the biggest effect, but together they decide how many of that species live there. Sometimes, very different things control the same species in different places. When we look at plants and bushes in a wild area, it might seem like their numbers and types happen by chance. But that’s not true! For example, when an American forest is cut down, new plants grow that are very different. But on old Indian mounds in the southern US, the trees growing there are just as diverse and balanced as in the untouched forests nearby. This shows that many struggles have happened over hundreds of years—trees dropping thousands of seeds, insects fighting each other, animals eating plants or each other—all working together to decide which plants and trees survive. It’s like throwing feathers in the air—they fall in a certain way because of natural rules. But this is much simpler than how plants and animals have shaped forests over centuries!

One living thing often depends on another, like a parasite depends on its host. Usually, this happens between very different kinds of animals. Sometimes, species fight for survival, like locusts and animals that eat grass. But the hardest fight is usually between members of the same species. This is because they live in the same places, eat the same food, and face the same dangers. Even different varieties of the same species fight hard. For example, if different types of wheat are grown together, the varieties that grow best in the soil or climate will outgrow the others and take over after a few years. To keep a mix of sweet-pea flowers that have different colors, farmers have to harvest each kind separately and then mix the seeds carefully. Otherwise, the weaker kinds will slowly disappear. The same happens with different types of sheep; some mountain sheep varieties can starve out others, so they can’t be kept together.

This also happens with different kinds of medicinal leeches. It’s even possible that no varieties of plants or animals we keep at home are exactly equal in strength or habits. So, if their seeds or babies weren’t sorted every year, the mix of varieties wouldn’t last long in nature.

Species that belong to the same genus usually have similar habits and body types. Because of this, they compete more strongly with each other than with species from different genera.
