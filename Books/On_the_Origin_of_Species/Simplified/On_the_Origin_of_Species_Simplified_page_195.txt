It doesn’t matter how small or unimportant a feature is—like the shape of a jaw, how an insect folds its wings, or whether an animal’s skin has hair or feathers—if that feature shows up in many different species, especially ones that live very differently, it becomes really important. That’s because the only way to explain why so many different creatures share this feature is that they got it from the same ancestor. We might make mistakes when looking at just one feature, but when several small features appear together in a big group of different animals, we can be almost sure they come from a common ancestor. These shared features are very useful when we try to organize and classify living things.

We understand why a species or group might be very different from its relatives in some big ways but still belong with them. This is okay as long as enough small features show they are connected by descent. Even if two animals don’t share a single feature, if they are linked by groups in between, we can say they share a common ancestor and put them in the same group. Important body parts that help animals survive in many different environments usually stay the same, so we trust those parts more when classifying animals. But if those important parts are very different in another group, we don’t use them as much to classify. Later on, we’ll see why how animals develop before birth is really important for classifying them. Also, where animals live can help us group them, because species in the same area probably came from the same ancestors.

With these ideas, we can see the difference between real relationships and fake similarities that happen because animals adapt. Lamarck first talked about this difference, and others have agreed. For example, the dugong and the whale both have body shapes and fins that look alike, but these are not because they’re closely related. It’s because they both adapted to living in water. There are lots of examples like this in insects too. Linnaeus even once wrongly classified an insect as a moth because it looked similar. Even things like thickened stems in turnips show this. The way a greyhound and a racehorse look alike is not really about family but about similar functions. According to my view, only features that show inheritance from ancestors are important for classification. Animals from different families can look alike because they live in similar ways, but that doesn’t mean they are closely related. These fake similarities can actually hide the true family connections. It might seem strange, but the same features can be fake similarities when comparing big groups but show real family ties when comparing animals within the same group. For example, body shape and fins are fake similarities between whales and fish because both adapted to swim, but these features show real relationships among different whales because they share many other features inherited from a common ancestor.
