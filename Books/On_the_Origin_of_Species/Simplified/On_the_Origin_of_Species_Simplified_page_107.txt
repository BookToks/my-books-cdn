So, we can safely say that if the Melipona bee changed its natural habits a little bit—which aren’t very amazing on their own—it could build a structure as perfect as the hive-bee’s. We have to imagine the Melipona making its cells perfectly round and all the same size. This isn’t too surprising because it already does this somewhat, and many insects can make perfect round tunnels in wood by spinning around a fixed spot.  

We also have to imagine the Melipona putting its cells in flat layers, like it already does with its tube-shaped cells. The hardest part to imagine is that it can figure out exactly how far apart to stand from other bees when making the spheres. But it’s already good at judging distance because its spheres overlap a lot, and then it connects the overlapping parts with flat surfaces.  

We can also imagine that after these round shapes join together to form hexagonal tubes in one layer, the bee can make these tubes as long as needed to store honey. This is like how humble-bees add wax cylinders to their old cocoons. With small changes like these—changes not much more amazing than what helps birds build nests—I think the hive-bee got its amazing building skills through natural selection.  

But we can test this idea with experiments. Following Mr. Tegetmeier’s example, I put a thick, square strip of wax between two combs. The bees started digging tiny round pits in it. As they dug deeper, the pits got wider and looked like shallow bowls, almost perfect parts of spheres, about the size of a cell.  

It was really interesting to see that when several bees dug these bowls close together, they started far enough apart so that when the bowls got as wide as a normal cell and about one-sixth as deep, their edges overlapped. When this happened, the bees stopped digging and began building flat wax walls where the bowls touched. So, each hexagonal tube was built on the curved edge of a smooth bowl instead of on straight edges like normal cells.  

Next, I put a thin, narrow strip of wax shaped like a knife edge, colored red, into the hive instead of the thick square piece. The bees again dug small bowls on both sides close to each other. But since the wax was so thin, if they dug as deep as before, the bottoms of the bowls would have broken into each other through the wax.  

The bees didn’t let this happen. They stopped digging at the right time, so the bowls had flat bottoms made of thin plates of red wax that weren’t dug through. These flat bottoms lined up perfectly along the imaginary planes where the bowls on opposite sides would meet. Sometimes there were just tiny parts left, other times bigger parts shaped like diamonds, but because this was an unnatural setup, their work wasn’t perfect.  

The bees must have worked at almost the same speed on both sides of the thin wax strip. That way, as they dug and made the bowls deeper, they were able to stop at just the right spot to leave flat plates between the bowls along the lines where they met.
