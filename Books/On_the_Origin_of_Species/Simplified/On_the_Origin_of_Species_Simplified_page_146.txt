For example, if all our fantail pigeons were destroyed, it might be possible for pigeon breeders to create a new breed that looks almost exactly like the old fantail after many, many years. But if the original rock-pigeon was also gone, it’s almost impossible that a fantail just like the one we have now could come from any other kind of pigeon. That’s because the new fantail would probably have some small differences from its new parent species.

Groups of species, like families and genera, follow similar patterns when they appear and disappear, just like single species do. These groups change faster or slower, and more or less, but once a group is gone, it doesn’t come back. During the time a group exists, it continues without stopping. I know there seem to be a few exceptions to this rule, but they are very rare. Even scientists who don’t agree with me admit this is true. This fits well with my idea that all species in the same group come from one original species. So, as long as any species in the group are alive, the group continues to exist. For example, species of the genus Lingula have lived continuously from the oldest rocks we know of to today.

In the last chapter, we saw that sometimes species in a group seem to appear suddenly. I tried to explain this, and if my explanation were wrong, it would ruin my ideas. But these sudden appearances are rare. Usually, a group slowly grows in the number of species until it reaches its largest size, then slowly shrinks. If you imagine a vertical line showing the number of species in a group across different layers of rock, the line might look like it starts suddenly at the bottom, then gets thicker as the group grows, stays thick for a while, and finally gets thinner as the species disappear. This slow increase fits perfectly with my theory because species and groups grow slowly over time. One species first creates a few varieties, then these slowly become new species, which then create more species, like branches growing from a tree, until the group becomes big.

About extinction — so far, we have only talked a little about species and groups disappearing. According to natural selection, old forms die out and new, better forms appear, and these things are closely linked. The old idea that all life on Earth was wiped out suddenly by disasters many times is mostly rejected now, even by scientists who once believed it. Instead, from studying fossil layers, we believe species and groups slowly disappear one by one, first in some places, then in others, until they vanish completely from the world.
