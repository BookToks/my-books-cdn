Systematic affinity means how much different species look alike in their body parts and makeup, especially in important parts that don’t change much between related species. How easily two species can mate and have fertile babies depends a lot on how closely related they are. For example, species from very different families don’t usually make hybrids, but species that are closely related often do.

However, this isn’t always true. Sometimes closely related species can’t mate or only do so with great difficulty. On the other hand, some very different species can mate easily. Even within the same family, some groups of species can cross easily, like Dianthus, while others, like Silene, cannot make hybrids even after many tries. The same happens within a genus: many Nicotiana species cross easily, but one species, N. acuminata, refuses to mate with eight others. There are many examples like this.

No one knows exactly how different two species have to be to stop them from crossing. It’s clear that plants which look very different and have different flowers, pollen, fruits, and seeds can still often cross. Plants that live in different places or climates can also mate without much trouble.

A reciprocal cross is when two species mate in both directions, like a male horse with a female donkey, and then a male donkey with a female horse. These two crosses can be very different in how easy they are. This shows that being able to cross doesn’t always depend on how closely related the species are or how different they look. Instead, it depends on hidden differences in their reproductive systems.

This difference in reciprocal crosses was noticed a long time ago by Kolreuter. For example, Mirabilis jalappa can be fertilized by Mirabilis longiflora easily, and their hybrids are fertile. But when Kolreuter tried the opposite cross many times over eight years, he failed every time. Similar cases happen with some seaweeds, too.

Gartner found that small differences in ease of reciprocal crosses happen even between species that are very closely related, or even considered just varieties. It’s also interesting that hybrids from these reciprocal crosses, though made from the same two species, often differ in how fertile they are—sometimes a little, sometimes a lot.
