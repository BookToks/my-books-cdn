Some groups of species suddenly appear. There are different rates at which living things change over time. Species often follow each other in a continuous way. Fossils found in layers show close connections between different species. Embryos develop in a certain order.

Mr. Pierce studied different types of wolves. Pigeons can have feathers on their feet and skin between their toes. Different breeds of pigeons exist and we know where they come from.

Birds’ feathers change between males and females in certain ways. Plums grow in the United States. The pointer dog’s origin and habits are known. Some poisons don’t affect certain colored animals. Poison affects animals and plants in similar ways. Fir trees produce pollen. Colonel Poole studied striped hemionus. Mr. Prestwich studied old English and French rocks.

Quince trees can be grafted. Rabbits’ young behave in certain ways. There are Arab and English race-horses. Domestic races have specific traits. Ramond studied plants of the Pyrenees. Professor Ramsay is also mentioned.
