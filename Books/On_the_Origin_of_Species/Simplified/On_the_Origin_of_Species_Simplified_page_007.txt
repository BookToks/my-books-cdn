Even if this idea is true, it wouldn’t be enough until we understand how the many different species in the world have changed over time to become so perfectly designed and connected with each other. Scientists often say things like climate and food are the only reasons animals and plants change. In one small way, this might be true, but it’s silly to think that just outside conditions made the woodpecker’s feet, tail, beak, and tongue so perfectly made to catch bugs under tree bark.

Take the mistletoe, for example. It sucks nutrients from certain trees, has seeds that birds must carry, and has flowers that need specific insects to move pollen between them. It’s just as silly to say its features and relationships with other living things happened because of outside conditions, habits, or the plant’s own choices.

The person who wrote ‘Vestiges of Creation’ might say that after many generations, a normal bird became a woodpecker, and a normal plant became mistletoe, and they were perfect from the start. But this doesn’t explain how these living things fit so well with each other and their environment.

So, it’s really important to understand how living things change and adapt together. At first, I thought studying animals and plants raised by people would be the best way to figure this out. I wasn’t wrong. Even though we don’t know everything, watching how animals and plants vary under human care gives the best clues. I believe these studies are very useful, even though many scientists ignore them.

Because of this, the first chapter of this summary will be about Variation under Domestication. We’ll see that a lot of inherited change can happen, and even more importantly, how humans can select small changes and build on them. Then, I’ll talk about how species vary in the wild, but I won’t go into much detail because it would take too many examples. Still, we’ll look at what conditions help variation happen.

The next chapter will explain the Struggle for Existence among all living things around the world. This idea comes from Malthus and applies to animals and plants. Since more individuals are born than can survive, they constantly compete to live. So, any creature that changes, even a little, in a way that helps it survive has a better chance of living and passing on its traits. Because traits are inherited, these helpful changes can spread.

The important idea of Natural Selection will be explained more in the fourth chapter. We’ll see how it causes less well-adapted forms to die out and leads to what I call Divergence of Character.
