Also, we can say that animals with body parts halfway between very different ways of living probably didn’t exist in large numbers or many different types early on. For example, thinking about the flying fish we talked about before, it’s unlikely that fish able to really fly would have many different kinds living both on land and in water until their flying parts were really good. These flying parts would have to be better than other animals’ to help them survive. So, finding fossils of species with these in-between body parts is harder because there were fewer of them compared to species with fully developed parts.

Now, I’ll give two or three examples of animals in the same species that have different habits. When this happens, natural selection can change the animal’s body to fit its new habits or just one of its many habits. It’s hard to know if habits change first and then the body changes, or if small body changes cause new habits; probably both happen at the same time. For example, many British insects now eat foreign plants or man-made things. There are many examples of different habits: I have watched a bird in South America called a tyrant flycatcher hover like a kestrel, then stand still by water and dive like a kingfisher to catch fish. In our country, the larger titmouse climbs branches like a creeper, kills small birds like a shrike, and breaks yew seeds like a nuthatch. In North America, a black bear was seen swimming with its mouth open to catch insects like a whale. If insects were always available and no better animals lived there, natural selection could make bears more aquatic with bigger mouths, eventually creating a creature as strange as a whale.

Sometimes, individuals of a species have habits very different from others in their species or genus. My theory says these individuals might sometimes start new species with unusual habits and bodies changed a little or a lot. This does happen in nature. A great example is the woodpecker, which is made for climbing trees and catching insects in bark. But in North America, some woodpeckers eat mostly fruit, and some with long wings chase insects in the air. On the plains of La Plata, where there are no trees, there’s a woodpecker that in many ways—like its color, voice, and flying style—looks like it’s related to our common woodpecker, but it never climbs trees!

Petrels are birds that live mostly in the air and ocean, but in the calm waters of Tierra del Fuego, the Puffinuria berardi dives, swims, and flies so differently that it could be mistaken for an auk or grebe. Still, it is a petrel with many parts of its body very changed.
