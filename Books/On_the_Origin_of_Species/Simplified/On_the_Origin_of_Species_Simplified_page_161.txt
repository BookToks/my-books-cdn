He hears birds that are closely related but still different, notices their songs sound almost the same, and sees their nests built in similar ways, but not exactly alike. Their eggs are also colored in nearly the same way. 

The plains near the Straits of Magellan have one kind of Rhea (a bird like an American ostrich), and farther north, the plains of La Plata have another kind of Rhea from the same group. But they don’t have true ostriches or emus like the ones in Africa and Australia, even though these places are at the same latitude.

On the La Plata plains, we find animals like the agouti and bizcacha. They behave a lot like our hares and rabbits and belong to the same rodent family, but they clearly have an American style. When we climb the high mountains of the Cordillera, we find a mountain version of the bizcacha. Looking at the water, we don’t find beavers or musk-rats, but we do find coypu and capybara, which are also American rodents. There are many other examples like this. 

If we check the islands near America, even if their geology is very different, the animals living there are still basically American species. Looking back to past times, as explained before, American types were common on the American continent and in American seas. These facts show a strong connection that lasts across space and time, over the same lands and waters, no matter their physical conditions. Any naturalist would be curious to know what this connection is.

My idea is that this connection is inheritance—the reason why organisms look alike or almost alike, like varieties of the same kind.

The differences in animals from different places can be explained by changes through natural selection, and a smaller part by the effects of the environment. How different they are depends on how easily animals moved from one place to another a long time ago, who moved there first, and how they competed with each other. The way animals relate to each other is the most important factor. Barriers like mountains or oceans stop animals from moving, which is important. Time also matters for slow changes through natural selection. Animals that already live in many places and are strong competitors have the best chance to settle in new areas. In these new places, they face new conditions and often change more, becoming even better and creating new groups of related animals. This idea of inheritance with change helps us understand why groups of animals often live only in certain areas.

I don’t believe there is a fixed law that all animals must develop in a certain way. Each species can change differently, and natural selection only helps when changes benefit the animal in its struggle to survive. So how much a species changes will not be the same for all. For example, if several species that compete with each other move together to a new, isolated place, they won’t change much because moving or being isolated doesn’t cause change by itself. Changes happen only when animals face new relationships with each other and the environment. As we saw before, some species have stayed almost the same over huge periods of time, and some have moved far without changing much.
