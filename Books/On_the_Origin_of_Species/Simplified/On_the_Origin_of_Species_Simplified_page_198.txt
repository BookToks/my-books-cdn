In a tree, we can point out this branch or that branch, even though at the actual split they come together and mix. We can’t clearly define all the different groups, but we can choose examples or types that show most of the features of each group, big or small. This helps us get a general idea of how different they really are.

This is what we’d have to do if we ever wanted to collect all the types in any group that have lived everywhere and at all times. We’ll probably never manage to make such a perfect collection. But in some groups, we are getting closer to this. Recently, Milne Edwards wrote an important paper about how useful it is to focus on these types, even if we can’t clearly separate or define the groups they belong to.

Lastly, we’ve seen that natural selection, which comes from the struggle to survive, usually causes some species to die out and others to change a lot. This explains a big and common pattern in how all living things are related: they fit into groups inside bigger groups. We group males and females, and young and old, into one species because they come from the same ancestors, even if they look different. We do the same for varieties, even if they look very different from their parents. I believe that this idea of shared ancestry is the secret connection naturalists have been looking for, which they call the Natural System. If we think of the natural system as a family tree that shows how closely related different groups are, we can understand why we classify things the way we do. We see why some similarities are more important than others, why we use even tiny or useless organs to help classify, and why we ignore some features when comparing very different groups but use them within the same group. We can understand how all living and extinct species fit into one big system and how each member of a group is connected to many others in complicated ways. We probably won’t ever untangle all these connections perfectly, but if we focus on clear goals and don’t expect some unknown plan behind creation, we can slowly make progress.

Morphology – We’ve seen that members of the same class, no matter how they live, look alike in their basic body plans. This similarity is called ‘unity of type,’ or that their parts and organs are homologous. Morphology is the study of this, and it’s one of the most interesting parts of natural history – you could say it’s the heart of the subject. How strange is it that a human hand for grabbing, a mole’s hand for digging, a horse’s leg, a porpoise’s paddle, and a bat’s wing are all built on the same design, with the same bones in the same places? Geoffroy St. Hilaire pointed out that in these matching organs, the parts may change shape and size a lot but always stay connected in the same order. For example, the bones in the arm and forearm or thigh and leg never switch places. That’s why we can use the same names for these bones in very different animals. We see the same pattern in insect mouths. The long spiral mouthpart of a sphinx moth, the folded one of a bee or bug, and the strong jaws of a beetle all look very different but are made from changes of the same basic parts: an upper lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae.
