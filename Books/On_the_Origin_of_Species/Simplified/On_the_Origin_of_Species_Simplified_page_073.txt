In my future work, I will share a list of the most interesting examples. Here, I will just quickly talk about one that shows the rule in a big way. The opercular valves of rock barnacles (a type of sea creature) are very important parts, and they look almost the same even in different groups. But in the different species of one group called Pyrgoma, these valves are amazingly different. The same valves in different species sometimes look completely different, and the differences between individuals in some species are so big that the varieties look more different from each other than species from different groups.

Birds living in the same country only change a little bit, so I have paid special attention to them. The rule seems to work well for birds. I can’t tell if it works for plants, and this made me doubt the rule for a while. But plants change a lot, so it is hard to compare how much they change compared to animals.

When we see a body part that is very developed or special in a species, we can guess it is very important for that species. But this part can also change a lot. Why does this happen? If each species was made on its own with all its parts perfect, I don’t see why. But if species come from other species and change over time through natural selection, I think this makes sense. 

In animals we keep at home, if we stop caring about a part (like the comb on a certain kind of chicken) or the whole breed, that part or breed will stop being the same. Then the breed is said to have gone backward. In body parts that aren’t very specialized or important, natural selection doesn’t work strongly, so these parts often stay changeable. 

What is important here is that in domestic animals, parts that are changing quickly because people choose them are also the parts that change the most. Look at pigeons: the beak of tumblers, the beak and wattle of carriers, or the tail of fantails all show huge differences because breeders focus on these parts. Even in small groups, like short-faced tumblers, it is hard to keep them perfect, and many babies look very different from the ideal. There is always a struggle between the tendency to go back to a more normal state or to change in many ways, and the power of careful breeding to keep the breed the same. Over time, breeding wins, and we don’t expect a short-faced tumbler to suddenly look like a common tumbler. But as long as breeding is still changing things, there will be lots of variation. Also, these changes caused by people sometimes appear more in one sex than the other, usually in males, like the wattle of carriers or the big crop of pouters.

Now let’s look at nature. When a part is very different in one species compared to others in the same group, we can guess that this part has changed a lot since that species split from the common ancestor of the group.
