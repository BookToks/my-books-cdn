The surprising thing about the Galapagos Islands is that new species created on each island haven’t quickly spread to the other islands. Even though the islands look close on a map, they are separated by deep, wide stretches of ocean, usually wider than the British Channel. There’s no reason to think the islands were ever connected. Strong sea currents flow between them, and big storms are very rare, so the islands are actually more separate than they seem. Still, some species, both those found worldwide and those only in the Galapagos, live on several islands. We can guess these species moved from one island to another. But people often wrongly assume that closely related species easily move into each other’s areas when they can travel freely.

If one species is better than another, it will quickly replace it, at least partly. But if both species are equally good at living where they are, they will probably stay separate for a long time. We know that many species brought by humans have spread fast to new places, so we might think most species do this. But the species that spread are usually very different from the local ones, often even in different groups. In the Galapagos, many birds are great at flying between islands but are still different species on each island. For example, there are three similar mocking-thrush species, each living only on its own island. Imagine a mocking-thrush from Chatham Island gets blown to Charles Island, which already has its own mocking-thrush. Why would the new bird survive there? Charles Island already has plenty of its own species, which are just as good at living there.

A similar example comes from Madeira and Porto Santo, two nearby islands. They have many different but related land snails. Even though lots of stones are moved from Porto Santo to Madeira every year, the snails from Porto Santo haven’t taken over Madeira. Both islands have been settled by some European snails, which probably had an advantage. Because of examples like these, it’s not surprising that each Galapagos island has its own special species that don’t spread everywhere. This idea also applies to places on the same continent. For example, the southeast and southwest parts of Australia have almost the same environment and are connected by land, but they have many different mammals, birds, and plants.

The main idea about ocean islands is that the animals and plants living there are usually related to those from the closest land, where they originally came from. Over time, they change and adapt to their new homes. This idea can be seen all over nature.
