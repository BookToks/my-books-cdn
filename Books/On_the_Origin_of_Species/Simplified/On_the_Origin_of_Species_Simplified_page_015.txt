The carrier pigeon, especially the males, is known for the strange, bumpy skin around its head. It also has very long eyelids, big nostril openings, and a wide mouth. The short-faced tumbler has a beak shaped almost like a finch’s. The common tumbler is famous for flying very high in a tight group and flipping over in the air. The runt is a really big bird with a long, strong beak and big feet. Some runts have very long necks, wings, or tails, while others have very short tails. The barb is related to the carrier but has a short, wide beak instead of a long one. The pouter has a long body, wings, and legs, and it can puff up its big crop (a pouch in its throat), which looks funny. The turbit has a short, cone-shaped beak and a line of feathers that go backward down its chest. It often slightly puffs up the top of its throat. The Jacobin has feathers on the back of its neck that form a hood, and it has long wings and tail feathers for its size. The trumpeter and laugher pigeons make different cooing sounds compared to other kinds. The fantail has 30 to 40 tail feathers instead of the usual 12 to 14. It keeps its tail feathers spread out so much that in good birds, the head and tail almost touch. It also has a tiny oil gland. There are many other breeds too, but these are the main ones.

When you look at the skeletons of these pigeons, the bones in their faces are very different in length, width, and shape. The lower jaw bones also change a lot between breeds. The number of bones in their tails and lower back, and the number of ribs, can vary too. The ribs can be wider or have different parts sticking out. The openings in the chest bone (sternum) and the size and shape of the wishbone (furcula) also differ a lot. The size of the mouth opening, eyelids, nostrils, tongue (which doesn’t always match the beak length), crop, throat, oil gland, and feathers all change depending on the breed. Their wings, tails, legs, feet, and toes also vary in size and shape. Even the time it takes for young pigeons to grow their adult feathers, the down feathers they’re born with, and the size and shape of their eggs can be different. How they fly, the sounds they make, and their behavior can also change between breeds. In some breeds, males and females look a bit different from each other.

If you showed about twenty different kinds of pigeons to a bird expert and said they were wild birds, the expert would probably think they were completely different species. I don’t think any expert would say that the English carrier, short-faced tumbler, runt, barb, pouter, and fantail all belong to the same group, especially since each of these breeds has sub-breeds that could even be called separate species.

Even though these pigeons are very different from each other, I believe most scientists are right when they say all pigeons come from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia). This rock-pigeon has several groups or subspecies that are only slightly different from one another.
