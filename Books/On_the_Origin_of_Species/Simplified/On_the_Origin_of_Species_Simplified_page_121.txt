Gartner talked about some interesting rules about how different species can mate. For example, some species can easily crossbreed with others, while some species can pass on their looks to their mixed offspring very strongly. But these two things don’t always happen together.

Sometimes, hybrids (offspring from two different species) don’t look like a mix of both parents but look almost exactly like one parent. These hybrids usually can’t have babies. Also, among hybrids that usually look like a mix of both parents, some rare ones look like just one parent and are almost always unable to reproduce, even if their siblings can. This shows that how fertile a hybrid is doesn’t depend on how much it looks like either parent.

Looking at all these rules about fertility in first crosses and hybrids, we see that when two distinct species mate, their fertility can be anywhere from zero to fully fertile, or even more fertile in some cases. Fertility can change depending on the environment and is naturally different in different individuals. It’s not always the same between the first cross and the hybrids made from that cross. Also, fertility doesn’t depend on how much the hybrid looks like either parent. Plus, how easy it is for two species to crossbreed isn’t always based on how similar they are. This is shown by the fact that sometimes it’s easier for one species to be the mother and the other the father, but harder the other way around. The hybrids from these reversed crosses also often have different fertility.

Do these complicated rules mean species are made sterile just to keep them from mixing in nature? I don’t think so. Why would sterility be so different in different species if its only job was to stop mixing? Why would sterility vary among individuals of the same species? Why can some species mate easily but produce sterile hybrids, while others barely mate but produce fertile hybrids? Why does switching the mother and father species change the results so much? And why allow hybrids to be made at all, only to stop them from reproducing later? That seems strange.

Instead, these facts suggest that sterility in crosses and hybrids happens because of unknown differences, mainly in the reproductive systems of the species. These differences are very specific, so sometimes the male part of one species can work with the female part of another species, but not the other way around. To explain this better, think about how some plants can be grafted onto others. This doesn’t really affect their survival in nature, so it’s not a special ability but just depends on how the plants grow differently.
