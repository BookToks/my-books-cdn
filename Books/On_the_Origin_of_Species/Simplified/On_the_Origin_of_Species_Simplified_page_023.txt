People usually notice only changes they can see on the outside, and they don’t really care much about what’s inside. They can only choose from changes that nature already shows a little bit. No one would try to breed a fantail pigeon without first seeing a pigeon with a slightly different tail, or a pouter pigeon without seeing one with a bigger crop. The weirder or more unusual a trait is when it first shows up, the more likely people will notice it. But saying someone tried to make a fantail pigeon on purpose is probably wrong. The person who first picked a pigeon with a slightly bigger tail didn’t imagine how its babies would change over time through slow and partly accidental breeding. Maybe the first fantail pigeon had just a few tail feathers spread out, like some pigeons today. Maybe the first pouter pigeon didn’t puff up its crop much more than some pigeons do now—a trait that pigeon breeders don’t even care about.

Don’t think people need big changes to notice something different; they actually spot tiny differences easily. People like to own anything new or a little different. Also, the value people put on small differences today isn’t the same as it was before breeds became well known. Many small changes happen now in pigeons, but breeders call them faults because they don’t match the perfect type for each breed. For example, the common goose hasn’t changed much into different kinds, so the Toulouse and common breeds, which mostly just look different in color, are only recently shown as separate breeds at bird shows.

This helps explain why we don’t really know where our domestic breeds came from. A breed is kind of like a way of speaking—it doesn’t have a clear beginning. Someone starts by keeping and breeding an animal that’s a little different, or carefully chooses the best animals to breed, making them better over time. These better animals spread slowly around the area. At first, they don’t have a special name and aren’t valued much, so no one keeps track of their history. When they get better and more well-known, they spread farther and might get a local name. In places where people don’t travel or share ideas much, new breeds spread slowly. Once people agree on what makes a breed special, unconscious selection—breeding without really thinking about it—keeps making these traits stronger. This happens more or less depending on how popular the breed is or where people live. But because these changes happen slowly and without much notice, it’s very unlikely anyone wrote down how it all started.

Now, a few words about what helps or hurts people’s ability to choose animals to breed. Lots of natural differences help because they give more options to pick from. But even small individual differences, if carefully chosen, can add up to big changes in almost any way people want.
