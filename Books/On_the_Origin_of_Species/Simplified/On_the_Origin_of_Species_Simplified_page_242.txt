This passage talks about many different things about animals and plants.

It mentions how animals that are crossed, like pigeons, are chosen by people. Professor Sedgwick talks about groups of species that suddenly show up. Seedlings can be destroyed by insects. Seeds have nutrients and some have wings. They can resist salt-water and are found in crops, bird intestines, eaten by fish, or stuck in mud. Some seeds have hooks and can be found on islands.

The idea of choosing domestic products, like animals and plants we use, is not new. It can happen without people realizing it. There are natural and sexual ways this happens, and natural selection works best when conditions are good.

The passage talks about the differences between male and female animals. Sexual traits can change. Merino sheep have been selected by people, and two new kinds were made without meaning to. There are also mountain varieties.

Shells can have different colors. Littoral shells are rarely stuck in rocks. Freshwater shells spread in different places. There are shells in Madeira and on land, too.

Silene plants can cross and still be fertile. Professor Silliman talks about a blind rat. The skulls of young mammals are mentioned.

There is something about the slave-making instinct. Colonel Hamilton Smith talks about striped horses. Mr. Fred talks about slave-making ants. Another Mr., from Jordan Hill, studies how coast rocks break down.

Snapdragons and Lord Somerville discuss sheep selection. Sorbus plants can be grafted. King Charlesâ€™s Spaniel breed is mentioned.

Groups of species appear suddenly, even beneath old rocks from the Silurian period. Species appear one after another and change all over the world at the same time.

Lord Spencer talks about how cattle get bigger. Sphex is a kind of parasitic insect. Spiders grow and develop. Spitz dogs have been crossed with foxes. There are sports, or variations, in plants. Sprengel, C., is also mentioned.
