Many flowers, like those in the pea family, keep their parts for making seeds tightly closed. But in many of these flowers, there’s a cool connection between how the flower is built and how bees get the nectar. When bees do this, they either push pollen from that flower onto the flower’s own stigma (the part that catches pollen) or bring pollen from another flower. Bees visiting these pea flowers are super important because, as I found in other experiments, the flowers don’t make as many seeds if bees don’t visit them.

It’s almost impossible for bees to fly from flower to flower without carrying pollen from one to another, which helps the plants a lot. Bees act like tiny paintbrushes, and just touching the pollen of one flower and then the stigma of another is enough to make the flower fertilized. But don’t think bees make lots of mixed-up plants from different species. If pollen from the same type of plant and pollen from another species both get on the bee, the plant’s own pollen usually wins and stops any effect from the foreign pollen.

Sometimes, the stamens (the part that makes pollen) suddenly move toward the pistil (the part that catches pollen), or slowly one by one. This seems designed to make the flower fertilize itself. This definitely helps, but insects often have to make the stamens move, like in barberry plants. Interestingly, in barberries, even though they seem built to fertilize themselves, if you grow very similar types close together, they mix a lot, so it’s hard to get pure plants.

In many other flowers, instead of helping self-fertilization, there are special tricks that stop the flower’s stigma from getting pollen from its own flower. For example, in Lobelia fulgens, all the pollen is swept away before the stigma is ready to catch any. Since this flower isn’t visited by insects in my garden, it never makes seeds on its own, but if I put pollen from another flower on its stigma, it grows lots of seedlings. Another Lobelia species nearby gets visited by bees and makes seeds easily.

In many cases, even without special tricks, either the pollen is ready before the stigma, or the stigma is ready before the pollen, so the flower can’t fertilize itself and has to cross with another plant. These facts are strange! Even though the pollen and stigma are so close, they often can’t work together in the same flower. It makes sense if cross-pollination with another plant is helpful or necessary.

If different types of cabbage, radish, or onion grow near each other and make seeds, most of the new plants will be mixes of the types. For example, I grew 233 cabbage seedlings from plants of different types growing close, but only 78 looked like one pure type, and some of those weren’t perfectly pure. Since each cabbage flower has its own stamens and those from many other flowers on the same plant, why do so many seedlings end up mixed? I think it’s because pollen from a different variety can be stronger than the plant’s own pollen. This shows that mixing pollen from different plants of the same species usually helps the plants a lot.
