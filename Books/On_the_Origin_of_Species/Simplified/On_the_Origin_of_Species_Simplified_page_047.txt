When our plant started having more and more attractive flowers because of natural selection, insects began to visit them more often. Without meaning to, these insects would carry pollen from one flower to another. I have many examples that show how well insects do this. I’ll share one example—not the most amazing, but it shows an important step in how male and female parts of plants become separate.

Some holly trees only have male flowers, which produce a small amount of pollen and have a tiny female part. Other holly trees only have female flowers, which have a full female part but male parts that don’t produce pollen. I found a female holly tree about sixty yards from a male one. I looked at the female flowers under a microscope and saw pollen on all of them, sometimes a lot. The wind was blowing from the female tree toward the male one, so pollen couldn’t have come by wind. The weather was cold and windy, so bees weren’t active. Still, every female flower I checked was fertilized by bees that accidentally carried pollen while looking for nectar.

Back to our example: once the plant became very good at attracting insects that carried pollen between flowers, another process might start. Scientists agree that it’s useful for plants to have a “division of labor,” meaning some flowers or plants produce only male parts and others only female parts. Sometimes, in plants grown by people, either the male or female parts become weak. If this happened a little bit in nature, and pollen was already being carried between flowers, plants with more separate male and female parts would do better. Over time, these plants would be chosen by nature more and more, until male and female parts were completely separated.

Now let’s think about the insects that feed on nectar in our example. Imagine the plant we’ve been making better at producing nectar is common, and some insects mostly eat its nectar. Bees try hard to save time. For example, they sometimes cut holes in flowers to get nectar faster instead of entering the flower’s opening.

Knowing this, it’s easy to believe that a tiny change in a bee’s body size or in the length or shape of its feeding tube (proboscis) could help it get food faster. Bees with this small change would have a better chance to survive and have babies.

Their babies would probably inherit the same small change. For example, the tubes of two types of clover flowers look about the same length, but hive-bees can easily get nectar from one type but not the other. The other type is visited only by different bees. So, the hive-bee would benefit from having a slightly longer or differently shaped proboscis. Also, I found that clover’s ability to produce seeds depends a lot on bees visiting and moving flower parts so pollen gets on the right spot.
