It’s good to try imagining giving one form an advantage over another. Most likely, we wouldn’t really know what to do to make sure one wins. This shows us how little we understand about how all living things are connected. This is something important but hard to learn.

All we can do is remember that every living thing tries to grow fast. At some time in their life, or during certain seasons, or every generation, they have to fight to survive and face lots of dangers. When we think about this struggle, we can feel better knowing that nature’s battle isn’t always happening, no one is always scared, death usually happens quickly, and the strong, healthy, and happy ones live and have babies.

How will this fight to survive affect changes in living things? We know that humans are really good at choosing traits they like, but can nature do the same? I think nature can do it even better. Think about how many weird and different traits animals and plants have, especially those raised by people. These traits often get passed down to their kids.

Nature is super complicated, and all living things depend on each other and their environment. So, isn’t it possible that useful changes happen naturally over thousands of generations? If they do, wouldn’t the ones with even a small advantage have the best chance to live and have kids? On the other hand, any harmful change would be removed. I call this process Natural Selection. Changes that don’t help or hurt wouldn’t be affected and would just stay mixed in.

We can understand natural selection better by thinking about a place where the climate changes. The number of animals and plants there would change quickly, and some might die out.

Since all the creatures in a place depend on each other in complicated ways, any change in the number of some species, even without climate change, would seriously affect many others.
