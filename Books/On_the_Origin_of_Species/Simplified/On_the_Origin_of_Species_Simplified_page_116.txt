It's clear that when different species are crossed, the level of sterility varies a lot and changes gradually. Also, the ability of pure species to reproduce can be easily affected by different things. So, it's really hard to say exactly when perfect fertility ends and sterility begins.

A good example is that two of the best observers ever, Kolreuter and Gartner, came to totally opposite conclusions about the same species. It's also helpful to compare what top botanists say about whether some unclear plants are separate species or just varieties, with what hybridizers have found about their fertility. This shows that neither sterility nor fertility clearly separates species from varieties. Instead, the difference is gradual and as uncertain as other physical or genetic differences.

About hybrid sterility over generations: Gartner managed to grow some hybrids for six, seven, and even ten generations without crossing them with pure parents. But he said their fertility never got better and often got worse. I think this usually happens because of close inbreeding. I have a lot of evidence showing that breeding closely lowers fertility, while occasionally crossing with a different variety or individual increases it. Breeders believe this a lot.

Since hybrids are rarely grown in large numbers and related plants often grow nearby, insects have to be kept away during flowering. This means hybrids usually fertilize themselves with their own pollen, which hurts their fertility even more. Gartner also said that when less fertile hybrids are fertilized artificially with pollen from the same kind of hybrid, their fertility sometimes improves and keeps getting better. When fertilizing artificially, pollen often comes from another flower, even if on the same plant, so this is really a kind of crossing.

Gartner would have made sure to remove the male parts (castrate) from hybrids during experiments to ensure crossing with pollen from a different flower or plant. So, the strange increase in fertility in these hybrids might be because close inbreeding was avoided.

Now, let's look at the results from another experienced hybridizer, the Honorable and Reverend W. Herbert. He strongly believed some hybrids are fully fertileâ€”just as fertile as the pure parent species. This is different from Kolreuter and Gartner, who said some sterility between species is a natural law. Herbert worked on some of the same species as Gartner. The difference in their results might be because Herbert was a very skilled gardener and had greenhouses to help his plants grow.

One important example from Herbert is that every ovule in a pod of Crinum capense fertilized by C...
