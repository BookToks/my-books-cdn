So, it might be safer to think that seeds from about 10 out of every 100 plants, after drying, could float across a sea that’s 900 miles wide and still grow. Bigger fruits often float longer than smaller ones, which is interesting because plants with big seeds or fruits probably can’t move around in any other way. A scientist named Alph. de Candolle showed that these plants usually don’t spread very far.

But sometimes seeds travel in other ways too. Driftwood washes up on most islands, even tiny ones in the middle of huge oceans. People living on coral islands in the Pacific get stones for their tools just from the roots of these drifted trees, and these stones are so valuable they’re like a royal tax. When I looked closely, I saw that small pieces of dirt often get trapped inside the roots and stones, so tightly that water can’t wash them away even after a long time. From one small patch of dirt stuck in an oak tree’s roots, three different kinds of plants grew. I’m sure this is true. Also, dead birds floating on the sea sometimes don’t get eaten right away, and seeds inside their crops can stay alive for a long time. For example, peas and vetches die if soaked in seawater for a few days, but seeds taken from a pigeon’s crop that floated in saltwater for 30 days almost all grew, which surprised me.

Living birds are probably really good at moving seeds around. I have lots of examples showing how birds can get blown by strong winds very far across the ocean. We can guess that in these situations, birds often fly at around 35 miles per hour, and some people say they fly even faster. I’ve never seen soft, tasty seeds survive going through a bird’s digestive system, but hard seeds from fruits can survive, even in a turkey’s stomach. Over two months, I collected 12 kinds of seeds from small birds’ droppings in my garden, and they looked fine. Some of these seeds even grew when I planted them. Here’s something important: the crop — a part of a bird’s body where it stores food — doesn’t have stomach acid, so it doesn’t hurt seeds at all. After a bird eats a lot of food, the seeds don’t all move into the stomach for 12 to 18 hours. During this time, a bird could easily be blown 500 miles away by the wind. Hawks often catch tired birds, and when these birds’ crops get torn open, the seeds inside can get spread around. A friend of Mr. Brent had to stop sending carrier pigeons from France to England because hawks near the English coast killed so many of them.

Some hawks and owls swallow their prey whole and then spit out pellets after 12 to 20 hours. Experiments at the zoo showed these pellets often have seeds that can still grow. Seeds like oat, wheat, millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet could still grow after spending 12 to 21 hours in the stomachs of birds of prey. Two beet seeds even grew after being in a bird’s stomach for over two days. Freshwater fish eat seeds from many land and water plants too. Since birds eat fish, seeds can move from place to place this way as well. I tested this by putting seeds into dead fish’s stomachs and then giving these fish to fishing eagles, storks, and pelicans. After some hours, these birds either spit out the seeds in pellets or passed them in their droppings, and many seeds could still grow. But some seeds always died from this process.
