As long as living conditions stay the same, we can believe that a change passed down for many generations can keep being passed down for a really long time. But we also know that new differences sometimes still appear, even in animals and plants that people have been raising for a very long time.

People don’t actually create these differences on purpose. Instead, they expose plants and animals to new environments without meaning to, and then nature causes the changes. But people can choose the changes that happen naturally and keep them, building up certain traits over time.

This way, people change animals and plants to help themselves or for fun. They might do this carefully or just by saving the ones that are most useful without thinking about changing the breed. It’s clear that by picking small differences in each generation—even ones that are hard to notice—they can greatly shape a breed. This selection process has been very important in making many different and useful breeds. Sometimes, it’s hard to tell if these breeds are just types of the same species or actually different species.

There’s no good reason why the same ideas that work with animals and plants at home wouldn’t work in nature. In nature, the survival of the fittest helps select who lives and who dies. Because all living things can make lots of babies, more are born than can survive. Even a tiny difference can decide which individuals live or die, and which species grow or disappear. Animals of the same species compete the most with each other, then different varieties of the same species compete, and then species in the same group compete. Sometimes, even very different animals compete. Any small advantage in survival or fitting into the environment can make a big difference.

For animals with males and females, males often fight to win mates. The strongest or best-adapted males usually have more babies. Success can also depend on having special weapons, defenses, or attractiveness. Even a small edge can mean winning.

Since the Earth has changed a lot over time, it makes sense that living things would have changed too, just like they do when people change them. If nature causes changes, it would be strange if natural selection didn’t happen. Some people say there’s only a limited amount of change in nature, but they can’t prove it. People can cause a lot of change quickly by choosing traits in domestic animals and plants, and everyone agrees that animals and plants in nature do have individual differences.
