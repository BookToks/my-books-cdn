I think there’s a good chance, like Andrew Knight suggested, that changes in living things might be partly caused by eating too much food.

It seems clear that living things need to live in new conditions for many generations before we see noticeable changes. Once these changes start, they usually keep happening for many generations. There’s no record of a plant or animal that stops changing when it’s been grown or raised by people. Even our oldest farm plants, like wheat, still produce new types. Our oldest domesticated animals can still be improved or changed quickly.

People argue about when these changes happen—whether it’s early or late in the embryo's development, or right at conception. Experiments by Geoffroy St. Hilaire show that messing with embryos can cause weird deformities, which are not very different from normal changes. But I think the main cause of changes might be that the male and female parts involved in reproduction get affected before conception. I believe this mostly because keeping animals or plants in captivity or farming conditions affects their ability to reproduce more than any other body part. It’s easy to tame an animal, but hard to get it to breed when it’s kept in captivity, even when males and females are together. Many animals won’t have babies even if they live a long time in captivity, which people often blame on messed-up instincts. But many farmed plants grow strong and healthy but rarely produce seeds! Sometimes tiny changes, like a bit more or less water at the right time, decide whether a plant makes seeds or not.

I have a lot of information on this strange topic, but here’s a quick example: meat-eating animals from tropical places usually breed fine in captivity here, except for bears and their relatives. But meat-eating birds almost never lay fertile eggs. Many foreign plants have pollen that is useless, just like sterile hybrids. So, while domesticated animals and plants might be weak or sick, they still breed well in captivity. But wild animals, even if tamed and healthy, can have their ability to reproduce messed up by things we don’t notice. So, it’s not surprising that when captivity does let them breed, their babies aren’t exactly like their parents and often show differences.

Sterility (not being able to have babies) is often seen as a big problem in gardening. But if this is true, then the same reasons that cause sterility also cause changes. And changes are what give us the best plants in the garden. Some animals, like rabbits and ferrets kept in cages, breed easily, showing their reproductive systems aren’t affected. Some plants and animals can handle being raised by people without changing much, maybe only a little more than in the wild.

Gardeners call “sporting plants” those that suddenly grow a new bud or branch that looks very different from the rest of the plant.
