Sheep’s horns aren’t as useful because they don’t always grow the same way. When sorting animals into groups, if we had a real family tree, everyone would probably want to use that to classify them. Some people have tried this before. Even if animals change a bit, their family background usually keeps similar types together.

For example, tumbler pigeons mostly have one habit—they tumble in the air. Some have longer beaks, but they’re still grouped together because they all share this tumbling behavior. One kind, the short-faced breed, doesn’t tumble much anymore, but it’s still grouped with the others because they’re related. If it was proven that the Hottentot people came from the Negro people, they would be put in the same group, even if they look different.

In nature, scientists always think about family when they group animals. They put males and females of the same species together, even if they look very different. For some creatures, males and hermaphrodites (which have both male and female parts) are so different that scientists know almost nothing they share, but they still don’t separate them. Scientists also group different life stages of the same animal, like larvae and adults, even if they look very different. They include odd or unusual animals and varieties, not just because they look like the parent, but because they come from it.

If someone thought the cowslip flower came from the primrose, they would put them in one species. When scientists found that three types of orchids sometimes grow on the same stalk, they put them as one species, even though they had been thought to be separate before. But what if it was proven that a kangaroo came from a bear after many changes? Should we put this kangaroo with bears? That sounds crazy. If we saw a perfect kangaroo born from a bear, we’d probably group it with bears. But then all kangaroos would have to be grouped with bears, which doesn’t make sense. This shows that animals that come from the same family usually look alike.

Since family ties have always been used to group animals, even when males, females, and young look very different, maybe the same idea has been used without people realizing it to group species into bigger groups like genera. But in these cases, the animals have changed more and it took longer. I think this is true. We don’t have family trees written down, so we try to figure out who’s related by looking at how they look. We pick features that probably didn’t change much because of their environment. Sometimes, parts that seem useless (like small leftover body parts) are just as important, or even more important, for figuring out relationships.
