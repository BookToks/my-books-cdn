We can guess that the bizcacha has kept more traits from its ancient ancestor than other rodents have. Because of this, it isn’t closely related to just one type of marsupial, but is kind of connected to almost all marsupials. This is because it has kept some features from the shared ancestor they all come from.

On the other hand, as Mr. Waterhouse said, the phascolomys looks most like rodents in general, not just one species. But this might just be because the phascolomys has adapted to live like rodents, so the similarities are more about lifestyle than family. The elder De Candolle noticed something similar in plants, where different groups can look alike because of how they live, not because they are closely related.

The idea is that species multiply and slowly change over time, keeping some traits from their common ancestor. This helps us understand why all members of the same family or bigger group are connected in very complicated ways. The original ancestor passed down some traits to all its descendants, but these changed in different ways and amounts. Because of this, species are related to each other by long, twisted family lines, like branches on a tree. Just like it’s hard to trace the family history of a big family without a family tree, it’s very hard for scientists to explain the relationships between many living and extinct species without drawing diagrams.

Extinction, which we talked about before, has been very important in creating and widening the gaps between different groups of animals. For example, whole classes like birds are different from all other vertebrates because many ancient forms that once linked birds and other animals have disappeared. There are fewer missing links between fishes and amphibians, and even fewer in groups like Crustacea, where very different forms are still connected by a long, though broken, chain of relationships. Extinction has separated groups but didn’t create them. If every creature that ever lived suddenly came back, it would be impossible to clearly define each group because they would blend together in tiny steps. Still, a natural order would exist.

We can see this using a diagram where letters A to L represent eleven ancient genera from the Silurian period. Some of these grew into big groups with many descendants. Imagine all the missing links between these groups and their original ancestor were still alive, and the differences between them were as small as between close varieties today. In this case, it would be impossible to clearly tell one group from another or from their ancestor. But the natural arrangement shown in the diagram would still make sense. Because of inheritance, all the forms that come from A, or from I, would share something in common.
