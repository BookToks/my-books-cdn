According to the idea of natural selection, all living things are connected to older parent species in their group. These parent species, which are mostly extinct now, were also connected to even older species. This goes back a long way, all leading to a common ancestor for each big group of animals. So, there must have been an incredibly large number of species that linked all living and extinct animals together. If this idea is true, all those species once lived on Earth.

Some people might argue that there hasn’t been enough time for all these changes to happen because evolution works very slowly through natural selection.

It’s hard to explain how much time has passed, especially to someone who hasn’t studied geology. If you read Sir Charles Lyell’s famous book on geology, which changed how science thinks about Earth, you’ll see that the past time periods were unbelievably long. But just reading the book isn’t enough. You have to spend years studying layers of rock and watching how the sea breaks down old rocks and makes new sediment to really understand how long time works.

It’s useful to walk along rocky coastlines and watch how the sea wears down the rocks. The tides only reach the cliffs twice a day for a short time, and waves only wear down rocks when they carry sand or pebbles. Pure water doesn’t do much to break rocks. Eventually, the base of the cliff gets worn away, big pieces fall off, and these pieces slowly get worn down into smaller rocks, then pebbles, sand, or mud. But sometimes you see big rounded rocks at the base of cliffs that don’t look very worn because they don’t get rolled around a lot. Also, if you follow a rocky coast for miles, you’ll notice that only small parts of the cliffs are currently being worn down. Other parts show signs that it’s been years since the water reached them.

People who study how the sea shapes coastlines realize that this process is very slow. Observations by Hugh Miller and Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill show just how slowly rocky coasts change.

With this in mind, look at thick layers of rock made of rounded pebbles, called conglomerates. These layers probably formed faster than some other deposits, but because the pebbles are worn and smooth, they show how slowly the whole layer built up. Remember Lyell’s important point: the thickness and size of these rock layers show how much the Earth’s surface has been worn down in other places.
