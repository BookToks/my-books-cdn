When animals or plants get buried in sand or gravel, they usually dissolve when rainwater soaks through after the ground rises. I think very few of the many animals living on the beach between high and low tide are ever preserved.

For example, many tiny creatures called Chthamalinae stick to rocks all over the world in huge numbers. They live right on the shore, except one kind in the Mediterranean Sea that lives deep underwater and has been found as a fossil in Sicily. But no other species have been found in old rocks from the Tertiary period. Still, we now know that the Chthamalus group existed way back in the chalk period. Another group called Chiton shows a similar pattern.

When it comes to land plants and animals from the Secondary and Palaeozoic periods, our fossil evidence is very incomplete. For example, no land snail shells are known from these times except one found by Sir C. Lyell in old rocks in North America. Looking at the list of fossil mammals in Lyell’s book shows how rare and random their preservation is. This isn’t surprising because many mammal bones from the Tertiary period come from caves or lake deposits, and no caves or lake beds from the Secondary or Palaeozoic times have been found.

The main reason the geological record is incomplete is because the rock layers are separated by long gaps of time. When we see these layers in books or in nature, it’s easy to think they happened one after the other without breaks. But studies like Sir R. Murchison’s work in Russia show there are big gaps between layers. The same is true in North America and other places. A geologist working only in one area might not guess that during the empty times in their region, lots of new sediments and life forms were building up somewhere else. Because it’s hard to know exactly how much time passed between layers anywhere, we believe long periods went by between each one. Changes in the minerals in rock layers also suggest big changes in the land and lots of time between them.

We can also understand why rock layers in each place are often broken up and not continuous. When I studied hundreds of miles of the South American coast, which has risen hundreds of feet recently, I noticed there aren’t any big new deposits that would last even a short geological time. Along the west coast, where unique sea animals live, there are hardly any thick Tertiary rock layers. So, no records of many different marine life forms will survive for a long time. If you think about it, this makes sense because even though a lot of sediment should be added from worn-down rocks and muddy rivers, no big recent or Tertiary formations are found along the rising western coast of South America.
