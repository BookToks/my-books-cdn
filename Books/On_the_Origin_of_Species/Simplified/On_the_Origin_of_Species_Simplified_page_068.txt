Whether or not plants change a lot to fit their environment, we have proof that some plants can get used to different temperatures over time. For example, pines and rhododendrons grown from seeds collected by Dr. Hooker at different heights in the Himalayas showed different abilities to handle cold when grown here. Mr. Thwaites saw similar things in Ceylon, and Mr. H. C. Watson noticed the same with European plants moved from the Azores to England.

For animals, there are real cases where species have spread from warmer to cooler places, and the other way around, in recent history. But we don’t really know if these animals were perfectly suited to their original climates or if they got used to their new ones. Usually, we assume animals are best adapted to where they come from, but we aren’t sure if they adjust fully when they move.

I think humans first picked domestic animals because they were useful and could breed easily in captivity, not because they could live in many climates. Still, these animals can live and have babies in very different climates, which shows that many wild animals could probably adapt to new places too. But we shouldn’t take this idea too far, because some domestic animals come from mixing wild species from very different places, like tropical and arctic wolves. Rats and mice aren’t really domestic, but humans have spread them worldwide, and now they live in many climates, from really cold places like the Faroe Islands to hot tropical islands. So, I believe that adapting to a new climate is mostly about having a flexible body that can handle changes, which many animals have. This explains why humans and their animals can live in so many places, and why extinct animals like some elephants and rhinoceroses once lived in ice-age climates even though their relatives today live in warm areas.

It’s hard to know how much animals and plants get used to a climate because of habit, natural selection, or both. I think habit matters, because farmers and old Chinese books often warn about moving animals to new places carefully. It’s unlikely humans created so many breeds perfectly suited to their regions; habit probably plays a big role. But natural selection also helps keep animals that are born better suited to a place.

In books about farming many plants, some types do better in certain climates than others. For example, in the U.S., some fruit tree kinds are recommended for the north and others for the south. Since these types are new, their differences can’t just be because of habit.
