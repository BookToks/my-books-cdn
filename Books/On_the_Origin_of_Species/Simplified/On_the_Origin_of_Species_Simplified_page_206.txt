Simple, unused, or unfinished organs are really common in nature. For example, male mammals usually have tiny, underdeveloped breasts. In birds, the "bastard-wing" is like a tiny, useless finger. Many snakes have one lung that is small and not fully grown, and some even have leftover parts of hips and back legs. Some examples are pretty strange, like baby whales having teeth before birth, but adults don’t have any teeth at all. Also, unborn calves have teeth under their gums that never come out. Even some baby birds have tiny teeth in their beaks. Wings are made for flying, but many insects have wings that are so small they can’t fly, and sometimes these wings are stuck under hard wing covers.

The meaning of these tiny, useless organs is usually clear. For example, some beetles look almost the same, but one has full wings while the other has only tiny, useless wing parts. This shows the tiny parts are just undeveloped wings. Sometimes these organs can still work but just don’t grow fully. For instance, male mammals sometimes develop breasts that can make milk. Also, cows usually have four big teats and two small ones, but sometimes the small ones grow and produce milk too. In plants, petals can be tiny or fully grown on the same kind of plant. Male flowers often have a tiny, unfinished female part. When these male plants are crossed with plants that have both sexes, the tiny female part grows bigger in the babies, proving that the tiny and full parts are basically the same.

An organ that does two jobs may lose one job but keep the other. In some plants, the pistil helps pollen reach seeds. It has a sticky part (stigma) on a stalk (style). But some male flowers have pistils without the sticky tip, so they can’t be fertilized. However, the style is still there and covered with hairs to help spread pollen. Sometimes, an organ stops doing its main job and starts doing something else. For example, some fish have a swim-bladder that no longer helps them float but has turned into a simple lung to help them breathe.

The size and development of these tiny organs can vary a lot even within the same species. Also, closely related species can have different levels of these tiny organs. For example, female moths in the same group can have wings that are more or less developed. Sometimes these organs disappear completely, meaning the animal or plant has no sign of an organ that other similar species have, but you might see it sometimes in unusual individuals. For example, snapdragons usually don’t have any sign of a fifth stamen (a part of the flower), but sometimes it appears. When scientists study body parts in different animals or plants, they often find these tiny or leftover parts, which help them understand how species are related.
