But things are actually quite different. Alph. De Candolle pointed out in his important book that when plants become naturalized—that is, when they start growing in a new place—they add more new groups of plants (called genera) than just new kinds of plants (species). For example, in the latest edition of Dr. Asa Gray's book about plants in the Northern United States, 260 naturalized plants are listed, and these belong to 162 different groups. This shows that these new plants are very different from each other. Also, out of those 162 groups, 100 groups are not originally from there, which means a lot of new plant groups have been added to the area.

By looking at the plants or animals that have managed to live successfully alongside the native ones and become naturalized, we can get a rough idea of how the native ones would have had to change to compete better. We can safely guess that having different body types or features—big enough to be in new groups—would have helped them.

The benefit of having different kinds of living things in the same place is like how different organs in your body have different jobs. Milne Edwards explained this well. For example, a stomach that is just for digesting plants or just for meat gets the most nutrition from those foods. Similarly, in any land, the more different the animals and plants are, the better they can live there. Groups of animals that are all very similar wouldn’t do as well as groups that are well-diversified. For example, the Australian marsupials don’t have many different types and only roughly match our groups of meat-eaters, plant-eaters, and rodents. Because of this, they might not compete well with those better-diversified groups. The Australian mammals show this early stage of becoming different.

After all this, which I could have explained more, we can say that the descendants of any species will do better if they become more different in their features. This helps them take over new places and roles. Now, let's see how this idea of benefiting from being different, combined with natural selection and extinction, works.

The diagram helps explain this confusing idea. Let’s say A to L are species in a big group of plants or animals common in one country. These species look alike but in different ways, as shown by the letters being at different distances in the diagram. I chose a big group because, as we learned earlier, more species in big groups change than those in small groups. Also, common species that spread widely change more than rare ones. Let’s pick (A), a common and widely spread species in a big group. The little fan of dotted lines coming from (A) shows its offspring that vary a little bit in different ways. These changes don’t all happen at once and don’t last the same amount of time.
