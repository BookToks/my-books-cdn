After looking at all the facts about crossing plants and animals, we can say that some level of infertility usually happens in first crosses and hybrids. But from what we know now, it’s not always true for every case.

Now, let’s look more closely at the rules about why first crosses and hybrids are often infertile. The main goal is to see if species were made this way on purpose to stop them from mixing completely. Most of these rules come from Gartner’s great work on plant hybrids. I also checked how these rules fit with animals, and even though we don’t know a lot about hybrid animals, it’s surprising how the same rules mostly apply to both plants and animals.

We’ve noticed that fertility in first crosses and hybrids can be anywhere from zero to fully fertile. It’s amazing how many different ways this happens, but here’s just a simple explanation. If pollen from a plant in one family lands on a plant from a totally different family, it’s like dust and does nothing. But if pollen comes from different species within the same genus, the number of seeds produced can range from almost none to almost full fertility. Sometimes, hybrids don’t produce any fertile seeds, not even with pollen from their parent species. Yet, some hybrids show the first signs of fertility, like their flowers wilting earlier, which means fertilization might be starting. From being totally infertile, some hybrids can self-fertilize and produce more and more seeds until they become fully fertile.

Hybrids from species that are very hard to cross usually have low fertility. But the idea that the harder it is to cross two species, the more infertile their hybrids are, isn’t always true. Sometimes, two species can cross easily and make many hybrids, but those hybrids are still very infertile. Other times, species that are very hard to cross make hybrids that are very fertile once they do cross. Even within the same genus, like Dianthus, both these cases happen.

The fertility of first crosses and hybrids is more easily affected by bad conditions than pure species. But fertility also changes naturally. It’s not always the same when you cross the same two species in the same way. It partly depends on the individual plants or animals used. The same goes for hybrids — their fertility can be very different even if they come from the same seed pod and live in the same conditions.
