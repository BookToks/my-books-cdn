The amount or value of differences between living things that are related to each other by blood can be very different. But their family tree stays true, not just now but at every step back in time. All the changed descendants from A will share something from their common parent, and the same goes for all descendants from I. This is true for every smaller branch of descendants at each step in time. 

If we imagine that some descendants from A or I have changed so much that they no longer show signs of their parents, then their places in natural grouping will be lost—this has happened sometimes with animals or plants today. All the descendants of the group F, along their whole family line, are thought to have changed very little, so they still form one group. Even though this group is quite separate, it still fits in the right middle position because F was originally between A and I in traits. The groups that came from A and I still have some of their characteristics. 

This natural order is shown in a simple diagram, but it’s much too simple. If we just wrote the group names in a straight line, it would be even harder to show the true natural order. It’s well known that you can’t show the connections between living things in a flat line on paper. So, the natural system is like a family tree, showing how groups are related. The differences between groups are shown by putting them into different categories like genera, families, orders, and classes.

To explain this idea, think about languages. If we had a perfect family tree of humans, grouping languages by how people are related would be the best way to classify all the languages in the world. If we included all extinct languages and all dialects that changed slowly, this family tree would be the only way to arrange them. Some old languages might have changed very little and created few new languages. Others, because of how people spread out and lived in different places, changed a lot and created many new languages and dialects. The differences between languages from the same root would be shown by smaller groups inside bigger groups. This family tree way of grouping is natural because it connects all languages, dead and alive, by how close they are and shows where each language came from.

To support this idea, let’s look at how varieties are classified. Varieties are groups that come from one species. They are grouped under species, and smaller groups under varieties. With domestic animals or plants, even more levels of difference are needed, like with pigeons. The reason for having groups inside groups is the same for varieties and species—it’s because of close family relationships and different amounts of change. Scientists use almost the same rules for grouping varieties as they do for species. People say it’s important to group varieties naturally and not by random features. For example, you shouldn’t group two types of pineapples just because their fruit looks alike. And no one groups Swedish and common turnips together, even though their stems look similar. The part of the plant or animal that stays most the same is used for grouping. For example, the farmer Marshall said horns are very useful for classifying cattle because they don’t change as much as the shape or color of the body.
