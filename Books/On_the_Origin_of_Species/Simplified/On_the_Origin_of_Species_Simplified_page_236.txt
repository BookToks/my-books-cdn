Scientists studied many things about nature and animals. Dr. P. looked at how traits are passed from parents to children. Lund and Clausen studied old fossils in Brazil. Sir Charles Lyell talked about how animals compete to survive and how the Earth has changed over time. He also measured how much land has worn away, studied old land snails, fossil whales, and layers of rocks older than the Silurian system.

Lyell explained that the fossil record is incomplete and talked about how species first appeared. He studied Barrande's fossil colonies and the old rock layers in Europe and North America. He noticed that similar rock layers appeared in different places and explained how seeds can travel on icebergs. He also talked about big changes in climate and how freshwater shells are spread out, including land snails from Madeira.

Lyell and Dawson found fossilized trees in Nova Scotia. Macleay studied similar traits in animals and plants from Madeira, including wingless beetles and fossil land snails. They also looked at birds and found that magpies can be tamed in Norway. Scientists studied maize that was crossed with other plants and compared animals from the Malay Archipelago with those in Europe.

They researched mammals and their tiny, leftover body parts, like rudimentary nails on manatees. Fossil marsupials from Australia were found, and scientists looked at marten animals too. They also studied the origin of human races and early island people.
