So, I think a clearly different variety can be called an early stage of a new species. But whether this is true depends on the overall facts and ideas I talk about in this book.

Not all varieties or early species actually become full species.

Some might die out while still in this early stage, or they might stay as just varieties for a very long time. For example, Mr. Wollaston showed this with certain old land-shells in Madeira. If a variety grows so much that it has more members than the original species, it could become the new species, and the old one would be the variety. Or it might replace and wipe out the original species. Or both could live together and be seen as separate species. We will talk more about this later.

From what I said, you can see that I think the word “species” is just a name we give to a group of individuals that look very similar. It’s not very different from the word “variety,” which we use for groups that are a bit less different and change more.

The word “variety,” compared to just normal individual differences, is also used just for convenience.

Based on ideas, I thought I could learn interesting things about species that change the most by listing all the varieties in certain well-studied plant groups. At first, this seemed easy. But Mr. H. C. Watson, who gave me a lot of helpful advice, soon showed me it was quite hard. Later, Dr. Hooker agreed, even more strongly. I will save the detailed talk about these problems and the lists of how many species vary for another book. Dr. Hooker said after reading my work and looking at the lists, he thinks some of my points are pretty well proven. But the whole topic is confusing and involves ideas like the “struggle for existence” and “divergence of character,” which we will discuss later.

Alph. De Candolle and others showed that plants found in many places usually have varieties. This makes sense because they face different environments and compete with different living things (and this competition is very important, as we will see). But my lists also show that in any small area, the species that are most common—meaning they have the most individuals—and the species that are spread out the most within that area (which is different from being found in many places and from just being common) often have noticeable varieties recorded in plant books. So, the species that do best, or that are “dominant”—those found all over the world, spread out widely in their own country, and very numerous—are the ones that most often produce clear varieties, or early new species. This might have been expected because for varieties to last, they have to compete with other living things. The species that are already dominant are more likely to have offspring that are slightly changed but still have the advantages that helped their parents become dominant.
