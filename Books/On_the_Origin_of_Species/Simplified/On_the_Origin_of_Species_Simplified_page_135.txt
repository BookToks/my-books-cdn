The reason is that the deposits near the shore and just below it are always being worn away as the land slowly rises and the waves constantly hit them.

I think we can safely say that sediment has to pile up very thick and solid to survive the constant wave action when the land first rises and moves up and down afterward. These thick piles of sediment can form in two ways. First, deep in the sea, where, based on E. Forbes’s studies, very few animals live, so the sediment won’t show a good picture of life back then. Or second, sediment can build up thick over shallow water if the sea floor slowly sinks. If the sinking and the sediment coming in balance out, the sea stays shallow and good for life, so a thick fossil-rich layer can form that can survive being exposed later.

I’m sure that all the old fossil-rich layers were made this way, during sinking. Since I shared these ideas in 1845, I’ve watched geology grow and seen many experts agree that big formations were made during sinking. For example, the only big ancient formation on the west coast of South America that has lasted so far was made while the land was sinking, which helped it get thick.

All geological evidence shows that land areas have gone through many slow ups and downs, and these changes affected large areas. So, fossil-rich layers that are thick and big enough to survive later wear may have formed over wide areas during sinking, but only if enough sediment was coming in to keep the sea shallow and protect the remains before they decayed. If the sea floor stayed still, thick layers couldn’t form in shallow parts, where life is best. Even less could happen during times when the land rose, because any layers formed then would get worn away by waves.

Because of this, the geological record will have gaps. I trust these ideas because they match the principles taught by Sir C. Lyell, and E. Forbes came to a similar conclusion on his own.

One more thing to notice: when the land rises, the land area and nearby shallow seas get bigger, creating new places where new species can form. But during these times, the geological record usually has gaps. On the other hand, when the land sinks, the living area and the number of animals go down (except near coasts when islands form), so although many species die out, fewer new ones appear. And it’s during these sinking times that the big fossil-rich layers formed.
