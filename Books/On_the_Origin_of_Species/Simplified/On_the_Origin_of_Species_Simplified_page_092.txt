Sometimes, two very different species have the same strange body part. Even though the part looks and works the same, there is usually a basic difference between them. I think this happened kind of like when two people invent the same thing by accident. Natural selection, which helps each living thing survive by using small changes, has sometimes changed parts in two species in almost the same way. These species don’t share much from a common ancestor.

It’s often hard to guess how a body part changed step by step to become what it is now. But since we know only a few living and extinct species, I’m surprised that almost every organ has some known stages showing its changes. This idea matches an old rule in nature: “Nature doesn’t make sudden jumps.” Many scientists agree with this, saying nature creates lots of variety but makes few big changes quickly. If you believe in creation, why would this happen?

Why do so many different living things, each made separately for their place in nature, have parts that change gradually from one form to another? Why doesn’t nature just jump from one structure to a totally different one? Natural selection explains this well. It can only work by using small, step-by-step changes. It can’t skip steps and must move slowly.

Sometimes, it’s hard to understand how simple body parts began if they don’t seem important enough to help survival. I’ve had a hard time with this, just like I did when thinking about something as complicated as the eye.

First, we don’t know enough about how a living thing’s whole body works to say which small changes matter. In an earlier chapter, I gave examples of tiny features, like fuzz on fruit or the color of flesh, that might help avoid insect attacks or link to other body differences. The giraffe’s tail looks like a tool made to swat flies. It seems unbelievable that it could have slowly changed to do this important but small job better and better. But we should be careful before saying it can’t be true. In South America, where animals live and spread depends on how well they fight off insects. Animals that can protect themselves from bugs can move into new areas and have an advantage. Flies don’t usually kill big animals, but they bother them constantly, making them weaker and more likely to get sick, starve, or be caught by predators.
