When a species has a super-developed body part and then gives rise to many changed offspring—which I think takes a very long time—natural selection can make that body part stay the same, no matter how unusual it is. Species that come from the same parent and live in similar conditions will tend to have similar changes, and sometimes they might even go back to traits their old ancestors had. Even though going back or having similar changes might not create totally new features, these changes still add to the amazing variety we see in nature.

No matter what causes small differences between parents and their babies—and there must be a reason for each difference—it’s the slow build-up of these differences through natural selection, when they help the animal survive, that causes big changes in body parts. This is how the countless living things on Earth fight to survive, and the ones best suited to their environment win out.

Chapter VI: Problems with the Theory

Before getting deeper into my work, you might have thought of a bunch of problems. Some are really hard, and I still get confused about them sometimes. But I think most are just seem that way, and the real problems don’t completely break my theory.

These problems can be grouped like this: First, if species slowly changed from other species step by step, why don’t we see tons of in-between forms everywhere? Why is nature not a big mess, but instead species look clear and different?

Second, can we believe that an animal like a bat, with its special body and habits, could have come from an animal that acted totally different? Can natural selection really make both small things, like a giraffe’s tail used to swat flies, and amazing, perfect things, like the eye, which we still don’t fully understand?
