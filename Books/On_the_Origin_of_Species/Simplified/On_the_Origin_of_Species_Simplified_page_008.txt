In the next chapter, I will talk about the complicated and not well-known rules about how living things change and how their growth is connected. Then, in the next four chapters, I will explain some of the biggest problems with the theory. These include: first, how simple creatures or body parts can change and develop into more complex ones; second, the idea of Instinct, or how animals think and act; third, Hybridism, which is about why some species can't have babies together while others can; and fourth, why the fossil record is incomplete.

After that, I will look at how living things have appeared over time in the Earth's layers of rock. Then in chapters eleven and twelve, I will explore where living things are found around the world. In chapter thirteen, I will talk about how different species are related to each other, both as adults and when they are embryos. In the last chapter, I will quickly review everything and share some final thoughts.

No one should be surprised that we don’t understand everything about how species and varieties started, especially since we don’t know much about how all living things around us are connected. For example, why does one species live in many places and have lots of members, while a similar species lives in only one place and is rare? These connections are very important because they affect how well living things survive now and in the future.

We know even less about how living things were related in the past, during different times in Earth’s history. Even though many things are still unclear and will stay that way for a long time, I am sure after careful study that the common idea—that each species was created separately—is wrong. I believe species can change over time. Species that belong to the same group come from older species that are now extinct, just like different types of one species come from that original species. I also believe natural selection has been the main way species change, though not the only way.

Chapter I talks about Variation under Domestication. It covers why living things vary, how habits affect them, how growth is connected, how traits are passed down, the features of domestic varieties, how hard it is to tell varieties from species, and how domestic varieties come from one or more species. It also discusses domestic pigeons—their differences and origins—and the old practice of selection, both careful and accidental, and how humans’ power to select has helped create domestic animals and plants.

When we look at plants and animals that people have raised for a long time, we notice that individuals of the same variety can be very different from each other—more different than wild species or varieties. Thinking about the huge variety of plants and animals that have been farmed or bred in many different places and conditions, it seems clear that this bigger difference happens because domestic animals and plants live in less consistent and different conditions than their wild ancestors did.
