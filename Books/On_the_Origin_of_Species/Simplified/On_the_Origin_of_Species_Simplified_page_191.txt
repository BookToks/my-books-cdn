Small details used for sorting things out are important mainly because they connect with other more important features. When you look at many features together, their value becomes clear in studying nature. That’s why a species can be different from its relatives in both big and small ways, but we still know where it fits in.

Also, using just one feature to classify something never works well because no part of an organism is always the same. The idea of looking at many small features, even if none seem important alone, helps explain a saying by Linnaeus: the group doesn’t give the features, but the features show the group. This means small similarities matter, even if they’re hard to describe.

Some plants have both perfect and weaker flowers. In the weaker flowers, many features that usually help us classify plants disappear, which can confuse our system. But even when a plant called Aspicarpa only made these weaker flowers in France for years, smart scientists still kept it in the same plant family. This example shows how classification sometimes needs to be flexible.

When scientists work, they don’t worry much about how important a feature is for the organism’s life. If a feature is almost always the same in many forms and not in others, they use it as a strong clue. If it’s less common, they treat it as less important. Many scientists agree with this idea, including a great botanist named Aug. St. Hilaire.

If some features always come with others, even if we don’t know why, they are considered very important. For most animals, big organs like those for moving blood or breathing are usually the same, so they help a lot in sorting animals. But in some groups, even these important organs don’t help much with classification.

We understand why features from embryos are as important as those from adults, since classification includes all life stages. But it’s not obvious why embryo features should matter more than adult ones, since adults live and do all the important things. Still, famous scientists like Milne Edwards and Agassiz said embryo features are the most important for classifying animals, and many agree.

The same is true for flowering plants. Their two main groups are based on embryo features, like the number and place of their first leaves, and how parts of the embryo grow. Later, when we study embryos more, we’ll see why these features are so useful, especially if we think about how species descend from ancestors.
