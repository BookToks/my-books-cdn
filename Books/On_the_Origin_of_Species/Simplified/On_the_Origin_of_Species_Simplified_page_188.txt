Lower members of each group usually change less over time and space than higher members, but there are some clear exceptions. According to my idea, these relationships over time and space make sense. Whether we look at life forms that changed in the same area over time or those that changed after moving to faraway places, the forms within each group are connected by family ties. The closer two forms are related, the closer they usually are in time and place. In both cases, the rules of change are the same, and changes have happened through natural selection.

From the very start of life, all living things look alike in different degrees, so they can be sorted into groups within groups. This sorting is not random like grouping stars into constellations. Groups would be simple if one group only lived on land and another only in water, or if one ate meat and another plants. But in nature, even close relatives often have very different habits.

In earlier chapters, I tried to explain that common, widespread species in bigger groups tend to change the most. These new varieties or early new species eventually turn into distinct new species. These new species then tend to produce other new and common species. So, the big groups with many common species usually keep growing bigger.

I also showed that the descendants of each species try to live in many different ways, which causes their traits to become more different over time. This idea is supported by how many different life forms compete in a small area and by facts about species moving to new places.

I also explained that the forms that increase in number and become more different tend to replace and wipe out the less changed, less improved, older forms. If you look at the diagram I mentioned before, you can see that the result is the descendants of one ancestor breaking into groups within groups.
