If we knew how fast the sea usually wears away a cliff of any height, we could figure out how long it took to wear down the Weald. We can’t really know for sure, but to get an idea, we can guess that the sea eats into cliffs 500 feet high by about one inch every hundred years. This might seem too slow at first, but it’s like saying a cliff one yard high would be worn back one yard every twenty-two years along the coast. 

I don’t think any rock, even soft ones like chalk, would wear down that fast except on very exposed coasts. Taller cliffs might break faster because of falling pieces, but I also don’t think any coastline ten or twenty miles long wears away all at once. Plus, most rock layers have harder parts that protect the base like a natural breakwater. So, assuming a cliff 500 feet high wears away one inch per century along its full length is a safe guess. At that speed, wearing down the Weald would have taken about 306 million years.

Fresh water on the gently sloping Wealden area probably didn’t wear it down much when it was raised, so this might make the time a little less. But since the land has gone up and down many times, it may have been above water for millions of years, safe from the sea’s action, and under water for long times too, safe from waves. So, it probably took even longer than 300 million years since the late Secondary period.

I’m talking about this because it’s really important to get some idea, even if it’s rough, of how many years have passed. During all those years, life has lived everywhere on land and in water. So many generations have come and gone — more than we can imagine! But when you look at the best geology museums, the fossil collections seem so small compared to all that life.

Our fossil collections are very incomplete, and everyone agrees on that. The expert Edward Forbes said many fossil species are known from just one or a few broken pieces found in one place. Only a small part of the earth has been carefully studied by geologists, and new discoveries keep happening every year in Europe. Soft creatures can’t be preserved as fossils. Even shells and bones can disappear if they lie on the sea bottom where no sediment covers them. I think we often wrongly assume that sediment is being laid down fast enough all over the ocean floor to bury and save fossils. But in many parts of the ocean, the clear blue water shows that it’s very clean.

There are many examples where one layer of rock lies on top of another, with a huge time gap between them, and the bottom layer hasn’t been worn down at all. This makes sense only if the sea floor sometimes stays unchanged for very long periods.
