We have seen that common species, which live in many places and belong to big groups, change the most. These species pass on their advantages to their offspring, helping them survive and be strong in their own areas. Natural selection, as mentioned before, causes species to become different from each other and leads to the disappearance of less successful or in-between forms of life. Using these ideas, I think we can explain how all living things are related.

It's amazing, though we often forget it because we see it all the time, that all animals and plants are connected in groups within groups. For example, varieties of the same species are closely related, species in the same genus are less closely related, and so on, forming bigger groups like families and classes. These groups donâ€™t just line up in a row but form clusters around points, which cluster around other points, and so on. If each species had been created separately, this would be hard to explain. But inheritance and natural selection, with extinction and changes over time, help explain it well.

People have compared the relationships of all living things in a class to a big tree. I think this is a good way to understand it. The green twigs on the tree show species alive today, and the older twigs that grew in past years represent species that have died out. Each year, all the twigs try to grow and spread out, competing to survive, just like species do in nature. The big branches split into smaller branches, just like groups of species split into smaller groups. When the tree was small, those big branches were just little twigs. This shows how all species, living and extinct, are connected in groups within groups. Many twigs that grew when the tree was just a bush have died off. Now, only a few big branches remain, bearing all the smaller branches. This is like how only a few species from long ago have living descendants today.

Since the tree started growing, many branches have died and fallen off. These lost branches represent groups of species that no longer exist and are known only from fossils. Sometimes, a small, weak branch grows low on the tree but survives and stays alive at the top. This is like animals such as the platypus or lungfish, which link two big groups of life and have survived because they live in safe places. Just like buds grow into new buds and stronger branches grow faster, the Tree of Life has grown over time, filling the earth with many dead and broken branches and covering it with beautiful, spreading branches.

Chapter V talks about how species change. It explains how outside conditions, using or not using parts of the body, and natural selection affect change. It covers how flying and seeing organs develop, how animals get used to new places, how growth is connected, how some changes balance others, and how some parts change together by mistake. It also talks about how simple or leftover body parts change a lot, how unusual parts change a lot, how specific differences change more than general ones, how male and female differences change, how species in the same group change in similar ways, and how some traits from long ago can come back. The chapter ends with a summary of these ideas.
