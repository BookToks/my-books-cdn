I’m not sure how low this fighting behavior goes in nature, but male alligators have been seen fighting, making loud noises, and spinning around like dancers in a battle, all to win over females. Male salmons have been watched fighting all day, and male stag-beetles often have scars from battles with other males. Fighting seems to be toughest between males of animals that have many mates, and these males often have special weapons. Carnivorous males already have strong weapons, but some animals get extra features through sexual selection, like the lion’s mane, the boar’s shoulder pads, or the hooked jaw of a male salmon. Sometimes, having a good shield is just as important as having a sword or spear to win.

With birds, the competition is usually more peaceful. Many people who study birds believe that male birds compete hard by singing to attract females. Birds like the rock-thrush from Guiana and birds of paradise gather in groups where males show off their bright feathers and do weird dances. The females watch and then pick the most attractive male. People who keep birds know that birds can have their own likes and dislikes. For example, Sir R. Heron wrote about one pied peacock that all the female birds liked the most. It might seem silly to think that these small things matter, but if humans can make their pet chickens look fancy by choosing certain traits, then it’s easy to believe that female birds picking the best singers or prettiest males over many generations can make a big difference.

I also think that some rules about the feathers of male and female birds, compared to young birds, can be explained by sexual selection. This happens when birds change their feathers at breeding age or during breeding season. These changes are then passed down, sometimes only to males or to both males and females. But I don’t have space to explain this more here.

So, I believe that when male and female animals live the same way but look different in color, shape, or decorations, these differences mostly come from sexual selection. This means that over many generations, some males had small advantages in weapons, defense, or charms, and passed those on to their sons. But I don’t think all differences between males and females come from this. For example, male domestic animals sometimes have strange features like wattles or horn-like bumps that don’t seem helpful in fighting or attractive to females. We see similar things in nature, like the tuft of hair on the turkey’s chest, which doesn’t seem useful or pretty. If this tuft appeared in a pet turkey, people would probably think it was strange.

To explain how natural selection works, I’ll give a made-up example. Imagine a wolf that hunts many animals. Some prey are caught by being sneaky, some by strength, and some by speed. Now, imagine that the fastest prey, like deer, have become more common, or other prey have become less common, during the time when the wolf really needs food.
