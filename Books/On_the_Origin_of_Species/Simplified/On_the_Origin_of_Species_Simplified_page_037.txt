Climate mostly works indirectly by helping some species more than others. We can see this in the many plants in our gardens that can survive our weather but never become wild here because they can’t compete with native plants or survive attacks from native animals.

When a species suddenly grows a lot in a small area, often disease outbreaks happen—at least this seems true for game animals. This disease acts as a limit besides the usual survival struggle. Sometimes, these outbreaks are caused by parasitic worms that spread more easily when animals are crowded. This creates a kind of fight between the parasite and its host.

On the other hand, some species need to have a big population compared to their enemies to survive. For example, we can grow lots of corn and rape-seed because there are way more seeds than birds that eat them. The birds don’t grow in numbers as fast as the seeds because they face other problems in winter. But if you try to get seeds from just a few wheat plants in a garden, it’s very hard—I have lost all my seeds that way. This idea explains why rare plants can be very common in the few places they grow, and why some social plants live in groups, even at the edges of where they can survive. In these cases, many plants living together help protect each other from dying out. Also, mixing genes often helps plants stay healthy, while close breeding can hurt them, but that’s a complicated topic I won’t get into now.

Many examples show how complicated and surprising the relationships and struggles between living things in the same area can be. I’ll give one simple example that interested me. In Staffordshire, on a relative’s land, there was a large, very poor heath (open land) that had never been changed by people. But 25 years earlier, a similar area had been fenced and planted with Scotch pine trees. The plants in the planted area changed a lot—more than you usually see when moving to a different soil type. Not only were the types of heath plants different, but twelve kinds of plants grew there that weren’t found on the untouched heath. The effect on insects was even bigger because six kinds of insect-eating birds were common in the plantations but not on the heath, which had only two or three kinds of such birds. This shows how powerful just planting one kind of tree can be, especially since the land was fenced to keep cattle out. I also saw how important fencing is near Farnham, Surrey.

There, large heaths have a few old Scotch pines on the hills. In the last ten years, big areas have been fenced, and many young fir trees have started growing on their own, so close together that they can’t all survive.
