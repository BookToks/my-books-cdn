If we accept that the geological record is very incomplete, then what we do have actually supports the idea that species change over time. New species have appeared slowly, one after another. Different groups of animals or plants change at different speeds over the same amount of time. The fact that some species and even whole groups have died out fits with natural selection because older, less fit forms get replaced by newer, better ones. Once a species or group goes extinct, it doesn’t come back. Over a long time, dominant species spread out and slowly change, making it look like many species changed all at once around the world. Fossils found in layers between older and newer layers show traits that are in between the two, which makes sense because they are part of a chain of descent. All extinct animals and plants fit into the same system as living ones because they share common ancestors. Since groups that come from one ancestor tend to become different over time, the oldest fossils usually show traits that are between those of modern groups.

People often think recent species are "better" or more advanced than extinct ones because newer species have usually outcompeted older ones. Also, certain groups of animals have lasted a long time in the same place—like marsupials in Australia or edentates in America—because both the living and extinct species there come from the same ancestors.

When we look at where animals and plants live, we can understand a lot by thinking about how species moved around the world over millions of years. Changes in climate and geography, plus other ways species spread, explain why there are patterns in where species live now and where their fossils are found. This is because all living things are connected by descent, and their changes happen in similar ways.

It’s amazing that on the same continent, no matter how different the environment—hot or cold, mountains or lowlands, deserts or swamps—most animals in each big group are clearly related. This happens because they mostly come from the same early ancestors and settlers. Using this idea, plus times like the Ice Age, we can explain why some plants and animals on faraway mountains or in very different climates are closely related. We also see close links between sea creatures in the northern and southern temperate zones, even though they are separated by the tropical ocean. Even if two places have similar environments, their animals and plants can be very different if they have been separated for a long time. This is because the relationships between living things matter most, and since each place got its species from different sources at different times, the species there changed in their own unique ways.
