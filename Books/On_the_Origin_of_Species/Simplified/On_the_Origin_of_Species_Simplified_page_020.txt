If someone has these talents, studies their subject for many years, and works on it with strong determination their whole life, they will succeed and might make big improvements. But if they don’t have these talents, they will definitely fail. Most people wouldn’t believe how much natural ability and practice it takes just to become good at something like keeping pigeons.

The same ideas apply to plant growers, but changes in plants can happen more quickly.

No one thinks our best plants came from just one change from wild plants. We have proof this isn’t true in some cases where records were kept. For example, the common gooseberry has gotten bigger over time. Many flowers have improved a lot in just the last 20 or 30 years, if you compare them to old drawings.

Once a group of plants is well established, seed growers don’t pick only the best plants but remove the “rogues,” or plants that don’t match the standard. Animal breeders do something similar because very few people let their worst animals have babies.

You can also see the effects of selection by comparing how different flowers are in various types of the same plant species in gardens. Look at how different the leaves, pods, or fruits are in kitchen gardens and orchards compared to the flowers and leaves. For example, cabbage leaves look very different, but their flowers look very similar. Heartsease flowers are very different, but their leaves look alike. Gooseberries have fruit that differ a lot in size, color, shape, and hairiness, but their flowers don’t change much. Usually, varieties that differ a lot in one way also show small differences in others, because of how growth is connected. But mostly, picking small differences in leaves, flowers, or fruits over time creates groups that mainly differ in those parts.

Some people might say that selection has only been used as a careful method for about 75 years. It’s true that people have paid more attention to it recently and many books have been written about it. The results have been fast and important. But the idea isn’t new. I can show examples from very old books that understood how important it is. Long ago, people in England imported good animals and made laws to stop exporting them. They even ordered small horses to be killed, which is like removing bad plants. Ancient Chinese books also clearly explain selection.

Some Roman writers gave clear rules about it. The Bible shows that people cared about the color of animals long ago. Even today, some tribes cross their dogs with wild animals to improve them, and they did this in the past too, as Pliny wrote. Some African tribes match the color of their work cattle or dog teams. Livingstone reported that African tribes who hadn’t met Europeans still valued good animal breeds. These examples may not always show actual selection, but they prove people have been careful with breeding animals since ancient times, even among the simplest societies.
