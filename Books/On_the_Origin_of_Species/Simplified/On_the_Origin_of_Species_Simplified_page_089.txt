Among all animals with backbones, the eyes don’t show much change in how they are built, and fossils don’t tell us much about how eyes first developed. To find the earliest steps in how eyes got better, we would probably need to look way deeper in the fossil record than we have now.

In animals with jointed legs, like insects and crabs, we can start with a really simple eye—just a nerve covered with pigment and nothing else. From this simple start, many different kinds of eyes have developed along two main paths, getting more complex over time. For example, some crabs have eyes with two clear layers, and the inner layer is divided into little sections, each with a lens shape. Other crabs have clear cone-shaped parts covered with pigment that help focus light, and these cones are shaped to help make the image clearer. At the bottom of these cones, there seems to be a jelly-like substance. These examples show that crustacean eyes are very different but also have many steps between simple and complex. Since most animals that ever lived are now extinct, it’s not hard to believe that natural selection turned a simple nerve with pigment into a good eye, just like many other body parts have evolved.

If someone agrees with this so far, and sees that many strange facts about animals make sense with the idea of evolution, they shouldn’t be afraid to believe that even a perfect eye, like an eagle’s, could have formed by natural selection—even if we don’t know every step that led there. Logic should be stronger than imagination here, though it’s normal to find this idea hard to accept at first.

It’s hard not to compare the eye to a telescope. We know telescopes got better because smart people worked on them for a long time. So, it seems natural to think the eye developed in a similar way. But maybe that’s making a big assumption. Do we have the right to think the Creator works like humans do? If we compare the eye to a tool, we should imagine a thick clear layer with a light-sensitive nerve under it. Then imagine this layer slowly changing in thickness and density, forming different layers at different distances, with their surfaces changing shape over time. Also, imagine there’s a force carefully watching every tiny change in these layers, choosing the changes that make the image clearer. Each new version would be copied millions of times, the old versions would disappear, and the best would survive. In living things, small changes happen naturally, many copies are made each generation, and natural selection picks the best improvements perfectly.

If this process goes on for millions and millions of years, and happens in millions of animals every year, isn’t it possible that a living eye could become even better than a glass telescope? In the same way, the Creator’s work is far greater than anything humans can make.
