You might wonder how small differences in animals or plants, which I call "incipient species," eventually turn into completely separate species. These new species often look much more different from each other than the small variations within one species. How do groups of species, which make up different "genera" and are even more different from each other, come about? All of this happens because of the struggle for life.

Because of this struggle, any small change that helps an individual survive in its complicated environment is likely to be passed down to its children. These children then have a better chance of living, since only a few individuals survive out of many born. I call this idea Natural Selection, which is like how people breed animals or plants, but it happens naturally. Humans can cause big changes by choosing useful traits, but Natural Selection is much stronger and works all the time, way beyond what people can do.

Now, let’s talk more about this struggle for existence. I will explain it more in my future work because it’s a big topic. Some scientists, like De Candolle and Lyell, have shown that all living things face tough competition. For plants, W. Herbert, who knows a lot about gardening, has explained this very well.

It’s easy to agree that all life struggles to survive, but it’s hard to always remember this fact. If you don’t really understand this struggle, you won’t fully get why animals and plants live where they do, why some are rare or common, why some die out, or why they change over time.

Nature looks happy and full of life. We see plenty of food and hear birds singing, but we often forget that these birds eat insects or seeds, so they are killing other life. We also forget that many of these birds, their eggs, and baby birds are eaten by other animals. Food might be plenty now, but it’s not always that way every season.

When I say "Struggle for Existence," I mean more than just fighting to live. It includes how one living thing depends on another and, most importantly, how well it can have babies that survive. For example, two dogs might fight for food when it’s scarce. A plant near a desert struggles against drought, but really it depends on water. A plant that makes a thousand seeds but only one grows up is really competing with other plants nearby. Mistletoe depends on apple trees but doesn’t exactly fight with them because too many mistletoes can kill the tree. However, many mistletoes growing close together on one branch do compete with each other.
