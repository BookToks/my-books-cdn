If a country had open borders, new kinds of animals and plants would definitely move in, and this would cause problems for some of the original creatures living there. Remember how one new tree or animal can change things a lot. But if the country is like an island or partly surrounded by barriers, new and better-suited species can’t easily get in. In that case, there would be empty spots in nature’s balance that could be better filled if some of the original animals or plants changed a bit. If the place was open, other species would take those spots.

Over time, small changes that help some individuals survive better in their environment would stick around. This is natural selection, which helps improve species.

We think that when life conditions change, it can affect how much creatures vary or change, especially in how they reproduce. If the environment changes, it helps natural selection by making useful changes more likely. Without helpful changes, natural selection can’t work. But it doesn’t need huge changes or strict isolation to create chances for natural selection to improve species. Even tiny changes in an animal’s body or habits can give it an advantage over others. These small improvements can add up and make a big difference.

No country’s animals and plants are perfectly matched to their environment; some have already been outcompeted by newcomers. Since new species can take over, it means the original species could have improved to resist them better.

Humans have made big changes in animals and plants by choosing certain traits, so imagine what nature can do! Humans only pick visible traits and for their own benefit, while nature doesn’t care about looks but only what helps the creature survive. Nature can change every part of a living thing, inside and out. Humans keep different kinds of animals in the same place and don’t always use their chosen traits well. For example, humans feed animals with different beak sizes the same food and don’t train animals with different body types in special ways.

Humans don’t let the strongest males compete freely for mates. They don’t kill all the weaker animals and try to protect all their animals through tough seasons. Sometimes humans start breeding from odd-looking animals or from ones with noticeable traits they find useful.
