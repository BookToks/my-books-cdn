Mr. Blyth, who knows a lot about many things, thinks that all kinds of chickens come from the same wild Indian bird called Gallus bankiva. For ducks and rabbits, which look very different from each other, I believe they all come from the common wild duck and wild rabbit.

Some people have taken the idea that different domestic animals come from different wild ancestors too far. They think every breed that looks a bit different must have had its own wild ancestor. If that were true, there would have been many wild types of cattle, sheep, and goats in Europe, even in Great Britain. One writer even said there used to be eleven wild kinds of sheep just in Great Britain! But now, Britain hardly has any unique wild mammals, and countries like France and Germany have mostly the same animals. Yet, these countries have many different breeds of cattle and sheep. This means many domestic breeds probably started in Europe because there weren’t many wild types to come from. The same goes for India. 

When it comes to dogs, which probably come from several wild species, I’m sure there has been a lot of inherited change. Who would believe that wild dogs looked exactly like Italian greyhounds, bloodhounds, bulldogs, or Blenheim spaniels? These dog breeds look very different from wild dogs. Some say all dog breeds came from mixing a few wild species, but crossing animals usually creates offspring that are in between the parents. If that were true, then those extreme-looking breeds would have existed in the wild already. Also, making new breeds by crossing is not as easy as some think. Crossing two pure breeds might give similar offspring at first, but after a few generations, the puppies can look very different from each other. This makes creating a new, stable breed from two very different ones almost impossible without a lot of time and careful selection. No one has ever made a permanent breed this way.

About Domestic Pigeons — I think it’s best to study one group carefully, so I chose to study domestic pigeons. I’ve kept every breed I could find and have received pigeon skins from different parts of the world, especially from India and Persia, thanks to some generous friends.

There are many important books about pigeons in different languages, some written a long time ago. I’ve met many pigeon experts and joined two London Pigeon Clubs. The variety of pigeon breeds is amazing. For example, if you compare the English carrier pigeon with the short-faced tumbler, their beaks are very different, which also changes the shape of their skulls.
