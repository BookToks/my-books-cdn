So, according to the idea of descent with modification, the main facts about how extinct creatures are related to each other and to living ones make sense. And these facts can’t really be explained in any other way.

Because of this idea, it’s clear that the animals living during any big time period in Earth’s history will be kind of in-between the animals from before and after that time. For example, the species that lived at stage six in the diagram came from those at stage five, and they are the ancestors of those at stage seven. So, they usually have features that are between the earlier and later forms. But we also have to remember that some earlier species died out completely, new species moved in, and many changes happened during the long gaps between different time periods.

With these things in mind, the animals from each time period are definitely kind of in-between the animals from before and after. One example is when the Devonian fossils were first found. Scientists quickly noticed they were in-between the fossils from the Carboniferous above and the Silurian below. But the animals aren’t always exactly in-between because the time between these periods wasn’t always the same.

It’s not a big problem for this idea if some groups don’t fit perfectly. For example, when Dr. Falconer arranged mastodons and elephants by how they’re related and when they lived, the order didn’t match up. The species with the most extreme features weren’t always the oldest or newest, and those with middle features weren’t always in the middle in terms of age. Even if we had a perfect record of when species appeared and disappeared, we can’t say they all lived for the same amount of time. Some old species might have lasted longer than newer ones, especially if they lived in different places. To compare small things to big: if we lined up the different types of domestic pigeons by how related they are, this wouldn’t match up well with when they first appeared or went extinct. For example, the original rock-pigeon is still alive, many varieties between the rock-pigeon and the carrier pigeon have gone extinct, and carriers with long beaks appeared before tumblers with short beaks, even though these two types are very different.

Also linked to the idea that fossils from a middle time are in-between in features is the fact, agreed on by all fossil experts, that fossils from two next-door time periods are much more closely related than fossils from two far-apart time periods. For example, Pictet showed that fossils from different parts of the chalk formation look alike, even though the species are different in each part.
