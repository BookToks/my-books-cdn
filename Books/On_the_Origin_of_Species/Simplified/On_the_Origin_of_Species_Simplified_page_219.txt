When an organ isn’t used much because of changes in habits or living conditions, it usually gets smaller over time. Natural selection can help with this too. This helps us understand why some organs are just leftovers, or “rudimentary.” But disuse and natural selection mostly affect animals when they’re adults and competing to survive, so these organs don’t shrink much when the animal is young. For example, calves have teeth that never come through their upper gums because their ancestors had full sets of teeth. Over many generations, the adult teeth got smaller or disappeared because the animal’s mouth and tongue adapted to eating without them. But the calf still has these hidden teeth because they haven’t been affected by natural selection or disuse yet. If every part of an animal was specially designed from the start, it’s hard to explain why animals often have useless parts like these teeth or tiny wings under beetle shells. Nature seems to show us how things have changed over time through these leftover parts, but many people just don’t want to understand.

I’ve now gone over the main facts that have convinced me species change slowly over time by keeping small helpful changes. You might wonder why many top scientists don’t agree with this idea. It’s clear that animals and plants do change naturally, and it’s not proven that changes stop after a certain point. There’s no clear line between species and different varieties, and species that crossbreed aren’t always sterile, while varieties usually can breed. People used to believe species never change because they thought the Earth was young. Now that we know Earth is very old, some still assume the fossil record would clearly show species changing if it really happened, but that’s not proven.

The main reason people don’t like the idea that one species can turn into another is that we don’t see all the small steps in between. This is like when geologists first learned that huge cliffs and valleys were formed slowly by waves over millions of years—it’s hard to imagine such long times. Our minds can’t easily understand a hundred million years or how tiny changes add up over many generations.

Even though I strongly believe in this theory, I don’t expect to convince many experienced scientists who have spent years believing the opposite. It’s easy to use phrases like “plan of creation” or “unity of design” to explain things, but those just restate what we see without really explaining it. People who focus more on what we don’t understand than on the facts that do support my idea will probably reject it. A few open-minded scientists who already question whether species are fixed might be convinced by this book. But I’m hopeful that future generations of young scientists will look at both sides fairly and understand the truth.
