So, I think that two or more groups called genera come from two or more species within the same genus, but with changes over time. These parent species come from one species of an older genus. In the diagram, you can see broken lines below the big letters coming together at one point. This point shows a single species that is the ancestor of the new groups and genera.

Let’s think about the new species called F14. It probably didn’t change much and kept the shape of species F, either the same or just a little different. Because it came from a species that was between two parent species (A and I), which are now extinct and unknown, it shares some features with both groups that came from those parents. But since those groups have changed a lot since then, F14 is not exactly in the middle between them. Instead, it is between types within those groups. Scientists can think of examples like this.

In the diagram, each horizontal line was thought to stand for a thousand generations, but it could also mean a million or even a hundred million generations. These lines also match layers of Earth’s crust, which hold fossils of extinct creatures. Later, when we talk about Geology, we’ll look at this again. The diagram helps us understand how extinct animals relate to living ones. Even though extinct species usually belong to the same big groups like families or genera, they often have features between those groups because they lived long ago when species hadn’t changed much yet.

I don’t see why this process of change has to only make new genera. If the changes shown by the branching lines in the diagram are big enough, then the groups labeled a14 to p14, b14 and f14, and o14 to m14 would be three very different genera. Also, the two groups from I would be two separate genera. Since these two groups come from different parents and have changed a lot, they would make two different families or even orders, depending on how much they changed. These new families or orders come from two species of the original genus, and those two species came from one species of an even older and unknown genus.

We have seen that in each country, species in bigger groups often have more varieties or new species starting to form. This makes sense because natural selection works when one form has an advantage over others in surviving and reproducing. It mostly affects species that already have some advantage. Big groups show that their species got some shared advantage from a common ancestor. So, the fight to create new and changed descendants mostly happens between big groups, all trying to grow in number. One big group will slowly beat another, lower its numbers, and reduce its chance to change and improve.

Inside the same big group, the newer and more advanced smaller groups will spread out and take over many new places in nature. They will often replace and destroy the older and less developed smaller groups.
