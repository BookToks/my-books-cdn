In the chapter about the Struggle for Existence, we learned that animals and plants that are closely related—like different kinds of the same species or species from the same family—usually compete the most with each other. This is because they have similar bodies, habits, and needs. So, when a new kind or variety appears, it often competes strongly with its closest relatives and can even cause them to die out.

We see this happen with animals and plants that people raise, too. For example, new breeds of cows, sheep, and flowers often replace older, weaker kinds very quickly. In Yorkshire, it’s known that old black cows were replaced by long-horn cows, and then the long-horns were wiped out by short-horn cows, almost like a disease spreading.

Now, let’s talk about something called Divergence of Character, which is very important. Varieties, even ones that look very different, are usually more similar to each other than separate species are. But I think varieties are like species that are just starting to form—what I call “incipient species.” So, the question is: how do small differences between varieties turn into big differences between species?

We know this happens because there are many clear species in nature, but varieties are usually only slightly different. Random changes might make a variety a little different from its parents, and its children might be even more different. But this alone can’t explain why species are often very different from each other.

To understand this, let’s look at animals people breed. Imagine one person likes pigeons with shorter beaks, and another likes pigeons with longer beaks. Since breeders like extreme traits, they keep choosing birds with shorter or longer beaks. Over time, the differences become bigger.

Or think about horses: one person might want faster horses, another stronger horses. At first, the differences are small, but after many years, these groups become very different breeds. The animals that are kind of in between—neither very fast nor very strong—get ignored and disappear.

This shows us that in breeding, small differences can slowly grow bigger, and breeds become more different from each other and from their original ancestors.

You might wonder if this idea works in nature, too. I believe it does. When descendants of one species become more different in body, habits, and makeup, they can live in many different places and survive better. This helps their numbers grow.
