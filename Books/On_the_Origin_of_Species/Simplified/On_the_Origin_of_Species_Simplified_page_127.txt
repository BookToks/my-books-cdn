Hybrids and mongrels can be compared in different ways, not just by whether they can have babies or not. Gartner, who really wanted to find a clear difference between species and varieties, found only a few small and unimportant differences between hybrids (offspring from different species) and mongrels (offspring from different varieties). In many important ways, hybrids and mongrels are actually very similar.

I’ll keep this explanation short. The biggest difference is that in the first generation, mongrels show more differences among themselves than hybrids do. But Gartner admits that hybrids from species that have been grown for a long time can also be quite varied in the first generation. I’ve even seen some clear examples of this. He also says that hybrids from species that are closely related tend to be more variable than hybrids from species that are very different. This shows the amount of variation changes gradually. When mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are bred for many generations, their offspring become very different from each other. But some hybrids and mongrels can stay pretty much the same for a long time. Still, mongrels usually show more variation over generations than hybrids do.

It makes sense that mongrels vary more because their parents are varieties, mostly ones bred by people. This means they have changed recently, so it’s expected that they keep changing and add to the changes caused by crossing. Hybrids don’t show much variation in the first generation, but their later generations do, which is interesting. This supports the idea that changes happen because the reproductive system is sensitive to changes in life conditions. When this system is affected, it can’t make offspring that are exactly like the parents. First-generation hybrids come from species whose reproductive systems have not been affected, so they don’t vary much. But hybrids themselves have affected reproductive systems, so their descendants vary a lot.

Back to comparing mongrels and hybrids: Gartner says mongrels are more likely to go back to looking like their parents than hybrids. If true, this difference is small. He also says that when two species that are closely related are crossed with a third species, their hybrids look very different from each other. But if two very different varieties of one species are crossed with another species, their hybrids don’t differ much. However, this idea seems based on just one experiment and disagrees with other experiments by Kolreuter.

These small differences are all Gartner could find between hybrid and mongrel plants. On the other hand, mongrels and hybrids both look like their parents, especially hybrids from closely related species. When two species are crossed, sometimes one parent has a stronger influence on how the hybrid looks. This also happens with varieties of plants, and with animals, one variety often has a stronger effect than another. Hybrids made by crossing parents in both ways usually look very similar, and mongrels do, too.
