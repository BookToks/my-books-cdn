When I think about all living things not as special creations, but as the descendants of a few creatures that lived a long time ago before the first Silurian rocks were formed, they seem more impressive to me. Looking at the past, we can safely guess that no living species will stay exactly the same far into the future. Also, very few of the species alive now will have descendants that survive for a long time. This is because most species in each group, and many groups themselves, have completely disappeared and left no descendants.

We can predict that the species that survive and make new species in the future will be the common and widespread ones from the biggest and strongest groups. Since all living things today come from those ancient creatures before the Silurian time, we can be sure that life has continued without stopping and that no huge disaster wiped out everything. So, we can feel confident that life will continue for a very long time. And because natural selection helps each being survive and do well, all physical and mental traits will keep improving.

It’s interesting to think about a busy bank full of many different plants, birds singing in the bushes, insects flying around, and worms moving through the wet soil. All these different and connected forms have come about because of natural laws around us. These laws include growth and reproduction, inheritance (which happens when things reproduce), changes caused by the environment and by using or not using parts of the body, a high rate of population growth leading to a struggle for survival, and natural selection. This leads to species becoming different and less successful ones dying out.

So, from nature’s battles, hunger, and death, the most amazing thing we can imagine—the creation of higher animals—comes directly. There is something great about seeing life, with all its powers, starting from just a few forms or maybe one, and while Earth keeps moving in its path because of gravity, from that simple start, endless beautiful and amazing forms have developed and continue to evolve.
