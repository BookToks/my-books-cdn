It's really hard to guess how many small steps it took for different living things to develop their features, especially in groups that are mixed up or not doing well. But we see so many strange changes in nature, as the rule says, "Nature doesn’t make jumps," that we should be very careful before saying any part of an animal or plant couldn’t have formed through many small steps. There are some tough problems with the idea of natural selection, like how ants have different groups of workers that don’t reproduce, but I’ve tried to explain how this problem can be solved.

When it comes to species being mostly unable to have babies when first mixed together, which is very different from varieties that can usually have babies when crossed, I want you to look at the facts I shared at the end of chapter eight. These facts show that this infertility isn’t something made on purpose. Instead, it happens because the reproductive systems of different species don’t work well together. We can see this is true because the results change a lot depending on which species is the mother or the father.

Varieties that are mixed usually can have babies, but not always. It’s not surprising they can have babies easily because their bodies and reproductive systems probably haven’t changed much.

Also, many varieties tested have been created by humans raising them, and since domestication seems to reduce infertility, we shouldn’t expect it to cause it.

The infertility of hybrids (the children of two different species) is very different from the first crosses, because hybrids’ reproductive organs don’t work well. But in first crosses, both parents’ organs are fine. We often see that living things become somewhat infertile when their bodies are upset by new or different life conditions, so it’s not surprising that hybrids are a bit infertile since they come from two different groups. This idea is supported by another fact that’s kind of the opposite: small changes in life conditions and crossing similar varieties actually make living things stronger and able to have more babies. So, big changes and crosses between very different forms reduce fertility, but small changes and crosses between similar forms increase it.

Now, about where different animals and plants live, there are big problems with the idea that they all come from common ancestors. All members of the same species and groups must have come from the same parents, so even if they live far apart now, they must have moved from one place to another over many generations. But sometimes we have no idea how this happened. Still, since some species have stayed the same for very long times, we shouldn’t worry too much about the rare cases where the same species is found far away. Over long periods, there are many chances for species to spread out by different ways.
