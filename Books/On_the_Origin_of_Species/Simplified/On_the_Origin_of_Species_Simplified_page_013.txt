Also, based on what I’m going to explain soon about where groups of animals come from, we shouldn’t expect to see big differences between types of animals we’ve tamed.

When we try to figure out how much animals of the same kind but different breeds differ, it gets confusing. That’s because we don’t know if they come from one original species or several. If we could find out, it would be really interesting. For example, if it was proven that dogs like greyhounds, bloodhounds, terriers, spaniels, and bulldogs all came from one wild species, it would make us question if some wild animals that are very alike, like different kinds of foxes, are really separate species. I don’t think all dogs come from just one wild species, but for some other tamed animals, there is some strong evidence that they do.

People often say that humans picked animals and plants to tame because they change a lot and can survive in many climates. I agree that these qualities are helpful, but how could early humans know if an animal would change or survive in different places? Some animals, like donkeys or guinea-fowl, don’t change much, and some, like reindeer or camels, don’t handle certain climates well, but they were still tamed. I believe that if we took the same number of wild animals and plants and bred them for the same time as our tamed ones, they would probably change just as much on average.

For most animals and plants that have been tamed for a very long time, it’s hard to say if they come from one species or many. People who think our tamed animals come from many species often point to old records, especially Egyptian monuments, showing lots of different breeds, some like the ones we have now. Even if that’s true, it only shows that some breeds started there 4,000 or 5,000 years ago. But research by Mr. Horner suggests that people who could make pottery lived in the Nile valley 13,000 to 14,000 years ago. So, who can say how long before that, people like the savages in Tierra del Fuego or Australia, who had partly tamed dogs, might have lived in Egypt?

I think this whole topic is still unclear. But from where these animals live and other facts, I believe our domestic dogs probably come from several wild species. I have no idea about sheep and goats. From what Mr. Blyth told me about Indian humped cattle—their habits, sounds, and health—I think they come from a different wild group than European cattle. Some experts also think European cattle come from more than one wild ancestor. As for horses, although some authors disagree, I’m not sure but I lean toward thinking all horse breeds come from one wild species.
