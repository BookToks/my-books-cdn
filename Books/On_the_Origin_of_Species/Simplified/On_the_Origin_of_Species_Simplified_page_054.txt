Places like these usually depend on physical changes that happen very slowly and on stopping better-adapted creatures from moving in. But natural selection mostly works when some animals or plants slowly change, which can mess up the relationships between others living there. Nothing can happen unless good changes show up, and changes usually happen very slowly. This process can be slowed down even more if different types breed freely. Many people think these things are enough to stop natural selection completely. I don’t think so. However, I do believe natural selection works very slowly, only sometimes, and usually only affects a few creatures in one area at a time. I also think this slow, on-and-off way natural selection works fits perfectly with what we know from geology about how living things have changed over time.

Even though natural selection is slow, if humans can make big changes by selecting certain traits, I don’t see any limit to how much nature can change things over a long time. Nature can make living things fit together in amazing and complex ways with each other and their environment.

Extinction will be talked about more in the geology chapter, but it’s important here because it’s connected to natural selection. Natural selection keeps helpful changes alive. But since every area already has lots of living things, when one type grows in number, the less successful ones become rare. Being rare usually means a species is close to dying out. Also, if there are only a few of a kind, they can easily go extinct when seasons change or more enemies show up. We also know that new types are always slowly appearing, so unless the number of species keeps growing forever, some have to go extinct. Geology shows the number of species hasn’t kept growing forever. There’s a limit to how many species can live in one place—not that any place has reached that limit yet. For example, at the Cape of Good Hope, which has more plant species than anywhere else, some foreign plants have moved in without causing any native ones to die out.

Also, species with lots of individuals are more likely to have helpful changes within a certain time. We saw in the second chapter that common species have the most varieties or new species starting to form. So, rare species change more slowly and get beaten by the improved descendants of common species.

Because of all this, I think it’s clear that as new species form through natural selection, others become rarer and eventually go extinct.

The species that compete most with those changing and improving will be the ones that suffer the most.
