Summary. — In this chapter, I tried to show that the mental abilities of our pets and farm animals can be different, and that these differences get passed down to their babies. I also briefly explained that instincts, or natural behaviors, can change a little bit in wild animals. Everyone agrees that instincts are very important for each animal. So, I don’t see why, when life changes, natural selection can’t slowly change instincts in useful ways. Sometimes habits or using something more or less probably help too. I’m not saying the facts here make my theory much stronger, but none of the problems I found really break it. Also, instincts aren’t always perfect and can make mistakes; no instinct exists just to help other animals, but animals do use the instincts of others. The natural history rule “nature doesn’t make jumps” applies to instincts as well as body parts, and this fits well with my ideas, but is hard to explain otherwise. All this supports the theory of natural selection.

This theory is also helped by other facts about instincts. For example, closely related species living far apart in the world, and in different environments, often still have almost the same instincts.

For example, we can understand why the South American thrush builds its nest with mud just like the British thrush does. Or why male wrens in North America build special “cock-nests” to sleep in, just like the males of our different Kitty-wrens, even though no other birds do this. Finally, it might not be a strict fact, but it makes sense to me to see instincts like the young cuckoo pushing out its foster siblings, ants making slaves, or certain larvae eating live caterpillars, not as special gifts or creations, but as small results of one big rule: multiply, change, let the strongest survive and the weakest die.

Chapter VIII Hybridism Distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids — Sterility varies and is not always complete, can be affected by close breeding, and sometimes disappears with domestication — Rules about hybrid sterility — Sterility isn’t made for a special purpose, but happens because of other differences — Reasons why first crosses and hybrids are sterile — Similar effects of new life conditions and crossing — Fertility of varieties when crossed and their mixed offspring is not always the same — Comparing hybrids and mixed animals without looking at fertility — Summary.

Most scientists think that species have been given the ability to be sterile when crossed, to keep different species from mixing up. This idea seems true at first because species living in the same place wouldn’t stay different if they could cross freely. The fact that hybrids are usually sterile is very important, and I think some recent writers have not noticed this enough. According to natural selection, this is especially important because hybrid sterility wouldn’t help the animals, so it couldn’t have developed by natural selection working to keep it.
