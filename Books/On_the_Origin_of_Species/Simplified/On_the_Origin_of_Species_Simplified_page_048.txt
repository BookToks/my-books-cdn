So, if humble-bees became rare in a country, it might actually help red clover flowers to change their shape a bit, making it easier for hive-bees to visit them. This shows how flowers and bees could slowly change together, either at the same time or one after the other, getting better suited to each other by keeping small helpful changes.

I know that some people don’t agree with this idea of natural selection, like they didn’t agree with Sir Charles Lyell’s ideas about how the Earth changes over time. But now, we accept that things like waves slowly shape big valleys and cliffs. Natural selection works the same way, by keeping tiny helpful changes that add up over time. Just like geologists no longer think one big flood made a valley, natural selection, if true, means new species don’t appear suddenly or all at once.

Now, a quick side note. For animals and plants with separate male and female parts, two individuals must come together to have babies. But for hermaphrodites, which have both male and female parts, it’s not so clear. I believe that even hermaphrodites usually need two individuals to reproduce, at least sometimes. This idea was first suggested by Andrew Knight. Most vertebrate animals and insects pair up for each birth. Research shows fewer animals are true hermaphrodites than we thought, and many hermaphrodites do pair up to reproduce.

However, many hermaphrodite animals don’t always pair up, and most plants are hermaphrodites. So, why do I think two individuals still play a role in reproduction here? I can’t explain all the details now, but some general facts help.

First, I’ve found many examples showing that crossing different varieties or strains of plants and animals makes their babies stronger and more fertile. But breeding closely related individuals makes them weaker and less fertile. These facts suggest it’s a natural rule that no living thing fertilizes itself forever. Instead, it needs to sometimes cross with another individual, even if rarely.

If we accept this idea, it helps explain many things that don’t make sense otherwise. For example, many flowers have their pollen and female parts exposed to the weather, even though wetness usually hurts fertilization. If crossing with other plants is really necessary, it makes sense that flowers let pollen from other plants in easily, especially since their own pollen and female parts are so close together that self-fertilization seems likely.
