Everyone agrees that instincts are just as important as a body’s shape and structure for the survival of each species, given how they live now. If life conditions change, small changes in instinct might help a species. If instincts can change even a little, then natural selection can keep and build on these helpful changes. This is how, I think, all the most complex and amazing instincts have started. Just like body parts change because of use or habit, and can fade away if not used, instincts probably work the same way. But I think habits are less important than natural selection acting on random changes in instincts—these changes happen for unknown reasons, just like small changes in body parts.

No complex instinct can form by natural selection except through many small, useful changes building up slowly. So, like with body parts, we shouldn’t expect to find the exact steps that created a complex instinct—those would only be in the direct ancestors of a species. But we should see signs of these steps in related species, or at least be able to prove that such steps are possible. And we can do that. I’ve been surprised to find, even though animal instincts have mostly been studied only in Europe and North America, and none are known from extinct animals, that we can often see gradual changes leading to complex instincts. The rule "Nature does not make jumps" applies almost as much to instincts as to body parts. Changes in instinct can sometimes happen easier if the same species has different instincts at different ages, seasons, or situations; then natural selection might keep one or the other instinct. We can see examples of this kind of instinct variety in nature.

Also, like with body parts and according to my theory, each species’ instinct is good for itself, but probably not made just to help others. One strong example of an animal doing something only to help another is aphids giving sweet juice to ants. Aphids seem to do this on purpose. I removed ants from a group of about a dozen aphids on a plant and kept ants away for several hours. After that, I thought the aphids would want to excrete. I watched them closely but none did. I even tried to tickle and stroke them like ants do with their antennae, but still no excretion.

Then I let an ant visit them. It quickly seemed to know it found a good group. The ant touched the aphids’ bellies with its antennae, one after another. Each aphid lifted its belly and dropped a clear sweet drop, which the ant eagerly drank. Even very young aphids did this, showing it’s an instinct, not learned from experience. But since the sticky juice is probably annoying for the aphids, it’s likely that they don’t excrete just to help the ants.
