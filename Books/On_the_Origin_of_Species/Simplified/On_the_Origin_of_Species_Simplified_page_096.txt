If we think about how amazing the sense of smell is, especially how male insects use it to find females, can we also admire how thousands of drones are made just for this one job? These drones don’t help the community in any other way and are eventually killed by their hardworking and sterile sisters. It might be hard to accept, but we should respect the queen-bee’s strong instinct to kill the new queens her daughters as soon as they are born, or die fighting them herself. This is definitely for the good of the whole group. Whether it’s motherly love or hatred, natural selection doesn’t care about feelings. If we admire how flowers like orchids use insects to help them reproduce, can we also think fir trees are just as clever when they make huge clouds of pollen, hoping a little bit will land on the right part of another tree?

In this chapter, we talked about some big problems and doubts about my theory. Many are serious, but I think we’ve made some things clearer that don’t make sense if you believe species were created separately. We’ve seen that species don’t change endlessly or have many in-between forms because natural selection is slow and only works on a few forms at a time. Also, natural selection often replaces and wipes out older forms and in-between types. Species that live close now probably formed when their habitats were separate, and the conditions didn’t change slowly across the area. When two varieties form in one area, an in-between variety might also appear for the middle zone, but it usually has fewer numbers than the other two. Because of this, the two bigger groups have a better chance to survive and replace the smaller in-between kind.

We also learned to be careful before saying very different habits of life couldn’t change into each other. For example, a bat might have come from an animal that could only glide at first.

A species can change its habits or have many different habits that are very different from its closest relatives. So, it makes sense how there are upland geese with webbed feet, ground woodpeckers, diving thrushes, and petrels that act like auks.

Even though it’s hard to believe something as perfect as the eye could form by natural selection, if we can see many small steps of improvement, each helpful to the creature, it’s possible for natural selection to create any level of complexity. When we don’t know about in-between stages, we should be careful about saying none existed because many organs show changes over time. For example, a swim-bladder in some fish has turned into a lung for breathing air.
