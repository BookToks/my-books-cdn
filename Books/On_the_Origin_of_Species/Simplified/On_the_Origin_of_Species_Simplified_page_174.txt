During the coldest time, I think that large parts of the tropical lowlands had a mix of tropical and temperate plants, kind of like the strange mix of plants you see at the base of the Himalaya mountains, which Hooker described well.

So, during the Ice Age, many plants, some land animals, and some sea creatures moved from the cooler northern and southern areas into the tropical regions near the equator. Some even crossed the equator. When it got warmer again, the temperate plants and animals moved up to higher mountains because they couldn’t survive in the lowlands. Those that hadn’t crossed the equator went back north or south to where they came from. But the ones that had crossed the equator kept moving into the opposite hemisphere’s temperate zones. We know from fossils that arctic sea creatures didn’t change much while moving south and then back north. But the plants and animals that settled on tropical mountains and in the southern hemisphere had to compete with new species. This likely caused them to change in their bodies, habits, and how they live. So, many of these travelers, though still related to their northern or southern relatives, now exist as different varieties or even new species.

It’s interesting, and Hooker noticed this about America while Alph. de Candolle saw it in Australia, that more plants moved from north to south than the other way around. A few southern plants are found on mountains in places like Borneo and Abyssinia, but not many. I think this happened because there’s more land in the north, and northern plants lived in bigger numbers. This helped them become stronger and better through natural selection and competition. So, when northern and southern plants met during the Ice Age, the northern ones were stronger and outcompeted the southern ones. Today, we see many European plants growing in places like La Plata and Australia, even pushing out native plants. But very few southern plants have spread to Europe, even though seeds have come there for centuries with imported goods. The same thing probably happened on tropical mountains. Before the Ice Age, these mountains had their own special plants, but most of them were beaten by stronger northern plants that came in. On many islands, native plants are now matched or outnumbered by new plants that have been brought in. Even if the native plants aren’t gone yet, their numbers have dropped a lot, which is the first step toward disappearing forever. A mountain is like an island on land, and before the Ice Age, tropical mountains were isolated like islands. I believe the native plants on these “islands” lost out to the stronger northern plants, just like real island plants have lost out to new plants brought by humans.
