Some body parts that don’t seem very important now were probably really important to early ancestors. These parts were improved a long time ago and passed down mostly unchanged, even if they’re not very useful anymore. If any harmful changes happened to these parts, natural selection would have stopped them. For example, tails are super important for swimming animals, and lots of land animals still have tails because their lungs or swim bladders show they came from water animals. A strong tail made for swimming could later be used for other things like swatting flies, grabbing stuff, or helping turn around—like dogs use their tails. But the help is small, since hares can turn quickly even with almost no tail.

Also, sometimes we think some traits are really important when they’re actually not. These traits can come from other causes besides natural selection. Things like climate and food might directly affect how animals grow. Traits can also reappear because of something called reversion, and growth connections can change body parts. Sexual selection can change how animals look to help males fight or attract females. Sometimes changes start without helping the animal but later become useful when their lifestyle or habits change.

Here are some examples. If we only knew green woodpeckers, we might think their green color helps them hide in trees and was made by natural selection. But since there are black and spotted woodpeckers too, the green might actually come from sexual selection. A climbing bamboo plant in the Malay Archipelago uses special hooks on its branches to climb trees, which helps a lot. But since many trees that don’t climb have similar hooks, the hooks might have appeared from natural growth rules and later helped the bamboo climb. Vultures have bald heads, which people think helps them when they eat dead animals, but bald heads could also be caused by the stuff they eat. Turkeys, which don’t eat dead animals, also have bald heads, so we should be careful about assuming why vultures have them. Baby mammals have skull sutures (soft spots) that help them be born, but birds and reptiles have these too, even though they just hatch from eggs. So, these sutures likely came from growth patterns and were useful for birth in mammals.

We don’t really understand why small, unimportant changes happen. We can see this when we look at different breeds of pets or farm animals in different countries, especially places where people haven’t done much breeding. Some people notice that wet climates affect hair growth, and this also affects horns. Animals living in mountains look different from those in flat areas, probably because climbing affects their legs and maybe their pelvis. Changes in one part of the body can cause changes in others, like the front legs or head, because of linked growth.
