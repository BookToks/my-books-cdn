The kinds of animals and plants living on ocean islands make me doubt that these islands were once connected to continents. Also, most of these islands are made from volcanoes, which doesn’t support the idea that they are pieces of sunken continents. If they were once part of mountains on land, some islands would be made of rocks like granite or old fossils, but instead, they are mostly just layers of volcanic stuff.

Now, I want to talk about what some people call “accidental” ways plants spread, but it’s better to call them “occasional” ways. I’ll focus on plants here. In books about plants, people often say certain plants aren’t good at spreading far. But no one really knew how well seeds could survive in saltwater until I did some tests with Mr. Berkeley. I found that out of 87 seed types, 64 could still grow after being soaked in seawater for 28 days, and a few lasted even 137 days.

I mostly tested small seeds without their fruit, and since these sank quickly, they couldn’t float across the sea, whether or not saltwater hurt them. Later, I tried bigger fruits and seed cases, and some of these floated for a long time. It’s known that fresh and dry wood float differently, so I thought floods might wash plants or branches into rivers, dry them on the banks, and then a new flood could carry them into the sea.

So, I dried stems and branches of 94 plants with ripe fruit and put them on seawater. Most sank fast, but some that floated a little when fresh floated much longer when dry. For example, ripe hazelnuts sank right away, but dried ones floated for 90 days and could still grow. An asparagus plant with ripe berries floated 23 days fresh, but 85 days dry, and its seeds grew afterward. Seeds of Helosciadium sank in two days fresh but floated over 90 days dry and still grew. Out of 94 dried plants, 18 floated more than 28 days, and some floated much longer.

So, since 64 out of 87 seeds survived 28 days underwater, and 18 out of 94 dried plants floated over 28 days, we can guess that about 14 out of 100 plants from any country could float in the sea for 28 days and still grow. According to Johnston’s Physical Atlas, Atlantic currents move about 33 miles per day (some up to 60 miles). This means seeds from 14 out of 100 plants could travel about 924 miles by sea and still grow if they landed in a good spot.

After my tests, M. Martens did similar ones but better. He put seeds in a box in the real sea so they got wet and dry like they would if really floating. He tested 98 seeds, mostly different from mine, choosing many big fruits and seeds from plants near the sea, which helped their float time and survival in saltwater.

But he didn’t dry the plants or branches with fruit first, which, as we saw, helps them float longer. His results showed 18 out of 98 seeds floated for 42 days and could still grow. Still, I believe seeds in rough waves would float less time than in our calmer tests.
