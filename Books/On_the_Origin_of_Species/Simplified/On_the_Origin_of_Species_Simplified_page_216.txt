In both types and species, growth seems to be linked, so when one part changes, other parts change too.

Sometimes, animals show old features that disappeared a long time ago. For example, some horses and their mixes sometimes have stripes on their shoulders and legs. This is hard to explain if we think every species was created separately. But it makes sense if we believe they all came from an ancestor with stripes, like how all domestic pigeons came from the blue and barred rock-pigeon.

If every species was created on its own, why would the features that make species different within the same group change more easily than the features they all share? For example, why would the flower color change more in one species if other species in the same group have different colors? If species are just strong varieties that have changed a lot since they came from a common ancestor, this makes sense. They have already changed in ways that make them different from each other, so those parts are more likely to keep changing. But if each species was created separately, it’s hard to understand why important parts that make one species unique would change so much. On the other hand, parts that are very unusual but shared for a long time, like a bat’s wing, might not change much because they have been kept the same by natural selection over a long time.

When we look at instincts, which can be amazing, they aren’t harder to understand than body structures if we think about natural selection making small useful changes over time.

This helps explain why animals in the same group have different instincts that develop step by step. I’ve tried to show how the idea of gradual change helps us understand the amazing skills of the hive-bee. Sometimes habits change instincts, but habits aren’t always necessary, like with worker insects that don’t have babies to pass on habits. If species in the same group come from a common ancestor and share many traits, it makes sense that related species living in different places still have similar instincts. For example, a South American thrush lines her nest with mud, just like British thrushes do. If instincts slowly developed through natural selection, we shouldn’t be surprised that some instincts aren’t perfect, make mistakes, or even hurt other animals.

If species are just strong, permanent varieties, it’s easy to see why their mixed offspring follow the same rules about how they look like their parents and blend together over time. But if species were created separately and varieties came from different causes, this would be hard to explain.
