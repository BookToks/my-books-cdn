When thinking about how organs change from one function to another, it’s really important to remember that these changes can happen gradually. I’ll give one more example. Some barnacles with stalks have tiny skin folds called ovigerous frena. These folds use a sticky substance to hold the eggs until they hatch inside a little sack. These barnacles don’t have gills; instead, their whole body and sack, including the small folds, help them breathe. 

On the other hand, barnacles that don’t have stalks don’t have these sticky folds. Their eggs just lie loose at the bottom of the sack inside a well-protected shell, but they do have big folded gills. I think most people would agree that the sticky folds in one group are basically the same as the gills in the other group. They even seem to change gradually from one to the other.

So, I believe that small skin folds that first helped hold eggs and helped a little with breathing slowly changed into gills. This happened because the folds got bigger and lost their sticky glands over time through natural selection. If all the stalked barnacles had died out, and they already have more than the stalkless ones, nobody would guess that the gills in the stalkless barnacles started as parts to stop eggs from being washed away.

We have to be very careful before saying an organ couldn’t have formed step by step. Still, some cases are really hard to explain, and I will talk about some of these in my next work.

One of the toughest examples is about neuter insects, which look very different from both males and females. I’ll discuss this in the next chapter. Another tricky example is the electric organs in fish. It’s hard to imagine how these amazing organs were made. But, as some scientists have said, their structure is really similar to normal muscles. Also, some rays have organs like electric organs but don’t actually produce electricity. This shows we don’t know enough to say these organs couldn’t have developed gradually.

Electric organs are even more confusing because they only appear in about a dozen kinds of fish, and these fish aren’t closely related. Usually, if an organ shows up in many similar animals with different lifestyles, we think they got it from a common ancestor. If some don’t have it, they probably lost it over time. But if electric organs came from one ancient fish, we’d expect all electric fish to be closely related. Also, fossils don’t show that most ancient fish had electric organs that later disappeared.

The glowing organs in some insects from different families and groups are another example of a difficult case. There are other examples too. For example, in plants, a strange structure made of many pollen grains on a stalk with a sticky tip is found in both Orchis and Asclepias—two very different kinds of flowering plants.
