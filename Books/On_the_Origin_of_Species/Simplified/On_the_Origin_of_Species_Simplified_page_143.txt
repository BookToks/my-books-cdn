Right now, this case is hard to explain, and some people might use that as a good reason to disagree with the ideas I'm talking about. But to show that there might be an answer in the future, I’ll suggest a guess.

Looking at the types of fossils, which seem to come from creatures that didn’t live very deep underwater, in different rock layers in Europe and the United States, and thinking about how thick these layers are, we can guess that big islands or land areas were near the continents we know today. But we don’t know what happened between these layers—whether Europe and the U.S. were dry land, underwater but close to land, or part of a deep, open sea.

If we look at today’s oceans, which cover three times more area than land, we see lots of islands. But none of these islands have old rock layers from the Paleozoic or secondary periods. So, maybe back then, no continents or islands existed where our oceans are now. If they had, we’d probably find old rock layers made from sediment worn down from those lands, and some of those layers would have been pushed up by changes in sea levels over time. So, from these facts, we might guess that oceans have been oceans for as far back as we can tell, and continents have been land, going up and down in height, since very early times.

A colored map in my book about coral reefs made me think that big oceans are places where the Earth's surface sinks, big groups of islands go up and down, and continents rise up. But can we be sure this has always been the case? Continents seem to have formed because rising forces were stronger over many changes in sea level, but maybe this has changed over millions of years. A long time before the Silurian period, continents might have been where oceans are now, and oceans where continents are now. Also, if the Pacific Ocean floor became land today, we might not find very old rock layers there because those rocks might have been changed a lot by pressure and heat deep underground. In places like South America, huge areas of rocks that have been heated and squeezed seem to need a special explanation. Maybe these are ancient rock layers from before the Silurian period that have been changed completely.

There are big problems we have to think about. We don’t find lots of “in-between” fossils showing gradual changes between species, whole groups of species suddenly appear in European rock layers, and we hardly find any fossil-rich rocks below the Silurian layers. These problems are serious. We can see this clearly because many top scientists—like Cuvier, Owen, Agassiz, Barrande, Falconer, Forbes, and famous geologists like Lyell, Murchison, and Sedgwick—have all strongly believed that species don’t change over time.
