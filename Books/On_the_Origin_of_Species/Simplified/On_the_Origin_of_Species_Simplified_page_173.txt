Dana said it’s really amazing that New Zealand’s crustaceans (like crabs and lobsters) are more similar to those in Great Britain, which is on the opposite side of the world, than to any other place. Sir J. Richardson also noticed that some types of fish from the northern parts of the world show up on the shores of New Zealand, Tasmania, and nearby places. Dr. Hooker told me that 25 types of algae are found both in New Zealand and Europe, but not in the tropical seas in between.

It’s important to know that the northern species found in the southern parts of the Southern Hemisphere, and on mountains near the equator, aren’t arctic animals but come from northern temperate zones. Mr. H. C. Watson recently said that as you move from the poles toward the equator, mountain plants become less like arctic plants. Many of the plants living on mountains in warm places and the Southern Hemisphere are hard to classify. Some experts say they’re different species, others say they’re just varieties, but some are definitely the same as northern species, while others are closely related but still different.

Now, let’s think about what this means, based on lots of geological evidence, that during the Ice Age the whole world—or at least a big part of it—was much colder than it is now. The Ice Age lasted a very long time. Since we know plants and animals can spread over huge areas in just a few hundred years, there was plenty of time for them to move around. When the cold slowly came, tropical plants and animals moved toward the equator, with temperate species following, and then arctic species came last. We don’t need to worry about the arctic ones here.

Tropical plants probably died out in large numbers, but no one knows exactly how many. Maybe the tropics once had as many species as we see today in places like the Cape of Good Hope or parts of temperate Australia. Many tropical plants and animals can survive some cold, so some might have lived through moderate temperature drops by finding the warmest areas. The main point is that all tropical life was hurt to some degree. Temperate plants and animals, after moving closer to the equator, faced new conditions but didn’t suffer as much. Many temperate plants can survive warmer climates if they avoid competition from others. So, it’s possible that some strong temperate species pushed into tropical areas and even crossed the equator.

This movement was probably helped by mountains and dry climates. Dr. Falconer told me that damp heat in the tropics is what really harms temperate plants that live for many years. Meanwhile, the hottest and most humid areas kept tropical plants safe. The mountain ranges northwest of the Himalayas and the long Cordillera mountains helped create two main routes for these species to move. Dr. Hooker also shared an interesting fact: all 46 types of flowering plants found both in Tierra del Fuego (at the southern tip of South America) and Europe are still found in North America, which must have been on their migration path.

I’m sure some temperate species even crossed the low tropical lands during the coldest times, when arctic species moved about 25 degrees of latitude from their homes and covered the land near the Pyrenees. During this very cold period, I believe the climate at sea level near the equator was like what we now experience at 6,000 or 7,000 feet high.
