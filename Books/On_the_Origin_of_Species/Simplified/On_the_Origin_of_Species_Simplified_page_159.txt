Extinct species are rarely direct links between animals alive today. Instead, they connect through a long, complicated chain of many extinct and different species. We can easily understand why fossils from rocks that formed one after another are more similar than fossils from rocks that formed far apart in time. This is because these species are connected through generations. Fossils found in the middle between old and new layers show features that are also in between.

Each group of animals living at different times in Earth’s history has outcompeted the ones before them. Because of this, they are considered higher up in nature’s ladder. This might explain why many scientists feel that life has generally gotten more complex over time. If it’s proven that old animals look somewhat like the embryos of newer animals in the same group, that would make sense. The fact that similar types of animals appear in the same places during later times in Earth’s history is no longer confusing—it’s just because they inherited traits from their ancestors.

If the fossil record is as incomplete as I think it is (and we can’t prove it’s much better), then the main problems people have with natural selection become much smaller or go away. On the other hand, all the main facts from studying fossils clearly show, to me, that species come from ordinary reproduction. Old species have been replaced by new and improved ones through variation and natural selection, which are still happening today.

Chapter XI: Geographical Distribution

Where animals and plants live today can’t be explained just by climate or physical conditions. Barriers like mountains or oceans are important. Animals and plants on the same continent are often related. There are places where life first appeared. Plants and animals spread around the world through changes in climate, land levels, and sometimes by chance. During the Ice Age, many species spread across the world.

When we look at where living things are found, the first big fact is that their similarities or differences don’t match up with climate or other physical conditions. Almost every expert who studies this agrees. Take America as an example: except for the far north where land is almost connected all the way around, there is a major difference between animals and plants in the New World (America) and Old World (Europe, Asia, Africa). 

If you travel from the middle of the United States all the way to the southern tip of South America, you will see many different environments: wet places, dry deserts, tall mountains, grasslands, forests, swamps, lakes, and big rivers. These places have almost every temperature you can think of. Almost every kind of climate found in the Old World also exists in the New World, and species usually need similar conditions. It is very rare to find animals or plants that live only in a tiny area with unique conditions. For example, some places in the Old World are hotter than any place in the New World, but they don’t have completely different animals or plants.
