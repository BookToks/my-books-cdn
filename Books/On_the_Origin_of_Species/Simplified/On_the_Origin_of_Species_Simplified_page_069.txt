The Jerusalem artichoke is never grown from seeds, so new types haven’t been created. Because it’s still as delicate as before, some people say this shows plants can’t really get used to new environments.

The kidney-bean is often mentioned for the same reason, and this example is stronger. But until someone plants kidney-beans early for many generations, lets most die from frost, then carefully saves seeds from the survivors without mixing them with others, and repeats this, the test isn’t really done. Also, some kidney-bean seedlings are tougher than others, so differences do exist.

Overall, I think habits, using or not using parts, have sometimes helped change the body and organs. But these changes often happen with natural selection, which can be stronger.

“Correlation of Growth” means that the whole body is connected while it grows. So, if one part changes a bit and natural selection favors it, other parts might change too. This is important but not well understood. For example, changes that help young animals might also change adults. Parts that are similar in the body, like the right and left sides, front and back legs, or jaws and limbs, tend to change together. Natural selection can sometimes control these changes. For example, there was once a group of stags with an antler on only one side, and if it helped them, natural selection might have made this permanent.

Similar parts often stick together. This happens in weird plants, but also in normal ones, like flower petals joining to form a tube. Hard parts can change the shape of soft parts nearby. Some think the shape of a bird’s pelvis affects its kidneys. Others believe a mother’s pelvis shape changes the baby’s head shape. In snakes, body shape and how they swallow affect where important organs are.

Why parts change together is often a mystery. A scientist named Geoffroy St. Hilaire noticed some unusual body problems happen together often, while others don’t, and we don’t know why. For example, cats with blue eyes often are deaf. Female cats usually have tortoise-shell fur. In pigeons, feathered feet link with skin between toes and how much down baby birds have when they hatch. Also, the hair and teeth of the naked Turkish dog seem connected, probably because of their shared body structure. When looking at mammals with unusual skin coverings, these connections seem important.
