If it could be shown that a really complicated organ existed which couldn’t have been made by many small changes happening one after another, my theory would completely fail.

But I haven’t found any example like that. There are probably many organs where we don’t know the middle steps, especially in species that live far away or are isolated. According to my theory, many related species have died out. Also, if an organ is found in all members of a big group, it must have started a very long time ago. To find the early steps of how that organ formed, we’d need to look at very old ancestors that are now extinct.

We should be very careful before saying that an organ couldn’t have formed by small changes. Many examples exist in simple animals where the same organ does completely different jobs at the same time. For example, in the baby dragonfly and a fish called Cobites, the digestive tube helps with breathing, digesting, and getting rid of waste. In the Hydra, the animal can turn inside out, and then its outside can digest food while the stomach breathes. In these cases, natural selection could easily focus on one part of the organ to do only one job, changing it little by little.

Sometimes two different organs do the same job in the same animal. For example, some fish have gills that breathe air dissolved in water and also breathe air in their swimbladders. The swimbladder has a special tube for air and is divided into parts with lots of blood vessels. One organ could slowly change to do all the work, helped by the other organ during the change. Then the other organ might change for a different job or disappear completely.

The swimbladder example is great because it shows that an organ made for one thing, like helping the fish float, can change into something totally different, like helping it breathe. The swimbladder also helps with hearing in some fish, or maybe part of the ear works with the swimbladder. Scientists agree that the swimbladder is very similar in place and structure to lungs in higher animals. So, it’s not hard to believe that natural selection changed a swimbladder into lungs used only for breathing.

I really don’t doubt that all animals with real lungs come from an ancient ancestor that had a swimming bladder or floating organ. From what Professor Owen described, it makes sense that all the food and drink we swallow pass near the opening of the windpipe, which risks going into the lungs, even though there is a smart way to close it off. In higher animals, gills have completely disappeared, but the slits on the sides of the neck and the shape of the arteries in embryos still show where they were. It’s possible that these lost gills were changed by natural selection to do a very different job. Some scientists think that the gills and scales of worms are similar to wings and wing covers of insects. So, organs that once helped with breathing a long time ago might have turned into wings for flying.
