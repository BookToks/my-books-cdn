When the nest is only a little disturbed, the slave ants sometimes come out, and like their bosses, they get very upset and try to protect their home. When the nest is really disturbed and the baby ants are exposed, the slaves work hard with their bosses to carry them to a safe place. This shows that the slaves feel comfortable living there.

In June and July, for three years in a row, I watched several nests in Surrey and Sussex for many hours. I never saw a slave ant either leave or enter a nest. Since there were only a few slaves during these months, I thought maybe they would act differently when there were more of them. But Mr. Smith told me he watched nests at different times in May, June, and August in Surrey and Hampshire, and even when there were many slaves in August, he never saw them leave or enter the nest. So, he thinks they mostly stay inside as household helpers. The bosses, however, can be seen all the time bringing materials and food to the nest.

This year in July, I found a group with a lot of slaves. I saw some slaves going out with their bosses, walking together to a tall tree about twenty-five yards away. They climbed the tree, probably to look for tiny bugs to eat. According to Huber, who studied these ants a lot in Switzerland, slaves there usually help their bosses build the nest and are the ones who open and close the doors in the morning and evening. Their main job is to look for aphids (small bugs). The difference between Switzerland and England is probably because more slaves are caught in Switzerland.

One day, I was lucky to see a move from one nest to another. It was amazing to watch the bosses carefully carry their slaves in their jaws, just like Huber described. Another day, I saw about twenty slave-making ants hanging around the same spot, but not looking for food. They were chased away by a group of independent slave species (F. fusca). Sometimes, three of these ants even grabbed the legs of the slave-makers. The slave-makers killed the small ants and took their bodies back to their nest as food, but they couldnâ€™t get any baby ants to make slaves from them. I dug up some baby F. fusca ants from another nest and put them near where the fight happened. The slave-makers quickly grabbed them, probably thinking they had won the fight.

At the same time, I put some baby ants of another species, F. flava, on the same spot. A few small yellow ants were still with their nest pieces. This species is sometimes made into slaves, but not often. Even though they are small, they are very brave and will attack other ants fiercely. Once, I found a group of F. flava living under a stone beneath a slave-making F. sanguinea nest. When I disturbed both nests, the little ants attacked the bigger ants with a lot of courage. I wanted to see if F. sanguinea could tell the difference between the baby ants of F. fusca, which they usually make slaves, and the tiny, fierce F. flava, which they rarely catch. It was clear they could: they quickly grabbed the F. fusca babies but were scared when they found the F. flava babies or even the dirt from their nest. They ran away fast, but after about fifteen minutes, when the little yellow ants had left, they got brave again and carried off the F. flava babies too.
