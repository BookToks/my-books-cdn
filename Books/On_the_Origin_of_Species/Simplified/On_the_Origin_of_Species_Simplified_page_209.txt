Based on the idea that small changes happen one after another, not always early in life but at the right time and passed down through generations, we can understand some big facts about how embryos develop. For example, in an embryo, parts that will look very different when fully grown still look similar early on. Also, different species in the same group have body parts that are alike, even if they use those parts in very different ways when adults.

Larvae are like embryos that are active and have changed to fit their way of living. This happens because changes are inherited at the right age. Using this idea, and knowing that when body parts get smaller because they’re not used or because of natural selection, it usually happens when the animal starts taking care of itself, we can explain why some animals have leftover or useless organs. These “leftover” organs might seem strange, but actually, we could expect them to be there. Knowing about embryos and these leftover organs helps scientists understand how to classify animals better because grouping animals makes the most sense when it reflects their family history.

Finally, all the facts in this chapter show clearly to me that all the many species, groups, and families of living things on Earth have come from common ancestors within their groups. They have changed over time as they descended. I would believe this idea even if there were no other evidence or arguments to support it.

  
Chapter XIV Recap and Conclusion

This whole book is one long argument, so it might help the reader to have the main facts and ideas summarized here.

I admit that many serious objections can be made against the idea that species change over time through natural selection. I have tried to give those objections full attention.

At first, it can be really hard to believe that complex body parts and instincts got so perfect, not by some special power like human thinking, but by lots of tiny improvements, each one helping the individual animal.

Still, this problem, which seems impossible to our imagination, isn’t really a problem if we accept these ideas: that there are steps showing how any organ or instinct got better, which either exist now or could have existed; that all body parts and instincts can change a little; and that living things compete to survive, so helpful changes stick around. I don’t think anyone can reasonably argue against these ideas.
