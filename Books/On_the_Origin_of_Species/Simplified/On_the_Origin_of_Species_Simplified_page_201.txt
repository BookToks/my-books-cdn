The worm-like babies of moths, flies, beetles, and other insects look a lot like each other compared to the adults. But these baby insects are active and specially made to live in certain ways. Sometimes, young animals keep looking alike for a while as they grow up. For example, baby birds in the same family often look similar in their first and second feathers, like the spotted feathers on young thrushes. In cats, many species have stripes or spots, and you can even see stripes on a lion cub. Sometimes, plants show this too. For example, the first leaves of certain plants like ulex or some acacias look divided or pinnate, just like the leaves they will have later.

Sometimes, embryos of very different animals in the same group look alike in ways that don’t seem to relate to how they live. For example, the way arteries loop near the gill slits in embryos of vertebrates doesn’t have anything to do with how they live. This is true whether the animal grows inside its mother, hatches from an egg in a nest, or comes from eggs underwater. It’s the same as how the bones in a human hand, a bat’s wing, and a porpoise’s fin are similar even though they have different jobs. Nobody thinks the stripes on a lion cub or spots on a young blackbird help them survive or match their environment.

But things change if the baby animal is active and has to take care of itself during any part of its early life. This active time can happen early or later, but when it does, the baby is just as perfectly adapted to its life as the adult. Because of these special adaptations, baby animals of related species can sometimes look very different from each other—even more different than their parents do. Still, most baby insects usually follow the pattern of looking alike during early stages. Barnacles are a good example: even the famous scientist Cuvier didn’t realize barnacles were crustaceans until he looked at their larvae. Also, barnacles that look very different as adults have larvae that look almost the same in all their stages.

As embryos develop, they usually become more complex. It’s hard to explain exactly what “more complex” means, but most people would agree a butterfly is more complex than a caterpillar. Sometimes, though, the adult is seen as simpler than the larva, like with some parasite crustaceans. For example, barnacle larvae in the first stage have three pairs of legs, a simple eye, and a mouth shaped like a tube, which they use to eat a lot and grow. In the second stage, like a butterfly’s chrysalis, they have six pairs of special swimming legs, big compound eyes, and complex antennae, but their mouth is closed and they don’t eat. At this stage, their job is to use their senses and swimming skills to find the right place to attach and finish growing into adults.
