Almost every plant in nature makes seeds, and most animals find a mate every year. So, we can be sure that all plants and animals try to increase their numbers really fast. They would fill up every place where they can live if nothing stopped them. But this quick growth has to be slowed down by some kind of death at some point in their life.

We often get confused because we see big farm animals that don’t seem to die much. But actually, many are killed for food every year. In the wild, just as many would have to die somehow to keep numbers balanced.

The only real difference between animals or plants that make lots of eggs or seeds and those that make only a few is how long it takes them to fill an area. For example, a condor lays just a couple of eggs, and an ostrich lays about twenty, but sometimes the condor is more common. Some birds, like the Fulmar petrel, lay just one egg but are still very numerous. One type of fly can lay hundreds of eggs, while another lays only one. But this doesn’t decide how many of each will live in an area. Having lots of eggs helps animals that need to grow quickly when food is available.

The main reason for making many eggs or seeds is to replace those lost early in life. Most deaths happen when animals are young. If an animal can protect its babies well, it doesn’t need to have many. But if many babies die, the animal must have many babies or the species might disappear. For example, a tree that lives about a thousand years only needs to make one seed every thousand years if that seed always grows safely. So, the number of animals or plants depends only partly on how many eggs or seeds they make.

When we look at nature, we have to remember that every living thing tries hard to have more babies. Each one fights to survive at some point in life. Many young or old animals die each generation or sometimes in waves. If anything reduces this death even a little, the number of that species can grow quickly. Nature is like a soft surface with many sharp wedges pushed in by strong hits, sometimes one wedge, sometimes another.

What stops every species from growing too much is still not clear. The strongest species tend to grow even faster as they get more numerous. We don’t really know what the limits are, even for humans, who we know better than any other animal. Many writers have talked about this, and I will explain some of these limits more in my next work, especially about wild animals in South America. Here, I will just remind you of some main ideas. Usually, eggs or young animals die the most, but not always. For plants, many seeds are destroyed, but I think seedlings suffer most when they try to grow in places already full of other plants.
