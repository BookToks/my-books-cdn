About how things happen in the world, we can at least understand this much—we see that events don’t happen because of random acts of God happening every single time. Instead, they happen because of general rules that are always in effect.

So, in the end, no one should think that studying too much is a bad thing, whether it’s about God’s word or about how the world works. It’s good to keep learning more and more in both religion and science.
