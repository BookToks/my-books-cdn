Fourthly, pigeons have been watched, taken care of, and loved by many people.

They have been kept as pets for thousands of years in many parts of the world. The earliest known record of pigeons is from ancient Egypt, around 3000 B.C. Some say pigeons were even mentioned earlier. During Roman times, pigeons were very valuable, and people even kept track of their family history. Around the year 1600, Akber Khan in India really liked pigeons and always had at least 20,000 with him. He even improved pigeons by breeding different types together, which no one had done before. At the same time, the Dutch were also very interested in pigeons. One reason pigeons have changed so much is because male and female pigeons usually stay together for life, so different types can live in the same place.

I have talked about where domestic pigeons probably came from, but I’m still not sure. When I first kept pigeons and saw how true their babies were to their parents, I found it hard to believe they all came from one original bird. Many people who raise animals or plants believe each breed comes from a different species. For example, a famous cattle breeder would laugh if you said his cattle came from longhorns. I have never met anyone who breeds pigeons, chickens, ducks, or rabbits who thinks their breeds came from the same original species.

Van Mons, who studied pears and apples, didn’t believe different types of apples could come from the same tree. There are many examples like this. The reason is simple: breeders study their animals and plants closely and notice small differences. Even though they know these differences add up over many generations, they don’t always accept that all breeds could come from one species. Maybe scientists who believe species can change over time can learn something from breeders who work with animals and plants every day.

Selection. — Now let’s quickly talk about how domestic breeds have been created, either from one or several related species. Some small changes might happen because of the environment or habits, but no one would say these alone explain the big differences between a work horse and a racehorse, or a greyhound and a bloodhound, or different types of pigeons. One amazing thing about domestic breeds is that they change not to survive better, but to be useful or pretty to people. Some useful changes might happen suddenly, like the fuller's teazle plant, which has hooks that work better than any machine and might have appeared overnight in a seedling.
