Thirdly, can instincts be learned or changed through natural selection? What can we say about an amazing instinct like the one that makes bees build cells, which even smart mathematicians have studied?

Fourthly, why do species that are crossed often become sterile and have sterile babies, while varieties that are crossed stay fertile?

The first two questions—about Instinct and Hybridism—will be talked about in separate chapters.

About the lack of in-between types—natural selection works by saving helpful changes. So, when a new form appears in a full environment, it usually replaces and eventually kills off its less improved parent or other less lucky forms competing with it. This means extinction and natural selection happen together. So, if each species comes from another unknown form, both the parent and all the in-between types are usually wiped out by the new, better form.

But if many in-between forms must have existed, why don’t we find lots of them in the earth’s layers? It’s easier to talk about this in the chapter about the Imperfection of the geological record. Here, I’ll just say that the fossil record is much less complete than most people think. This is mainly because creatures don’t live in very deep seas, and their remains only get preserved when thick layers of sediment cover them. These thick layers only form where a shallow sea slowly sinks, and all these conditions happen very rarely and take a long time. When the sea bed stays still or rises, or when sediment is thin, gaps appear in our geological history. The earth’s crust is like a huge museum, but its natural collections were made only at very distant times.

Some might say that when many related species live in the same place, we should see many in-between forms now. Let’s look at a simple example: when we travel from north to south across a continent, we usually find closely related species appearing one after another, each filling almost the same role in nature.

These related species often meet and overlap; as one becomes rare, the other becomes common until it replaces the first. But if we compare these species where they mix, they are usually just as different from each other as they are when found far apart. According to my idea, these related species come from a common parent. During changes, each got used to its own area and replaced and killed off its original parent and all the in-between types.

So, we shouldn’t expect to find many in-between types in each area today, even though they must have lived there and might be found as fossils.

But in the middle areas, where conditions are in between, why don’t we find closely connecting in-between types now? This question confused me for a long time, but I think there is a good explanation for it.
