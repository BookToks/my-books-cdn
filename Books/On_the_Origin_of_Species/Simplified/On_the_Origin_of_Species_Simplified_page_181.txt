Why do we find bats on remote islands but no other land mammals?

The answer is simple: land mammals can’t cross large oceans, but bats can because they can fly. Bats have even been seen flying far over the Atlantic Ocean during the day. Some bats from North America sometimes visit Bermuda, which is 600 miles away from the mainland. Mr. Tomes, who studies bats, says many bat species live in very different places, like continents and faraway islands. So, it makes sense that bats that travel to new places change over time to fit their new homes. That’s why we find unique bats on islands but no land mammals.

Besides how far islands are from continents, the depth of the sea between them also matters. This affects whether the same or similar mammals live on both the island and the nearby mainland. Mr. Windsor Earl noticed this in the Malay Archipelago, where deep ocean separates some islands and their animals are very different. But islands on shallow underwater banks nearby have animals that are closely related or even the same. There are some exceptions, and human activity has made it tricky to understand everything. Mr. Wallace is studying this area carefully, so we’ll learn more soon. I haven’t studied every place yet, but what I’ve seen mostly fits this idea. For example, Britain and Europe are separated by a shallow channel, and their mammals are the same. Similar facts are true for islands near Australia. The West Indian Islands are on a very deep underwater bank, and their animals are different from those in America. Since the changes in animals depend on how long they’ve been separated, islands separated by shallow seas were probably connected to the mainland more recently. This explains why sea depth relates to how similar island and mainland mammals are—a fact that’s hard to explain if animals were created independently.

Looking at ocean islands, we see few types of animals, lots of unique species in some groups, no groups like frogs, and no land mammals except bats. Also, some plants have unusual features, like herb plants turning into trees. These facts make more sense if animals and plants occasionally arrive by chance over time instead of islands once being connected to continents. If islands had been connected by land, migration would have been more complete, and all living things would have changed more evenly based on how they interact with each other.
