Why do bats have similar bones in their wings and legs when they use them for totally different things? Why does one kind of crustacean with a very complex mouth always have fewer legs, while those with many legs have simpler mouths? Why do the different parts of a flower, like sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, all have the same basic design even though they do very different jobs?

The idea of natural selection helps us understand these questions. In animals with backbones, we see a chain of bones inside with parts sticking out. In animals like insects and crabs, their bodies are made of segments with parts on the outside. In flowering plants, leaves grow in spirals. Having many repeated parts is common in simple or less changed forms. So, it makes sense that the very first animals with backbones had many vertebrae, the first segmented animals had many body parts, and the first flowering plants had many spirals of leaves. Because these parts are repeated so much, they can change in number and shape over time. Natural selection could have picked certain repeated parts and changed them little by little to do very different jobs. That’s why even very different parts still look a bit alike because they come from the same original design passed down by inheritance.

In molluscs, like snails and clams, you can compare parts between different species, but you rarely see many repeated parts in one animal. This is because molluscs don’t have as many repeated body parts as other big groups of animals and plants.

Scientists often say that the skull is made from changed vertebrae, crab jaws from changed legs, and flower parts from changed leaves. But it might be better to say that skulls and vertebrae, jaws and legs, all came from the same original part, not one from the other. Scientists use these ideas as a way to explain things, not meaning the parts actually changed directly into each other. But the changes look so real that it’s hard not to talk about them this way. For example, crab jaws still have many features they would keep if they really had changed from legs over a long time, which supports this idea.

When animals develop before birth, some parts that end up very different look exactly the same in the embryo. Also, embryos of different animals in the same group can look very alike. A good example is when a scientist named Agassiz forgot to label an embryo of a vertebrate and couldn’t tell if it was a mammal, bird, or reptile because they looked so similar.
