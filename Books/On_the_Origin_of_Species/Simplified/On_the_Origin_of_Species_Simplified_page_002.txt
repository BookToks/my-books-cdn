On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.

By Charles Darwin

Introduction

Chapter I Variation under Domestication

Things can change when animals or plants are raised by people. Causes of change include habits, how growth is connected, passing traits to offspring, and the nature of domestic types. It’s hard to tell the difference between varieties and species. Domestic varieties may come from one or more species. Domestic pigeons show many differences and origins. People have been selecting animals and plants for a long time, which affects them. Selection can be done on purpose or without realizing it. We don’t always know how our domestic plants and animals started. Many things help people select what traits they want.

Chapter II Variation under Nature

In the wild, animals and plants also show differences. Individuals are not exactly the same. Some species are hard to identify. Species that live in many places or are common tend to change more. Species in larger groups in a country change more than those in smaller groups. Many species in big groups look like varieties because they are closely but unevenly related and live in limited areas.

Chapter III Struggle for Existence

Survival affects natural selection. This idea is used broadly. Populations can grow very fast. Animals and plants that are introduced to new places can increase quickly. Many things stop unlimited growth. Competition is everywhere. Climate affects survival. Living things protect themselves by their numbers. All animals and plants are connected in nature in complex ways. The hardest competition is between individuals and types of the same species and often between species of the same group. Relationships between living things are the most important.

Chapter IV Natural Selection

Natural selection works like how people choose traits but is more powerful. It can affect small details and works on all ages and both males and females. Sexual selection is part of this. Most breeding happens between members of the same species. Some things help natural selection, like breeding within a group, isolation, and population size. Natural selection works slowly. It can cause species to go extinct. Differences grow over time because of natural selection and extinction. This explains how all living things are grouped.
