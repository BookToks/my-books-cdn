Owen’s drawings clearly show the leg bones of a horse, ox, and rhinoceros.

It’s interesting that some body parts, like teeth in the upper jaws of whales and cows, start to form in embryos but then completely disappear later on. Usually, these tiny or useless parts are bigger compared to nearby parts in embryos than in adults. That means these parts aren’t really “useless” at first. So, when adults have these small leftover parts, it’s often said they still show their early stage from when they were embryos.

I’ve shared the main facts about these leftover body parts. When you think about it, it’s surprising. On one hand, many body parts are perfectly made for certain jobs. But on the other hand, these leftover parts seem useless and imperfect. Some natural history books say these parts exist just to keep the body balanced or complete. But that doesn’t really explain anything, it just repeats the idea. Imagine saying planets orbit the sun in a certain way just to look balanced—that wouldn’t make sense. One scientist said these leftover parts might help get rid of bad stuff in the body. But think about tiny parts in flowers or teeth that disappear in baby cows—can they really do that? When people lose fingers, sometimes small nails still grow on the stump, but it’s not because they help get rid of something. It’s just how growth works. So, leftover nails on animals like manatees probably don’t have that job either.

From my view of evolution, these leftover parts come from changes over time. We see many examples in pets and farm animals, like a tiny tail stump in breeds without tails or small horns in hornless cows, especially in babies. Even in weird animals called monsters, we see parts that didn’t fully develop. But I don’t think these examples explain how leftover parts appear in nature because wild species don’t change suddenly. I believe if an organ isn’t used much, it slowly shrinks over many generations until it’s tiny and useless—like the eyes of animals living in dark caves or the wings of birds on islands where they rarely fly. Sometimes an organ that was once helpful can become harmful, like wings on beetles that live on small islands. In that case, natural selection would keep making the organ smaller until it stopped causing problems and became useless.

Natural selection can make small changes step by step. So, if a body part stops being useful or even becomes harmful, it can slowly change to be helpful for something else.
