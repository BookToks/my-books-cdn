The shape of the pelvis can affect the shape of a baby’s head before it’s born because of pressure. Breathing hard in high places might make the chest bigger. Also, different body parts can be connected to each other. Animals kept by people in different countries often have to work hard to survive, and natural selection happens a bit. Animals with slightly different bodies do better in different climates, and body type and color seem to be linked. A good observer noticed that in cows, how much flies bother them is connected to their color, and some colors make cows more likely to be harmed by certain plants. So, color can change because of natural selection. We don’t know enough to say which laws of change are the most important. I said all this to show that if we can’t fully explain the differences in our farm animals, which come from regular breeding, we shouldn’t worry too much about not understanding small differences between species. I could also talk about differences between human races, which are very clear. Some ideas about sexual selection might help explain those differences, but I won’t go into details here because it might seem silly.

These points make me talk about something some scientists have recently said. They don’t agree with the idea that every part of a body was made just to help the animal survive. They think many parts were made for beauty or just to be different. If that’s true, it would mess up my theory. Still, I agree that many body parts don’t help the animal directly. Physical surroundings probably changed some body parts a bit without helping the animal. When one part changes, other parts often change too, even if those changes don’t help. Also, some traits that used to be useful might come back even if they don’t help now. Sexual selection, where animals look nice to attract mates, only helps in a weak way. The most important thing is that most body parts come from ancestors. So, even if animals fit well where they live, many parts don’t have a direct link to how they live now. For example, we don’t think webbed feet really help the upland goose or frigate-bird now. We don’t think the same bones in a monkey’s arm, a horse’s leg, a bat’s wing, and a seal’s flipper all help those animals in the same way. These parts come from their ancestors. The ancestors of the upland goose and frigate-bird probably had webbed feet that were very useful, like the webbed feet of water birds today. The ancestor of the seal probably had feet with five toes for walking or grabbing, not flippers. The bones in the limbs of monkeys, horses, and bats were probably very useful to their common ancestor, even if they are used differently now. So, these bones were probably shaped by natural selection a long time ago and passed down through inheritance, reversion, and growth connections. This means every little body part in every living thing might have been really useful to an ancestor or is still useful now, either directly or because of how growth works.
