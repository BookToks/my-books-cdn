There are good reasons to think that animals and plants higher up on the "ladder of nature" change faster than those lower down, although there are some exceptions. As Pictet pointed out, the amount of change in living things doesn't always match perfectly with the layers of rocks we find in the earth. So, between two layers, life forms usually haven't changed by the same amount. But if we look at layers that aren’t very close in time, almost all species will have changed in some way. When a species disappears forever, it probably never comes back exactly the same. One tricky example is the 'colonies' found by M. Barrande, which seem to show species coming back after disappearing. But Lyell’s idea that these were just animals moving temporarily from a different place makes more sense.

These facts fit well with my theory. I don’t believe there’s a fixed rule that makes all animals and plants in a place change suddenly or all at once, or by the same amount. Change happens very slowly. Each species changes on its own, separate from others. Whether these changes help the species survive and add up over time depends on lots of things—like if the changes are helpful, how the species mates, how fast it breeds, how the environment slowly changes, and especially how it competes with other species. So it’s not surprising that some species stay the same for a long time, or change very little. We see this in places like Madeira, where land snails and beetles have changed a lot compared to their relatives in Europe, but sea shells and birds haven’t changed much. The faster change in land animals and more complex creatures compared to sea creatures and simpler ones might be because higher animals have more complicated relationships with their environment. When many species in an area improve and adapt, any species that doesn’t change will likely die out. That’s why, over long times, all species in a region tend to change—because those that don’t will go extinct.

Within the same group of animals or plants, the average amount of change over a long time might be about the same. But because the layers of rocks in the earth formed in uneven, irregular ways, the fossils we find in these layers don’t show the same amount of change every time. So, each rock layer doesn’t represent a brand-new creation of life, but just a snapshot taken at a random point in a long, slow process of change.

We can understand why a species, once gone, never returns exactly the same, even if the same living conditions come back. This is because even if a new species adapts to live in the same way as the old one, they won’t be exactly the same. They come from different ancestors and so will have different traits.
