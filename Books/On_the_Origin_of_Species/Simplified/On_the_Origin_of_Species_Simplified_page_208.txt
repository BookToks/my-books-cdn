Sometimes, a body part might keep just one of its old jobs. When a part stops being useful, it can change a lot because natural selection doesn’t stop those changes. Usually, this happens when the animal grows up and is fully active. Because of how traits are passed down at the same age, the smaller or less useful part will show up in adults but not much in embryos. That’s why baby animals often have bigger leftover parts than grown-ups.

If the shrinking of a part was inherited really early in life, the part might disappear completely. Also, the body tends to save energy by not making parts it doesn’t need, which can lead to those useless parts disappearing over time.

Since leftover parts are passed down through families, scientists can use them to figure out how different animals are related. These parts are like letters in a word that don’t change how it sounds but help us understand where the word came from. So, seeing useless or incomplete parts in animals isn’t strange; it fits with the idea that animals come from common ancestors and change over time.

In this chapter, I tried to explain how all living things are connected in groups that fit inside bigger groups. Scientists use these connections to classify animals and plants, paying attention to traits that stay the same, whether they seem important or not. This way of grouping makes sense if we think about animals sharing ancestors and changing through natural selection, which sometimes causes some groups to die out or change in different ways. When scientists group animals, they also include different sexes, ages, and varieties, even if they look quite different.

If we keep using the idea of common ancestors—the only sure reason why living things are similar—we can understand what a natural system is. It’s like a family tree showing levels of difference, called varieties, species, genera, families, orders, and classes.

With this idea of descent and change, all the big facts about body structures make sense. We can see how different animals in a group have similar body parts arranged in the same way, even if they use them for different things. We can also see this pattern inside each animal or plant’s body.
