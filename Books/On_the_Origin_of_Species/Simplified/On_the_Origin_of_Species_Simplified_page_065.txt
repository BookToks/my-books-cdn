If someone believes that every species was created exactly as it is, they would have to say that this shell, for example, was made with bright colors for warm seas. But they would also have to say that this other shell got its bright colors by changing when it moved into warmer or shallower waters.

When a small change helps an animal, it’s hard to know how much of that change comes from natural selection and how much comes from the environment. For example, people who work with animal fur know that animals of the same kind have thicker and better fur when they live in colder places. But no one knows how much of that is because animals with thicker fur survived better over many generations, and how much is because the cold weather itself affects their fur. It seems like the climate does have some direct effect on the hair of animals like pets.

There are examples where the same kind of change happens in very different environments. And there are also examples where different changes happen in the same kind of animal living in the same place. This shows that the environment affects animals in an indirect way.

Also, many naturalists have seen species stay the same, or not change at all, even when they live in very different climates. Because of this, I don’t think the environment directly causes many changes. Instead, the environment seems to affect how animals reproduce, which then causes small changes. Natural selection then builds up these helpful changes over time until we can clearly see them.

Use and disuse also have effects. From what was said earlier, it seems clear that when animals use a body part a lot, it gets stronger and bigger, and if they don’t use it, it gets smaller. These changes can be passed down to their babies. In the wild, we don’t have good examples to compare because we don’t know what the original animals looked like, but some animals have body parts that make sense if we think about disuse.

For example, Professor Owen pointed out that it’s strange to have a bird that can’t fly, but there are several like this. The logger-headed duck in South America can only flap its wings while on water, and its wings are like those of a farm duck. Big birds that live on the ground usually only fly to escape danger, so I think birds on islands with no predators lost their ability to fly because they didn’t need to use their wings. Ostriches live on continents and face danger, but they don’t fly. Instead, they can fight by kicking. We can imagine that ostriches’ ancestors flew like bustards, but over time they got bigger and used their legs more than their wings, so their wings got too weak to fly.

Kirby noticed, and I agree, that many male dung beetles often lose parts of their front feet. He looked at seventeen beetles and none had even a small piece of that foot left. In one type called Onites apelles, the feet are so often lost that it was said they don’t have them at all. In other beetle groups, the feet are there but very small. In the Egyptian sacred beetle, the feet are completely missing. There isn’t enough proof to say that losing parts like this is passed down through families. I think the missing feet in some beetles happened because their ancestors stopped using them for a long time. Since the feet fall off early in life, the beetles probably don’t use them much.
