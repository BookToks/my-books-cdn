If you looked at a dead water-ouzel, you wouldn’t guess it spends a lot of time underwater. Even though it’s part of a family of birds that live on land, it actually dives underwater—holding onto stones with its feet and using its wings to swim.

Some people believe every animal was made exactly as it is now, but they might get confused when they see animals with habits and body parts that don’t seem to match. For example, ducks and geese have webbed feet for swimming, but some upland geese with webbed feet hardly ever go near water. The frigate-bird has all its toes webbed but almost never lands on the sea. On the other hand, birds like grebes and coots live in water even though their toes only have a little webbing. The long toes of some birds seem made for walking on swamps, but some of those birds live more on land. In many cases, an animal’s habits change but its body doesn’t change much. So, the webbed feet of upland geese don’t help much anymore, but the feet still look the same. In frigate-birds, the webbing is changing shape, showing the body is slowly adapting.

People who think each animal was created separately might say that the Creator made these animals to fill different roles. But this just repeats the fact in fancy words. People who believe in natural selection know that every animal tries to have more babies, and if one animal changes even a little bit in a way that helps it survive better, it can take over the place of another animal, even if it’s very different. So it makes sense that geese and frigate-birds have webbed feet but live mostly on land, or that some birds live in places you wouldn’t expect, like woodpeckers where there are no trees, or diving thrushes that act like other water birds.

The eye is an amazing and complicated organ. It can focus on things at different distances, control how much light gets in, and fix problems with vision. It seems impossible that something so complex could have formed through natural selection. But if we can find many small steps from a simple eye to a perfect one, and if those small changes help the animal survive and are passed on, then it’s not so unbelievable. How a nerve can become sensitive to light is a mystery, just like how life began, but some evidence suggests that nerves can become sensitive to light and sound over time.

To understand how an organ like the eye got better over time, we should look at an animal’s ancestors. But since we can’t usually find them, we look at related species instead. These species share a common ancestor, so by comparing them we can see possible steps in how an organ might have developed and improved.
