Natural Selection needs certain conditions to work well. It’s a complicated topic. It helps if there’s a lot of inherited differences between individuals, but even just small differences can be enough. Having many individuals is important because it gives a better chance for helpful changes to show up. Even though nature gives a lot of time for natural selection to happen, it doesn’t last forever. All living things compete to survive, so if a species doesn’t improve as much as its competitors, it might die out.

When humans breed animals or plants, they pick the ones with traits they want. If animals breed randomly, it can mess up this process. But even if people don’t try to change a breed, if many breeders pick the best animals, the breed slowly improves over time, even if some less good animals are mixed in. The same happens in nature. In a small area with some space to fill, natural selection helps keep the individuals that have useful differences, so they can better fit that space.

If the area is big, different parts will have different living conditions. Natural selection will change the species in each part, but animals from different parts will mix where these areas meet. This mixing makes it hard for natural selection to make all individuals perfectly fit their local conditions because the environment changes gradually between places. Animals that travel a lot, like birds, and don’t breed fast, usually have their different versions in separate countries. This is probably true.

Some animals that don’t travel much, or ones that breed quickly, can form a new improved group in one place. This group can mostly breed with itself, so it keeps its special traits. Later, this new group might slowly spread to other places.

Gardeners know this too. They like to get seeds from many plants of the same kind because it lowers the chance of mixing with other kinds.

Even for animals that breed slowly and travel, mixing doesn’t always stop natural selection. I have many examples where different versions of the same animal live in one area but stay separate because they live in different places, breed at different times, or prefer to mate with their own kind.

Mixing helps keep animals and plants of the same kind looking similar. It works best for animals that mate once for each birth. But we believe that some mixing happens with all animals and plants sometimes.
