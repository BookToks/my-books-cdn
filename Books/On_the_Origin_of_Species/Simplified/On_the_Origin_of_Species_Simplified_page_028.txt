It's clear that the two types are definitely different from each other. But they are connected by many in-between forms, and it’s unlikely these are just mixes. There’s a lot of evidence showing they come from the same parents, so they should be considered varieties.

If you look closely, most scientists will agree on how to classify confusing forms. But it’s true that the most confusing forms are found in well-studied places. I’ve noticed that if an animal or plant is really useful or interesting to people, many varieties of it are recorded. Sometimes, some experts even call these varieties separate species. For example, the common oak tree has been studied a lot, yet one German scientist calls more than a dozen species what most people see as just varieties. In this country, top experts argue about whether certain oaks are separate species or just varieties.

When a new scientist starts studying a group of plants or animals they don’t know, it’s hard at first to tell what differences mean they are different species or just varieties. This shows that variation is very common. But if they focus on one type of organism in one country, they will soon figure out how to classify most confusing forms.

At first, they will probably call many forms different species because they notice a lot of differences, just like bird or chicken breeders do. They don’t yet know about how much variation happens in other groups or places to help them decide. As they study more, they will find more tricky cases because there are many similar forms. But with enough study, they usually figure out which are varieties and which are species, even if other scientists argue about it. When they study related forms from far apart places, where they can’t find the middle forms, it gets even harder and they have to guess more.

No one has drawn a clear line between species and sub-species (which are forms close to species but not quite), or between sub-species and well-defined varieties, or between small varieties and individual differences. These differences blend together in a way that feels like a smooth transition.

So, I think small individual differences, though not very important for classification, are very important for us because they are the first step toward small varieties that are barely recorded. And slightly more obvious and lasting varieties lead to stronger and more lasting varieties; those lead to sub-species, and then to species. Moving from one level of difference to the next might sometimes be caused by long-term physical differences in two areas, but I don’t believe this much. Instead, I think natural selection causes a variety to gradually change more and more from its parent by building up differences in certain directions.
