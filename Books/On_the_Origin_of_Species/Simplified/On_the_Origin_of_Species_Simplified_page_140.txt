When different types of animals or plants go back to where they originally came from, they might change just a little bit. Because of these small changes, many scientists who study fossils would call them new and different species.

If this idea is true, then we shouldn’t expect to find tons of in-between forms in the rocks that show how one species changed into another. Instead, we should only find a few examples—some very closely related, some less so. Even if these examples are found in different layers of rock, most scientists would still call them different species. I wouldn’t have guessed how few examples we’d find if it wasn’t for the problem that we hardly ever discover many of these in-between links between species that show up at the start and end of each rock layer.

Sometimes, whole groups of related species seem to appear suddenly in certain rock layers. Some scientists, like Agassiz, Pictet, and especially Professor Sedgwick, have used this to argue against the idea that species slowly change over time. If many species really appeared all at once, it would go against the idea that species slowly evolved from common ancestors. This slow process should have taken a very long time, with the original ancestors living far before their changed descendants.

But we often think the fossil record is better than it really is. Just because we haven’t found certain groups in older layers doesn’t mean they didn’t exist then. We forget that the Earth is huge, and we’ve only studied a small part of it carefully. Species could have lived and slowly changed in other places before showing up in the areas we study, like Europe or the United States. Also, there might be big gaps of time between the layers we find. These gaps could have given species enough time to multiply and change, so when we find them in the next layer, it looks like they appeared suddenly.

I also mentioned before that it might take a very long time for a species to develop a new skill, like learning to fly. But once a few species get this new skill and an advantage, it wouldn’t take long for many different kinds to develop and spread all over the world.

Now, I’ll give some examples to show how easy it is to be wrong about thinking whole groups of species suddenly appeared. For example, not long ago, scientists thought mammals suddenly showed up at the start of the tertiary period. But now, we’ve found lots of fossil mammals from the middle of the secondary period, and even one true mammal from very early in that time.
