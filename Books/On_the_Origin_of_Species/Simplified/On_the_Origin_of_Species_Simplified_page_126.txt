In this case, manipulating the plants couldn’t have caused harm because the plants have separate male and female parts. No one thinks these types of maize are different species. It’s important to notice that the hybrid plants made from these varieties could still have babies, so even Gartner didn’t think they were separate species.

Girou de Buzareingues crossed three types of gourd, which also have separate sexes like maize. He says it’s harder for them to fertilize each other if they are more different. I’m not sure how reliable these tests are, but Sagaret, who classified these plants mostly by whether they could produce babies, says they are just varieties.

The next example is even more surprising and almost hard to believe. It comes from many years of experiments on nine species of Verbascum by Gartner, who was a careful observer but didn’t want to believe in hybrids. He found that yellow and white types of the same Verbascum species made less seed when crossed than when they were crossed with the same color. Also, when yellow and white types of one species were crossed with yellow and white types of a different species, more seed was made when the colors matched than when they were different colors. The only difference between these types is flower color, and sometimes one type can grow from the seed of the other.

From what I have seen with some hollyhock varieties, I think similar things happen.

Kolreuter, who was very careful and whose work has been confirmed by others, found something interesting with tobacco plants. One variety of common tobacco made more babies when crossed with a very different species than the other varieties did. He tested five varieties by crossing them in both directions and found their hybrid offspring could have babies too. But one variety, when crossed with Nicotiana glutinosa in either parent role, always made hybrids that were less sterile than those from the other four varieties crossed with N. glutinosa. This means the reproductive system of this one variety must have changed in some way.

From all these facts, and because it’s hard to tell if varieties can’t have babies in nature, since infertile ones usually get called species, and because humans only pick visible traits when making different domestic types, and because they don’t want or can’t make hidden changes in how plants reproduce, I don’t think it’s true that all varieties are always fertile. The fact that varieties are usually fertile doesn’t prove they are different from species. Fertility differences seem to happen because of slow changes, especially in how plants reproduce, and not because fertility or infertility is a special, built-in trait.
