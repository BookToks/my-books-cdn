One evening, I visited another group of F. sanguinea ants and saw many of them going into their nest carrying dead F. fusca ants and lots of pupae. This showed they were not moving to a new place. I followed the ants carrying their "loot" for about forty yards to a thick bunch of heath plants. I saw the last F. sanguinea ant come out, carrying a pupa, but I couldn’t find the empty nest in the thick plants. The nest had to be nearby because a few F. fusca ants were running around nervously, and one was sitting still on a branch with its own pupa in its mouth, right above the damaged home.

These facts show the amazing instinct these ants have for making slaves. It’s interesting to compare the habits of F. sanguinea with those of F. rufescens. F. rufescens doesn’t build its own nest, doesn’t decide when to move, doesn’t gather food, and can’t even feed itself. It depends completely on its many slaves. Meanwhile, F. sanguinea has fewer slaves, especially early in the summer. The master ants decide when and where to build a new nest, and when they move, the masters carry the slaves. In both Switzerland and England, the slaves take care of the larvae, while the masters go on slave-making missions. In Switzerland, both slaves and masters work together to build the nest and collect food, with slaves doing most of the work caring for aphids, which they “milk” for food. In England, the masters usually leave the nest to get building materials and food for the whole colony.

So in England, the masters get less help from their slaves than in Switzerland.

I don’t want to guess how the slave-making instinct of F. sanguinea started. But I have seen ants that don’t make slaves carry pupae of other species if they’re near their nests. Maybe these pupae were first kept as food but then developed into ants. These ants would follow their natural instincts and do the work they could.

If having these slaves helped the species that captured them, and it was better to keep workers than to raise their own, then natural selection might make the habit of collecting pupae stronger and permanent, just to raise slaves. Once the instinct started, natural selection could slowly improve it—if each change helped the species—until an ant depended totally on its slaves, like Formica rufescens does.

Now about how Hive-Bees make their cells. I won’t go into all the details but will share my main thoughts. Anyone who looks at a beehive’s comb can’t help but admire it. Mathematicians say bees have solved a tricky problem by making cells that hold the most honey with the least wax. It’s been said that even a skilled worker would find it hard to make these cells exactly right, but bees do it perfectly while working in dark hives. No matter what instincts you think they have, it’s amazing and hard to imagine how they make all the exact angles and know when it’s done correctly.
