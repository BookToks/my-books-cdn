Mistletoe depends on birds to spread its seeds. You can think of it like a competition with other plants that have fruits, trying to get birds to eat its seeds instead of others. This kind of competition is what I call the struggle for existence.

This struggle happens because all living things tend to have lots of babies. Every animal or plant that makes many eggs or seeds will lose some of them at some point. If they didn’t, their numbers would grow so fast that the Earth couldn’t support them all. So, since more babies are made than can survive, living things have to compete with others of their kind, with different species, or with their environment to stay alive.

This idea is based on what Malthus said about human populations, but it applies even more to animals and plants. Unlike humans, they can’t control how much food they get or when to have babies. Some species might be growing in number, but not all can keep growing forever because the world can’t fit everyone.

Every living thing grows its numbers so fast that if none died, the Earth would be covered by their offspring. Even humans, who have fewer babies, have doubled their population in 25 years. If this kept up, there wouldn’t be space for anyone in just a few thousand years. A scientist named Linnaeus said that if a plant made only two seeds each year, in 20 years those seeds would turn into a million plants. Elephants breed very slowly, but even if one pair had babies every 30 years, after 500 years there could be 15 million elephants from just that first pair.

We also have real examples, not just math, that show how fast animals can grow when conditions are good for a few years. Wild animals like cattle and horses in South America and Australia have increased quickly, and it’s hard to believe unless you trust the reports. Plants can spread fast too. Some plants from Europe now cover large areas in other parts of the world in less than ten years. Some plants brought from America now grow all over India. This isn’t because these plants or animals suddenly became more fertile, but because their new homes gave them better chances to survive and have babies. When conditions are good, the number of animals and plants grows in a way that explains why they spread so fast and far in new places.
