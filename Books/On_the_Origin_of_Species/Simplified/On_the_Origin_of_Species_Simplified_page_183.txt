Many similar examples could be given. It’s almost always true that the unique plants and animals on islands are related to those on the closest continent or nearby islands. There are only a few exceptions, and most can be explained.

For example, the plants on Kerguelen Land are closer to American plants than African ones, even though the island is nearer to Africa. This makes sense if seeds came to the island on icebergs from America, carried by ocean currents. New Zealand’s unique plants are much more like Australia’s, the closest mainland, which is expected. But they are also related to South America’s plants, even though South America is very far away. This is less strange if you consider that long ago, New Zealand, South America, and other southern lands might have gotten plants from the Antarctic islands, which had vegetation before the Ice Age started. There’s also a small link between some plants in southwestern Australia and the Cape of Good Hope, which is a surprising connection that scientists don’t fully understand yet, but it only applies to plants.

There’s a rule that animals and plants on groups of islands, called archipelagos, are often different species but closely related to those on the nearest continent. This can also be seen within the same group of islands. For example, the islands of the Galapagos have species that are very closely related but mostly different on each island. This makes sense because the islands are close together, so they probably got their plants and animals from the same sources or from each other.

However, some people might wonder why these islands, which are so close and similar in climate and geography, have different species that are only slightly changed from each other. This was a big question for me. The answer is that the physical environment isn’t the only important factor. The other living things that each species has to compete with are just as important, or even more so. When we look at the animals and plants on the Galapagos that also live elsewhere in the world (not the unique species that only live there), we see differences between the islands. This fits with the idea that seeds or animals arrived by chance, like a seed landing on one island and a different one on another.

When a new species settled on one or more islands, or spread between islands, it faced different living conditions because it had to compete with different sets of plants and animals. For example, a plant might find better spots taken by different plants on each island or face different enemies. If the species changed a bit, natural selection would favor different versions on different islands. Some species, though, spread widely and stayed mostly the same, like some plants and animals on continents.
