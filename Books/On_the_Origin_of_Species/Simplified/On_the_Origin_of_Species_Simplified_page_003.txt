Chapter V Laws of Variation

How outside conditions affect living things — Using or not using body parts, combined with natural selection — Body parts for flying and seeing — Getting used to new environments — How growth in one part can affect another — Balancing growth and saving energy — Mistaken connections — Simple and less developed body parts change more — Body parts that develop in unusual ways change a lot: traits specific to a species change more than traits shared by a group — Differences between males and females change — Species in the same group change in similar ways — Sometimes old traits come back — Summary.

Chapter VI Difficulties on Theory

Problems with the idea that species change over time — How one species changes into another — Missing or rare in-between forms — Changes in how animals live — Different habits in the same species — Species with very different habits than their relatives — Perfect body parts — How changes happen — Difficult examples — Nature does not make big jumps — Small body parts — Body parts aren’t always perfect — The idea that all animals share a basic plan and live under certain conditions fits with natural selection.

Chapter VII Instinct

Instincts are like habits but start differently — Instincts can be simple or complex — Aphids and ants — Instincts can change — Instincts in pets come from nature — Natural instincts in cuckoos, ostriches, and parasitic bees — Ants that make slaves — Honeybees and how they build cells — Problems with the idea that instincts come from natural selection — Worker insects that can’t have babies — Summary.

Chapter VIII Hybridism

Difference between babies from different species and hybrids — Sterility (not being able to have babies) can be different in degree, not always total, can be caused by close breeding, and can be fixed by breeding in captivity — Rules about hybrid sterility — Sterility is not a special feature but happens because of other differences — Causes of sterility in first crosses and hybrids — Similar effects from changing environment and crossing species — Varieties don’t always produce fertile babies when crossed — Comparing hybrids and mixed breeds without thinking about fertility — Summary.

Chapter IX On the Imperfection of the Geological Record

Why we don’t see many in-between species today — What extinct in-between species were like and how many there were — How long time has passed, based on how land changes and rocks form — How incomplete our fossil collections are — Gaps in rock layers — Why in-between species don’t appear in one rock layer — Why many new groups of species seem to appear suddenly — Why they also seem to appear suddenly in the oldest fossil layers we know.
