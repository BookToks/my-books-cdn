Sometimes, animals or plants don’t live in certain areas because they died out there. We don’t fully understand all the climate and land changes the Earth has gone through recently, but these changes made it easier for species to move around. For example, the Ice Age had a big impact on where animals and plants lived all over the world. We still don’t know much about how species might have traveled from place to place. When different but related species live far apart, it’s because changes happened slowly over a long time, giving them many chances to spread out.

According to natural selection, there must have been many forms connecting different species, kind of like the small differences we see in animals today. You might wonder why we don’t see all these in-between forms around us. The thing is, we usually only find links between living species and ones that are already extinct. Even in places where two similar species live close to each other, we might not find many in-between types because only a few species change at a time, and the changes happen slowly. Also, these in-between types can get replaced by the more common, stronger species nearby, so they often disappear.

If many connecting forms existed and then died out, why don’t we find their fossils everywhere? Why don’t fossil collections show clear evidence of these gradual changes? This is a strong argument against my idea. Also, why do groups of related species sometimes seem to appear suddenly in the fossil record? Why don’t we find older layers filled with the ancestors of these species? According to my idea, these old layers should exist somewhere.

I can only explain these questions by saying that the fossil record is much less complete than most scientists think. It’s not because there wasn’t enough time for changes to happen—there has been way more time than we can imagine. Plus, the number of fossils we have is tiny compared to all the animals and plants that have ever lived.
