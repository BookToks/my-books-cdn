But I think that a very important expert, Sir Charles Lyell, might have serious doubts about this topic after thinking more about it. I know it’s risky to disagree with such respected people, because we owe them a lot of what we know. People who believe the geological record is pretty complete, and don’t think much about the other evidence I’ve shared, will probably reject my idea right away. For me, using Lyell’s example, I see the geological record like a world history that’s not fully kept and is written in a language that changes over time. We only have the most recent part, and only from a few places. Even that part is incomplete, with just some short chapters and a few lines here and there. Each word in this slowly changing language might explain why life forms seem to change suddenly in the different rock layers. If we think about it this way, many problems I mentioned before become much smaller or even go away.

Chapter X talks about how new species slowly appear one after another and how they change at different speeds. Once a species is gone, it never comes back. Groups of species follow the same general patterns of appearing and disappearing as individual species do. The chapter also covers extinction, worldwide changes in life forms at the same time, how extinct species are related to each other and to living ones, how ancient creatures developed, and how the same types appear again in the same places. It sums up what was said in earlier chapters.

Now, let’s check if the facts about how living things show up in the geological record fit better with the idea that species never change, or with the idea that they slowly change over time through descent and natural selection.

New species have shown up very slowly, one after another, both on land and in water.

Lyell showed that it’s almost impossible to ignore this fact when looking at different stages of the Tertiary period. Every year, scientists find more connections between these stages, making the appearance and disappearance of species seem more gradual. In some of the newest rock layers, even though they’re very old, only one or two species disappeared and only one or two new species appeared for the first time, either in that area or anywhere on Earth. Philippi’s observations in Sicily suggest that changes in sea creatures there happened slowly and step by step. Older rock layers are less complete, but as Bronn pointed out, the appearance and disappearance of extinct species didn’t happen all at once in those layers.

Different kinds of species have changed at different speeds and amounts. In the oldest Tertiary layers, you can still find some living types of shells among many extinct ones. Falconer shared a clear example of this with a living crocodile found alongside many strange extinct mammals and reptiles in the sub-Himalayan area. The Silurian Lingula (a shellfish) looks almost the same as its living relatives today, while most other Silurian shellfish and all crustaceans have changed a lot. Land animals seem to change faster than sea animals, which was clearly seen recently in Switzerland.
