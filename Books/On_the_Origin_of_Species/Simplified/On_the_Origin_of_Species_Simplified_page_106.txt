The problem isn’t as hard as it first seems: all this amazing work probably comes from just a few simple instincts.

I started looking into this because of Mr. Waterhouse, who showed that the shape of a cell depends a lot on the cells next to it. The idea I’m sharing might just be a small change to his theory. Let’s think about the idea of gradual change and see if Nature shows us how she works.

At one end of the scale, we have humble-bees. They use their old cocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding short wax tubes, and make separate, messy round wax cells. At the other end, we have hive-bees, whose cells are in double layers. Each cell is a hexagonal prism, with the bottom edges shaped to fit a pyramid made of three diamond shapes. These diamonds have certain angles, and the pyramid base of one cell also fits into the bases of three cells on the other side of the comb.

Between these two, there are the cells of the Mexican Melipona domestica bee, described by Pierre Huber. The Melipona is between the humble-bee and hive-bee but closer to the humble-bee. It makes a wax comb of round cells where its babies hatch, plus some large, almost spherical cells to hold honey. These big cells are packed close together so they would overlap if they were full spheres, but the bees build flat wax walls between them to stop this.

So, each cell has a round outer part and two or more flat walls where it touches other cells. When one cell touches three others, the flat walls form a pyramid, which is a rough copy of the pyramidal base in hive-bee cells. Like hive-bee cells, the flat walls of one cell are also part of its neighbors’ cells. This way, Melipona bees save wax because the flat walls aren’t double-thick—they’re just one wall shared by two cells.

Thinking about this, I realized that if Melipona made its spheres a little farther apart, all equal in size, and arranged them in two layers, the structure might be just as perfect as a hive-bee’s comb. So, I wrote to Professor Miller at Cambridge, who checked my idea and said it’s exactly right:

If you place equal spheres in two parallel layers, with each sphere’s center about 1.414 times its radius away from six neighbors in the same layer and the same distance from spheres in the other layer, and then cut flat walls where the spheres meet, you get a double layer of hexagonal prisms joined by pyramidal bases made of three diamonds. These shapes and angles match perfectly with the best measurements of hive-bee cells.
