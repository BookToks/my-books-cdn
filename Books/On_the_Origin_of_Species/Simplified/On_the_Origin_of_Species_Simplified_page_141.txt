Cuvier used to say that no monkeys were found in any rocks from the tertiary period. But now, scientists have found extinct monkeys in India, South America, and even Europe, going back as far as the eocene stage.

The most surprising example is whales. Since whales have huge bones, live in the ocean, and are found worldwide, people thought it was strange that no whale bones were found in older rocks called secondary formations. This made them believe whales suddenly appeared between the latest secondary and the earliest tertiary periods. But in 1858, new evidence showed that whales actually lived even before the end of the secondary period.

I have another example that really surprised me. I studied fossil barnacles (called sessile cirripedes) and noticed that many species from the tertiary period were found all over the world in different water depths. The fossils were well preserved, so I thought that if barnacles had lived in the secondary period, we would have found their fossils. Since we hadn’t found any, I believed barnacles suddenly appeared at the start of the tertiary period. This bothered me because it seemed like another group of species appeared suddenly.

But soon after, a paleontologist named M. Bosquet sent me a drawing of a perfect barnacle fossil from chalk rocks in Belgium, which are from the secondary period. Even more surprising, this barnacle was a Chthamalus, a common type that hasn’t been found in tertiary rocks yet. This proved that barnacles did exist during the secondary period and might have been the ancestors of many later species.

Another group that seems to appear suddenly is teleostean fishes, which include most fish alive today. Some scientists think these fish appeared suddenly at the start of the chalk period. But this wouldn’t be a big problem for my theory unless it was shown that they appeared everywhere in the world at the same time.

It’s important to remember that very few fossil fish have been found from south of the equator. Also, only a few fish species are known from different European rock layers. Some fish families today live in small areas, so teleostean fishes might have started in one sea and then spread out.

We also can’t assume that the world’s seas have always been connected like they are now. Even today, if certain land areas like the Malay Archipelago were dry land, the Indian Ocean would be a large, closed sea. In such a place, marine animals could grow and stay isolated until they adapted to colder waters and spread to other oceans by moving around southern Africa or Australia.
