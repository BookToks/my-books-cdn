Thin wax is very flexible, so I don’t think it’s hard for bees working on both sides of a wax strip to know when they have made it thin enough and then stop. When I looked at normal combs, I saw that bees don’t always work at the same speed on both sides. Sometimes, one side of a cell looked a bit curved in, and the other side curved out. I think this happened because the bees chewed away too fast on one side and slower on the other. In one clear case, I put the comb back in the hive and let the bees keep working. When I checked again, the thin wax plate between the cells was perfectly flat. It was so thin that they couldn’t have flattened it by chewing the curved side. I think the bees stood in the cells on opposite sides and pushed the warm, soft wax into a flat shape, which is easy to do.

From an experiment with a line of red wax, we can see that if bees made a thin wax wall by themselves, they could make the cells the right shape by standing the right distance apart, chewing at the same speed, and making equal round hollows without breaking into each other. Bees actually build a rough wall or rim all around the comb. They chew into this rim from both sides, always working in circles as they make each cell deeper. They don’t make the whole bottom of the cell at once, only the thin plate at the edge, or two plates if needed. They don’t finish the top edges of these plates until they start making the hexagonal walls. Some of this is different from what the famous Huber said, but I’m sure this is right. I could explain more if I had space.

Huber said the first cell starts by digging into a thick wall of wax, but I’ve never seen that. Instead, it begins with a small wax hood. I won’t go into details here. Excavating (chewing out) is very important in making cells, but it would be wrong to think bees can’t build a rough wall in the right place—the line where two round shapes meet. I have several examples that show they can do this. Even in the rough rim around a new comb, you can sometimes see bends where the base plates of future cells will be. But the rough wax wall always needs to be finished by chewing a lot on both sides. The way bees build is interesting: they first make a rough wall that is 10 to 20 times thicker than the thin final wall of the cell.

Think of it like masons piling up a big ridge of cement, then cutting it down evenly on both sides near the bottom until only a thin, smooth wall remains in the middle. The masons keep piling the cut-off cement back on top and add new cement, so the thin wall grows upward with a big thick ridge on top. Because all cells, both new and finished, have this strong thick ridge on top, bees can crawl and hang on the comb without breaking the tiny hexagonal walls, which are only about one four-hundredth of an inch thick. The base plates are about twice as thick.
