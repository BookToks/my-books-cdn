The same organ can do very different jobs at the same time, and later it may become specialized for just one job. Also, two different organs might do the same job together, with one getting better while helped by the other. This probably made changes easier.

We don’t know enough to say any part of an animal is unimportant for its survival. Changes in its structure could have slowly built up through natural selection. But we can be sure that many changes, caused just by how living things grow and not helpful at first, were later used by future generations in a useful way.

Sometimes, a part that used to be very important is kept even when it’s not very useful anymore. For example, land animals still have tails like their water-living ancestors. These parts might not have been made by natural selection because they don’t help much now, but they stayed anyway.

Natural selection doesn’t create things just to help or hurt other species. It makes body parts, organs, or chemicals that can be very helpful or harmful to other species, but they always help the animal they belong to. In any place, natural selection mostly works through competition between animals living there. So, animals become stronger or better based on how tough the competition is in their home. That’s why animals from smaller places often lose to animals from bigger places. Bigger places have more animals and more types, so the competition is harder, making animals there better adapted. Natural selection doesn’t always make things perfect, and we probably can’t find perfect things anywhere.

With natural selection, we understand an old idea in nature: “Nature does not make jumps.” This means changes happen slowly over time. If we only look at animals living now, it might not seem true, but if we include all animals from the past, it is true according to this theory.

It’s generally accepted that all living things follow two big rules—Unity of Type and Conditions of Existence. Unity of Type means that animals in the same group have similar body structures, no matter how they live. According to my theory, this happens because they all come from the same ancestors. Conditions of Existence, a concept emphasized by the scientist Cuvier, fits well with natural selection. Natural selection changes animals so their parts fit their environment, either now or in the past. These changes are helped by use or disuse, affected a bit by the environment, and follow growth rules. So, the law of Conditions of Existence is the most important because it includes Unity of Type through inherited changes.

Chapter VII talks about Instinct. Instincts are like habits but start differently. Instincts can be simple or complex. It covers things like aphids and ants, how instincts can change, where domestic animal instincts come from, natural instincts of animals like cuckoos and ostriches, and even ants that make slaves. It also looks at how bees build their cells, problems with the idea of instincts evolving by natural selection, and sterile insects. The chapter ends with a summary.
