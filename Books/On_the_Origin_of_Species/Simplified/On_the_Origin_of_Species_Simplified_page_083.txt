First, we need to be really careful when we assume that because a place is connected now, it has always been connected for a long time. Geology shows us that many continents were broken into islands even not too long ago. On these islands, different species could have developed separately without any mix between them. Changes in land shape and climate mean that places in the ocean that are connected now might not have been so connected in the past. But I won’t focus too much on this idea because I believe many clear species have formed in areas that have always been connected. Still, the fact that some areas used to be broken up probably helped new species form, especially animals that move around a lot.

When we look at where species live now, they usually cover a big area but become less common near the edges and then disappear. So, the empty space between two similar species is usually smaller than the areas each species lives in. We see this on mountains too, where some species suddenly stop existing at certain heights. Scientists have noticed the same thing in the ocean depths. People who think climate and physical conditions are the main reasons for where species live might find this surprising because those conditions change slowly and smoothly. But we have to remember that each species depends on others—it might compete with them, eat them, or be eaten by them. So, where a species lives doesn’t just depend on the environment but also on other species around it. Because species don’t blend slowly into each other, the area where one species lives tends to have clear boundaries. Also, at the edges where a species is rare, changes in predators, prey, or seasons can easily wipe it out, making these boundaries even clearer.

If I’m right that related species living in the same area usually have large ranges with small areas between them where they become rare, then the same idea should apply to varieties within a species. If we imagine a species living across a big area, then two varieties would live in two large areas, and a third variety would live in a small area in between. This middle variety would be less common because it lives in a smaller area. From what I’ve seen, this seems true in nature. I’ve found clear examples of this with varieties in a genus called Balanus. Others have told me that when varieties exist between two forms, they are usually rarer than the forms they connect. If we trust these facts, it helps explain why intermediate varieties don’t last long. Usually, they get wiped out sooner than the main forms they link together.
