We can see this happening recently in parts of the United States, where one kind of swallow has caused another kind to become fewer. In Scotland, the missel-thrush has grown in number, which has made the song-thrush decrease. We often hear about one type of rat taking over the place of another, even in very different climates! In Russia, a small Asian cockroach has pushed out a bigger kind. One type of charlock plant can replace another, and this happens in other cases too.

We can guess that competition is strongest between species that are closely related because they live in almost the same way. But we usually can’t say exactly why one species wins over another in the struggle to survive.

An important idea comes from this: the body of every living thing is connected in important ways to other living things. They compete for food or homes, try to escape from each other, or hunt each other. For example, the teeth and claws of a tiger are made for hunting, and the legs and claws of a parasite living on the tiger’s fur are made for holding on.

At first, the way dandelion seeds have pretty feathers, or how water-beetles have flat, fringed legs, seems only related to air and water. But the feathers on dandelion seeds help them spread far and land on empty ground, which is important because the land already has many plants.

The water-beetle’s legs help it dive, so it can compete with other water insects, catch its own food, and avoid being eaten.

Seeds of many plants store food inside them. This seems unrelated to other plants at first. But since young plants like peas and beans grow strong from these seeds when planted in tall grass, the food inside seeds probably helps young plants grow well when they have to compete with other plants nearby.

If you look at a plant in the middle of where it lives, why doesn’t it grow a lot more? The plant can handle a bit more heat, cold, wetness, or dryness because it lives in areas that are hotter or colder, damper or drier. So, if we imagine giving the plant the power to grow more, it would need some advantage over other plants or animals that eat it.

At the edges of where a plant can live, being able to handle the climate better would help it. But only a few plants or animals live so far out that the weather alone kills them. Even in very cold or dry places, some species still compete with others for the best spots.

This also shows that when a plant or animal moves to a new place with new competitors, even if the climate is the same, its life will change a lot. To help it grow more in the new place, we would have to change it in a different way than before, giving it an advantage over the new competitors or enemies.
