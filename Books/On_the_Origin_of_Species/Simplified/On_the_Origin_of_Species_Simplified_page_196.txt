It’s the same with fishes.

Different groups of animals have changed little by little over time to live in similar places—like on land, in the air, or in water. Because of this, sometimes we notice that groups in different animal classes look like they match up in numbers. Scientists who saw these patterns sometimes changed how they grouped animals to make the matches fit better. That’s probably how we got different ways to classify animals into groups of seven, five, four, or three.

Animals that come from successful groups usually keep the good traits that helped their ancestors do well. These animals spread out and take over many places in nature. So, bigger and stronger groups tend to grow even bigger and replace smaller, weaker ones. That’s why all animals, living and extinct, fall into just a few big groups and classes, all part of one big natural system. For example, when Australia was discovered, scientists didn’t find any new big groups of insects, and only a few small new plant groups showed up.

In a chapter about how life changed over time, I explained that old types of animals often had features that were kind of in-between what we see in today’s groups. Some ancient animals changed very little and their descendants still exist today; these are called “aberrant” or unusual groups. The more unusual a group is, the more missing links we think there must have been that disappeared over time. We see that these unusual groups usually have very few species left, and those species are very different from each other, which shows many relatives have gone extinct. For example, the platypus and the lungfish are unusual and each has only one species left. These rare groups probably failed to compete with more successful animals, and only a few survived by luck.

Mr. Waterhouse pointed out that when an animal in one group seems related to a very different group, the similarities are usually broad and not specific to just one species. For example, the bizcacha, a type of rodent, is somewhat like marsupials, but it doesn’t closely match any one marsupial species. These shared traits likely come from common ancestors.

So, we have to think either that all rodents, including the bizcacha, came from a very old marsupial ancestor that had traits between today’s marsupials, or that rodents and marsupials both came from a shared ancestor long ago and then changed in different ways over time.
