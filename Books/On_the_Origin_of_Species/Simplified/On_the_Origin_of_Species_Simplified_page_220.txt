If someone comes to believe that species can change, it would help a lot if they honestly share their opinion. This is the only way to get rid of the strong biases around this topic.

Recently, some well-known scientists have said that many supposed species in each group aren’t really separate species. But they also say some species are real and were created independently. I find this idea strange. They admit that many forms, which they used to think were specially created and still mostly are, have actually changed over time. But they won’t apply this idea to other very similar forms. They can’t even say which species were created and which came from changes. They accept change in some cases but reject it in others without a clear reason. One day, people will look back and see this as an example of how people stuck to their beliefs without proof. These scientists act like creating species by magic is as normal as birth. But do they really believe that many times in Earth’s history, lifeless atoms suddenly turned into living things? Do they think each creation made one or many individuals? Were all animals and plants made from eggs, seeds, or as adults? And for mammals, were they made with signs of being fed inside their mothers? While scientists ask for full explanations from those who believe species change, they ignore the question of how species first appeared.

Some may ask how far I think species change. It’s hard to answer because when forms are very different, the proof gets weaker. But some strong reasons support change over a long way. All members of big groups can be linked by a chain of similarities, and all can be organized in smaller groups within bigger ones. Fossils sometimes fill big gaps between existing groups. Body parts that are small and not useful show that ancestors had these parts fully developed, meaning a lot of change happened. In whole groups, body parts are made in similar ways, and young animals look alike. So, I believe that all members of the same big group come from common ancestors. I think animals came from only four or five original ancestors, and plants from about the same number or fewer.

By comparing things, I am led to believe even more—that all animals and plants came from one original form. But comparing can sometimes trick us. Still, all living things share a lot, like their chemicals, cell structures, and how they grow and reproduce. We even see this in small facts, like the same poison affecting both plants and animals, or a gall-fly making strange growths on wild roses or oak trees. So, I would guess that all living things on Earth came from one very first life form, into which life was breathed at the start.
