On the Origin of Species By Charles Darwin 'But with regard to the material world, we can at least go so far as thisâ€” we can perceive that events are brought about not by insulated interpositions of Divine power, exerted in each particular case, but by the establishment of general laws.' W. Whewell: Bridgewater Treatise.
 
 'To conclude, therefore, let no man out of a weak conceit of sobriety, or an ill-applied moderation, think or maintain, that a man can search too far or be too well studied in the book of God's word, or in the book of God's works; divinity or philosophy; but rather let men endeavour an endless progress or proficience in both.' Bacon: Advancement of Learning.
