It seems like the English factory laws are tricky with their numbers. They leave out some workers from the rules but still count a lot of different people as factory workers, like engineers, managers, salesmen, and messengers—basically everyone except the factory owner.

Ure admits that workers can be moved from one machine to another whenever the manager wants. He thinks this is a big change from the old way, where each worker had a specific job, like making the head of a needle or sharpening its point. But he should have asked why this old system is only changed “if needed.”

When things get really bad, like during the American Civil War, factory workers are sometimes made to do hard jobs like building roads. In England, around 1862, poor cotton workers had to do city work that actually helped the rich factory owners and competed with regular workers. Their health got better because they worked outside on public projects.

For example, machines introduced after the 1844 law helped replace child workers in wool mills. If the owners’ own kids had to learn in the mills, machine technology would improve a lot. Some machines, like self-acting mules, are very dangerous, especially for children who crawl under them to clean while they move. Some supervisors were punished for this, but it didn’t help much. If machine makers created a cleaning machine, it would be a great safety improvement.

Proudhon had a cool idea that machines don’t just combine tools but also combine small tasks to help workers themselves.

Even some positive thinkers, like Mr. Molinari, say that watching machines for 15 hours a day is more tiring than doing physical work. This kind of watching might be good for the brain if it’s short, but doing it too long hurts both the mind and body.
