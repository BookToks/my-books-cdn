When lots of workers each work alone and for themselves, they are often ignored. People think they don’t matter because they seem far away from bigger businesses. This is a big mistake because these small workers are really important for a country’s success.

Big workshops can make one or two bosses very rich, but the workers there are just hired hands. They get paid but don’t share in the business’s success. In small workshops, no one gets super rich, but many workers live okay lives. Workers who save money and work hard can build up some savings for things like a baby’s birth, sickness, or their own needs.

More workers will want to save and work hard because they see it can really improve their lives, not just get a small pay raise that only helps day to day. Big workshops help the bosses feel comfortable but don’t really help the country as a whole. Small workshops, often combined with farming small pieces of land, are the only truly free ones.

When some farmers were kicked off their land, it freed workers and their tools to be used in industry. This also created a home market for goods.

Before, peasant families made the things they needed themselves. Now, these things became products to sell. Big farmers sold raw materials like yarn and cloth to factories. The many small customers who used to buy from scattered artisans now formed one big market for factory-made goods.

Because of this, the old rural home industries slowly disappeared, and farming and manufacturing separated. Only by ending rural home industries could the country’s market grow enough for capitalism to work properly.

But manufacturing didn’t fully change everything. It still relied on small town craftsmen and rural home industries. Sometimes, when factories took over one area, home industries popped up somewhere else because they were needed to prepare raw materials.

This created a new group of small village workers who farmed as a side job but mainly worked in industry. They sold their goods directly to factories or through merchants.

This helps explain why, starting in the late 1400s, there were many complaints about big capitalist farms taking over the countryside and slowly destroying the peasant way of life.
