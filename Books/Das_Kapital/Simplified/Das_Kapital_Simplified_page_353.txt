A French worker wrote about his time in California: “I never thought I could do all the different jobs I tried there. I used to believe I was only good at printing. But in a place full of people who change jobs as often as they change shirts, I did the same. Mining didn’t pay well, so I moved to the town and worked as a printer, a roofer, a plumber, and more. Because I found out I can do many kinds of work, I feel less useless and more like a real person.”

John Bellers, an important thinker from the late 1600s, understood that the way education and work were set up then wasn’t good for society. He said, “Learning without working is almost useless. Physical work is natural and healthy, just like eating. If you avoid work, you might end up sick. Work keeps your mind and body strong. Doing silly, childish jobs only makes children’s minds weak.”

Most of this kind of work happens in small workshops, like those making lace, straw hats, or metal goods in cities like Sheffield and Birmingham.

Some reports said that factory work can be just as good, or even better, than working at home. Many examples of this can be found in official inspections of factories.

There are differences between large factories and small workshops, and both have their advantages.

The law planned to cover many trades, including lace-making, knitting, straw-plaiting, making clothes and accessories, metalwork, paper and glass factories, tobacco and rubber factories, shoe and hat making, book printing and binding, rope making, brick-making, sugar refineries, and many more.

New factory laws were passed in 1867. They set rules for big places like foundries, metal shops, glass and paper mills, rubber and tobacco factories, printing houses, and workshops with more than 50 workers. Another law covered smaller workshops and home industries.
