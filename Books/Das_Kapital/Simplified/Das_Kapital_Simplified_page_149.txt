In November 1795, W. Pitt talked about a factory that used a lot of cotton. In The Times newspaper on November 26, 1862, a factory owner who had 800 workers said that his factory cost him a lot of money even when it wasn’t running. He said these costs were about £6,000 a year. Some of these costs were things like rent, taxes, insurance, and paying managers and other staff. He also spent £150 on coal to heat the factory and sometimes run the machines. Besides that, he paid workers to keep the machines fixed even when the factory wasn’t busy. Finally, he said the machines lost value over time, costing him £1,200 a year because machines wear out even if they aren’t always being used. He pointed out that £1,200 was not a big estimate because his machines were already almost worn out.

“Productive consumption” means using things as part of making products. When this happens, the value of what is used doesn’t disappear; it becomes part of the new product. For example, in an American book, it says it doesn’t matter what form money or goods take after being used in production. It explains that food, clothes, and shelter, which people need to live and feel comfortable, are used up but their value helps give people energy and strength. This energy then helps people work and create more products. But it’s important to understand that what really comes back is not the price of the food but the nutrients in it.

What comes back in the energy or strength is the value of the things that helped create that energy, not the things themselves. If the same food cost less, it would still give the same strength, but that strength would be worth less. This mix-up between the value of things and the strength they give, along with unclear explanations, shows someone trying hard but failing to explain how extra value or profit comes from just using things that already exist.

All products of the same kind are really just one big group, and their price is usually decided by the overall market, not by specific details. In Chapter 9, Section 1, it talks about how the extra value or profit made during production comes from the capital used. This extra value is the difference between the value of the final product and the value of everything that went into making it.
