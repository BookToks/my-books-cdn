The effect of having less work available is very different from just having shorter working hours set by law. The first situation doesn’t depend on how long the workday is. It can happen whether the workday is 15 hours or just 6 hours. The normal pay is based on working 15 hours in the first case, or 6 hours in the second. So, if someone only works 7½ hours in the first case or 3 hours in the second, the result is the same.

In lace-making, the extra pay for overtime is very small—between half a penny and two pence per hour. This is very unfair because the work harms the health and strength of the workers. Also, the small extra money they earn often has to be spent on extra food to keep their strength up.

Before new laws were introduced, people working in paper-staining didn’t stop for meals. They worked 10½ hours by 4:30 p.m., and anything after that was overtime. They usually didn’t finish before 6 p.m., so they worked overtime all year round.

In Scotland, before 1862, bleaching workers had a system where ten hours was the normal workday, paid at a low daily rate. But they usually worked 3 or 4 hours extra every day, paid only a few pence per hour. Because of this, they couldn’t earn a decent wage without working overtime. Higher pay for working longer hours was too tempting to refuse.

In London, young girls aged 14 to 15 worked in book-binding. Even though they had set work hours, they often worked late at night until 10 or 11 p.m. or even later, with older workers. Their bosses tempted them to work late by offering extra pay and supper, which they ate in nearby pubs. This caused a lot of bad behavior among these young girls but also meant they helped bind many Bibles and religious books.

During a big strike in 1860, London builders said they would only accept hourly wages if two things happened: first, a normal workday of 9 or 10 hours was fixed, with the 10-hour day paying more per hour than the 9-hour day; second, any work beyond the normal hours had to be paid as overtime at a higher rate.

It is important to notice that places with long working hours often pay very low wages. Most of the work that earns just enough food is done for very long hours.

For example, hand nail-makers in England have to work 15 hours a day because the pay is so low. They work from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., working hard all the time just to earn a small amount. They also have to pay for tools, fuel, and waste materials, which lowers their already small earnings even more.
