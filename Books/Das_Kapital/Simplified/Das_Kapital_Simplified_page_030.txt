The value of something depends on how much work goes into making it and how useful that work is. Some things can be useful but don’t have value because they don’t need work to be useful, like air, fresh soil, or natural fields. Other things can be useful and made by people but aren’t sold or traded. For example, if someone makes something just for themselves, it’s useful but not a commodity. To make something a commodity, it has to be made for others and traded with them. Also, if something isn’t useful, it has no value, and the work put into it doesn’t count.

At first, we saw that a commodity has two parts: it is useful and can be traded. We also learned that work has two parts: the kind of work that makes things useful and the kind of work that gives things value when traded. This idea is very important to understand how the economy works, so we need to look at it more closely.

Let’s look at two things: a coat and 10 yards of cloth. If the cloth is worth W, then the coat is worth 2W.

The coat is useful because it meets a need. Making the coat involves a special kind of work, like tailoring, which is different from weaving the cloth. The work that makes the coat useful is called useful labor. We focus on how this work creates something useful.

Since the coat and cloth are different kinds of useful things, the work to make them is different too. Coats aren’t traded for other coats because they are different kinds of products.

Each type of useful thing comes from a different kind of useful labor. These types of labor are organized in society by how work is divided among people. This division of labor is needed to make commodities. But making commodities doesn’t always happen just because there is a division of labor. For example, in some old communities, people had different jobs but didn’t trade goods. Also, in factories today, work is divided among workers, but they don’t trade their own products with each other. Only products made by different kinds of work, done separately by individuals, can be traded as commodities.
