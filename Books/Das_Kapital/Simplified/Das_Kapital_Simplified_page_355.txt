Liebig wrote important books about chemistry and farming in 1862. He was one of the first to explain how modern farming can actually harm the land. Even though his history of farming has some big mistakes, it still gives some useful ideas.

However, Liebig made some quick guesses that don’t fully make sense. He said that ploughing the soil more helps air get into it and renews the surface, but the amount of extra crops you get isn’t as much as the extra work you put in. He said this idea came from John Stuart Mill’s book on economics.

But this is confusing because Mill didn’t fully understand the idea, and Liebig also mixed up what “labour” means. Plus, the idea wasn’t new at all. It was first shared by James Anderson during Adam Smith’s time, then copied by others like Malthus, West, Ricardo, and James Mill (John Stuart Mill’s dad). By John Stuart Mill’s time, it was already a common idea everyone knew.

So, it’s surprising that Liebig gave John Stuart Mill most of the credit for this theory, when it really came from many thinkers over many years.
