The secret to making capital grow is having control over a certain amount of other people’s unpaid work.

For example, in a letter written in 1851 called “Dritter Brief an v. Kirchmann von Rodbertus,” the writer challenges some old ideas about rent but still understands how capitalist production works. I’ll talk more about this letter later.

In the third German edition, there’s a note showing how much Marx respected people who made real progress or had good ideas. Later letters from Robertus show that Marx’s praise was a bit too strong. In those letters, Robertus says that capital should be controlled not only by labor but also by itself. He thinks industrial capitalists should be seen as workers who get paid a salary, which can be controlled or lowered if it takes too much from workers’ wages. Robertus warns against Marx’s ideas, saying Marx's book attacks the current form of capital instead of studying capital itself. So, Robertus’s strong attack turned into common arguments about capitalism. — F. E.

When calculating profits, the part of the product that simply replaces the original investment (constant capital) is not counted. Mr. L. de Lavergne, who really admires England, tends to underestimate the capitalist’s share rather than overestimate it.

All advanced types of capitalist production involve teamwork. It’s easy to ignore the conflicts involved and pretend they are just free partnerships, like A. de Laborde did in a book from 1818. H. Carey from America also sometimes tries to do this, even with slavery.

Even though the Physiocrats couldn’t figure out how surplus value worked, they understood one thing: it’s a kind of wealth that someone owns without buying it and then sells it. (Turgot, in “Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth,” p.11.)
