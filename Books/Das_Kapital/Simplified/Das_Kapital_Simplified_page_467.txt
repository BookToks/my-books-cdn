You can see how wages actually changed in a simple way, without going into too much detail. The Poor Law was the same in 1795 and 1814. This law worked like this in the countryside: the parish gave extra money to make sure workers earned enough to live on. Comparing the wages farmers paid and the money the parish added shows us two things.

First, wages dropped below what workers really needed. Second, it shows how much the farm worker was both a paid worker and a poor person relying on help, almost like they were tied to their parish like a servant. Let’s look at one county, Northamptonshire, which was pretty average. In 1795, workers earned 7 shillings and 6 pence a week. A family of six spent about £36 a year but only made about £30. The parish had to give them almost £7 to make up the difference.

In 1814, wages went up to 12 shillings and 2 pence a week. But a family of five spent nearly £55 a year and only earned £36. So the parish had to give over £18 to fill the gap. In 1795, the parish helped with less than a quarter of the wages, but by 1814, it was more than half. It’s clear that the small comforts workers once had were gone by 1814. Of all the animals on the farm, the workers—called “the talking tool”—were treated the worst, fed the least, and worked the hardest.

This situation continued quietly until the Swing riots in 1830, when angry farmers burned crops. This showed the ruling class that farm workers were just as unhappy as factory workers. At that time, a politician named Sadler called farm workers “white slaves,” and a bishop agreed. A famous economist said that Southern English peasants weren’t free or slaves but just poor people depending on help.

Right before the Corn Laws were repealed, people debated the condition of farm workers. Middle-class leaders wanted to show that these laws didn’t really help the people who grew the corn. Meanwhile, factory owners were angry that rich landowners were criticizing factories and acting like they cared about factory workers, even though they were selfish and fake.

There’s an old English saying: “when thieves fight, honest people benefit.” The big fight between the rich groups about who treated workers worse actually helped reveal the truth. Earl Shaftesbury, a leader against factories, became famous around 1845 for showing the bad conditions of farm workers. The Morning Chronicle, a major newspaper, sent people to study farms and didn’t just give numbers but named the families and landlords involved.

They looked at wages in three villages near Blanford, Wimbourne, and Poole. These villages belonged to Mr. G. Bankes and Earl Shaftesbury. It’s clear that, like Bankes, Shaftesbury took a big part of the workers’ low wages by charging high rent for their homes.
