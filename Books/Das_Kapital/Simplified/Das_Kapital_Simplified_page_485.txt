Like all big industries today, this one keeps creating extra workers who aren’t needed, even though it also hires more people overall. The hard life of farmers helps build huge shirt factories, where most workers live spread out across the countryside. Here, we see the same system as before, where people work from home for low pay and long hours, which helps create even more extra workers. Finally, even though people moving away doesn’t cause as much damage as it would in a fully developed capitalist country, it still hurts the local market. When people leave, there are fewer jobs and less money for small shopkeepers, craftsmen, and other workers. That’s why incomes between £60 and £100 drop, as shown in Table E.

A clear view of the lives of farm workers in Ireland is in the Reports of the Irish Poor Law Inspectors (1870). These government officials, working under a strict and sometimes harsh government, have to be careful with their words, unlike their English counterparts. Still, they don’t let the government believe false hopes. They say that wages, which are still very low, have gone up 50-60% in the last 20 years and now average 6 to 9 shillings a week. But this supposed rise hides a real fall in wages because it doesn’t match how much the price of basic living things has gone up. For proof, look at these official workhouse costs.

AVERAGE WEEKLY COST PER PERSON  
Year ended Provisions and Clothing TOTAL  
29th Sept., 1849: 1s. 3¼d. + 3d. = 1s. 6¼d.  
29th Sept., 1869: 2s. 7¼d. + 6d. = 3s. 1¼d.

The price of basic living things is now twice as high as 20 years ago, and clothing costs exactly twice as much.

Even without this problem, just comparing wages in money doesn’t tell the full story. Before the famine, most farm workers were paid with goods, not cash. Now, they get paid mostly in money, so wages in cash have to go up no matter what.

“Before the famine, workers had their own small houses with some land to grow potatoes. They could raise pigs and chickens too. But now, they have to buy bread and have no scraps to feed animals, so they don’t get money from selling pigs, chickens, or eggs.” Before, these farm workers were tiny farmers, helping bigger farms where they worked. But since the disaster in 1846, they’ve become just wage workers who depend only on money from their bosses.

We know how bad their homes were in 1846. Since then, things have only gotten worse. Some farm workers still live on farmers’ land in crowded, awful huts, even worse than the worst homes of English farm workers.
