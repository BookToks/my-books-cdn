A reviewer once said that money (capital) is scared of trouble and fights, which is partly true but doesn’t tell the whole story. Money doesn’t avoid making a profit, even if it’s small—just like nature was once thought to hate empty spaces.

If the profit is good enough, money will be very brave. A 10% profit will make it want to be used anywhere; a 20% profit will make it excited; a 50% profit will make it bold; a 100% profit will make it ready to break any human laws; and a 300% profit means it won’t hesitate to do any crime or take any risk, even if the owner might get caught or punished.

If fighting and chaos bring profit, money will happily support them.

The examples of smuggling and the slave trade prove this point very well.
