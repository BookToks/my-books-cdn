69 l. c., p. 18, Note. — The Relieving Officer of the Chapel-en-le-Frith Union said this to the Registrar-General: — “At Doveholes, some small holes have been dug into a big pile of lime ashes (waste from lime-kilns). People working on building a railway live in these holes. The holes are small and wet, have no drains or toilets, and only have one hole at the top for smoke to go out, which acts as a chimney. Because of this, smallpox has spread for some time, and some people living there have died from it.”  

70 The details at the end of Part IV mainly talk about coal mine workers. For even worse conditions in metal mines, see the careful Report of the Royal Commission from 1864.

74 “Many poor people in London are starving. Recently, big posters appeared all over London with a shocking message: — ‘Fat oxen! Starving men! The fat oxen from their glass palace go to feed the rich in their fancy homes, while starving people are left to die in their terrible homes.’ These posters keep showing up again and again. When one is removed, another appears somewhere else. This reminds people of secret groups that helped start the French Revolution in 1789. Right now, while English workers and their families are freezing and hungry, millions of English gold — which comes from their work — is being used to invest in businesses in Russia, Spain, Italy, and other countries.”
