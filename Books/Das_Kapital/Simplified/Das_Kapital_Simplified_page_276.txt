There are two types of wear and tear on a machine. One happens from using it, like coins getting worn down as they’re used. The other happens when the machine isn’t used, like a sword rusting if it’s left in its case. The second kind is caused by the environment. The more a machine is used, the more it wears out. But if it’s not used, it can get worse in a different way.  

Besides the physical wear, machines also lose value in another way. This happens when other machines like it are made cheaper or better machines come out. Even if the machine is still new and works well, its value depends on how long it takes to make a similar or better machine. So, its value goes down over time.  

If it takes less time to make a new machine, the machine’s value won’t drop as fast. Also, the longer the working day, the shorter it takes to make a new machine. When a new machine is first used in a business, people quickly find ways to make it cheaper and better. These improvements can change the whole machine, not just small parts. Because of this, the push to make workers work longer hours is strongest when machines are new.  

If you want to use twice as many workers, you need to spend twice as much money on machines, buildings, raw materials, and other supplies. But if you make the working day longer instead, you can produce more without buying more machines or buildings. This means you get more profit, and it costs less to make that profit. This happens every time the working day gets longer, but it’s a bigger deal when you have a lot of machines.  

Factories make more and more of their money tied up in machines. These machines can keep making money, but if no one is working, they lose their value. A factory owner said that if one worker stops working, it wastes machines worth a huge amount of money. Imagine how bad it is if even one person leaves the factory! Because of machines, it becomes more important to have longer working days.  

Machines help make more profit by lowering the cost of workers and the things workers need to live. When machines are first used in a business, they make workers’ labor more effective and valuable. This lets the owner get more value from each hour of work. At first, when only a few use the new machines, profits are really high. Owners try to make the most of this by making workers work longer hours. The big profit makes them want even more.  

But as more people start using machines, the value of what’s made goes down to normal levels. Then it becomes clear that extra profit doesn’t come from the workers replaced by machines, but from the workers who actually work with the machines.
