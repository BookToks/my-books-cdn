This shows that when the coat is compared to the linen, it means more than when it’s just on its own, kind of like how a guy in a fancy uniform looks more important than when he’s in regular clothes.  

Making the coat takes real work from a tailor. So, human effort is stored inside it. The coat holds value because of this work, but you can’t see that just by looking at it. When the coat is equal in value to the linen, it shows that value as a kind of “body” or form. For example, person A can’t be “your majesty” to person B unless B sees A as that, and this image can change with different leaders.  

So, in the value comparison where the coat equals the linen, the coat acts as the shape of value. The value of the linen is shown by the shape of the coat. The linen and the coat are different things you can use, but as value, they are the same and linen looks like the coat in this way. This means linen gets a new kind of value form that’s different from what it really is. Its value shows because it’s equal to the coat, just like how a Christian is like the Lamb of God.  

We can see that everything about the value of things, like linen, is clear when it’s compared to another thing, like the coat. But it talks about this in the only way it knows: the language of things with value.  

To say that its value comes from human work, the linen says the coat is worth the same because it has the same kind of work in it. To tell us that value isn’t the same as its physical body, it says value looks like a coat, so linen and coat are very similar as value. The language of things that have value has different ways to say this in different languages. For example, the German word “Wertsein” (to be worth) is less clear than the French or Italian words that show value better. The saying “Paris vaut bien une messe” means Paris is worth a mass. So, when one thing is compared to another, the body of the second thing shows the value of the first. By connecting with the coat, the linen uses the coat’s usefulness to show its own value. This way, the value of linen takes the form of relative value.  

(b.) How much value it shows  
Every thing with value is useful and comes in a certain amount, like 15 bushels of corn or 100 pounds of coffee. A certain amount of these things has a set amount of human work in it. So, the value form must show not just value in general but how much value there is.  

That’s why in the value comparison between linen and coat, the coat isn’t just equal in value to the linen but a specific number of coats (1 coat) equals a specific amount of linen (20 yards).  

The equation “20 yards of linen = 1 coat” means both have the same amount of value inside, which is the same amount of human work and time spent making them.
