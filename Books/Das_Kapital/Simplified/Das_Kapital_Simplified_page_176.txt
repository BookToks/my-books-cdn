It’s clear this system is well known. For example, when I asked the manager of a big rolling-mill how they covered for boys who were absent, he said, “I guess you know that as well as I do,” and admitted it.

At one rolling-mill with hours from 6 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., a boy worked about four nights every week until at least 8:30 p.m. for six months. Another boy, only 9 years old, sometimes worked three 12-hour shifts in a row. When he was 10, he worked two day shifts and two night shifts straight. A third boy, now 10, worked from 6 a.m. until midnight three nights, and until 9 p.m. on the other nights.

Another boy, now 13, worked from 6 p.m. until noon the next day for a whole week, and sometimes for three shifts straight, like from Monday morning until Tuesday night. Another, now 12, worked in an iron foundry from 6 a.m. until midnight for two weeks straight but couldn’t keep it up any longer. 

George Allinsworth, age 9, started as a cellar-boy last Friday. The next morning, they had to start work at 3 a.m., so he stayed all night. He lives five miles away and slept on the floor near the furnace, with an apron under him and part of a jacket over him. The next two days, he started work at 6 a.m. He said, “It’s really hot in here.” Before this, he worked nearly a year at a similar job in the country. He always started at 3 a.m. on Saturdays, but since he lived nearby, he could sleep at home. Other days, he worked from 6 a.m. until 6 or 7 p.m.

Now, let’s hear what the owners think about this 24-hour system. They don’t talk about the worst abuses, like the very long working days. They only talk about the “normal” way the system works.

Messrs. Naylor & Vickers, steel makers who employ 600 to 700 people (only 10% are under 18), say just 20 boys under 18 work night shifts. They say the boys don’t suffer from the heat, which is about 86° to 90°. In the forges and rolling mills, workers work both day and night in shifts, but other jobs are only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. In the forge, some workers always work nights without switching to days. They don’t see any health differences between night and day workers. They think people sleep better if they have the same rest times instead of changing. They say they can’t do without boys under 18 working at night because it would make production cost more. Skilled workers are hard to find, but boys are easy to get. Since they only have a small number of boys, the issue of limiting night work isn’t very important to them.

Mr. J. Ellis, from John Brown & Co., which employs about 3,000 workers, says their heavier steel work runs day and night in shifts. They have about one or two boys for every 20 men. They employ over 500 boys under 18, with about 170 under 13. Mr. Ellis says he wouldn’t mind a rule saying no one under 18 should work more than 12 hours in a day. But he thinks there’s no age limit, even for 12-year-olds, where boys could stop working at night.
