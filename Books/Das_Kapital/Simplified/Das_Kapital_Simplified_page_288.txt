Division of labour means people get really good at using one specific tool. But when machines start doing the job instead, the value of the worker’s skill disappears. The worker becomes useless, like money that’s no longer accepted. Workers who lose their jobs because of machines either struggle to survive or flood other parts of the job market, making wages go down.

People are told two things to feel better: first, that their problems are only temporary; second, that machines take over jobs slowly, so the damage isn’t as bad all at once.

But these two ideas cancel each other out. When machines take over jobs slowly, workers suffer for a long time. When machines take over fast, many people lose jobs at once. For example, English hand-loom weavers lost their jobs over many years and many starved or lived in extreme poverty. In India, cotton machines caused terrible suffering too. Machines might cause “temporary” problems, but because they keep taking over more jobs, these problems last a long time. This creates a big conflict between workers and machines, and workers start fighting back against the tools they use.

Machines end up replacing workers. This fight between workers and machines is strongest when machines compete with old handmade crafts. Even in modern factories, better machines keep pushing workers out.

The goal of better machines is to reduce the need for people to work by hand. Machines are improved regularly to save power, make better products, work faster, or replace workers like children, women, or men. When a job needs skill and steady hands, machines take over so anyone, even a child, can run them. As machines get better, skilled workers lose their jobs.

New machines don’t just cut down on the number of adult workers needed. They also replace skilled workers with less skilled ones, adults with kids, and men with women. This changes wages and causes new problems for workers.
