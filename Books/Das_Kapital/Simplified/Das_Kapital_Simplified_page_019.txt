Actually, you might wonder why this English version took so long to come out. For years, the ideas in this book have been talked about, attacked, defended, and sometimes misunderstood in magazines and books in both England and America.

Soon after the author died in 1883, it became clear that an English edition was really needed. Mr. Samuel Moore, who was a good friend of Marx and the person writing this, and who knows the book very well, agreed to translate it. The people in charge of Marx’s work wanted the book to be shared with the public. I was supposed to check the translation against the original and suggest changes if needed. 

But Mr. Moore couldn’t finish the translation quickly because of his job. So, we accepted help from Dr. Aveling to translate part of the book. At the same time, Mrs. Aveling, Marx’s youngest daughter, helped by checking quotes and fixing parts taken from English works that Marx had translated into German. This was done almost everywhere except for a few small parts.

Dr. Aveling translated these parts: Chapters X (The Working Day) and XI (Rate and Mass of Surplus-Value); Part VI (Wages, which includes Chapters XIX to XXII); from Chapter XXIV, Section 4 to the end of the book, including Chapter XXV and Part VIII (Chapters XXVI to XXXIII); and both of the author’s prefaces. Mr. Moore did the rest of the book. Each translator is responsible for their part, but I take responsibility for the whole book.

The third German edition, which we used as the base for this work, was prepared by me in 1883. I used notes left by Marx that showed which parts of the second edition needed to be replaced by parts from the French edition published in 1873. These changes matched instructions Marx gave about ten years ago for an English translation planned in America, but it was never finished because they couldn’t find the right translator.

This manuscript was given to us by our old friend Mr. F. A. Sorge from Hoboken, New Jersey. It included some more changes from the French edition, but since it was older than the final instructions for the third edition, I only used it a little, mostly to help with tricky parts. We also looked at the French text in difficult sections to see what Marx was willing to leave out when full meaning couldn’t be kept in translation.

There is one problem we couldn’t avoid: some words are used differently here than in normal life or usual Economic studies. But this had to happen. Every time a science looks at something in a new way, it changes the special words it uses. Chemistry is a good example — its terms change a lot every twenty years, and the names for many chemicals have gone through many changes. Political Economy usually just uses words from business and industry as they are, but that limits how much new ideas it can explain.
