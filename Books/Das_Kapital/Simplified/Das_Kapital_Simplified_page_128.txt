All raw materials are things people work on, but not everything that can be worked on is raw material. Something only becomes raw material after it has been changed by work.

An instrument of labour is something a worker uses between themselves and the material they work on. It helps the worker do the job. People use the natural features of some things to control other things and reach their goals. For example, when gathering fruit, a person’s own hands are the tools they use. But usually, the first thing a worker gets is not the material to work on but the tool to work with.

Nature becomes like a part of the worker’s body, adding power to them. The earth is like a natural storehouse and tool shed. It gives stones for throwing, grinding, cutting, and more. The earth itself is a tool for farming, but farming also needs many other tools and more advanced work. As soon as work develops even a little, special tools are needed.

In the oldest caves, we find stone tools and weapons. Early humans also used animals they tamed as tools, along with specially made stones, wood, bones, and shells. Making and using tools is something special about humans, even though some animals use simple tools. Because of this, Franklin called humans “tool-making animals.” Old tools are as important for studying past societies as fossil bones are for studying extinct animals. What matters is not just the things made, but how and with what tools they were made. This helps us understand different economic times.

Tools show how advanced human work is and also tell us about the social conditions during that time. Mechanical tools, which we can think of as the muscles and bones of production, give clearer signs of a certain production era than tools like pipes, tubs, or baskets, which mostly just hold materials. These containers are like the veins and blood vessels of production.

These containers become more important in chemical industries.

More broadly, tools include not only those used directly in work but also things needed to keep the work going. These don’t take part directly but are necessary for work to happen fully or at all. Again, the earth is a universal tool because it gives a place for the worker to stand and work. Other tools made by past work include workshops, canals, and roads.

So, in working, a person’s activity combined with tools changes the material they work on in a planned way. The work itself disappears into the final product, which becomes useful to people. Nature’s material is changed to fit human needs. The labour shows up as movement in the worker but as a still quality in the product. For example, a blacksmith works by forging, and the product is a piece of forged metal.
