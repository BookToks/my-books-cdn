The workers in coal mines are some of the best-paid workers in Britain’s working class.

But the cost of their wages, explained earlier, comes with a price. Here, I’ll quickly look at where they live. Usually, the mine owner or tenant builds cottages for the workers. The miners get these cottages and coal for heating "for free"—this is part of their wages paid in goods instead of money. If they don’t get housing like this, they get £4 a year instead. Mining areas quickly attract many people, including miners and the people who provide services for them, like shopkeepers and craftsmen. Because many people live there, rent prices are high. So, the boss packs as many cottages as possible close to the mine entrance to fit all the workers and their families. If new mines open or old ones start again, the crowd gets even bigger. When building these cottages, the only thing that matters is the capitalist saving as much money as possible.

Dr. Julian Hunter says the housing for miners in Northumberland and Durham is probably the worst and most expensive you can find in England, except for one area in Monmouthshire. The worst problems are too many men crammed into one room, tiny yards with many houses squeezed together, no clean water, no toilets, and sometimes houses stacked on top of each other or divided into apartments. It’s like the people are just camping there, not really living.

Dr. Stevens said he visited most big mining villages in Durham and found that almost none took care of the people’s health. Miners are “bound” to work for the mine owner for twelve months, a system that feels like slavery. If miners complain or bother the boss, their names get marked, and they can be fired when their contract ends. This system is worse than any other unfair payment system. The miner has to rent a house that’s unhealthy and dirty, and he can’t do anything about it. Only the owner could help, but he cares more about making money. Miners also often have to pay the owner for water, good or bad, by having money taken from their wages. 

Even though the public and health officials disagree, the owners say these bad living and working conditions are necessary to make a profit. It’s the same when owners don’t spend money on safety equipment in factories or mines.
