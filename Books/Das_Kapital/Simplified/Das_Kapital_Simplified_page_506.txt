Primitive accumulation is just a fancy way of saying the process where workers were separated from the tools and land they needed to work. It’s called "primitive" because it happened a long time ago, before capitalism really started.

Capitalist society grew out of feudal society. When feudalism broke down, it allowed capitalism to grow.

Workers, or laborers, could only sell their work after they stopped being tied to the land or being slaves, serfs, or servants to others. To be free to sell their work anywhere, they also had to break away from the strict rules of guilds, which controlled how apprentices and workers operated. So, becoming wage-workers meant they were free from serfdom and guild rules, which some historians focus on. But these workers only became free sellers after losing all their land and support from old feudal systems. This loss was often violent and harsh.

Industrial capitalists, the new powerful people, had to take over not just from guild leaders but also from feudal lords who owned wealth and land. Their rise was a fight against both feudal lords and guild restrictions that held back production and allowed people to exploit others. However, these capitalists gained power through unfair means, similar to how freed slaves once took control in ancient Rome.

The start of capitalism and wage labor came from the old system of laborers being controlled. The big change was that this control shifted from feudal exploitation to capitalist exploitation. We don’t have to look far back to see this. Early capitalist production started in some Mediterranean towns in the 14th or 15th centuries, but capitalism really began in the 16th century. By then, serfdom was mostly gone, and medieval towns had lost their power.

In the history of primitive accumulation, major revolutions are key because they helped the growing capitalist class. Especially important were times when many people were forced off their land and became free workers looking for jobs. Taking peasants away from their farms was the foundation of this process. This happened differently in different countries and times. England shows a classic example of how it worked.

In Italy, where capitalism started earlier, serfdom ended sooner than in other places.
