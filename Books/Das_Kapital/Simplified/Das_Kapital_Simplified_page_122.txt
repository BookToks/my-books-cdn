The amount of work done makes up the value of a day’s work or the value of the worker’s energy used each day. If half a day’s normal work is worth three shillings, then three shillings is the price for a full day’s work. So, if the worker sells their labour for three shillings a day, the price matches the value. Our friend Moneybags, who wants to turn his three shillings into more money, pays this value.

The lowest value of work is decided by the cost of things the worker needs to live and stay healthy. If the price of work drops to this lowest point, it’s actually less than its real value, because the worker can only survive and grow weakly. But the value of every product depends on the time needed to make it properly.

It’s silly to say this way of figuring out the value of work is cruel. Rossi complains that thinking about work without considering what workers need to live is like trying to understand something that isn’t real. When we talk about the ability to work, we also have to think about the worker and what they need to survive, like their wages. Talking about the ability to work isn’t the same as talking about actual work, just like having a good stomach isn’t the same as digesting food. The ability to work needs the right living conditions, and these costs are part of its value. If the worker can’t sell their ability to work, they don’t benefit, and it feels unfair that it costs them things to keep this ability alive.

The worker will agree with Sismondi who said, “the ability to work means nothing unless it’s sold.” One unique thing about the ability to work as a product is that its usefulness doesn’t go to the buyer right when the worker sells it. Its value is set before it’s sold because people have already put time into creating it. But the real usefulness comes when the worker actually uses their energy. The selling and using of work happen at different times.

In most places where capitalism is common, people don’t pay workers before they actually work, like at the end of a week. So, the worker lets the buyer use their energy before getting paid, which means the worker is giving credit to the boss. This credit isn’t just made up — sometimes workers lose their pay if the boss goes bankrupt, and there are other lasting effects. Still, whether money is used to buy or to pay later, this doesn’t change how the trade works. The price of work is set in the contract, even if the worker gets the money later, like rent for a house. The ability to work is sold but paid for afterward.

To make things clearer, let’s imagine the worker gets paid right away each time they sell their work.
