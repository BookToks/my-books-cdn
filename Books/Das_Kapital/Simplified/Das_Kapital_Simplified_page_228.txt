Sometimes, things don’t go exactly as planned. If one worker takes a lot more time than usual to make something, their work won’t match the average time most people need. Because of that, their work won’t be seen as average, and their ability to work won’t be valued as average either. This means their work might not sell well, or might sell for less than usual. So, there’s always an assumption that everyone works at at least a basic level of efficiency. Later, we’ll see how businesses make sure this minimum level is met. Still, this minimum can be different from the average, even though employers have to pay workers based on the average value of their work.

Out of six small business owners, some will make more profit than average, and some less. These differences balance out for society as a whole, but not for each individual owner. The rules about how value is made really only work perfectly when a business owner acts like a capitalist, hiring many workers whose combined work is seen as average social labor.

Even if the way people work doesn’t change, having a lot of workers at the same time changes things a lot. The buildings they work in, the storage for materials, and the tools they use are shared by all of them. This means some of the stuff they need to make things is used together instead of separately. Using things together doesn’t make them worth more money because using something better or more doesn’t increase its price.

But when shared by many people, these tools and buildings are used on a bigger scale. For example, a room with twenty weavers working on twenty looms needs to be bigger than one with just a couple of people. Still, it takes less work to build one big workshop for twenty people than to build ten small ones for two people each. So, the value of these shared tools and buildings doesn’t grow as much as the size and usefulness of what they do.

Because they are shared, each product made uses up less value from these tools and buildings. That’s partly because the total value is spread over more products, and partly because, even though the total value is bigger, each tool is less valuable compared to when used alone.

Because of this, part of the constant capital (the value of tools, buildings, and materials) becomes cheaper. When this happens, the total value of what’s made also goes down. It’s like the tools cost less. This savings happens because many workers use these things together. Also, these shared tools get a special social value, different from tools used alone by independent workers or small bosses. This happens even if the workers don’t help each other but just work nearby each other. Some tools get this social value before the actual work itself does.

Saving money on using tools can be looked at in two ways. First, it makes products cheaper, which lowers the value of labor-power (the worker’s ability to work). Second, it changes how much extra value (surplus-value) is made compared to all the money spent on tools and wages. We won’t talk about the second part until later in the third book, along with other related ideas.

This split in the topic makes sense because, in capitalism, workers don’t own the tools—they belong to someone else. So saving money on tools seems like a separate thing from the worker’s own effort, and it feels like it doesn’t affect how productive the worker is personally.
