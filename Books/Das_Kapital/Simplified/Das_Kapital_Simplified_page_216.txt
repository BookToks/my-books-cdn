He would only need enough tools and materials to work for 8 hours. But the capitalist, who makes him work an extra 4 hours of unpaid work, needs more money to provide extra tools and materials. In our example, the capitalist would have to hire two workers just to live as well as one worker does, meaning he only meets basic needs, not making extra wealth. But making extra wealth is what capitalism is all about.

If the capitalist wants to live twice as well as a worker and still save half of the extra value made, he would need to spend eight times more money by hiring more workers. Sometimes, the capitalist can also work himself, mixing the roles of boss and worker, becoming a “small boss.”

At a certain point in capitalism, the capitalist must spend all his time controlling workers and selling their products. In the Middle Ages, guilds tried to stop bosses from becoming capitalists by limiting how many workers a boss could have. A person only becomes a real capitalist when they have much more money than what was allowed back then. This shows a rule Hegel found: when something changes enough in size, it changes in kind.

The amount of money needed to become a capitalist depends on how developed capitalism is and the type of business. Some businesses need lots of money right from the start, more than one person usually has. This led to government help or special companies with legal rights, which were early versions of modern corporations.

In production, capital controls labor, meaning the capitalist makes sure workers do their jobs regularly and work hard.

Capital forces workers to work more than needed just to meet their basic needs. It exploits workers by making them work extra hours and harder than before, more than any older system of forced labor.

At first, capital controls labor based on the technology it inherited and doesn’t immediately change how work is done. Making extra profit by simply making workers work longer hours doesn’t require changing the way production works.

This happened in old bakeries as well as in modern factories.

When we look at work simply, the worker uses tools and materials as helpers for their own smart work, not as capital.
