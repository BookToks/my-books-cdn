The person who sells something in the first deal then becomes a buyer in the second deal, where a third person shows up as the seller. These two steps, which are opposite to each other, make a cycle: a thing becomes a commodity, then loses that form, and then becomes a commodity again. The commodity looks different at the start and the end. At first, it’s not useful to its owner, but at the end, it is. Money also looks different in these steps: first, it’s like a solid crystal of value that the commodity turns into, and later, it melts away to be replaced by something useful.

The two changes that make up this cycle are also the opposite parts of changes in other commodities. For example, the linen starts its own changes and finishes the changes of another commodity, like wheat. In the first step, the linen does both jobs itself. But then, when it turns into gold, it finishes its own change and helps start the change of a third commodity. So, one commodity’s cycle is mixed up with the cycles of others. All these cycles together make up the flow of commodities.

This flow of commodities is different from simply swapping products (barter), not just in how it looks but in how it works. Think about what happens: the weaver trades his linen for a Bible, his own product for someone else’s. But this is only true for the weaver. The Bible seller, who wants something to warm him up, doesn’t think about trading his Bible for linen, just like the weaver doesn’t know that his linen was traded for wheat. Person B’s product replaces person A’s, but A and B don’t directly swap with each other. Sometimes, A and B might buy from each other at the same time, but this is not required by how commodities usually move around. This shows how exchanging commodities breaks local and personal limits found in barter and creates a whole network of social relationships that grow on their own, beyond what any person controls. The farmer sells wheat so the weaver can sell linen, the weaver sells linen so the Bible seller can sell his Bible, the Bible seller sells the Bible so the distiller can sell his drink, and so on.

Because of this, the process of exchange doesn’t end when the useful things change hands like in barter. Money doesn’t disappear after one commodity’s cycle ends. Instead, money keeps moving into new spots where other commodities have left. For example, in the full cycle of linen turning into money and then into a Bible, the linen leaves circulation and money takes its place. Then the Bible leaves circulation and money comes back again. When one product replaces another, the money always ends up with a third person. Circulation makes money move everywhere.

It’s silly to think that because every sale is a purchase and every purchase a sale, the flow of commodities always balances out perfectly. If this just means that sales equal purchases, that’s obvious. But some people say it means every seller brings their buyer with them, which isn’t true. A sale and a purchase are really one single act—an exchange between someone who owns a commodity and someone who owns money, like the two opposite ends of a magnet.
