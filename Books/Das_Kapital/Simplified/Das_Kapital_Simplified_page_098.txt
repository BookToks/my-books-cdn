There is nothing worse in our lives right now than money, which is everywhere and causes so much harm.

Money can destroy cities, force people out of their homes, change good people’s minds, and make them do terrible things. There is no limit to what money can make people do, even the worst crimes.

People always want more money, as if they want to take all the wealth hidden deep in the earth.

In politics and economics, the main goal is to have as many sellers as possible and as few buyers as possible. This idea controls how money and trade work.

The amount of money needed for a country’s trade changes all the time. When money is low, coins are made from gold or silver. When coins are low, the metal is melted down. This happens naturally without politicians interfering.

John Stuart Mill said that in India, people still use silver jewelry as a form of money. They turn it into coins when interest rates are high and back into jewelry when rates fall.

In 1863, India imported much more gold and silver than it exported, by over £19 million. In the eight years before 1864, the extra gold and silver coming in added up to more than £109 million. Over 200 million pounds worth of coins were made in India during this century.

At the start of the 18th century in England, business people were very harsh and rude to each other, more than anywhere else in the world.

In some cases, money can be used to buy things before the money is fully earned or the goods delivered. This happens often with prepayments. For example, the English government buys opium from Indian farmers by paying them upfront. Here, money is used directly to buy things, and capital is given as money.

Money crises happen regularly but can be different. Some crises are caused by problems in banking, the stock market, or finance. These crises mainly affect money and financial systems before affecting industries and trade.
