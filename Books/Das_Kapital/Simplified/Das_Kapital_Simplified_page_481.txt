In 1865, 127,470 more acres were counted as "grass land," mostly because 101,543 acres of "bog and waste unoccupied" land disappeared. Comparing 1865 to 1864, there was a drop in cereal crops by 246,667 quarters. This included 48,999 quarters less wheat, 160,605 less oats, 29,892 less barley, and others. Potato production also went down by 446,398 tons, even though more land was used to grow them in 1865.

Next, we look at how the money of landlords, big farmers, and business owners in Ireland changed. This is shown by how the Income-tax went up or down. Remember, Schedule D includes profits from jobs other than farming, like lawyers and doctors. Schedules C and E cover incomes of workers, government officials, and people who earn money from government funds.
