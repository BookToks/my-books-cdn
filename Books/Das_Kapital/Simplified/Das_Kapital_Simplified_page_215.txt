Now we know that a capitalist splits their money into two parts. One part is spent on things needed to make products, like machines and materials. This is called constant capital. The other part is spent on paying workers. This is called variable capital.

The amount of constant and variable capital changes depending on the type of work and the technology used. But no matter how the money is split, the rule stays the same: the value of the constant capital shows up in the product’s value, but it doesn't create new value. 

For example, if you hire 1,000 workers instead of 100, you need more materials and machines. The value of these extra things can go up or down, but it doesn’t affect how much new value the workers create by working.

So, the law says: the amount of value and extra value made by different businesses depends directly on how much they spend on workers, assuming the price of labor and how much it’s used stay the same.

This idea seems to go against what people see every day. Everyone knows that a cotton spinner, who spends a lot on machines and less on workers, doesn’t make less profit than a baker, who spends more on workers and less on machines. To explain this, we need some extra ideas, like how in math you sometimes need to use tricky steps to understand a problem.

Classical economists understood this law without clearly saying it because it follows from basic value rules. They tried to ignore the confusing facts by simplifying things too much. Later, we’ll see how some economists got stuck on this problem. Ordinary economics often just trusts what looks true instead of the deeper laws.

Think about all the workers in a society as working together in one big workday. If there are one million workers, each working 10 hours, that’s 10 million hours total. To make more extra value, you either need more workers or longer work hours.

So, the total extra value a society can make depends on how many workers there are and how long they work. More people can be the limit, or longer work hours can be the limit, depending on the situation. But this rule only applies to the type of extra value we’ve talked about so far.

From this, it follows that not every amount of money can become capital. To turn money into capital, you need at least enough to pay for one worker working all year, every day, to make extra value.

If a worker owned their own tools and was okay with a simple life, they would only need to work enough hours to earn what they need to live, maybe 8 hours a day.
