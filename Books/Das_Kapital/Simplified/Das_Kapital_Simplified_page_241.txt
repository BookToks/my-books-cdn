7 Even though this detail worker works at home, he is very different from a craftsman who works for his own customers because he works for a capitalist (a factory owner). 8 The second type of manufacturing, which is more advanced, makes products by going through connected steps, one after another. For example, making needles involves the wire being handled by 72 or even 92 different workers.

At first, this kind of manufacturing brings together many small crafts, so it makes the space between different steps smaller. The time and effort needed to move from one step to the next get shorter. 9 Compared to a single craftsman, this way of working produces more because it relies on teamwork. But the division of labor, which is what makes manufacturing special, means that each step is separate and independent. To keep the process going, the product has to be moved all the time from one worker to another and from one step to the next. This constant moving is a problem and costs extra, especially in modern machine-based factories.

10 If we look at a batch of raw materials, like rags for paper or wire for needles, we see that they go through many steps, handled by different workers until the product is finished. But if we look at the whole workshop, we see raw materials in all stages at once. The workers use different tools to do different tasks at the same time: one group pulls the wire, another straightens it, another cuts it, and another points it. So, the steps that used to happen one after another now happen side by side.

Because of this, more finished products are made in the same amount of time. 11 This happens because of teamwork, and manufacturing not only uses teamwork but also creates it by breaking down the work into small parts. But it also forces each worker to focus on just one small task.

Since each worker’s part is only one step in making the final product, each worker prepares the material for the next one. One worker’s result is the starting point for the next worker. The time needed for each step is learned by experience, and manufacturing works on the idea that a certain result will be finished in a certain time. This way, the steps can happen smoothly and at the same time, side by side.

Because the workers depend on each other, each one has to spend only the necessary time on their task. This creates a steady, regular, and intense way of working that is very different from working alone or in simple teamwork. 12 The rule that the time spent making a product should not be more than what is needed is usually kept by competition because each producer has to sell their product at the market price.
