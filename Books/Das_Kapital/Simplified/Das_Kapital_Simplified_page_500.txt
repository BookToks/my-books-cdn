I look around and don’t see any houses except mine. I’m the giant of Giant Castle, and I have eaten up all my neighbors.

Something similar has happened in France over the last ten years. As business owners take over farming, they push extra farmers into the cities. The places where these extra people live are getting worse, with bad housing and poor conditions.

This system of dividing land has created a special group called the “landless workers.” You can read more about this in the works of Colins and Karl Marx’s book from 1869. In 1846, about 24% of people in France lived in towns, and 76% lived in the countryside. By 1861, the town population grew to nearly 29%, and the countryside dropped to 71%. In the last five years, even fewer people live in rural areas.

Back in 1846, Pierre Dupont wrote a song about workers living badly:  
“Badly clothed, living in holes, under the roofs, in ruins, with owls and thieves, friends of the dark.”

A report from 1867 focused on how children were used in farming gangs.

Some gang leaders even became rich enough to own big farms or rows of houses.

But there were problems too. For example, many girls who joined these gangs got into trouble.

These gangs have grown a lot in recent years. In some places, gangs started recently; in others, they’ve been around for a long time. More and younger children work in them now.

Small farmers don’t use gangs. Instead, gangs work on land that rents for a good price, where many women and children are employed.

One gang leader said the system would be fine if it had a nicer name like “the Agricultural Juvenile Industrial Self-supporting Association.”

A former gang leader said gangs are cheaper for farmers, but a farmer said gangs are the worst for the kids.

A lot of work children do now was once done by men and women. Because of this, many men have lost jobs where children and women work.

At the same time, some people say children are very important for farm work, especially because many workers have moved away and it’s easy to travel to big cities.

In English farming areas, the “labor problem” really means how landlords and farmers can keep enough workers on farms and keep wages low, even as more people leave the countryside.
