In America, among wild Native Americans, almost everything belongs to the worker, with about 99 out of 100 parts being the result of their work. But in England, the worker might not even get two-thirds of what they produce.

Natural wealth, like land that produces food easily, can make people lazy, proud, and careless. On the other hand, wealth that requires hard work encourages people to be watchful, educated, skilled, and organized. It’s a big problem when people live in a place where food grows naturally without much effort, and the weather is easy, because they might become lazy. But having land that doesn’t produce anything even when people work hard is just as bad.

The need to predict when the Nile River would flood led the ancient Egyptians to study the stars and develop astronomy. This helped priests control farming because they knew when to plant crops. They watched the sky carefully to find signs that the Nile’s rise was coming.

In India, one way the government kept control was by managing water supply. The Muslim rulers knew this better than the British who came later. For example, a terrible famine in 1866 killed over a million people in the Orissa region because of water problems.

No two countries produce food and necessities equally easily or with the same amount of work. People’s needs change depending on how cold or warm their climate is. In cold places, people need more clothes and have to work the land more, so more labor is needed. In warm places, less work is required for the same number of people.

All work should create more than just what was used in doing it; it should leave extra or a surplus.

Earlier versions of the book Capital had a mistake in a quote from John Stuart Mill. The missing part was about laborers and capitalists being separate groups. Marx pointed this out in a letter to a translator, explaining the error.
