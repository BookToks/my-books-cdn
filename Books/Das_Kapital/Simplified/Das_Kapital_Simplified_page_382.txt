Chapter 20: Time-Wages

Wages come in different forms, but most economic books only look at the money side and don’t talk about these differences. Explaining all the types of wages is part of studying wage labor, which is not the main focus here. Still, we need to understand two basic types.

When workers sell their labor, they usually do it for a set amount of time, like a day or a week. This is called time-wages, meaning wages paid by the hour, day, or week.

The rules about how the price of labor and extra profit change, explained in an earlier chapter, also apply to wages but in a different way. There is also a difference between the money amount of wages (called nominal wages) and what that money can actually buy (called real wages). We won’t repeat what was already said before. Instead, we’ll focus on some important points about time-wages.

The amount of money a worker gets for a day or week is their nominal wage, which is the wage measured in money. But how long a person works each day matters too. The same daily wage can mean different pay rates per hour depending on how many hours the worker works. So, when looking at time-wages, we have to separate the total wages from the price of labor per hour. To find this price, divide the daily wage by the number of hours worked. For example, if a worker gets 3 shillings for 6 hours of work, but actually works 12 hours a day, the price for 1 hour of work is 3 shillings divided by 12, which is 3 pence. This hourly wage is the basic way to measure the price of labor.

This means daily or weekly wages can stay the same even if the price of labor goes down. For example, if the usual working day is 10 hours and the daily wage is 3 shillings, the hourly wage is about 3.6 pence. But if the working day gets longer, like 12 or 15 hours, the hourly wage drops, even though the daily wage stays the same. On the other hand, daily or weekly wages can go up even if the hourly price of labor stays the same or falls. For instance, if a worker usually works 10 hours and gets 3 shillings, and then works 12 hours because business is better, their daily wage can rise without changing the hourly rate. The same thing can happen if the worker works harder during the hours instead of longer hours.

So, the daily or weekly wage can increase while the hourly price of labor stays the same or drops. The same is true for a worker’s family income if other family members also start working more. This shows that wages can be lowered without actually cutting the daily or weekly pay. As a general rule, given the amount of daily or weekly labor...
