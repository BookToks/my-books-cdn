Machines don’t need strong muscles to work, so they let people with weaker muscles, like women and children, get jobs. That’s why bosses who use machines first wanted women and children to work for them. Machines became a way to hire everyone in a worker’s family, no matter their age or gender. 

Working for the boss replaced kids playing and even stopped family members from doing small jobs at home to help out. The value of a worker’s effort wasn’t just about how much it cost to keep the adult alive, but also about what it took to support their whole family. Because machines pushed every family member to work, the value of one worker’s effort got spread out over the whole family, making each person’s work seem less valuable. 

Hiring a whole family might cost more than just one adult before, but four people working means the boss gets four times the work in less time. To survive, four people have to work and give extra work to the boss. So, machines not only gave bosses more workers to use but also made them get more work from each person.

Machines also changed the deal between workers and bosses. Before, they were thought to be equal business partners: the boss had money and tools, and the worker had their ability to work. But now, bosses buy the work of children and young people too. Workers don’t just sell their own work; they end up selling the work of their wives and kids. 

It’s like the worker has become someone who trades slaves. The need for child workers is so strong it looks like how people used to look for slaves in old ads. 

An English factory inspector once saw an ad looking for 12 to 20 young people, but only those who looked at least 13 years old. This is because rules say kids under 13 can only work 6 hours a day, and a doctor has to prove their age. So bosses want kids who look old enough, even if they aren’t. 

The number of kids under 13 working in factories dropped a lot in the last 20 years, but this was mostly because doctors lied about their ages to help bosses make more money. In a poor area called Bethnal Green, there’s a market where kids as young as 9 come every week to find work with silk makers. 

Usually, parents get paid 1 shilling and 8 pence a week, and the child gets 2 pence plus tea. But the work contract only lasts for one week.
