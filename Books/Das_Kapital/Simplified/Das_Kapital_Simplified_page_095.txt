Back in 1667, some people talked about how money works in the economy. Later, in 1774, A. Young wrote a book called "Political Arithmetic" where he explained that prices depend on how much money is around. 

Adam Smith, a famous economist, didn’t really focus on how much money is actually in use. He sometimes treated money just like any other product, which isn’t quite right. But other times, like when he criticized older economic ideas, he got it more correct. He said that the amount of money in a country depends on the value of the goods being bought and sold there. Money just moves around to help people buy what they need, and you can’t have more money circulating than what’s needed for trade.

Jacob Vanderlint, in 1734, said that prices go up when there’s more gold and silver in a country, and they fall when there’s less. It looks like another economist, Hume, knew about Vanderlint’s ideas and used them. Even before Vanderlint, some writers thought that the amount of money affects prices. Vanderlint also said that free trade is good because if money leaves one country, it will cause prices to rise in the country that gets the money, making things cheaper in the first country and eventually bringing money back.

It’s obvious that the price of each product is part of the total prices of everything sold. But it’s hard to understand how very different products can all be compared to the total amount of gold and silver in a country. If we imagine all products as one big product, then each product is a part of that big product and can be compared to a part of the total money.

Montesquieu explained this idea seriously. He said if there was only one product in the world, its parts would match parts of the total money available. So, the price of things depends on the relationship between the total amount of goods and the total amount of money.

Later economists like Ricardo and his followers developed these ideas more, but that’s a story for another time.
