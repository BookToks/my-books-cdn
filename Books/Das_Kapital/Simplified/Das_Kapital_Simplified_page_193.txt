But here, to make up for taking away the “freedom” of capital, the work hours for kids aged 11 to 13 were increased from 10 to 10½ hours. The excuse was that “working in silk mills was easier than in other mills and less harmful to health.” But official health reports later showed that, actually, the death rate was very high in silk areas, especially for women, even higher than in cotton areas.

Even though the Factory Inspector complained every six months, the problem didn’t stop. The 1850 law changed the 15-hour workday from 6 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. into a 12-hour day from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. but only for “young people and women.” It didn’t affect children, who could still work half an hour before and two and a half hours after this time, as long as they didn’t work more than 6½ hours total. While the law was being discussed, inspectors showed Parliament reports about the bad effects of this loophole, but nothing changed.

Behind the scenes, there was a plan to make adult men work 15 hours by using children to help. However, the men resisted, and the plan failed. In 1853, the law was updated to stop children from working before and after the hours set for young people and women. From then on, the 1850 Factory Act basically controlled the work hours for almost all workers in the industries it covered.

By this time, 50 years had passed since the first Factory Act. For the first time, factory laws were applied beyond their original industries with the “Printworks’ Act of 1845.” Capitalists did not like this new law at all. It limited work hours for kids aged 8 to 13, and for women, to 16 hours between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., without any breaks for meals. Men over 13 could still work anytime. This law was a failure.

But the main idea had won in the big industries that showed the modern way of working. From 1853 to 1860, these industries grew a lot, and the workers’ health and behavior improved. The bosses, who had fought hard against these laws for 50 years, now openly compared their factories to others that still had no rules. Economists who once opposed these laws started praising the idea of a set workday as a new “discovery.”

It’s clear that once the factory owners accepted these laws as unavoidable, their power to fight back got weaker. At the same time, workers got stronger because more people in society joined their cause. That’s why progress since 1860 happened faster.

By 1860, dye and bleach factories were covered by the 1850 Factory Act. Lace and stocking factories joined in 1861.

After the first report on child workers in 1863, many other industries like earthenware, matches, gun caps, cartridges, carpets, and some finishing work were also regulated. In 1863, special laws were made for outdoor bleaching and baking. These laws banned work at night for young people and women in bleaching, and stopped bakers under 18 from working between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.
