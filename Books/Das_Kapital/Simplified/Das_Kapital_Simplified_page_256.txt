The difference is not so clear-cut. Adam Smith, in his book "Wealth of Nations," talks about how many different industries work together to meet the needs of a regular worker in a successful country. This idea was actually copied almost exactly from B. de Mandeville’s earlier work called "Fable of the Bees."

There is no longer a clear reward for individual work. Each worker only makes a small part of a bigger product, and that small part by itself isn’t useful or valuable. So, the worker can’t really say, “This is my product, I will keep it.”

During the Civil War in the U.S., the government made a new tax: 6% on all industrial products. But what counts as an industrial product? The law said something is made when it is ready to sell. For example, umbrella makers in New York and Philadelphia used to make entire umbrellas themselves. But since umbrellas have many different parts, these parts started being made by different industries in different places. Then the umbrella factory just put the parts together. The Americans called these “assembled articles.” The umbrella is taxed 6% on each part and then another 6% on the whole umbrella.

Karl Marx said that the less control society has over dividing work, the more division of work happens inside small workshops, where one person has more control. So, the control inside workshops and society is linked in an opposite way.

In India, villages have stayed the same for a very long time. Even if kingdoms change or there are wars or disasters, the villages keep their names, borders, and families. People don’t worry about who rules them; they care about their village staying the same.

To divide work into small crafts, it’s not enough to just have the tools and resources ready in society. The people in charge must also have enough money and resources to run big operations.
