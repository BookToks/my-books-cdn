Besides this, where capitalist production is fully accepted in Germany (like in factories), things are much worse than in England because there are no Factory Acts to balance things out. In other areas, like the rest of Western Europe, we suffer not only because capitalism is growing but also because it’s not fully developed. Along with new problems, old problems from outdated ways of working and living still hold us back. We are hurt not only by what’s happening now but also by the past. The dead hold the living tight!

The social statistics in Germany and Western Europe are badly done compared to England, but they still show enough to scare us. We would be shocked at how bad things are if, like in England, our governments regularly investigated economic problems with honest and powerful people who didn’t take sides. In England, factory inspectors and health reporters work hard to uncover the truth about poor conditions for workers, women, children, housing, and food. It’s like wearing a magic cap to pretend there are no monsters.

Let’s not fool ourselves. Just like the American War of Independence in the 18th century inspired Europe’s middle class, the American Civil War in the 19th century inspired Europe’s working class. In England, society is clearly falling apart. When it gets worse, it will affect the rest of Europe too. How it happens depends on how strong and organized the working class is. For many reasons, the ruling classes should want to remove any laws that stop the working class from growing freely. That’s why I spent so much time in this book talking about English factory laws.

One country can and should learn from others. Even when a society is moving in the right direction to understand its own natural rules – which is what this book aims to do – it can’t skip steps or fix all problems with laws. But it can make the hard changes happen faster and with less pain.

To avoid confusion, one thing: I don’t see capitalists or landlords as good people. But here, I talk about them as symbols of economic groups and class interests. My view looks at society’s economic development like a natural process in history, so I can’t blame individuals for the social systems they are part of, no matter how much they try to rise above them.

In political economy, free scientific study faces the same enemies as other fields, but also the worst feelings like selfishness and greed. For example, the English Church would rather have its beliefs challenged than lose part of its income. Nowadays, being an atheist is seen as a small sin compared to that.
