The simplest way to compare the value of one thing is by looking at how much of it you can trade for something else. So, the value of one item can be shown by how much of another item it’s worth.

For example: 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, or 20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat.

There are two parts to this idea: the relative form and the equivalent form. The tricky part is understanding how these two work together.

In this example, the linen and the coat have different roles. The linen shows its value by being compared to the coat. The coat is the item that shows what the linen is worth. The linen is active in expressing value, and the coat is passive, just showing it.

These two forms – relative and equivalent – are connected and depend on each other, but they are also opposites. You can’t say 20 yards of linen = 20 yards of linen because that doesn’t show value, just the amount of linen. To show value, the linen has to be compared to something else, like the coat.

The coat, which shows the linen’s value, cannot be the item whose value is being expressed at the same time. It just acts as the thing that represents the value of the linen.

If you flip it around and say 1 coat = 20 yards of linen, then the coat’s value is being shown, and the linen becomes the equivalent. One item can’t be both the one showing value and the one representing value in the same comparison.

Which item is relative and which is equivalent depends on the specific situation – whether the value of that item is being shown or it is being used to show the value of something else.

To understand this better, we need to look at how the value of one item is hidden in the comparison between two items, ignoring the exact amounts for now. Usually, people just focus on how much of one thing equals how much of another, but there’s more to it than just numbers.
