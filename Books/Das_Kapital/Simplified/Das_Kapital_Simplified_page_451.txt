... The endless growth of workers' productivity only leads to more luxury and comfort for rich people who don’t work. Finally, Destutt de Tracy, a strict middle-class thinker, says bluntly: “In poor countries, people live okay, but in rich countries, most people are usually poor.”

Section 5: Examples of How Capitalism Grows

A. England from 1846-1866

No time in modern history is better for studying how capitalism grows than the last 20 years. It’s like this time had a magic money bag. England is the best example because it is the biggest player in the world market, capitalism is fully developed there, and since 1846, free trade stopped the last bit of old-fashioned saving.

Production grew a lot—especially in the second half of these 20 years—and this was already explained in Part IV.

Even though England’s population grew a lot in the last 50 years, its growth rate went down steadily, as this table from the census shows.

Annual population growth rates for England and Wales:  
1811-1821: 1.533%  
1821-1831: 1.446%  
1831-1841: 1.326%  
1841-1851: 1.216%  
1851-1861: 1.141%

Now, let’s look at how wealth increased. The best way to check this is by looking at profits, land rent, and other income that gets taxed. Between 1853 and 1864, profits that were taxed in Great Britain went up by 50.47%, or about 4.58% per year. The population only grew by about 12% in that time. Land rent, including houses, railways, mines, and fishing, rose by 38%, or about 3.5% per year.

Here are some of the biggest increases in yearly income from 1853 to 1864:  
Houses: 38.60% total increase, 3.50% per year  
Quarries: 84.76% total increase, 7.70% per year  
Mines: 68.85% total increase, 6.26% per year  
Ironworks: 39.92% total increase, 3.63% per year  
Fisheries: 57.37% total increase, 5.21% per year
