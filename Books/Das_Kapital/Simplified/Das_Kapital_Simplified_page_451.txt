... The indefinite multiplication of the productive powers of labour can then only have for result the increase of luxury and enjoyment of the idle rich.” 29 Finally Destutt de Tracy, the fish-blooded bourgeois doctrinaire, blurts out brutally: “In poor nations the people are comfortable, in rich nations they are generally poor.”30 Section 5: Illustrations of the General Law of Capitalist Accumulation A. England from 1846-1866 No period of modern society is so favourable for the study of capitalist accumulation as the period of the last 20 years. It is as if this period had found Fortunatus’ purse. But of all countries England again furnishes the classical example, because it holds the foremost place in the worldmarket, because capitalist production is here alone completely developed, and lastly, because the introduction of the Free-trade millennium since 1846 has cut off the last retreat of vulgar economy. The titanic advance of production – the latter half of the 20 years’ period again far surpassing the former – has been already pointed out sufficiently in Part IV.
 
 Although the absolute increase of the English population in the last half century was very great, the relative increase or rate of growth fell constantly, as the following table borrowed from the census shows.
 
 Annual increase per cent. of the population of England and Wales in decimal numbers: 1811-1821 1.533 per cent.
 
 1821-1831 1.446 per cent.
 
 1831-1841 1.326 per cent.
 
 1841-1851 1.216 per cent.
 
 1851-1861 1.141 per cent.
 
 Let us now, on the other hand, consider the increase of wealth. Here the movement of profit, rent of land, &c., that come under the income tax, furnishes the surest basis. The increase of profits liable to income tax (farmers and some other categories not included) in Great Britain from 1853 to 1864 amounted to 50.47% or 4.58% as the annual average,31 that of the population during the same period to about 12%. The augmentation of the rent of land subject to taxation (including houses, railways, mines, fisheries, &c.), amounted for 1853 to 1864 to 38% or 3 5/12% annually.
 
 Under this head the following categories show the greatest increase: Excess of annual income Increase of 1864 over that of 1853 per year Houses 38.60% 3.50% Quarries 84.76% 7.70% Mines 68.85% 6.26% Ironworks 39.92% 3.63% Fisheries 57.37% 5.21% 452 Chapter 25 Gasworks 126.
