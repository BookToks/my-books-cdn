This is the special job that a boss expects from workers, and in this deal, he follows the usual rules of buying and selling things. The worker, like anyone selling stuff, gets paid the value of what they sell and gives up the use of it. They can’t keep one without giving the other. The worker’s ability to work (labour) doesn’t belong to them once it’s sold, just like oil doesn’t belong to the seller after it’s sold. The person who pays for a day’s work owns that work for the day. Even though it only costs half a day’s work to keep the worker alive, the worker can work a full day, so the value created by a day’s work is twice what the boss pays. This is lucky for the boss but not unfair to the worker.

The boss expected this and that’s why he laughed. The worker finds the tools and materials needed to work, not just for six hours but for twelve hours. Just like 10 pounds of cotton needed six hours of work to turn into yarn, now 20 pounds of cotton need 12 hours of work to make yarn. Let’s look at what this longer work time produces. In 20 pounds of yarn, there is the work of five days: four days’ worth is in the cotton and tools, and one day’s work is from spinning the cotton. This five days of work is worth thirty shillings. So, 20 pounds of yarn cost thirty shillings, which is the same price as before—18 pence a pound. But the total value of the cotton, tools, and worker’s pay was 27 shillings. The yarn’s value is 30 shillings, so the product’s value is one-ninth more than what was spent to make it. The 27 shillings turned into 30 shillings, creating 3 shillings of extra value. The trick worked; money has turned into capital.

All the rules of buying and selling are followed here. The boss paid the full value for each thing: cotton, tools, and work. Then he used those things, like any buyer would. Using the worker’s labour made 20 pounds of yarn worth 30 shillings. The boss, who was a buyer before, now sells the yarn for its real price, 18 pence a pound. But even so, he makes 3 shillings more than he started with. This change, turning money into capital, happens both when buying and selling and also outside that, because the real gain happens during production. So, “everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds,” as Voltaire said. By turning money into things needed for making new products, and mixing living work with the tools and materials, the boss changes value — old, dead work — into capital, a living thing that grows and multiplies.

If we compare making value and making extra value (surplus-value), we see that making surplus-value is just making value go further. If the worker only works enough to cover what the boss paid for their labour, it’s just making value. But if the worker works beyond that, it becomes making surplus-value, extra value for the boss.
