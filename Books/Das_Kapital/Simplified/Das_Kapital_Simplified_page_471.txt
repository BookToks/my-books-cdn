Here is a table showing the weekly amounts of different nutrients people get from their food:

Portland (convict) gets 28.95 ounces of nitrogenous ingredients, 150.06 ounces of non-nitrogenous ingredients, 4.68 ounces of mineral matter, totaling 183.69 ounces.  
A sailor in the Navy gets 29.63 ounces of nitrogenous ingredients, 152.91 ounces of non-nitrogenous ingredients, 4.52 ounces of mineral matter, totaling 187.06 ounces.  
A soldier gets 25.55 ounces of nitrogenous ingredients, 114.49 ounces of non-nitrogenous ingredients, 3.94 ounces of mineral matter, totaling 143.98 ounces.  
A working coachmaker gets 24.53 ounces of nitrogenous ingredients, 162.06 ounces of non-nitrogenous ingredients, 4.23 ounces of mineral matter, totaling 190.82 ounces.  
A compositor gets 21.24 ounces of nitrogenous ingredients, 100.83 ounces of non-nitrogenous ingredients, 3.12 ounces of mineral matter, totaling 125.19 ounces.  
An agricultural labourer gets 17.73 ounces of nitrogenous ingredients, 118.06 ounces of non-nitrogenous ingredients, 3.29 ounces of mineral matter, totaling 139.08 ounces.  

The medical commission in 1863 found that many poor farming families don’t get enough food to stop starvation diseases. This is especially true in rural areas like Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Wilts, Stafford, Oxford, Berks, and Herts.

Dr. E. Smith said the labourer usually eats more than the average because he needs more energy for his work. He often eats most of the meat and bacon in the family. But the wife and children, especially when they are growing fast, often don’t get enough food, especially protein. Male and female servants living on farms usually get enough food. Their numbers dropped from 288,277 in 1851 to 204,962 in 1861.

Dr. Smith also said that women working in the fields, even if it’s hard work, helps the family. Their earnings help pay for clothes, shoes, and rent, which means the family can afford better food.

One big finding was that English farm workers are the worst fed compared to other parts of the UK. The table below shows the weekly amounts of carbon and nitrogen, which are important nutrients, eaten by an average farming adult:

England: 46,673 grains of carbon, 1,594 grains of nitrogen  
Wales: 48,354 grains of carbon, 2,031 grains of nitrogen  
Scotland: 48,980 grains of carbon, 2,348 grains of nitrogen  
Ireland: 43,366 grains of carbon, 2,434 grains of nitrogen  

Dr. Simon said in his Health Report that the poor housing conditions for farm workers also add to their problems.
