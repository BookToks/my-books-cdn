How much workers are used and how productive they are affects how much money a business makes and saves. The bigger the extra money made (called surplus-value), the more money can be saved or invested. For example, if 80% of this extra money is saved and 20% is spent, the saved amount will be much bigger if the total extra money is big. So, everything that affects how much extra money is made also affects how much money is saved and grows.

Remember, the amount of extra money depends mainly on how much workers are used or exploited. Economics sometimes mixes up the faster money growth from workers being more productive and from workers being used more. Usually, it’s assumed workers get paid enough to live on. But sometimes wages are pushed below this living amount, which actually helps businesses save more money. This means workers’ basic needs are being used to help businesses grow.

John Stuart Mill said wages don’t create stuff; they just pay for the ability to work. Wages don’t add to making products any more than paying for tools adds to the tools themselves. If workers didn’t need to be paid, wages wouldn’t be necessary. But since workers need to live, their wages can’t be zero, though businesses always try to pay as little as possible.

An 18th-century writer said England’s goal was to lower wages to match countries like France and the Netherlands. He noticed English workers wanted to live well and buy luxuries like brandy, tea, and tobacco. In France, workers lived much more simply, eating mostly bread, fruit, and dried fish, and worked harder for less money. This made French labor cheaper than English labor.
