Now we come to a tricky point, so pay close attention! The second to last working hour is just like any other working hour—nothing special. So how can the spinner make yarn in one hour that is worth 5¾ hours of work?

The truth is, he doesn’t do any magic. The value of the yarn he makes in one hour includes 5¾ hours of work. But 4¾ of those hours are already built into the cotton, the machines, and other materials before he even starts. He only adds one hour of work himself.

Since his paycheck comes from 5¾ hours of work, and the yarn he makes in one hour includes 5¾ hours of work, it makes sense that the value of what he spins in 5¾ hours equals the value of the yarn made in one hour.

You’re wrong if you think he spends any time replacing the value of the cotton or machines. Actually, because he spins, the value of the cotton and machines naturally becomes part of the yarn. This happens because of the kind of work he does, not how long he works.

Sure, he adds more value in one hour than in half an hour, but that’s just because he spins more cotton in one hour than in half an hour. So, when you say the worker produces the value of his wages in the second to last hour, and your profit in the last hour, what you really mean is that in two hours of work, whether at the start or end of the day, the yarn includes 11½ hours of work—two hours of his own and 9½ hours of others’ work.

And when I say the worker produces his wages in the first 5¾ hours and your profit in the last 5¾ hours, I mean you pay him for the first part but not the second.

When we talk about paying for labor, I’m just using your own words. Now, if you compare the time you pay for with the time you don’t, you’ll see they are equal—half a day paid, half a day unpaid—meaning a 100% profit rate, which is pretty good.

Also, if you make your workers work 13 hours instead of 11½, and treat the extra hour and a half as pure extra work, then the unpaid work increases from 5¾ hours to 7¼ hours, and the profit rate goes from 100% to about 126%. So don’t expect that adding 1½ hours will double your profit.

On the other hand, don’t worry that cutting work hours from 11½ to 10 will kill your profit. The unpaid work will drop from 5¾ to 4¾ hours, but you’ll still have a good profit rate of about 82%.

That scary “last hour” you’ve heard so much about? It’s nonsense. Losing it won’t hurt your profits or the well-being of the workers.

When that “last hour” really comes, just think of the Oxford Professor.

Now, gentlemen, goodbye, and may we meet again in a better world, but not before.

Senior first made the “last hour” a big deal in 1836. In 1848, James Wilson, a respected economist, brought it up again to argue against the 10-hour workday law.
