In 1846, the United States produced 21,789,346 pounds of cotton. By 1860, this had grown to 59,166,616 pounds, and in 1865, it reached 109,734,261 pounds.

The economic growth of the United States comes mostly from European, especially English, modern industry. Even in 1866, the U.S. was still kind of like a European colony. But since then, it has grown into a country with the world’s second biggest industry, though it still keeps some colonial traits.

The amount of cotton the United States exported to Great Britain also grew a lot. In 1846, it was 401,949,393 pounds. By 1852, it was 765,630,543 pounds, and in 1859, it reached 961,707,264 pounds. In 1860, it hit 1,115,890,608 pounds.

The U.S. also exported a lot of corn and other grains to Great Britain in 1862. For example, it sent over 16,202,312 cwts (hundredweights) of wheat, 3,669,653 cwts of barley, 3,174,801 cwts of oats, and other grains like rye, flour, buckwheat, maize, peas, and beans. The total exports added up to 74,083,441 cwts.

In July 1866, shoemakers in Leicester, England, who had lost their jobs because of a lock-out, made a big appeal to trade groups. They said that 20 years earlier, their industry changed when they started using riveting instead of stitching. At first, workers earned good wages, and companies competed to make the best shoes. But then, competition got worse as companies tried to sell their shoes cheaper than each other. This made wages go down a lot, sometimes to half of what they used to be. Even though wages dropped, companies kept making more money.

During tough times, manufacturers still made big profits by cutting workers’ wages too much. For example, in Coventry’s silk weaving industry, wages were cut by 30 to 40 percent, even though this wasn’t really needed because of foreign competition or other reasons. Five years ago, weavers earned 6 or 7 shillings for making a ribbon, but now they only get about 3 shillings. Other work that used to pay 4 shillings now pays about 2. Even though weaving costs went down, the prices for the finished ribbons didn’t drop much. This shows workers were being paid way less while companies kept selling for almost the same price.
