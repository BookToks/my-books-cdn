Some landlords took advantage of workers by paying them less than normal wages. But three years later, when a cattle disease spread, Parliament quickly gave millions of money to pay the rich landlords back, even though the farmers didn’t lose out because meat prices went up. The angry complaints from the landowners in 1866 showed that people can really care about their land and animals, even if they are not religious, and can act stubborn like bulls.

A worker needed enough money just to live, while the boss needed workers to make money.

In a place called Durham, things were different. Farmers didn’t fully control the workers there. Because of mining jobs, workers had some choices. Farmers only rented farms that had houses for workers, called “hinds’ houses.” The rent for these houses was part of the workers’ pay. The workers had to agree to a contract called “bondage,” which meant if they worked somewhere else, they had to leave someone, like a family member, to take their place. The workers were called “bondsmen.” This system showed how workers’ living needs ended up helping the rich landowners. For example, the landowners even controlled where workers could go to the bathroom and used their waste as fertilizer for their gardens, making sure they kept control over everything.

It’s important to remember that when it came to child labor and other kinds of work, even the idea that workers chose to sell their labor freely wasn’t always true.

Capital (money and resources used to make things) needs workers to earn wages, and workers need capital to have jobs. They depend on each other. For example, a worker in a cotton factory doesn’t just make cotton clothes; they also create capital. They make things that give the bosses more control over work and help create even more value. These ideas were explained by Karl Marx in 1849 during some talks he gave to a workers’ group in Brussels, but the publication was stopped because of a revolution.
