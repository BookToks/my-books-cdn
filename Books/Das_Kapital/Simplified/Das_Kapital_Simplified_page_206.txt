Back in 1734, Jacob Vanderlint said that when rich people complained about workers being lazy, it was really because the workers wanted to get paid for working 6 days instead of just 4.

In France, people didn’t like working more than 12 hours a day because a law set that as the limit, and that was the only good thing left from the government’s rules. Before this law in 1850, workers could be made to work 14, 15, or even more hours a day.

Belgium is an example of a country that tries to control work hours. But even there, they don’t have laws to limit kids’ work. The government wanted to make rules but kept facing strong opposition because some people believe in total freedom to work however much you want.

Working 12 hours a day means a lot of time is spent working, eating, and traveling to work—almost 14 hours out of 24. This is really bad for kids and young workers because it leaves no time to rest or enjoy life. It’s important for society that workers get some free time every day to stay healthy and happy.

During the time of King Louis Philippe in France, a law was made in 1841 to limit kids’ work hours, but it was never really enforced. It said kids between 8 and 12 could work 8 hours, and older kids could work longer, but there were lots of exceptions. The law wasn’t properly checked, and only one area had a government inspector to enforce it.

Reports from the mid-1800s often talked about bad working conditions and unfair practices in factories. Some laws allowed kids to work 10 hours, but only on alternate days, and these rules mostly weren’t followed.
