Surplus-produce is the extra stuff made beyond what’s needed to pay the worker for their time. For example, if a worker produces 20 pounds of yarn, 2 pounds of that is surplus-produce. 

The amount of surplus-produce depends on how much work is needed to make what the worker needs to live, not the whole product. Since making surplus-produce is the main goal of capitalist businesses, a person’s or country’s wealth isn’t about how much they make overall, but how much extra they produce beyond what’s needed to survive.

The total working time includes both the time the worker spends making what they need for themselves and the time spent making surplus-produce for the capitalist. This total is called the working day.
