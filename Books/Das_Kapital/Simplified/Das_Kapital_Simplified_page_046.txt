3. Moving from the General Form of Value to the Money Form

The universal equivalent form is a way to show value that any product can take. But if one product becomes the universal equivalent (called form C), it’s only because all the other products have agreed to accept it as their equivalent.

When this agreement finally focuses on just one product, that’s when the general way of showing value among all products becomes real and accepted by society.

The product that becomes the universal equivalent is called the money commodity, or just money. This product gets a special role and is the only one allowed to act as the universal equivalent for all other products.

Among all products, one has taken this top spot – gold. If we swap the linen in form C with gold, we get form D.

For example:  
20 yards of linen = 1 coat = 10 pounds of tea = 40 pounds of coffee = 2 ounces of gold = 1 quarter of corn = ½ a ton of iron = x Commodity A.

The changes from form A to B, and B to C, are big changes. But there’s no real difference between forms C and D, except that gold replaces linen as the universal equivalent. Gold is now what linen was before – the universal equivalent.

The big change is that society has agreed that gold is the direct and universal way to exchange value.

Gold became money because it was first just a regular product like others. It could be used as an equivalent in some trades or alongside other products. Over time, it started to be used more and more as the universal equivalent.

Once gold took over this role completely, it became the money commodity. That’s when form D becomes different from form C, and the general form of value changes into the money form.

The simple way to express the value of one product (like linen) in terms of the money product (like gold) is called the price form.

So, the price form of linen is 20 yards of linen = 2 ounces of gold. If 2 ounces of gold are worth £2 when made into coins, then 20 yards of linen = £2.

The hard part about understanding the money form is really understanding the universal equivalent form and, because of that, the general form of value (form C). This general form comes from form B, which is the expanded form of value. The key part of that is form A, like 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or x commodity A = y commodity B.
