If the work hours were cut, more kids would have to be hired. It was thought that the extra kids aged 8 to 9 would fill the need for more workers.

A report from October 31, 1848, talks about this issue.

Some men who used to earn 10 shillings a week had 1 shilling taken off because of a 10% pay cut, and then another 1 shilling 6 pence cut because of fewer work hours. That means they lost 2 shillings 6 pence total. Still, many said they preferred working 10 hours.

One person signed a petition but said he felt it was wrong. When asked why he signed it, he said he was scared of losing his job if he didn’t. This shows he felt treated unfairly, but not exactly because of the Factory Act.

In Mr. Horner’s area, 10,270 adult male workers were checked in 181 factories.

Their stories are in the Factory Reports from the half-year ending October 1848. These reports give useful information in other ways too.

You can find some of the evidence collected by Leonard Horner and others in the appendix of the reports. One factory owner even told the truth openly.

These reports were published on October 31, 1848, and April 30, 1848, among other dates.

The idea of capital, or money used for business, has been the same for a long time. For example, before the American Civil War, in New Mexico, workers were seen as the capitalist’s property because they had bought their work. The same idea was in ancient Rome, where money lent to poor people was thought to become part of their bodies and lives.

Other reports and letters from that time show different opinions on these issues.

A law called Sir John Hobhouse’s Factory Act stopped factory owners and their close family members from being judges in Factory Act cases. This was to avoid unfair decisions.

More details and examples are in the reports from 1848 and 1849.
