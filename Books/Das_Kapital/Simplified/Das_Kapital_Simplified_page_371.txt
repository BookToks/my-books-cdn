When workers get better at their jobs and work harder, they can make more stuff in less time. This means they don’t need to work as long just to earn what they need to live.

The shortest possible workday is the time needed to make enough for a worker to survive. If the workday were only this short, there would be no extra work done, which is impossible under capitalism. Only by getting rid of capitalism could work hours be cut down to just what’s needed.

Even then, what counts as “enough to live” would grow. Workers would want a better life, and some of the extra work now done would become necessary, like saving for the future.

As work gets more productive, the workday can get shorter. And as the workday gets shorter, workers can work more intensely during that time. Society benefits when labor is used efficiently, avoiding waste. But capitalism, while saving money in some businesses, wastes a lot of labor and resources because of the chaotic competition and creates many jobs that aren’t really needed.

If work is more intense and productive, society needs less time to produce what it needs. This leaves more free time for people to learn, grow, and enjoy life—especially if work is shared fairly among everyone. But under capitalism, one group gets free time only because most people have to work all the time.

In the end, the shortest workday depends on everyone sharing work equally. Right now, some people get free time by making others work more.
