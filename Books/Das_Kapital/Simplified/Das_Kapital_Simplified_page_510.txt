A lot of the church’s land was given away to greedy royal favorites or sold really cheap to farmers and city people who wanted to make money. These new owners kicked out the families who had lived there for generations and combined their lands into bigger farms. The poor people’s rights to some church land were quietly taken away. Queen Elizabeth saw so much poverty during her trip around England that she said, “Poor people are everywhere.” In her 43rd year as queen, the country had to officially admit there were a lot of poor people by starting a tax to help them. The people who made this law seemed embarrassed because it didn’t even explain why it was needed. Later on, the law became permanent, and it wasn’t changed until 1834, when it became stricter. But these changes right after the Reformation weren’t the most important in the long run. Church land used to support old ways of owning land, but when the church lost its property, those old ways couldn’t last. Even by the late 1600s, there were still many independent farmers called yeomen, who played a big role in supporting Cromwell. They were better off than the rich but irresponsible landowners and the local priests, who sometimes had to marry their masters’ old girlfriends. But by around 1750, the yeomen had disappeared, and by the late 1700s, the last common lands for farm workers were gone too. We’re not talking about the economic reasons for these changes here, just the forceful ways they happened.

After the Stuarts came back to power, rich landowners used legal tricks to take control of land in England. On the European continent, this happened without any legal steps, but in England, they did it through laws. They got rid of old rules that tied land to the government, paid the government with taxes from peasants and other people, and claimed full private ownership of land they had only had under old feudal rights. They also made laws that hurt farm workers, similar to harsh rules in Russia under Boris Godunof.

The “Glorious Revolution” brought William of Orange to power along with landlords and capitalists who wanted to get rich from farming. They started stealing state lands on a huge scale, much more than before. These lands were given away, sold for very little money, or just taken over by force. They didn’t even pretend to follow the law. The lands stolen from the crown and church became the huge estates owned by England’s rich ruling class today. Capitalists liked this because it helped them buy and sell land freely, grow big farms, and have many poor farm workers ready to work. The new rich landowners worked closely with bankers, rich financiers, and big manufacturers who wanted protection from competition. The English rich acted smartly for themselves, just like the Swedish rich did when they worked with farmers to help their kings take back crown lands from the old ruling class in the early 1600s.

Communal land, which means land shared by communities and not owned by the state, was an old Germanic tradition that lasted under feudalism. We’ve seen how people started taking this land by force at the end of the 1400s and into the 1500s, often turning farm fields into pastures for animals. But back then, this was done through violent acts by individuals, and for about 150 years, laws tried but failed to stop it.
