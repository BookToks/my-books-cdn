France is slowly catching up to England. The February revolution was needed to create the 12-hour workday law, which is not as good as the English version. Still, the French way has some advantages. It sets the same workday limit for all shops and factories, no matter what. In England, the rules change depending on the situation, making things confusing with lots of different laws.

The French law makes a clear rule, while in England, this was first done only for children, teenagers, and women, and only recently became a general right for everyone. In the United States, workers couldn’t really fight for their rights as long as slavery existed. Workers who were white couldn’t be free while black workers were treated like property. But after slavery ended, a new movement started. The first big result of the Civil War was the fight for an eight-hour workday, which spread quickly all across the country.

At a big meeting of workers in Baltimore in 1866, they said the most important thing was to pass a law for an eight-hour day in all states. They promised to work hard until this happened. At the same time, another important workers’ meeting in Geneva agreed that limiting work hours was the first step to improving workers’ lives and freeing them. They also said eight hours should be the legal limit for work.

So, workers on both sides of the Atlantic agreed with English Factory Inspector R.J. Saunders, who said changes in society would only work if work hours were limited and the limit was strictly followed. We have to admit that workers are changed by their work. When they sell their ability to work, it looks like a fair deal. The contract says they are free to choose, but in reality, they are forced to work for a set time. The boss keeps control “as long as the worker has muscles, nerves, and blood to use.”

To protect themselves from this, workers have to come together and demand a law that stops them from selling themselves and their families into slavery through contracts. Instead of just talking about “rights,” they need a real law that says clearly when work time ends and their own time begins. What a big change from before!
