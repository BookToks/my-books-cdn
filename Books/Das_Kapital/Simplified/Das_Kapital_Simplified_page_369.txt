Every change in the relationship between how much extra value workers create and the value of their work happens because the amount of extra work they do changes. This extra work means extra value.

The value of a worker’s ability to work can only change because working extra hours causes more wear and tear on the worker. So, changes in this value happen because of changes in the extra value created, not the other way around.

Let’s start with what happens when the working day gets shorter.

If the working day is shortened, the value of the worker’s ability and the time needed for basic work stay the same. But the extra work and extra value created go down. This means both the total extra value and the extra value compared to the worker’s value drop.

The only way a boss could avoid losing out is by paying the worker less than their actual value.

Most arguments against shorter working days assume this situation, but in real life, changes in how productive or intense work is happen before or right after the day gets shorter.

Now, let’s look at when the working day gets longer. Imagine the basic work time is 6 hours, and the value of work is 3 shillings. The extra work is also 6 hours, with extra value of 3 shillings.

So, the total workday is 12 hours and worth 6 shillings. If the day is lengthened by 2 hours but the worker’s pay stays the same, the extra value goes up both in total and compared to the worker’s value. Even though the worker’s value doesn’t change in total, it becomes less compared to the extra value.

Usually, the value of a worker’s ability changes only if the total value changes. But here, the value compared to the worker’s value changes because the extra value changes.

Because a longer workday means more value created, both the extra value and the worker’s pay can go up at the same time, either equally or not.

When the workday gets longer, the worker’s pay might actually become less than the real value of their work, even if the pay looks the same or even higher.

The real value of a day’s work is based on how long people usually work and live, and how their bodies handle work. Up to a point, working longer can be balanced by higher pay. But after that, the damage to the worker increases quickly, and the conditions needed for them to work normally are lost.

At that point, the worker’s pay and how much the boss exploits them can no longer be fairly compared.
