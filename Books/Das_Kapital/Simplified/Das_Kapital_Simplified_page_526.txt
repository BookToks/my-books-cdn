Chapter 29: How the Capitalist Farmer Started

We’ve already talked about how a group of workers without land were forced into working for wages, and how the government used the police to help rich people get richer by making workers work harder for less pay. Now, the question is: where did the capitalists come from in the first place?

Taking land from farmers only made the biggest landowners richer. But when it comes to how the farmer class began, we can actually trace it because it happened slowly over many centuries. Serfs and small landowners held land in different ways and became free under different economic conditions.

In England, the first kind of farmer was the bailiff, who was a serf. His job was like an old Roman farm manager’s but with less power. In the late 1300s, the bailiff was replaced by a farmer who got seeds, animals, and tools from the landlord. He wasn’t much better off than a peasant but hired more workers. Soon, he became a metayer, or half-farmer. He and the landlord both put in part of the farm’s resources and split the harvest based on a contract.

This system didn’t last long in England. Soon the full farmer appeared, who used his own money to hire workers and paid rent to the landlord either in money or crops. In the 1400s, peasants and farmworkers who worked for themselves or for wages could get richer by their own labor. During this time, farmers weren’t doing very well either.

The big change, called the agricultural revolution, started in the late 1400s and went on through most of the 1500s (except the last 10 years). This made farmers richer but made most farmworkers poorer. When common lands were taken away, farmers could increase their animals for almost no cost and get more manure to enrich their soil.

Another important change happened in the 1500s: farm contracts lasted a long time, sometimes 99 years. Money lost value because precious metals became less valuable. This helped farmers a lot. Wages went down, so farmers made more profit. Prices for things like grain, wool, and meat went up, which increased the farmer’s money without them doing more work, while rent stayed the same or became cheaper in real terms.

Because of all this, farmers got richer by taking advantage of both their workers and landlords. It’s no surprise that by the end of the 1500s, England had a class of rich capitalist farmers compared to the times they lived in.
