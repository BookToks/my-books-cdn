So, the law from 1844 about child labor was really strict, and some factory owners, like Shylock, wanted to follow it exactly. But then they started fighting against the same law when it came to rules about women and young people working.

The main goal of the law was to stop the “false relay system,” which let workers be switched in and out during long workdays. The factory owners said the parts of the 1844 law that stopped them from using young people and women in this way weren’t a big deal if the workday was 12 hours. But with the Ten Hours’ Act, they said these rules were really unfair.

They told the inspectors to ignore the law and bring back the old system because, they claimed, it would let them pay workers more. They said this was the only way to keep Britain strong in industry. They even said it might be hard to spot rule-breaking with the relay system, but that wasn’t important compared to the country’s big business interests.

Of course, these tricks didn’t work. The Factory Inspectors took the case to court.

But then, lots of complaints from factory owners piled up and the Home Secretary, Sir George Grey, told inspectors not to punish mill owners if there was no clear proof that young workers were working too long. After that, one inspector, J. Stuart, allowed the relay system again in Scotland, where it became popular once more.

But English inspectors said the Home Secretary couldn’t just ignore the law and kept going to court to stop the relay system.

Still, what was the point of taking factory owners to court when the judges, who were local bosses themselves, always let them off? For example, a cotton spinner named Eskrigge made a relay plan for his mill. When the inspector said no, he waited. Then a man named Robinson, who was connected to Eskrigge, took the same plan to court and was let off by judges, including Eskrigge himself.

After that, Eskrigge thought it was okay to use the system in his own factory too. The judges were basically deciding for themselves, which was against the law.

Inspector Howell said these unfair court cases needed fixing. Either the law should be changed to match the judges’ decisions, or the law should be enforced by better judges who would actually follow the rules.
