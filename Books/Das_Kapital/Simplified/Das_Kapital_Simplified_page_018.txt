The last reason mentioned is still very important today, especially because the way things work in the world market hasn’t changed much. English weights and measures still mostly control the main industries like iron and cotton.

To finish, a few words about Marx’s way of using quotes, which many people don’t really get. When the quotes are just facts or descriptions, like from the English Blue books, they act as simple proof. But when Marx quotes other economists’ ideas, he’s not just copying them. He’s showing where, when, and who first clearly explained an economic idea as it was developing.

The important thing is that the idea mattered to the history of economics and showed the economic situation of that time. It doesn’t matter if the idea is still true or already outdated. So, these quotes are like a running commentary, taken from the history of economic science, showing when and by whom important economic theories were created. This was needed because the history of economics was often told by people who ignored facts and only cared about their own careers. That’s why Marx only rarely quoted German economists, as explained in the Afterword to the second edition.

There is hope that the second volume will come out sometime in 1884.
