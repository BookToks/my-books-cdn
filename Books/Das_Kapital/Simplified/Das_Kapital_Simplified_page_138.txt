This kind of power is more valuable, so the work that uses it is also higher-level work. This kind of work creates more value in the same amount of time compared to unskilled work.

Even though there is a skill difference between a spinner and a jeweller, the part of the jeweller’s work that just replaces the value of their own effort is no different from the extra part that creates profit. Making jewelry, like spinning yarn, creates profit only when the work goes beyond what is needed to cover the worker’s own value. 

However, when we look at how value is created, skilled work has to be compared to average work. For example, one day of skilled work might be equal to six days of unskilled work.

To make things simpler, we assume that the worker hired by the boss does unskilled average work.

"The earth doesn’t produce much on its own, and what it does produce seems like a small gift from nature, kind of like a little money given to a young person to help them start working and building their future." (James Steuart, 1770)

"Reason is as clever as it is powerful. It works by letting things affect each other naturally, without forcing anything, to reach its goals." (Hegel, 1840)

In his poor book from 1815, Ganilh lists many steps that need to happen before real farming can start, opposing the "Physiocrats."

Turgot, in 1766, highlights how important farm animals were to early human societies.

The least important products for comparing different times in history are luxury items. Even though old history books rarely focus on how people made stuff (which is the base for all society and history), prehistory is divided based on the materials used for tools, like the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages.

It might sound strange to say that fish swimming freely are part of fishing work, but no one has figured out how to catch fish where there are none.

This way of deciding what counts as productive work doesn’t directly apply to how bosses run their businesses.

Storch calls real raw materials “matières” and other materials “matériaux.” Cherbuliez calls these other materials “instrumental materials.”

Colonel Torrens cleverly said that the first stone a savage throws at an animal or the first stick used to get fruit is the start of capital, because these items help get other things.

Products belong to someone before they become capital, and turning them into capital doesn’t change that.
