Wages can only go up so much without breaking the whole capitalist system. The way capitalism works means workers have to keep being exploited, and their pay can’t rise too much, or else the system won’t keep growing. In capitalism, workers exist to help make money grow, not the other way around. Just like in religion people are controlled by their own ideas, in capitalism people are controlled by the things they produce.

Economists say that wages don’t go up because there is more wealth or capital already, but because capital keeps growing and growing fast. We’ve talked about one part of this process, where capital grows but the way it’s made stays the same. But the process doesn’t stop there.

At some point, as capitalism grows, the productivity of workers becomes the biggest driver of growth.

Adam Smith said that the same thing that raises wages – more money or stock – also makes workers more productive, so less work produces more stuff. Outside of natural things like good soil or the skill of individual workers, productivity means how much stuff one worker can make using tools and machines in a certain time. When workers get more productive, they use more raw materials and machines. Some of these materials and machines increase because workers get more productive, while others are needed to help workers be more productive. For example, dividing work into parts and using machines lets workers process more raw materials faster.

Whether they help productivity or result from it, having more machines and tools compared to workers shows that productivity is growing. This means less work is needed for the same amount of production, or the tools and machines become more important than the workers’ effort.
