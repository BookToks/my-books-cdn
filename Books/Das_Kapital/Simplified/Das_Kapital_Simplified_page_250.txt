In every developed and modern society, most working people end up in a tough situation because of how work is divided. To stop the majority of people from becoming worse off because of this, Adam Smith suggests that the government should give people some education, but only in small amounts.

However, G. Garnier, a French writer who translated and commented on Smith's work, disagrees. He says teaching everyone goes against the natural way work is divided. He believes that as society gets richer, the difference between physical work and brain work becomes more clear. This division is both a result of progress and a cause of future progress. Garnier asks if the government should really try to stop this natural division by mixing the two types of work, especially if it costs public money.

Some damage to people’s bodies and minds is unavoidable when work is divided like this in society. Manufacturing makes this separation even stronger and affects workers deeply, which is why it starts many problems related to work and health.

Breaking down a person’s work into tiny parts can be very harmful. If the person deserves punishment, it’s like killing them, and if not, it’s like killing them anyway. The division of labor, especially in manufacturing, can destroy people’s lives.

Manufacturing work begins naturally and then becomes the usual way capitalist businesses operate. Over time, the way work is divided gets set and stays the same for a long time, changing only when new tools or machines are invented. Manufacturing either uses parts already ready to be put together, like in making clothes, or assigns certain jobs to specific workers, like in bookbinding. Usually, it doesn’t take long to figure out how many people are needed for each job.

By breaking down tasks, specializing tools, and grouping workers, manufacturing creates a system that organizes work and makes production more efficient. But, under capitalism, this system mainly helps bosses get richer by making workers produce more while making their lives harder.

This system makes it easier for capital owners to control workers. So, while manufacturing is a step forward in economic growth, it’s also a smart and modern way to exploit workers.
