If smaller workplaces were not included in the rules about working hours, it would be unfair. Bigger factories would lose their young and female workers to these smaller places that don’t have to follow the laws. Also, more small workplaces would open, and these are usually the worst for workers’ health, comfort, education, and overall improvement.

The Commission’s final report suggests that over 1,400,000 children, young people, and women should be covered by the Factory Act. About half of these workers are in small industries or do work at home. The report says if Parliament agrees to protect all these young and female workers, it would help a lot. It would not only protect them but also improve conditions for many adult workers. The law would make sure they work regular, fair hours and that workplaces are clean and healthy. This would keep workers stronger and healthier, which is good for everyone.

It would protect kids from working too hard too young, which can hurt their health and cause them to get sick early. It would also make sure children up to age 13 get some education. Right now, many kids don’t get any education, which is sad and shows how badly the country is doing.

In 1867, the government said it had turned the Commission’s ideas into laws to improve working conditions. But it had taken 20 years of trying and failing to get this far. Back in 1840, another group had looked into child labor and found terrible cruelty and suffering. Nassau W. Senior said their report showed “the worst greed and cruelty” from bosses and parents and how children were suffering badly.

Sadly, these problems didn’t go away. A pamphlet from two years before said the same abuses from 1842 were still happening. It’s shocking that the report was ignored for 20 years, during which children grew up without morals, knowledge, or care, and became the parents of the next generation.

Since things had changed, Parliament couldn’t ignore the 1862 Commission like it had ignored the 1840 one. So in 1864, even before the whole report was out, some industries like pottery, paper-making, matches, and others had to follow the same rules as textile factories.
