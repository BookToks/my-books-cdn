In societies where capitalism is the main way of producing things, wealth shows up as a huge pile of commodities.  

A commodity is just one item that people can buy or sell.  

Each commodity has two important parts: use-value and value.  

Use-value means how useful the item is.  

Value means how much work or effort it took to make the item.
