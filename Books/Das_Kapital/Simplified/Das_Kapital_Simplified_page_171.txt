But,” he says kindly, “I can understand why people don’t like losing time.” The Commission’s report thinks in a simple way that some big companies’ fear of losing time, which means losing the chance to use other people’s work and make money, is not a good reason to let kids under 13 and young people under 18 work 12 to 16 hours a day without a proper dinner. They say giving them food just like coal for engines or oil for wheels, as if the food is just part of the work process, is wrong. No industry in England, except for bread making with new machines, still uses such old-fashioned ways as baking. But money owners don’t care about how work is done at first; they just take it as it is.

The terrible mixing of bad stuff into bread, especially in London, was first uncovered by the House of Commons Committee on food cheating in 1855-56 and by Dr. Hassall’s book “Adulterations detected.” Because of these findings, a law was made in 1860 to stop food and drink cheating, but it didn’t work well. This law was too kind to Free-traders who wanted to make easy money by selling bad goods. The Committee even awkwardly said Free-trade basically means selling fake or “sophisticated” goods. This kind of trickery is better at twisting truth than famous old philosophers. Anyway, the Committee made people pay attention to their “daily bread” and the baking trade. At the same time, London bakers spoke out against working too much. Their complaints were so strong that Mr. H. S. Tremenheere was made Royal Commissioner to investigate. His report and the evidence didn’t move people emotionally but grossed them out. English people, who know the Bible well, knew that unless you are rich, you must work hard for your bread. But they didn’t know their bread had sweat, pus, cobwebs, dead bugs, bad yeast, alum, sand, and other nasty stuff mixed in. Because of this, the free baking business was put under government inspection by the end of 1863, and the same law banned bakers under 18 from working from 9 at night to 5 in the morning. This rule shows how much bakers were overworked in this old-fashioned job.

“A London baker usually starts work around eleven at night. At that time, he ‘makes the dough’ – a hard job that takes about half an hour to forty-five minutes, depending on how much dough and effort is needed. Then he lies down to sleep on the kneading board, which covers the dough trough, using a sack as a mattress and another as a pillow, and sleeps for about two hours. After that, he works fast and nonstop for about five hours – handling the dough, cutting it, shaping it, putting it in the oven, baking rolls and fancy bread, taking the bread out, and bringing it to the shop.”
