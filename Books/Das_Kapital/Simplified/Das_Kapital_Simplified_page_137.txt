If we keep going and compare making something valuable with just the simple act of working, we see that working means doing useful tasks that create things we can use. Here, we think about work as making a specific item and focus only on what the work is for and what it produces.

But if we look at work as a way to create value, we only think about how much time the worker spends doing the job. It’s all about how long the worker uses their energy. The materials used don’t matter as much as the amount of work put into them. Whether the materials already had work put into them before or the worker adds new work, what counts is how long the work takes — like hours or days.

Also, only the time needed to make something under normal conditions counts. This means work has to be done in usual, standard ways. For example, if most people use a spinning machine to spin cotton, it doesn’t make sense to give a worker old-fashioned tools like a spinning wheel. The cotton must be good quality too, so the worker doesn’t waste extra time fixing problems. If the cotton or tools are bad, the worker takes longer than usual to make one product, but this extra time doesn’t create extra value or money. The quality of materials depends on the boss, not the worker.

The worker’s effort must also be average for that kind of job. The worker should have the normal skills and work at the usual speed. The boss makes sure the workers aren’t lazy or wasting time because the boss paid for their work for a certain amount of time and wants to get his money’s worth. The boss also has rules to stop workers from wasting materials because wasted stuff means wasted work — and that wasted work doesn’t add any value to the product.

So, the difference between work that just makes useful things and work that creates value comes down to two ways to look at making things.

Making things can be seen as the combination of doing work and creating value, which is making products to sell. Or it can be seen as the combination of doing work and making extra value for the boss, which is the way bosses run production to make a profit.

We said before that it doesn’t matter if the work the boss uses is simple or skilled. More skilled work costs more because it takes longer to learn, so it has a higher value than simple work.
