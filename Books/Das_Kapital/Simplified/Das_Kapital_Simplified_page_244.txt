Manufacturing creates a system where workers have different levels of skills, and they get paid differently because of that. Some workers do only one simple job for their whole life, while others do different tasks based on what they are naturally good at or have learned.

Every production process needs some easy tasks that anyone can do. But even these simple tasks get separated and given only to certain workers. This leads to a group of “unskilled” workers, who didn’t exist in older craft industries. Manufacturing makes some workers super specialized in one thing, but also makes some workers have no skills at all. So, workers get split into skilled and unskilled groups. For unskilled workers, they don’t need to spend time learning a trade anymore, and for skilled workers, it takes less time to learn because their jobs are simpler. This makes the value of their work lower.

The only time this changes is when breaking down the work creates new, more important jobs that didn’t exist before in crafts. When workers spend less time learning their jobs, it means companies can get more value out of them because workers can produce more in less time.

Now let’s talk about how work is divided in manufacturing compared to how work is split up in society. We first looked at how manufacturing started, its basic parts, the workers, and the tools they use. Now we will briefly look at how the division of labor in manufacturing relates to the division of labor in society, which is the base of all making and selling goods.

If we focus just on work, the big categories like farming and industries are called the general division of labor. Breaking these big groups into smaller types is the particular division of labor. And dividing tasks inside a workshop is the smallest, or detailed, division of labor.

Division of labor in society and in manufacturing start from different places. In families and tribes, work gets divided naturally based on things like age and gender. This is a natural division because of biology. As communities grow bigger and fight or take over other groups, this division of labor grows too.

At the same time, when different families or tribes meet, they start trading goods. Early on, it wasn’t individuals trading, but whole families or tribes. Different communities produce different things because of their environment, so they swap what they have. This trading leads to products becoming commodities, or things made to be sold.

Trade doesn’t create differences in what communities produce, but connects already different groups. This makes different areas of production depend on each other and helps build a bigger, shared economy.
