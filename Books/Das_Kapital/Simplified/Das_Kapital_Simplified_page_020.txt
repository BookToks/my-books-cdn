So, even though people knew that profits and rent are just parts of the unpaid work that workers do for their bosses, classical economists never really looked at this unpaid part as a whole. Because of that, they never fully understood where it comes from, what it really means, or how its value gets shared.

Also, all non-farming or non-handmade work is just called "manufacturing" without thinking about the big difference between two important times in economic history: the time when work was done by hand in workshops, and the modern time when machines do most of the work. It makes sense that a theory seeing modern capitalist production as just a temporary phase should use different words than those who think it’s the final, never-changing stage.

A quick note about how the author uses quotes. Most of the time, the quotes support the points made in the text. But sometimes, quotes show when and where certain ideas were first clearly explained by economists. These are important because they reflect the social and economic conditions of their time, whether or not Marx agreed with them. So, the quotes add a kind of running commentary from the history of economic thought.

Our translation only includes the first book, but this first book stands well on its own and has been seen as an independent work for twenty years. The second book, edited in German by me in 1885, isn’t complete without the third book, which won’t be published until the end of 1887. After Book III is out in German, then we can think about making an English version of both.

“Das Kapital” is often called the “Bible of the working class” in Europe. The ideas in this book are becoming the main beliefs of the working-class movement not just in Germany and Switzerland, but also in France, Holland, Belgium, America, and even Italy and Spain. Everywhere, workers see these ideas as a true reflection of their situation and hopes. In England, too, Marx’s theories already have a strong influence on the growing socialist movement, both among educated people and workers.

But there’s more. Soon, England will have to seriously look at its own economic situation. The country’s industrial system depends on constantly growing production and markets, but this growth is slowing down and might stop.

Free Trade has run out of new ideas; even Manchester, which once strongly supported it, now doubts it. Foreign industries are growing fast and competing with English products everywhere—not just in protected markets, but also in neutral ones and even nearby. While production power grows very fast, market growth is much slower. The usual cycles of slowdowns and booms from 1825 to 1867 seem to be over, but now we might be stuck in a long, ongoing economic slump.
