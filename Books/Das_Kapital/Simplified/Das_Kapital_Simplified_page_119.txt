The change doesn’t happen in the second part of selling, where the product is just sold again and turned back into money. The real change has to happen when the product is first bought, but not in its value, because equal value is exchanged and the product is paid for fully. So, the change happens in how the product is used, meaning when it is consumed.

To get value from using a product, the person with money has to find a special kind of product in the market. This product’s use itself creates value because it involves work. The money owner finds this special product in something called labor-power, which means a person’s ability to work.

Labor-power means all the mental and physical skills a person uses when they make something useful.

But for the money owner to buy labor-power as a product, some things must be true first. Just trading products doesn’t create other kinds of dependence. Labor-power can only be sold if the person who has it agrees to sell it. To do that, they must own their ability to work freely, meaning they own themselves.

The buyer and seller meet in the market and deal as equals under the law, but one buys and the other sells. The worker must sell their labor-power only for a certain time, not forever, because if they sold it forever, they’d become a slave, losing their freedom and becoming a product themselves. They keep ownership by renting out their labor-power for a limited time.

Another important condition is that the worker can’t sell products they made; instead, they must sell their labor-power, which is part of themselves.

To sell products other than labor-power, a person needs the tools, materials, and support to make them. For example, you can’t make shoes without leather. People also need food and other basics to live. Nobody can live on things that aren’t finished or that will come in the future. From the very start, people have always been consumers, both before and while they’re making things.

In a society where everything is bought and sold, products must be sold first before they can be used to meet the needs of the person who made them.
