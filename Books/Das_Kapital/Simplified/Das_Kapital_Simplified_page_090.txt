When money became a common way to pay for things, people had to save up money to pay what they owed on certain days. While saving money just to get rich stopped being a big thing as society got more advanced, keeping some money ready to pay bills became more important.

When money moves beyond local use, it loses its local features like prices, coins, or symbols, and goes back to being just valuable metal. In world trade, the value of things is shown in a way everyone understands. That’s why money in global markets is seen as universal. Here, money really shows its true nature as something created by human work.

At home, only one kind of money works as the standard measure of value. But in world markets, both gold and silver are used. World money helps pay for things everywhere, buy stuff, and show how much wealth exists. Its main job is to settle payments between countries. That’s why merchants cared a lot about having a balance of trade.

Gold and silver are mostly used internationally when trade between countries is suddenly upset. They also show wealth when it’s hard or impossible to send goods between countries. Just like countries keep money for buying things inside the country, they also need money for trading with other countries.

Because of this, people keep hoards of money both for local use and for international trade. For international trade, real gold and silver are necessary. That’s why Sir James Steuart called gold and silver the “money of the world,” to separate them from local types of money.

Gold and silver move in two ways. First, they spread from where they’re mined to markets everywhere. They get used in different countries, replace worn-out coins, make luxury items, or get saved in hoards. This happens because countries trade their goods made by labor for gold and silver from mining countries.

Second, gold and silver constantly flow back and forth between countries because exchange rates keep changing. Countries with advanced economies keep their money hoards in banks just enough to handle their special financial needs.
