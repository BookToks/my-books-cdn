The cure won’t be perfect until poor factory workers are okay with working six days to earn the same money they now make in four days. To fix this and to stop laziness, bad behavior, and waste, and to encourage hard work, “faithful Eckart” of capital suggests locking up workers who depend on public help, called paupers, in a special “ideal workhouse.” This workhouse must be a “House of Terror,” not a place where poor people get good food, warm clothes, and do little work.

In this “House of Terror,” the poor would work 14 hours a day, with time for meals, leaving 12 hours of real work. Imagine working 12 hours every day back in 1770! Sixty-three years later, in 1833, the English government limited the working day for kids aged 13 to 18 in some industries to 12 hours. This was a big moment for English industry!

In 1852, when Louis Bonaparte tried to change the working day laws, French workers shouted that the law limiting work to 12 hours was the only good law left from the Republic. In places like Zürich and Aargau, working hours for children were also reduced to 12 hours or less in the 1860s. What progress since 1770!

Macaulay would have been very happy!

The “House of Terror” for poor people that capitalists dreamed of in 1770 actually became a huge “Workhouse” for workers themselves, called the Factory. But the perfect idea disappeared when the real factory was made.

Section 6: The Fight for a Normal Working Day.

The Law Limits Working Time.

After capitalists spent centuries making the workday longer and longer, up to 12 hours, the rise of machines and modern industry in the late 1700s caused a huge increase in work demands. All limits were broken—age, gender, day and night didn’t matter anymore. Things got so mixed up that in 1860, a judge had to carefully figure out what counted as day and night. Capitalism was running wild.

When workers, shocked at first by the noise and chaos, started to understand what was happening, they began to fight back. This first happened in England, where machines were invented. But for 30 years, the wins workers made were only on paper. Between 1802 and 1833, Parliament passed five labor laws but didn’t spend any money to enforce them. So the laws were useless. Before the 1833 Factory Act, kids and young people worked all day and night without limits.

A normal working day for modern industry only started with the Factory Act of 1833, covering cotton, wool, flax, and silk factories. The story of these English Factory Acts from 1833 to 1864 shows how capitalists fought hard to keep control.
