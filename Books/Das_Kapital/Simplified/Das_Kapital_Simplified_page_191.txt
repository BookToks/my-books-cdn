When these cases came up, I really wished for a paid judge,” said one official. The crown lawyers thought the factory owners’ way of understanding the 1848 law was ridiculous. But the people trying to protect workers didn’t give up. Leonard Horner said, “We tried to enforce the law by charging people in ten different areas, but only one case was supported by the judges. So, I stopped trying to prosecute those who ignored the law. The part of the 1848 law that was supposed to make work hours the same everywhere isn’t working anymore in my area (Lancashire). Neither the inspectors nor I can check if young people and women are working more than 10 hours a day when the mills run in shifts.”

By April 30th, there were 114 mill owners using shifts, and that number was growing fast. 

Usually, the mills were open for 13½ hours, from 6 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. In some places, they worked even longer—up to 15 hours, from 5:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. By December 1848, Leonard Horner had a list of 65 factory owners and 29 supervisors who all agreed that no system could stop huge overwork under these shift plans. Now, the same kids and young workers moved from the spinning room to the weaving room, working up to 15 hours, moving between factories.  

It was impossible to control a system that, “under the cover of shifts, just shuffled workers around all day, changing their work and rest hours so no full group worked together at the same time.” This shift system was a crazy idea from greedy factory owners, like something from a funny story by Fourier, but instead of attracting workers, it was all about making money.

Look at the plans the factory owners made, which the “respectable” newspapers called examples of “care and good planning.” The workers were split into 12 to 14 groups that kept changing. During the 15-hour factory day, the owners pulled workers in for 30 minutes or an hour, then sent them out, then back in again, moving them around in small bits of time, but making sure they worked the full 10 hours. Like actors on stage changing scenes, the same workers had to appear in different parts of the factory at different times. But unlike actors who belong to the stage, these workers belonged to the factory for 15 hours, not counting the time it took to get there and back.

Because of this, breaks weren’t really breaks—they were forced boredom, which made the young men go to the bar and the girls to bad places. Every new trick the factory owners used to keep machines running 12 or 15 hours without hiring more workers meant the workers had to eat their meals at odd times. 

When workers fought for a 10-hour day, the owners said they wanted to get paid for 12 hours while working 10. Now the owners flipped that around—they paid workers for 10 hours but made them work 12 or 15 hours. This was the real meaning of the 10-hour law for the owners! 

These were the same so-called caring Free-traders who, for 10 years during the fight against the Corn Laws, told workers that with free grain imports and English industry, 10 hours of work was enough to make factory owners rich.
