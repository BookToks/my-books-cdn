Sometimes, the amount of time needed for a job is already set, like in herring fishing. One person can only work about 12 hours a day, but if 100 people work together, they can get 1,200 hours of work done in one day.

Because there isn’t much time, having lots of workers all working at the same time makes up for it. Finishing the job on time depends on many people working together at once. The result depends on how many workers there are. Still, fewer workers working together can do the same job faster than many workers working alone.

When people don’t work together, like in some parts of the western US or East India, crops like corn and cotton get wasted every year. Working together helps get jobs done over a bigger area. That’s why it’s needed for big projects like draining land, building dykes, irrigation, canals, roads, and railways.

At the same time, working together can make the work area smaller compared to the size of the job, which saves money. This happens because workers gather in one place, different tasks are combined, and tools and machines are shared.

When workers team up, they produce more in less time compared to the same number of workers working alone. This happens for many reasons: they can use machines better, work over larger spaces, save resources by sharing, encourage each other, work continuously, do different tasks at the same time, and more.

No matter the reason, working together makes labor more productive. This power comes from cooperation itself. When workers work together, they overcome their limits as individuals and bring out their full potential as humans.

Usually, workers need to be in the same place to work together. So, they can only cooperate if they are hired at the same time by the same boss. The boss has to pay all of them at once, like paying 300 workers for one day, which costs more than paying a few workers over a whole year.

Because of this, how many workers can cooperate depends on how much money the boss has to pay them. In other words, it depends on how much control the boss has over the workers’ living needs.

The same goes for materials. For example, a boss who hires 300 workers has to spend 30 times more on raw materials than bosses who each hire 10 workers.
