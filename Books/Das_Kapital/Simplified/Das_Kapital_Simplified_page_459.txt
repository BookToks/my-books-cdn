New houses were being built very slowly, but businesses were growing very fast. So, in 1865, the town was more crowded than ever. Almost no rooms were available to rent. Dr. Embleton, from Newcastle Fever Hospital, said that typhus kept spreading mainly because too many people lived cramped together in dirty homes. These rooms, where workers often lived, were in small, unhealthy yards or courts. They had very little space, light, air, or cleanliness, which was shameful for a civilized town. Men, women, and children slept crowded together at night. The night workers would take over from the day workers without giving the beds time to cool down. The whole house had poor water supply and even worse toilets. Everything was dirty, stuffy, and full of disease. The rent for these places was between 8 pence and 3 shillings a week.

Dr. Hunter said Newcastle had some of the best people in the country, but bad housing and streets made their lives almost savage. Because money and jobs went up and down, the state of homes in industrial towns could be okay one day and terrible the next. Sometimes, the town officials would try to fix the worst problems. But then, lots of poor Irish or English farm workers would arrive, packed into cellars and attics. Even homes that were once decent for workers turned into crowded lodging houses where people came and went like soldiers in a long war. Take Bradford in Yorkshire as an example. The town was trying to improve, and in 1861, there were still 1,751 empty houses. But then trade picked up again, which Mr. Forster, a politician who supported free trade and helped Black people, talked about happily. When trade grew, many poor workers came looking for jobs. Most of the terrible cellar homes Dr. Hunter found were lived in by workers who earned decent wages.

These workers said they would pay for better homes if any were available.

Still, they got sicker and poorer. Meanwhile, Mr. Forster, the politician, happily praised free trade and the profits of rich Bradford businessmen who dealt with wool.

In a report from September 1865, Dr. Bell, a doctor for the poor in Bradford, said many fever patients died because their homes were so bad.

He described one small cellar of just 1,500 cubic feet where ten people lived.

In streets like Vincent Street, Green Aire Place, and the Leys, there were 223 houses with 1,450 people, 435 beds, and only 36 toilets. On average, about 3.3 people shared each bed, with some beds holding 5 or 6 people. Some had no beds at all and slept in their clothes on bare wooden floors—young men and women, married and single, all mixed together. Many of these homes were dark, damp, dirty, and smelly—totally unfit for people to live in. These places spread disease and death even to people living nearby who were better off but let the problem continue. Bristol was the third worst city for bad homes after London.
