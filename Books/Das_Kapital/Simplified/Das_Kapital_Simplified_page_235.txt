This means that when people work together, passing a brick through a certain space, they can get the brick to the right place much faster than if each person carried their own brick alone to the upper floor.

If a job is complicated, many tasks need to be done at the same time. One person does one thing while another does something else, and together they achieve results that one person alone couldn’t. For example, one person rows, another steers, and a third throws the net or uses a harpoon to catch fish. This teamwork makes fishing much more successful than working alone.

In farming, doing work at the right time is very important. Timing is one of the most important parts of agriculture.

Another problem is that in some places, like where a lot of cotton is grown, there aren’t enough workers to pick all the cotton. Because of this, a lot of cotton is left unpicked or falls to the ground and gets dirty or rotten. This means farmers lose a lot of their crop, which is bad for places like England that need the cotton.

As farming develops, all the money and work that used to cover 500 acres is now focused on better farming of just 100 acres. This means the work and money are more concentrated in a smaller area, but the total amount of farming is bigger than before when one person worked alone.

Even though each person’s strength is small, when many people combine their efforts, they create a force stronger than just adding up their individual strengths. Working together saves time and covers more ground.

Making profits is the main goal of business.

According to the newspaper, the Spectator, when workers and owners formed a partnership at the Wirework Company in Manchester, waste went down quickly. The workers didn’t want to waste their own property any more than the owner’s, and waste is one of the biggest causes of loss in manufacturing. But the paper also said that in the Rochdale co-operative experiments, workers could run shops and factories well and improved their own conditions, but they didn’t make room for bosses, which was a problem.

Professor Cairnes explained that in the Southern States of North America, slaves had to be watched closely while working, but farmers who owned their own land in the North worked hard because they kept everything they produced.
