The wealth of a country isn’t just about money, and gold and silver shouldn’t be left out as things people trade. Gold and silver have value as metals even before they become money.

Locke said that people agreed to give silver a made-up value because it’s good for use as money. But Law questioned how different countries could all agree on this made-up value or how it could last. He also said silver was traded based on its real usefulness, and that when it became money, it got an extra value.

Money is like a symbol for things we want to buy. It’s attracted to goods and represents them. But money isn’t just a symbol—it is wealth itself. It doesn’t just stand for value; it is equal to that value.

The idea that money is just a symbol and that precious metals have only imaginary value started with lawyers long before economists. They supported kings and queens who wanted to lower the value of coins throughout the Middle Ages. According to Roman Law, only the emperor could decide what money was worth. It was even forbidden to treat money as something you could buy and sell like a product.

One scholar said no one should question that the king has the power to decide the value of money and how it should be used. The law said money was made for public use and shouldn’t be treated like a regular product.

Some people have studied this idea carefully and argued especially against the lawyers who pushed these views.

William Petty explained that if it takes the same time to get an ounce of silver or a bushel of corn, they naturally have the same price. But if new mines make silver easier to get, the price of corn will go down, too, assuming everything else stays the same.

Professor Roscher said wrong ideas about money fall into two groups: those that say money is more than a commodity and those that say it is less. He showed he didn’t really understand the history of money theories. He also pointed out that many economists don’t think enough about what makes money different from other products—so, money is either more or less than a commodity after all!
