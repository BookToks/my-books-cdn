Most children in Egypt don’t wear shoes or many clothes because the weather is warm. Because of this, it doesn’t cost parents much to raise a child—about twenty drachmas in total. This is a big reason why Egypt has so many people and can build such huge projects.

But the huge buildings in ancient Egypt aren’t just because there were lots of people. They happened because many people were free to work on things beyond just getting food and basic needs. If people spend less time working to survive, they can spend more time doing extra work.

In capitalist production, the amount of extra work people can do depends on how easy their work is, especially how good the soil is for farming. But just because the soil is really good doesn’t mean capitalism grows best there.

Capitalism is all about humans controlling nature. If nature gives too much easily, people don’t have to work hard or improve themselves. Capitalism actually grew best in places with changing seasons and different kinds of soil. These changes push people to work more, want more, and develop new skills.

A big part of industry’s history is about controlling natural forces, like building irrigation systems in Egypt, Italy, Holland, India, and Persia. These canals not only water the land but also bring nutrients from the hills. The success of industry in places like Spain and Sicily under Arab rule was mostly because of irrigation. Good natural conditions only make it possible to have extra work and products, but don’t guarantee it.

Different natural conditions mean that the same amount of work can meet different needs in different countries. This changes how much work is needed just to survive, and only after that can people work extra for others. As industry grows, these natural limits become less important. In Western Europe, workers often have to do extra work just to earn the right to work for themselves, so people think making extra products is natural for all labor.

But think about someone living in the eastern islands of Asia where sago trees grow wild. When the sago is ready, people cut down the tree, take out the pith, mix it with water, and filter it to make food. One tree can give 300 to 600 pounds of sago. So, people there just go into the forest and “cut” their bread like we cut firewood.

If this person only needs 12 hours of work a week to meet all their needs, nature gives them a lot of free time. But to use this free time to work more and produce extra for others, many historical changes and pressures are needed first.
