So, here’s the magic of money. In the kind of society we’re talking about, people work alone when making things. This means their connections with each other in making stuff are based on real, physical things, not on what they think or plan. Usually, the things they make show up as products called commodities. Over time, one special kind of commodity becomes money. So, the mystery of money is really just the mystery of commodities, but it’s easier to see with money.

Back in the 12th century, known for being very religious, some unusual things were sold as commodities. For example, a French poet listed things in a market like clothes, shoes, farming tools, and even “women crazy about their bodies.” Proudhon started by thinking of justice as something linked to how commodities are made and traded. He believed that making commodities is as eternal as justice. Then he wanted to change how commodities are made and the laws around them to match his idea of perfect justice. But imagine a chemist who tries to control how matter changes based only on perfect ideas like “eternal justice” instead of studying real science. Saying usury (charging too much interest) is wrong because it breaks “eternal justice” doesn’t really help us understand it any more than old church leaders who said it went against “eternal grace” or “God’s will.”

Every object has two uses. One use belongs to the object itself, and the other doesn’t. For example, a sandal can be worn, but it can also be traded for something else. Both are uses of the sandal because even when you trade it, you’re still using it as a sandal, just not in the usual way. It wasn’t made to be traded. This helps us see how silly some small business socialists are when they want to keep making commodities but get rid of the conflict between money and commodities—and then get rid of money too. This is like trying to keep Catholicism without the Pope. For more on this, check my other work.

When people trade lots of different things for just one thing, like in very early societies, this swapping is still very basic and messy.

Karl Marx said metals are naturally money. For more details, see my other book’s chapter on “The precious metals.” Some people say, “Money is the universal commodity.”

Silver and gold, also called bullion, are just like any other product like wine or cloth. Their value goes up and down depending on how much stuff you can buy with a small amount of them. So, even though money is used to measure the value of other things, it’s still just a commodity itself.
