The value of something, like any product, depends on how much work time it takes to make it. If a worker needs 6 hours a day to produce the things they need to live, then they have to work 6 hours every day just to cover the value of their work. This 6 hours is the necessary part of their workday and stays the same. But the total length of the workday can still change.

Let’s say the line A–––B shows the necessary work time, which is 6 hours. If the worker works 1, 3, or 6 more hours after A––B, we get three different workdays: Working day I, II, and III.

A–––B–C. A–––B––C. A–––B–––C.

These represent workdays of 7, 9, and 12 hours. The extra time B––C is called surplus work. So, the whole workday is A––B plus B––C, or A––C, and it changes depending on how long B––C is. Since A––B is fixed, we can compare B––C to A––B. In working day I, B––C is 1/6 of A––B; in day II, it’s 3/6; and in day III, it’s 6/6.

This ratio of extra work time to necessary work time shows how much extra value the worker creates. For the three workdays, this is about 16 2/3%, 50%, and 100%. But knowing this ratio alone doesn’t tell us exactly how long the workday is. For example, if the extra work is equal to the necessary work (100%), the total workday could be 8, 10, 12 hours, or more. It just means the two parts are equal, but not how long each part is.

So, the workday isn’t always the same length. One part is fixed because it’s the time needed for the worker to cover their own living costs. But the total workday changes depending on how much extra work they do. The workday can be figured out, but it doesn’t have a set length.

Even though the workday can change, it can only be so short or so long. The shortest limit happens if the extra work time is zero, meaning the worker only works enough to support themselves. But in a capitalist system, the worker always works more than that minimum. On the other hand, the workday can’t be too long either.

There are two main reasons for this maximum limit. First, there are physical limits: a person can only use so much energy in a day. Like a horse that can only work about 8 hours a day, people need time to rest, sleep, eat, and take care of themselves. Second, there are social and moral limits: workers also need time for their minds and social lives, which depends on how society is developed.

So, the workday changes but stays between physical and social limits. These limits are flexible and can vary a lot.
