Descartes, like Bacon, expected that new ways of thinking would change how we make things and help humans control nature better. In his book “Discours de la Méthode,” he said that it’s possible to gain useful knowledge for life. Instead of just studying philosophy for ideas, we can use it practically. If we understand the power and effects of fire, water, air, stars, and other things around us as well as we know different trades, we can use them in many ways. This way, we can become masters of nature and improve human life.

In the introduction to Sir Dudley North’s “Discourses upon Trade” (1691), it’s said that Descartes’ method started to free economics from old myths about gold and trade. Early English economists mostly followed Bacon and Hobbes, but later on, Locke became an important thinker in economics in England, France, and Italy.

In 1862, the Krupp steel factory in Essen had 161 furnaces and produced a huge amount of cast steel. They had thirty-two steam engines and fourteen steam hammers, which together had 1,236 horsepower. This was about the same number of steam engines as all of Manchester had in 1800. The factory also had 49 forges, 203 tool machines, and about 2,400 workers. This means there were fewer than two workers for each horsepower.

Babbage said that in Java, the work done by spinners adds 117% value to cotton. In 1832, the total value added to cotton by machines and workers was about 33%. Machine printing also saves on the use of colors.

Dr. Watson shared a report in 1860 about products in India.

Ricardo said machines require much less work to make than the work they replace, even if they cost the same money. This means that in a society where everything is shared equally, machines would be used differently than in a society where people own things privately.

Employers don’t want to keep two groups of children under thirteen working if they don’t have to. For example, wool yarn spinners now rarely hire children under thirteen. They use better machines that replace the need for child workers. One machine, called a piecing machine, lets one young person over thirteen do the work that used to take six or four younger children.
