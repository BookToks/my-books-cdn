After the English government stopped the constant fighting among the clan leaders and their raids into the Lowland plains, the clan chiefs didn’t stop their old habit of stealing; they just changed how they did it. They turned their supposed right to land into private ownership. This caused fights with their own clansmen, so the chiefs decided to force them out by violence. As Professor Newman said, “A king of England might as well try to push his people into the sea.” 

This change started in Scotland after the last rebellion of the Pretender’s followers. We can see its early stages in the writings of Sir James Steuart and James Anderson. In the 18th century, the Gaels who were chased out were not even allowed to leave the country. The goal was to push them into cities like Glasgow to work in factories.

An example from the 19th century is what the Duchess of Sutherland did. She was smart about money and wanted to fix things quickly. The population had already been reduced to 15,000 people, about 3,000 families, by earlier removals. Between 1814 and 1820, these people were forced out. Their villages were destroyed and burned, and their fields turned into land for sheep. British soldiers made sure the people left, even fighting with them. One old woman died in a fire because she refused to leave her hut.

The Duchess took over 794,000 acres of land that had belonged to the clan for a very long time. She gave the displaced people only about 6,000 acres along the coast – just 2 acres per family. This land had been unused and didn’t earn any money. In a show of kindness, she even rented this land to the clansmen at 2 shillings and 6 pence per acre, even though these people had fought for her family for centuries.

She split the stolen clan land into 29 big sheep farms. Each farm was run by one family, mostly English workers brought in from outside. By 1835, the 15,000 Gaels were replaced by 131,000 sheep. The few people left on the coast tried to survive by fishing. They lived half on land and half on water, but barely made it.

But the Gaels’ troubles didn’t end there. The rich landowners saw the fish the Gaels caught and wanted to make money from it. They rented the coastal land to big fishmongers from London, and the Gaels were forced out again.

Later, some of the sheep farms were turned into deer parks. England has no real forests, and the deer in its parks are tame and fat, like city officials. So Scotland became the last place for real wild forests and deer hunting. In 1848, Somers wrote that new forests were growing quickly in the Highlands, from Glenfeshie to Ardverikie and many other places. Sheep had been put into valleys where small farmers used to live, pushing those farmers to worse land.

Now, deer are replacing sheep, and sheep were already pushing small farmers off their land. These farmers are forced to live on poorer soil and grow poorer. Deer parks and people can’t live together; one has to go. If the number of forests keeps growing, the Gaels will disappear from their homeland.

For some of the Highland landowners, this movement is about ambition and power.
