The price of labor can change for different reasons, not just because of how much extra value workers create. Also, the amount of basic things people need to live, which affects the price of labor, can change on its own. When we talk about wages, we are really just talking about the price of labor.

Wage changes in one country can look like different wage levels when we compare countries. To compare wages between nations, we have to think about many things. These include how much basic stuff costs, how much it costs to train workers, how much work women and kids do, and how productive the work is. We also need to compare the same kind of work by the same amount of time, then change time wages into pay per piece of work, because that shows how hard and productive the work really is.

Every country has an average work intensity. If work is done with less effort than this average, it takes longer than normal and isn't considered good quality work. Only work done harder than the average affects the value by how long it takes. But this changes worldwide because work intensity is different in each country. Some countries work harder, some less. These averages form a scale where the hardest work counts as more value and earns more money.

On the world market, countries that work more productively also count as working harder, as long as they don’t have to lower their prices because of competition. When capitalism grows in a country, work there gets harder and more productive than in other countries. So, things made in different countries in the same time have different international values and prices. Money is worth less in a country with more advanced capitalism than in one with less.

This means wages paid in money will be higher in the more advanced country, but this doesn’t always mean workers there get more real things to live on. Even when wages in money are higher in one country, the real cost and value of work and life can be very different.
