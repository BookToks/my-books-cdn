Here’s what this all means in simpler words:

Even though the worker gets paid by the boss, the boss doesn’t really lose money. This is because the work the worker does actually makes the product worth more, which covers the wages and even brings profit.

Productive work is special because when something is used up in making more things, it becomes capital. Capital is basically money or stuff used to make more money or products.

At first, new factories hire a lot of poor people, but those people stay poor. The more factories grow, the more poor people there are. Some farmers say they "keep the poor," but really, the poor just stay miserable.

Some people don’t fully understand how using stuff to make more stuff works. For example, miners in South America do super hard work carrying heavy metal from deep underground. They mostly eat bread and beans. Their bosses make them eat beans because beans have minerals that help them work harder, even though the workers would rather just eat bread.

If the cost of paying workers goes too high, even if there is more money to invest, it might not help create more jobs or products.

Only when money or resources are used to make more things is that called productive use. The worker helps the boss and the country by working, but the worker doesn’t directly benefit in the same way.

The most valuable thing a worker has is their skill, and most workers don’t need money saved up to learn their skills.

Some letters from factory owners sounded like they were announcing their plans and views.

Usually, factory owners say that workers don’t have special skills and are easy to replace. They say machines are more important than workers. But workers actually take time and training to become skilled, and they can’t be replaced quickly.

The government didn’t spend money to help workers move away. Instead, they passed laws that kept workers in tough, almost starving conditions.
