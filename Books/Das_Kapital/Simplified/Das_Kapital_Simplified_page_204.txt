... but recent investigations have found that even in places once known for strong, brave men and soldiers, the people have become weak and small. In the healthiest areas, like hills by the sea, the faces of hungry children look as pale as those living in dirty London alleys.” (W. Th. Thornton, “Overpopulation and its Remedy,” pp. 74, 75.) They actually look like the 30,000 “brave Highlanders” who live packed together in Glasgow’s narrow streets with prostitutes and thieves.

But even though the health of workers is very important for the country, employers have not been very eager to take care of it. The mill-owners only started paying attention to workers’ health because they were forced to. (Times, November 5th, 1861.) The people of West Riding became world-famous cloth makers, but their workers’ health was ignored, and the population became weaker after a few generations. Then things started to change. Lord Shaftesbury’s Bill limited the hours children could work, and so on. (“Report of the Registrar-General,” October 1861.)

For example, in early 1863, 26 big pottery companies in Staffordshire, including Josiah Wedgwood & Sons, asked for laws to help. They said competition made it impossible for them to limit children’s working hours by themselves. “We really wish things were better, but only a law can fix this,” they said. (“Children’s Employment Commission” Report, 1863, p. 322.) 

A more recent example happened in Blackburn. When cotton prices went up during a busy time, mill owners agreed to shorten work hours for a while. This ended around November 1871. But richer owners, who did both spinning and weaving, used the lower production to grow their businesses and make big profits, hurting smaller owners. The smaller owners then asked workers to fight for a 9-hour workday and promised to help pay for this.

Laws about working hours, like those made at the same time in France and the Netherlands, were officially canceled in England in 1813, long after new ways of working made them useless.

In Massachusetts, laws set limits like: “No child under 12 can work more than 10 hours a day in factories.” These laws were made between 1836 and 1858. New Jersey also said no child could work more than 10 hours a day or 60 hours a week in factories, and no child under 10 could work at all (Law of March 18, 1851). Rhode Island said kids aged 12 to 15 couldn’t work more than 11 hours a day or before 5 a.m. or after 7:30 p.m. (Revised Statutes of Rhode Island, July 1, 1857).

“Sophisms of Free Trade” (7th Edition, London, 1850) explains that laws about wages, which helped employers but hurt workers, lasted for 464 years. Population grew, and these laws became unnecessary and a burden. (p. 206.)

About one law, J. Wade said: “Back in 1496, food cost about one-third of a craftsman’s income and half of a laborer’s income, which shows workers had more freedom than now, because today food costs a much bigger part of their wages.”
