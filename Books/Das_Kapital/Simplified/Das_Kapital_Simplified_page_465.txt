The father and oldest son allow themselves to use tobacco, and on Sundays they go to the cabaret, which costs them 86 centimes a week.

From looking at average wages for workers in different jobs, men earn about 1 franc 56 centimes a day, women 89 centimes, boys 56 centimes, and girls 55 centimes. If the family earns this much, their total income would be about 1,068 francs a year.

But if the mother also works, who takes care of the house? Who looks after the young kids, cooks the meals, and does the laundry and repairs? This is a big problem for working families.

Here is the family’s yearly budget: The father works 300 days at 1.56 francs, earning 468 francs. The mother works 300 days at 0.89 francs, earning 267 francs. The boy works 300 days at 0.56 francs, earning 168 francs. The girl works 300 days at 0.55 francs, earning 165 francs. Together, they make 1,068 francs a year.

But the family’s yearly expenses are more than this. If they lived like a sailor, it would cost 1,828 francs, leaving a 760 franc shortfall. If they lived like a soldier, it would cost 1,473 francs, leaving a 405 franc shortfall. Even living like a prisoner, it would cost 1,112 francs, leaving a 44 franc shortfall.

Most working families can’t afford even the cheapest lifestyle, like a prisoner’s. Prisons save money because prisoners don’t pay for housing, and they buy food in bulk, which lowers costs.

So how do most workers survive? They find ways to save money that only they know about. They eat less food, switch from wheat bread to rye bread, eat little or no meat or butter, live crowded in one or two small rooms, with boys and girls sleeping close together on the same pallet. They save on clothes, washing, and personal care. They give up fun activities on Sundays, and accept many hard sacrifices.
