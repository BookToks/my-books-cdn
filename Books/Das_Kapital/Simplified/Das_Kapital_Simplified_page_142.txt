When a worker puts effort into something, they add extra value to it, no matter what kind of work they do. At the same time, the value of the tools and materials they use doesn’t disappear. Instead, these values show up again in the final product. For example, the value of cotton and the spindle used to make yarn is included in the value of the yarn itself. This happens because the value of the tools and materials is passed on to the product during the work process.

But how does this happen?

The worker isn’t doing two separate jobs—one to add value and another to keep the value of the tools and materials. Instead, by adding new value, they also keep the old value. Since adding new value and preserving old value are two different results happening at the same time, it means the worker’s labor has two parts. At the same time, their work creates value and transfers value.

So, how does a worker add new value?

They add value by doing their specific job, like spinning, weaving, or forging. The way they work turns the materials and tools into part of the new product, giving it a new use. Even though the old items change form, their value stays in the new product. The value that was in the materials comes from the work that made those materials in the first place, and this value is passed on to the new product. The worker keeps this value not just by working hard, but because of the specific kind of work they do. This special work brings the materials to life and mixes with them to create the new product.

If the worker wasn’t spinning, they couldn’t turn cotton into yarn, and so couldn’t pass on the value of the cotton and spindle to the yarn.

Imagine the same worker changes jobs and becomes a joiner. They would still add value to the materials they work with during the day. This shows two things: first, new value is added because the worker is working in general, not because they’re doing a specific job like spinning or joinering. Second, the amount of value added depends on how long they work, not on any special usefulness of their work.
