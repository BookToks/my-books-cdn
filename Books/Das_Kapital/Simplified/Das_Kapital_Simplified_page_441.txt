As capital grows, the mix between constant capital (like machines) and variable capital (like workers) changes. If it started as equal parts, it shifts so that machines make up more and more compared to workers. This means less of the total capital goes to paying workers and more to buying machines and materials.

Because the need for workers depends only on the part of capital used for labor, the demand for workers doesn’t keep growing with total capital. Instead, it grows slower and slower compared to the whole capital. Even though total capital and the number of workers both grow, workers increase at a slower rate.

The time when production just grows without changing much gets shorter. To keep hiring more workers or even keep current workers busy, capital needs to grow faster and faster. This faster growth causes the part of capital spent on workers to shrink compared to the part spent on machines.

While total capital grows quickly, the number of workers grows even faster, but capital only uses some of these workers. This creates a surplus of workers who are more than what capital actually needs. So, capitalism naturally creates a bigger population of workers than it can use.

Looking at society’s total capital, its growth causes changes that affect different industries in different ways. Some industries change how their capital is divided without growing bigger. Others grow but use fewer workers. Some keep growing and hire more workers for a while, then change and use fewer workers later.

In all industries, when the number of workers grows, it often causes big ups and downs in how many workers are needed. Sometimes workers lose jobs, other times it’s harder to find jobs for new workers. As capital grows and production expands, more workers are both hired and pushed out.

The speed of change in how capital is made and used increases, and more industries go through these changes at once or one after another. Workers, by helping capital grow, also create the conditions that make many of them unnecessary, turning them into a surplus population.

This is a rule unique to capitalism. Every way of producing things in history has its own rules about population, which apply until humans change them.
