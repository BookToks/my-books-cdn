This is exactly why the thing he makes is only useful to him because he can trade it for something else. But it can only become something everyone agrees has value by turning into money. That money, though, is in someone else’s pocket. To get that money, his product has to be useful to the person who has the money.

For this to happen, the work he puts into it must be the kind of work that people need, and it has to be part of a bigger system where different people do different jobs. This system of different jobs grew naturally without people planning it. 

Sometimes, the product might come from a new kind of work that tries to meet new needs or even create new needs. A small task that used to be part of making something bigger might become its own separate job and be sold as its own product. Sometimes this works well, sometimes it doesn’t. Today, the product might meet a need, but tomorrow it could be replaced by something better.

Even if our weaver’s work is part of this system, that doesn’t guarantee that his 20 yards of linen will be useful. If everyone already has enough linen made by other weavers, his product is extra and not needed. People don’t usually buy things just to give them away. 

But if his product is useful and attracts money, the question is, how much money? The answer is shown by the price of the item, which reflects its value. We assume he spent the normal amount of time needed to make it. So, the price is just the money form of the social labor put into it. 

However, without our weaver’s control, the old way of weaving changes. The time it took before to make a yard of linen might not be needed anymore. The person with the money can prove this by showing prices from other weavers. There are many weavers competing.

Finally, even if every piece of linen has only the normal amount of labor in it, the total amount of labor spent on all the linen might be too much. If the market can’t buy all the linen at the normal price, it means too many people are working as weavers. This is like each weaver spending more time than needed on their own product. 

In this way, all the linen in the market is seen as one product, and each piece is just a part of it. The value of each yard comes from the same amount of human labor that society agrees on.

So, we see that products want money, but “true love never runs smoothly.” The way work is divided up happens naturally, just like the different kinds of work. The people who make things realize that even though they work alone, they rely on each other through what they produce. Their independence is connected by a system that depends on everyone’s products.
