If two different things, like gold and silver, are both used to measure value, then everything has two prices – one in gold and one in silver. These two prices can exist side by side as long as the value of silver compared to gold stays the same, like 15 silver equals 1 gold. But if this ratio changes, it messes up the prices in gold and silver and shows that having two standards for value doesn’t really work well.

When things have clear prices, you can say a certain amount of commodity A equals some amount of gold, commodity B equals some other amount of gold, and so on. This means we imagine the value of things as amounts of gold.

Even though there are many different things, their values become like gold amounts, which makes it easy to compare them. Because of this, people felt the need to compare everything to a fixed amount of gold as a unit. This unit could be divided into smaller parts, making a standard or scale. Before things became money, metals like gold, silver, and copper already had standard weights. For example, a pound could be divided into ounces or combined into bigger weights. This is why money names often come from weight names.

Money has two separate jobs. First, it measures value because it represents human work. Second, it is a fixed weight of metal that sets prices. As a value measure, money turns the value of things into prices, which are like imaginary amounts of gold. As a price standard, money measures real amounts of gold. The value measure compares things as values, while the price standard measures actual gold by fixed units.

To make gold a price standard, you have to pick a certain weight as the unit. It’s very important that this unit doesn’t change. The more stable the unit, the better it works as a price standard. But gold only works as a value measure because it is made by human work and can change in value.

First, if gold’s value changes, it doesn’t affect its job as a price standard. No matter how gold’s value goes up or down, the ratio between different amounts of gold stays the same. For example, 12 ounces of gold always equal 12 times as much as 1 ounce, so prices still make sense. Also, the weight of gold doesn’t change, so the smaller parts of gold keep the same weight. This means gold is always a steady price standard, even if its value changes.

Second, if gold’s value changes, it doesn’t mess up its job as a value measure either. The change affects all things at the same time, so their values compared to each other stay the same, even if their prices in gold go up or down.
