An increase in wages only means that workers have to do less unpaid work. But this decrease can never be so big that it breaks the whole system. Sometimes there are big fights about wages, and Adam Smith already showed that in these fights, bosses usually win. If wages go up because of more capital, two things can happen: either wages keep rising without stopping the growth of capital, or the growth slows down because higher wages make profits less exciting.

If wages keep rising without stopping growth, that’s normal. Adam Smith said that even when profits get smaller, the total capital can still grow faster than before. So, less unpaid work doesn’t stop capital from growing. But if higher wages slow down growth, then the problem that caused the slowdown—too much capital compared to workers—goes away. The system fixes itself because wages fall back to a level that matches what capital needs.

In the first case, capital grows faster than the number of workers, so there aren’t enough workers for all the capital. In the second case, capital grows slower, so there’s too much labor or its price is too high. These changes in capital affect the amount and cost of labor, making it seem like labor controls the changes, but really capital does. So, the speed of capital growth controls wages, not the other way around.

During economic crises, prices of things fall, which means money is worth more, and during good times, prices rise, so money is worth less. Some people mistakenly think this means there is too much or too little money in the system. Others wrongly say there are too many or too few workers. Both ideas are wrong.

The real rule of capitalist production, which some call the “natural law of population,” is simple: the connection between how much capital grows and wages is really about how much unpaid work turns into capital and how much paid work is needed to keep that going. It’s not about capital and workers as separate things, but about unpaid and paid work done by the same workers.

If the unpaid work grows fast and needs a lot of extra paid work to use it, wages go up and unpaid work goes down. But if unpaid work drops too much, less money goes into capital, growth slows, and wage increases stop.
