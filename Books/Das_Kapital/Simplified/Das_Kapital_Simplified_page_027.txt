We need to start by looking closely at what a commodity is.  

A commodity is basically something outside of us, a thing that has qualities that satisfy human needs or wants. It doesn’t matter if these wants come from hunger or just liking something. We’re also not worried about how the thing meets these wants—whether it’s for eating or for making other things.  

Every useful thing, like iron or paper, can be looked at in two ways: its quality and its quantity. It has many qualities, so it can be useful in different ways.  

Finding out all the ways things can be used is a job for history. History also helps set standard ways to measure these useful things. The different ways we measure come from both the different kinds of things and from agreements people have made.  

The usefulness of something makes it what we call a use value. But this usefulness isn’t just imaginary. It depends on the actual physical properties of the thing. So, a commodity like iron, corn, or a diamond is useful because of what it is. This usefulness doesn’t depend on how much work went into getting it. When we talk about use value, we always think about specific amounts, like dozens of watches or tons of iron. Use values are important for understanding how goods work in business. Use values only matter when we use or consume the things, and they are the real basis of all wealth, no matter the society. In the kind of society we’re discussing, use values also hold the exchange value.  

Exchange value seems at first like a number that shows how much of one thing you can trade for another. This number changes depending on time and place. Because of this, exchange value looks like something random and only based on comparison. So it seems strange to say exchange value is a real, built-in part of commodities. But let’s think about it more carefully.  

For example, a quarter of wheat might be traded for some blacking (a polish), some silk, or some gold—different things in very different amounts. So wheat has many exchange values. But since each of these things (blacking, silk, gold) represents the same exchange value as the wheat, they must be equal to each other in value. So first, exchange values of a commodity show something equal; second, exchange value is just the way we show something that’s inside the commodity but also different from it.
