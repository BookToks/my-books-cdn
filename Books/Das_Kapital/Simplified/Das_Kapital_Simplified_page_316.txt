The factory inspectors found out by asking the school teachers that kids working in factories got only half the school time compared to regular students but still learned just as much, sometimes even more.

This is because they only spent half the day at school, so they were always fresh and ready to learn. Their day was split between manual work and school, which made each part feel like a break from the other. This made both work and school easier and more enjoyable for them. For example, a kid who spent the whole morning in school could not compete with one who came fresh from work, especially in hot weather.

More information on this can be found in Senior’s speech at the Social Science Congress in Edinburgh in 1863. He explained how long, boring school hours for rich kids just wasted the teachers’ and children’s time, health, and energy. Robert Owen showed that the factory system started a new kind of education where kids over a certain age would combine work, school, and exercise. This would not only help production but also help kids grow into well-rounded people.

Modern industry uses technology to break down work into small tasks, but capitalism makes this worse by turning workers into just parts of machines. Outside factories, cheap unskilled labor, including women and kids, is used a lot.

The conflict between old ways of dividing work and modern industry is clear. Many kids in factories do very simple, boring jobs for years without learning skills that would help them later. For example, in old printing jobs, apprentices learned step-by-step until they became skilled printers who could read and write. But with printing machines, there are now just two types of workers: adults who run the machines and mostly boys aged 11 to 17 who only put paper under the machines or take printed sheets out.

These boys often work very long hours, sometimes 14 to 16 hours a day for several days, and sometimes even 36 hours straight with only 2 hours for meals and sleep. Many can’t even read, and their behavior is often wild and strange.

They don’t need to learn much for their jobs because the work needs little skill or thought. Even though they get decent pay for boys, their wages don’t go up much as they get older. Most can’t move up to better jobs like machine minder because there are many boys for every machine minder, so fewer chances to get promoted.
