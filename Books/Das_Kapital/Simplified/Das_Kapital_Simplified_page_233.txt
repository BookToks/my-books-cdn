In old Asian kingdoms, workers who didn’t farm only had their own hard work to offer. But because there were so many of them, and because leaders could organize them well, they built huge palaces, temples, pyramids, and giant statues that still amaze us today. This was possible because all the money and resources were controlled by just a few people. 

This kind of power, once held by kings and priests in places like Asia and Egypt, has now moved to capitalists—people who invest money to make more money. Sometimes this is one person, sometimes a group in companies.

Early human cooperation, like among hunter groups or Indian farming communities, was based on sharing everything together. Each person stayed closely connected to their tribe, like bees in a hive. This kind of teamwork is different from capitalist teamwork because it’s based on shared ownership and close community ties.

In history, big group work sometimes happened under systems like slavery, where some people ruled over others. But capitalism depends on free workers who sell their labor for wages.

Capitalist cooperation grew as a way to compete with farmers and small craft workers who worked independently or in guilds. From their point of view, cooperation wasn’t just teamwork—it was a special kind of work linked to capitalism.

When workers start working together in big groups under capitalism, it changes how work is done. This change happens naturally when many wage workers work at the same time, which is the start of capitalist production. This moment also marks the beginning of capital itself.

Capitalism turns work into a social process by making workers cooperate, which helps bosses make more profit by getting workers to be more productive.

In its simplest form, cooperation is needed for any large-scale production, but it doesn’t always show up as a clear feature of capitalist development. It mostly appears during early manufacturing and in big farms that are different from small peasant farms because they have many workers and lots of resources.

Simple cooperation is common in industries where capital is used on a large scale, but where dividing work and using machines isn’t the main focus.
