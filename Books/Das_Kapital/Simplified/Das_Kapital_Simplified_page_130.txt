Actually, it’s usually the flaws in things that show us where they come from. For example, a dull knife or weak thread reminds us of the person who made them, like Mr. A., the knife maker, or Mr. B., the thread spinner. But when we look at a finished product, the work that went into making it seems to disappear.

A machine that doesn’t help with work is useless. Plus, it can be ruined by nature—iron rusts and wood rots. Yarn that isn’t used for weaving or knitting is just wasted cotton. People have to use their energy to bring these things to life, turning them from just potential into useful tools. When work is put into them, they become part of the process of making new products, which can be used either for living or for more work.

So, finished products are not just the results of work but also needed for work to happen. The only way to keep these products useful is by using them with living labor.

Work uses up the materials and tools it needs, so it’s a process of using things up. This “productive consumption” is different from using things for yourself. When you use products for yourself, like food, you become the result. But when products are used for work, the result is a new product, not the worker.

Since the tools and materials used in work are themselves products, work uses some products to make others. But just like in the beginning when people worked directly with nature, today we still use many things provided straight by nature that don’t involve human labor.

Work, broken down to its simplest parts, is people acting to make useful things by using natural materials. It’s how humans connect with nature and survive, and this is true no matter what society they live in. So, we don’t need to think about other workers or social conditions here. Just like you can’t tell who grew the oats by tasting porridge, you can’t tell from this simple work process whether the worker is a slave, a farmer, or living under any other system.

Now, let’s go back to our future boss. He just bought everything needed for work: the tools and machines, and the workers’ labor. With a sharp eye, he picked the best tools and workers for his trade, whether that’s spinning thread, making boots, or something else.
