From 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. was the legal “day,” and within this time, young people and women had to work 12 hours at first, then 10 hours under certain rules.

Factories started by firing some, sometimes half, of the young people and women they employed. Then, for adult men, they brought back night shifts, which were almost gone. The factory owners said the Ten Hours’ Act left them no choice. Their next move was about meal breaks. Let’s hear from the Factory Inspectors.

“Since work hours were cut to ten, factory owners say that if work is from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., they meet the law by giving an hour before 9 a.m. and half an hour after 7 p.m. for meals. Sometimes they even give an hour or half an hour for dinner but say they don’t have to give any break during the workday.” The manufacturers believed the law only let workers eat before and after work, meaning at home. They asked, why not eat dinner before 9 in the morning? But the lawyers said meal breaks must happen during work hours, and it’s illegal to make people work 10 hours straight without breaks. After these fights, the factory owners followed the law, so what they did was legal.

The 1844 law stopped children aged 8 to 13 who worked before noon from working after 1 p.m. But it didn’t control children who started work at noon or later. So, kids could work from 12 to 1, then 2 to 4, and finally 5 to 8:30 p.m., making 6.5 hours total. Or, even better for the factory owners, kids could just start working at 2 p.m. and stay until 8:30 p.m. without breaks, matching adult men’s hours.

“It’s now clear that mill owners want their machines running more than 10 hours a day, so they keep kids working with adult men after all young people and women leave, sometimes until 8:30 p.m.” Workers and inspectors complained for health and moral reasons, but factory owners said, “If I break the law, I’ll take the blame.” Still, on July 15, 1850, 3,742 children in 257 factories were working this way, despite protests. But even that wasn’t enough.

Factory owners noticed the 1844 law only required a 30-minute break if kids worked 5 hours before noon but said nothing about work after noon. So, they made 8-year-old kids work from 2 to 8:30 p.m. without breaks, making them work hard and stay hungry during that time.
