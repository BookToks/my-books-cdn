People talk about how valuable work is and call the money paid for it its natural or necessary price. But they also talk about market prices for work, which can go up or down from that natural price.

So, what makes something valuable? It’s the amount of social work put into making it. How do we figure out how much work is in something? By how much work time it took to make it. For example, how do we know the value of a 12-hour workday? It’s just the 12 hours worked, which sounds obvious and kind of silly. Work has to exist before it can be sold.

If a worker could make their work exist on its own, they would sell a product, not just work. Also, trading money (which is past work) directly for work happening right now would mess up the system based on value and wages. In capitalism, work is sold as wages.

A 12-hour workday might be worth, say, 6 shillings in money. If the worker gets all 6 shillings, then their pay equals the value of their work, and the buyer doesn’t make extra profit. That would mean no capitalism because profit comes from paying workers less than the value they create. But usually, the worker gets less than 6 shillings for 12 hours of work, meaning they are paid for fewer hours than they actually work. This mix-up of equal and unequal amounts can’t be explained by normal rules. It doesn’t help to say one kind of work is “realized” and one is “living” work because the value of a product depends on how much work is needed to make it, not how much was actually done.

For example, if a product usually takes 6 hours to make but then a machine can do it in 3 hours, the product’s value drops by half. It now shows 3 hours of social work instead of 6. What matters is the work needed to make something, not the work already done.

When money meets work on the market, it’s not the work itself but the worker who shows up. The worker sells their ability to work, called labor-power. Once the worker starts working, the work belongs to someone else and can’t be sold again. Work is what decides value but doesn’t have value itself. Saying “value of labor” is confusing and backwards, kind of like saying “value of the earth.”

These confusing ideas come from how the system works. Things often seem upside down in how they appear, and this is true in economics too. Classical economists borrowed the idea of “price of labor” from everyday talk without questioning it and then just asked how that price is decided.
