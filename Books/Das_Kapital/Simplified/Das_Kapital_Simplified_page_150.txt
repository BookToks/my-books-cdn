Capital C is made up of two parts: one is the money spent on things needed to make stuff, called c, and the other is the money spent on paying workers, called v. The c part is called constant capital, and the v part is called variable capital. So, C = c + v. For example, if you have £500 to spend, it might be split into £410 for constant capital and £90 for variable capital.

After making the product, its value is (c + v) + s, where s is the extra value made, called surplus-value. Using the example, the product’s value would be (£410 + £90) + £90, which equals £590. So, the original £500 has grown to £590, and the extra £90 is the surplus-value.

Since the value of the product’s parts equals the value of the money spent, it’s obvious that the extra value (surplus-value) shows how much the capital has grown.

But we need to look closer at this. We compare the product’s value with the value of the parts used to make it.

Some of the constant capital, like machines, only give part of their value to the product because they wear out slowly. The rest of their value stays in the machines. We can ignore the part that stays in the machines because it doesn’t help make the product’s value right now.

For example, if c = £410, that might be £312 for raw materials, £44 for extra materials, and £54 for machine wear and tear. The total machine value might be £1,054, but only £54 is used up while making the product. If we counted the full £1,054, we’d have to count it on both sides of the calculation, which wouldn’t change the surplus-value of £90.

So, when we say constant capital, we mean only the part actually used up in making the product.

Going back to the formula, C = c + v changes into C' = (c + v) + s. The value of constant capital just moves into the product, it doesn’t create new value. The new value made is only from variable capital plus surplus-value—that is, v + s, or £90 + £90 = £180, not £590.

If c = 0—meaning no materials or machines are needed, only workers and natural materials—then there would be no constant capital added to the product.
