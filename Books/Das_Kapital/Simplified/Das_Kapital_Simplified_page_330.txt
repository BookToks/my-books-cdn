5 At first, the original power-loom looked a lot like the old-fashioned loom.

But the modern power-loom has changed a lot since then.

6 In the last 15 years (since about 1850), more and more of these machine tools have been made in England by other machines, not by the people who usually make the machines. Some examples are machines that make bobbins automatically, set cards, make shuttles, and forge parts for spinning machines.

7 Moses said, “Don’t stop the ox from eating while it’s working.” But in Germany, some Christian people put wooden boards around the necks of workers called serfs, who powered grinding machines, so they couldn’t eat any flour with their hands.

8 The Dutch used wind power because they didn’t have good streams with strong waterfalls, and sometimes had too much water. They got the windmill from Germany, where people argued about who owned the wind—the nobles, priests, or emperor. While the wind caused trouble in Germany, it helped free the Dutch by keeping their land dry. In 1836, Holland had 12,000 windmills with 6,000 horsepower to stop two-thirds of the land from flooding.

9 Watt’s first steam engine made things better, but it was still mostly just a machine for pumping water and moving saltwater from mines.

10 Babbage said that a machine is made when many simple tools are powered by one motor.

11 In January 1861, John C. Morton gave a talk about the forces used in farming. He said that making land flat and smooth helps steam engines work better. Horses are still needed where fences and other things get in the way. But these problems are getting smaller. Tasks that need a lot of thinking still need humans. Morton compared steam power, horse power, and human power using the same unit of measurement. He said it costs less to use steam power than horses, and horses can only work about 8 hours a day to stay healthy. Using steam power can replace many horses on farms, especially since horses only work well for 3 or 4 months a year. Steam power also does better work than horses. To do the same job as one steam engine, 66 men would be needed, costing 15 shillings an hour. For one horse’s work, 32 men would be needed, costing 8 shillings an hour.

12 Faulhaber in 1625 and De Caus in 1688 worked on related ideas.

13 The modern turbine helps use water power much more effectively than before.

14 When textile factories first started, they had to be built near streams with waterfalls to turn water wheels. These watermills helped end home-based manufacturing but were still in rural areas and far apart. It wasn’t until steam power was used instead of water that factories could be built close together in towns where coal and water for steam were easy to find.
