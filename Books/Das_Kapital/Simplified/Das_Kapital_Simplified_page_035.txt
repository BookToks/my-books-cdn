It's easy to forget that you can only compare the size or amount of different things if you measure them using the same unit. Only then can you say they are the same kind of thing and compare them fairly. For example, whether 20 yards of linen equals 1 coat, 20 coats, or some number of coats, each statement means that linen and coats are being measured by the same standard—they are both things of value. Saying linen equals coat is the starting point for this comparison.

But even though we treat these two items as the same kind of thing, they don’t play the same role. We only talk about the value of the linen here. How? By comparing it to the coat, which stands for the value and can be traded for the linen. The coat shows the value of the linen because it represents the value in a form we can understand. The linen’s value becomes clear because it can be compared or exchanged with the coat. 

To explain this with a science example, butyric acid and propyl formate are different chemicals. But both are made from carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the same amounts. If we say butyric acid equals 4 of propyl formate, it means propyl formate just shows the same chemical makeup in a different form. Saying this tells us they have the same basic parts even though they look and act differently.

When we say commodities (things you can buy or sell) are just frozen human work, we’re simplifying them to their value. But value doesn’t have its own shape or form separate from the actual thing. It’s different when you compare one commodity’s value to another’s. One thing becomes value because it’s related to the other.

By making the coat equal to the linen, we’re saying the work that made the coat is equal to the work that made the linen. The tailoring for the coat is a different kind of work than weaving the linen, but by comparing them, we focus on what they share: human labor in general. This shows that weaving and tailoring, though different, are both just kinds of human work that create value. Comparing different things like this helps us see that value comes from all kinds of human labor being basically the same kind of effort.

But there’s more than just showing the kind of work that creates value. Human labor, when it’s happening, doesn’t have value by itself. It only becomes value when it’s frozen or stored in something, like an object. To show the value of linen as frozen human work, that value has to exist outside the linen itself, but also be something that linen and all other products share. This idea has already been figured out.

When the coat stands in for value in the comparison, it is equal to the linen because it represents value. At this point, the coat is just value in a physical form. But the coat itself, as an actual thing, is just something useful. A coat doesn’t tell us it has value any more than a piece of linen does.
