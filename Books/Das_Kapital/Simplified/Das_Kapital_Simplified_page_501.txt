The “Public Health Report” talks briefly about children dying and the gang system but hasn’t been shared much with newspapers or the public in England. However, the latest report from the “Child Employment Committee” got a lot of attention in the news. 

The Liberal newspapers wondered how rich and important people, including church leaders in Lincolnshire, could let such a bad system happen on their land, especially since they send people to faraway places to teach about good behavior. The more polite newspapers just commented on how sad it is that poor farm workers would sell their children into such slavery.

The terrible conditions these “fancy” people force on farm workers are so bad that it wouldn’t be shocking if a parent even harmed their own child. What’s really surprising is that many farm workers still have strong morals despite all this. Official reports show that parents in gang areas hate the gang system.

The reports say parents often wish they had laws to help them say no to pressure from parish officers or bosses who threaten to fire them if their children don’t work, even when going to school would be better. All the wasted time, energy, and suffering from hard work hurts both workers and their kids. Parents see how overcrowded homes and the bad influence of gangs ruin their children’s morals. These things make the poor families feel upset and helpless.

They know a lot of pain has been caused by problems they didn’t create and couldn’t stop. If it were up to them, they wouldn’t agree to it, but they have no power to fight back.

In Ireland, the population grew from about 5.3 million in 1801 to over 8.2 million in 1841.

If we look back further, sheep numbers in 1865 were about 3.7 million, slightly less than in 1856, and pigs in 1865 were about 1.3 million, down from 1.4 million in 1858.

The data comes from official Irish agricultural statistics shared with Parliament every year.

In 1872, compared to 1871, the land used for farming dropped by about 135,000 acres. There was more land for crops like turnips and mangold-wurzel, but less for wheat, oats, barley, rye, potatoes, flax, and some grasses.

The area growing wheat kept getting smaller from 1868 to 1872, dropping from 285,000 acres to 228,000 acres. In 1872, there were about 2,600 more horses, 80,000 more cattle, nearly 69,000 more sheep, but 236,000 fewer pigs.

The total yearly income shown in one table is different from others because of legal deductions.
