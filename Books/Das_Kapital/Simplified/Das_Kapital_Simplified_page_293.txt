When workers lose their jobs because machines take over, their suffering doesn’t last forever, just like the wealth in the world doesn’t last forever.

About the workers who got fired, the £1,500 they had to live on was never really capital. What counted as capital was the £1,500 spent on machines. If you look closer, this money came from part of the carpets made in a year by the 50 workers who lost their jobs. They were paid in money instead of carpets. With that money, they bought things to live on worth £1,500. So, these things weren’t capital to the workers but just stuff they bought. When machines took away their jobs, they didn’t have money to buy these things anymore. Because fewer people could buy these goods, the prices dropped. If this drop continued and spread, more workers making these goods lost their jobs. Some capital used to make these goods had to change into something else. While prices fell and capital moved, workers making these goods also lost part of their wages. So, instead of machines helping workers by turning their living things into capital for new jobs, the usual idea of supply and demand actually shows machines push workers out of jobs, not just where machines are used, but in other industries too.

The truth, which some economists ignore, is this: When machines push workers out of factories, these workers end up looking for jobs in the labor market, adding to the number of workers employers can choose from. Later in this book, it will be clear that this effect of machines, which some say helps workers, is actually very harmful. Right now, I’ll just say this: Workers who lose jobs in one industry can look for work in another. But if they find new jobs, it’s because new money is invested in those industries, not because the money that paid them before was turned into machines. Even if they find work, their chances are bad! Because they only know one kind of job, they are worth very little in other fields. They can only get work in low-paying jobs with too many workers. Also, every year, new workers enter the market, ready to fill jobs or help industries grow. So, when machines free up workers in one industry, these new workers go into other jobs, while the original workers often starve during this change.

It’s true that machines don’t directly “free” workers from what they need to live. Machines make production cheaper and faster in the industry they’re used in and don’t change how much stuff other industries make at first. This means society still has as much, or even more, basic things to live on than before, even for workers who lost jobs. This happens even though a lot of the yearly production is wasted by people who don’t work. And this is the point some people use to defend machines!
