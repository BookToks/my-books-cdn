Coins have two things about them: their actual metal weight and their value as money. This difference means that coins don’t have to be made of metal; they could be made of other materials and still work as money.

It’s hard to make very tiny coins out of gold or silver. Also, usually, cheaper metals like copper or silver are used first as money before the more valuable gold takes over. That’s why silver and copper coins were used as stand-ins for gold coins in history.

Silver and copper coins are used where money changes hands a lot, like in small everyday purchases. These coins wear out faster because they’re used more. To stop these cheaper coins from completely replacing gold, rules say how much they must be accepted as payment instead of gold.

Different types of coins work together in money systems. Small coins help pay parts of a gold coin. Gold coins move into small sales but often get changed back into smaller coins. The metal weight in silver and copper coins is set by law, not by their value. Since these coins wear out faster than gold ones, their worth doesn’t depend on their metal anymore.

Gold coins also don’t need to be worth the metal they’re made of. This is why things like paper money, which don’t have much value themselves, can be used as money instead of coins. Paper money shows this idea clearly, while metal coins hide it a bit.

Here, we’re talking about paper money that the government issues and makes people use. This kind of money started from real metal coins. Money based on credit, like loans or IOUs, works differently and isn’t explained here. Real paper money comes from money’s job as something you use to buy and sell things. Credit money comes from money’s job as a way to pay debts.

The government prints paper money with numbers on it, like £1 or £5. When paper money replaces gold, it follows the same rules as metal money. There’s a special rule for paper money: the amount of paper money can’t be more than the gold or silver it replaces.

The amount of gold money people use changes but usually stays around a certain level. This minimum amount is well-known from experience. Even if the gold coins get replaced by new ones, the total amount stays the same and keeps moving around. Paper money can take the place of this gold.

But if all the money used today was paper and matched the maximum amount of gold the system can handle, then if buying and selling changes suddenly, there could be too much paper money and problems might happen.
