Ireland’s suffering is once again being talked about a lot in England. At the end of 1866 and the start of 1867, one rich Irish landowner, Lord Dufferin, tried to find a solution by writing in The Times newspaper. 

From the data we saw, in 1864, three people who made profits earned only £262,819 out of a total £4,368,610. In 1865, the same three earned £274,528 out of £4,669,979 total profits. In 1864, 26 people made £646,377; in 1865, 28 made £736,448. In 1864, 121 people made £1,076,912; in 1865, 150 made £1,320,906. In 1864, 1,131 people made £2,150,818, almost half the total profit; in 1865, 1,194 people made £2,418,833, more than half the total profit. But a very small number of rich landowners in England, Scotland, and Ireland take a huge share of the yearly rent money. The English government doesn’t even give out the stats on how rent is shared like it does for profits.

Lord Dufferin is one of these rich landowners. The idea that rent and profits can be too high, or that having too much money is connected to people being poor, is considered a bad or wrong idea. He sticks to facts. The fact is that as the Irish population goes down, the rent money from landowners goes up. So fewer people actually help the land, which benefits landlords, the soil, and therefore the people who live there. He says Ireland still has too many people and that not enough people are leaving the country. To fix things, Ireland needs to lose at least 300,000 working men. Don’t think Lord Dufferin is crazy or like an old doctor who keeps cutting a patient to fix them. He only wants to reduce the population by 300,000 instead of two million. Without this, Ireland will never be truly happy. The proof is easy to show.

In 1864, there were farms in Ireland like this:

1. Farms not over 1 acre: 48,653 farms covering 25,394 acres.

2. Farms over 1 and up to 5 acres: 82,037 farms covering 288,916 acres.

3. Farms over 5 and up to 15 acres: 176,368 farms covering 1,836,310 acres.

4. Farms over 15 and up to 30 acres: 136,578 farms covering 3,051,343 acres.

5. Farms over 30 and up to 50 acres: 71,961 farms covering 2,906,274 acres.

6. Farms over 50 and up to 100 acres: 54,247 farms covering 3,983,880 acres.

7. Farms over 100 acres: 31,927 farms covering 8,227,807 acres.

8. Total farm area: 26,319,924 acres.

From 1851 to 1861, small farms under 15 acres were mostly destroyed. These small farms mainly have to disappear. This means 307,058 extra farmers, and if each family has 4 people, that’s 1,228,232 people too many.
