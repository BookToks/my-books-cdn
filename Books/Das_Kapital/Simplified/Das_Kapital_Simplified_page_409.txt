Every year, businesses have to make enough stuff to replace the tools and materials they used up during the year. After doing that, there’s extra stuff left over, called the surplus-product, and this is where the extra value or profit comes from. But what is this extra stuff made of? Is it just things the rich people buy for themselves?

If that were true, all the extra value would be spent, and nothing would grow or get bigger.

To make their businesses bigger, capitalists have to turn some of that extra stuff back into more tools, machines, and things workers need to live. So, part of the extra work done each year goes into making more of these things, more than just what’s needed to replace old stuff.

In simple terms, surplus value becomes new capital because the extra stuff already includes the materials needed to make more capital. But to actually use this new capital, capitalists need more workers. If the workers they already have don’t work more or harder, they have to find new workers. Capitalism prepares for this by making sure there’s always a group of workers who need jobs and whose wages cover their living costs and growing families. Capitalists just have to hire these new workers and give them the tools they need, and the cycle of turning surplus value into more capital keeps going. 

This means that instead of just repeating the same process over and over, the system grows step by step, like a spiral getting bigger and bigger. 

For example, if someone starts with £10,000 in capital, they make £2,000 extra profit and add it to their capital. Then the new total makes £400 more, which is added again, and so on, growing like a rolling ball.

We’re not talking here about how much the capitalist spends on themselves.

It also doesn’t matter right now if the new money is added to the old capital or kept separate, or if the same person uses it or someone else does. What’s important is that the original money keeps working and making more profit, and all the new money does this too.

The original £10,000 came from the owner’s work and the work of their ancestors, which makes sense based on how things are made and sold.

But the extra £2,000 is different. We know exactly where it comes from: unpaid work by workers. The tools and supplies used for the new workers, and what keeps them alive, all come from the extra goods made by workers but kept by the capitalists as profit.
