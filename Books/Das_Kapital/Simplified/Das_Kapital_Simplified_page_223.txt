The real value of a product isn’t just how much time one person spends making it, but how much time society usually needs to make it. So, if a boss uses a new way to make something and sells it at the normal social value of one shilling, but it only took him less time to make, he actually makes extra profit.

If a worker’s day is 12 hours, but now the boss can produce 24 items instead of 12, he needs to sell twice as many to get rid of them all. To sell more, prices usually have to go down. So, he might sell each item for tenpence, which is less than the normal value but more than what it cost him. This way, he still makes extra money on each item.

This extra profit goes to the boss, no matter what type of product it is. So, every boss wants to make things cheaper by making workers more productive.

But even when this happens, the extra profit comes from making workers spend less time doing necessary work and more time doing extra work. For example, if workers usually work 10 hours to cover their wages, and 2 hours as extra work, the boss now makes 24 items and sells them for twenty shillings total.

Out of this, twelve shillings cover the cost of materials, and the rest is from the workers’ effort. Six items represent the workers’ necessary work, and about 3 and a half items are extra work. Before, the ratio of necessary to extra work was 5:1, but now it’s 5:3. 

In money terms, the work done in 12 hours is worth twenty shillings, but the materials cost twelve shillings, so eight shillings is new value made during the day. This value is higher than usual because the work is more productive. The boss still pays workers the same five shillings for a day’s work, so workers only need to work 7 and a half hours to earn this. The extra work time increases by 2 and a half hours, and the boss’s profit goes up from one shilling to three.

So, the boss using the new way of working gets more extra work from the worker than other bosses. He does this alone, but all bosses end up doing the same to keep up. However, this extra profit disappears once the new method is common and prices adjust. The rule that value depends on labor time forces bosses to sell products at normal value, pushing all bosses to use the new method.

In the end, the overall profit rate only changes when the new way of working spreads to industries that make everyday things workers need, which affects how much workers’ labor is worth.
