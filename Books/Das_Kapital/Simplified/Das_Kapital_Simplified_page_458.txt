When workers lose their old homes because they are torn down, they don’t usually leave their neighborhood. At most, they move just outside it, trying to stay as close as possible.

They want to live near their jobs. People don’t move far, usually within the same area or the next one. They split small two-room homes into single rooms and pack even more people into them. Even if rent is high, those who are forced out can’t find places as decent as the ones they lost. Half the workers on the Strand, a busy London street, walked two miles to work.

The Strand looks rich to visitors, but it shows how crowded people are in London. In one parish there, a health officer counted 581 people per acre, including half the Thames river area. So, every time London tries to improve health by tearing down bad houses, it just pushes workers into even smaller, more crowded spaces.

Dr. Hunter said this will either have to stop because it makes no sense, or the public must start caring enough to help those who can’t afford homes. He means people who don’t have money can’t get houses by themselves, even though they could pay little by little if someone built homes for them.

This is unfair! When landowners lose property because of new roads or railways, they get paid fully and even make money. But workers with families get thrown out on the street. If too many of them crowd into neighborhoods where the city wants things to be clean, they get in trouble for health reasons!

At the start of the 1800s, London was the only English town with over 100,000 people. Only five towns had more than 50,000. Now, there are 28 towns that big.

Because of this, many more people live in towns now. The old small towns are packed tight with buildings all around, with no fresh air. Rich people leave these places for nicer areas outside town. Their old big houses get split up so many families live in just one room, and they rent out space to more people. These houses weren’t made for so many people, and living there is bad for adults and even worse for children.

The faster money grows in a town with factories or business, the more people come looking for work, and the worse the workers’ homes become.

Newcastle-on-Tyne, a coal and iron town, is the second worst after London for bad housing. About 34,000 people live in single rooms there. Because these homes are dangerous, many houses have recently been torn down by the city in Newcastle and nearby Gateshead.
