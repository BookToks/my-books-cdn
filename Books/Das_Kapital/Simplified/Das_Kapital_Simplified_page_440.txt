Big factories and industries are growing everywhere, and this helps organize the work of many people better. It also helps improve the tools and machines they use. This means that instead of working alone using old ways, production becomes a group effort that is planned and arranged in a smart way.

But saving money and growing wealth slowly over time is much slower than bringing money and resources together all at once. For example, the world wouldnâ€™t have railways if people waited until a few individuals saved enough money to build them. Instead, companies joined money together quickly to build railways fast. This joining of money not only makes saving faster but also pushes new technology that uses more machines and less human work.

When a lot of money is combined quickly through this joining process, it grows even faster and becomes a strong tool for making society richer.

So, when we talk about society getting richer, we also mean the effects of joining money and resources together.

New money made from saving usually helps pay for new inventions and improvements in industry. But old money also gets updated over time, like getting a makeover. This means using better machines and tools that need fewer workers to make more products. The more money is joined together, the less work is needed from people.

So, on one side, new money saved needs fewer workers compared to how big it is. On the other side, old money being updated pushes away more and more workers who used to work for it.

Saving money and growing wealth at first looks like just getting bigger, but it also changes the way money is used. More money goes into machines and tools (constant capital) and less into paying workers (variable capital). The way businesses work, the power of workers to produce things, and how money is invested all change faster than just the amount of wealth grows. This happens because money is joined together more and more, and technology used in both new and old businesses changes at the same time.
