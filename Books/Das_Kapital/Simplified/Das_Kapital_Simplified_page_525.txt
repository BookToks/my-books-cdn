After the war, people earned more money than they did in the next hundred years.  

One law says that all groups made up of people from the same job or trade must be completely destroyed. This is a basic rule of the French constitution. It is not allowed to bring these groups back in any way, no matter the reason.  

Another part of the law says that if people in the same job or craft meet and agree to refuse to work together or only work for a set price, these meetings and agreements are illegal. They go against freedom and the rights of people.  

So, itâ€™s against the law for workers to join forces to control their work or prices, because this breaks the rules about freedom and human rights.
