It doesn’t matter what kind of material we use or how much it’s worth. The only thing that matters is that there’s enough material to cover the work done to make something.

Once we have enough material, its value can go up or down, or even be worthless like land or the sea. But this doesn’t change how value is created or how much value changes.

First, we say the constant capital is zero. So, the capital used is just the variable capital (v) instead of constant plus variable (c + v). Instead of the product’s value being (c + v) + s, it’s now (v + s). If the new value made is £180, which shows all the labour done, and we take away £90 (the variable capital), we have £90 left. This £90 is the extra value made, called surplus-value.

This £90 shows the total surplus-value made. To find out how much the surplus-value grew compared to the variable capital, we divide surplus-value by variable capital (s/v). In this example, 90 divided by 90 equals 100%. This percentage is called the “rate of surplus-value.”

We know that during part of the work, the worker only makes enough value to cover what they need to live, like food and shelter. Because work is divided in society, the worker doesn’t make the things they need directly. Instead, they make something else, like yarn, which is worth the same as what they need or the money to buy it.

The time spent making this value depends on how much the worker needs. If the things they need take six hours of work to produce, the worker must work six hours to make that value. If the worker worked for themselves, they’d still have to work those six hours to get what they need.

But when the worker works for the boss, the part of the day when they make the value for their own needs (say three shillings) just replaces the money the boss already spent on their wages. This looks like the worker is just getting back what was given to them.

This part of the workday is called “necessary labour time,” and the work done is “necessary labour.” It’s called necessary because the worker must do it no matter what kind of work or society they live in. It’s also necessary for the boss, because if the worker didn’t survive, the boss wouldn’t either.

After that, the worker spends the rest of the day working more, but now they’re not making value for themselves. Instead, they’re making extra value for the boss. This is called “surplus labour time,” and the work is “surplus labour.”

To really understand surplus-value, you have to see it as the extra work time turned into value, just like regular value is made from hours of work turned into things.
