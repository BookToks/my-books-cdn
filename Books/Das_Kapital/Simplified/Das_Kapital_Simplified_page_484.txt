The scattered tools and machines that workers use for their own jobs and survival, without using other people’s work to make them more valuable, are not really capital—just like a product made and used by the same person isn’t really a commodity. If the number of tools used in farming goes down with the population, the total capital used in farming can still grow because some tools that were spread out get gathered together and turned into capital.

In Ireland, outside farming, the total capital used in industry and trade grew slowly over the last twenty years and had many ups and downs. But even though it didn’t grow much overall, the individual parts of this capital got more concentrated. And compared to the smaller population, the capital actually grew a lot.

So, right in front of us, there’s a clear example of what traditional economics says: that misery comes from having too many people and that things balance out by fewer people living. This is even more important than the plague in the 14th century, which some people like Malthus praised. But if people today tried to use the same old ideas from the 14th century to explain the 19th century, they’d miss important details. After the plague, England’s farmers got richer and freer, but in France, people became poorer and more controlled.

The Irish famine in 1846 killed over a million poor people, but it didn’t hurt the country’s wealth at all. The big wave of people leaving Ireland over the next 20 years didn’t destroy their tools and farms like wars did in other places. Instead, Irish people found a new way to send poor people far away from the country. Those who moved to the United States sent money back to help others leave too. So, instead of costing Ireland, emigration became one of its most profitable exports. This process didn’t just make a temporary drop in population—it took out more people every year than were born, so the population kept shrinking.

What happened to the workers left in Ireland? The number of extra workers who couldn’t find jobs stayed just as high as before 1846. Wages stayed low, workers suffered more, and misery pushed the country toward another crisis. The facts are clear: farming changed as people left, but the number of extra workers grew faster than the population shrank. Looking at the land, Ireland changed even more than England did. In England, people grew more crops as they raised more cattle, but in Ireland, growing crops went down. Many fields that used to be farmed were left empty or turned into pastures, and some unused land and bogs started being used for cattle.

Small and medium farmers—those with less than 100 acres—still make up about 80% of all farmers. But one by one, they are being crushed by competition from big, capital-run farms, and many end up becoming wage workers. Ireland’s biggest industry, linen-making, doesn’t need many adult men and only employs a small part of the population, even though it grew after cotton prices went up between 1861 and 1866.
