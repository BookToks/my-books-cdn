Even when people work moderate hours, like from 8 in the morning to 6 in the evening, 3 or 4 workers still faint every day. The big changes in how things are made happen because new machines, like sewing machines, are used more and more in different jobs.

These changes don’t happen all at once but in different ways depending on how common sewing machines are, how long they’ve been used, what kind of workers there were before, and whether the work was done by hand or in small workshops or at home.

For example, in dressmaking, where workers already helped each other a lot, the sewing machine was just a new tool. But in jobs like tailoring, shirtmaking, and shoemaking, things are mixed up. Some workers get materials from bosses and work together in small rooms or attics with many women sewing.

At the same time, some people still use their own sewing machines at home or with their families, sometimes with help from others. In England, the boss usually gathers many machines in one place and then sends out the finished work to people working at home.

Even though there are many ways this change happens, the sewing machine pushes everything toward the factory system, where many machines and workers are all in one place under one boss. This happens because some parts of the work are easier to do where the machines are, and because people who used to sew by hand or at home are losing their jobs.

More and more money is being spent on sewing machines, which leads to making too many machine-made clothes. This floods the market and forces home workers to sell their machines. The makers of sewing machines often rent them out cheaply, which hurts small owners who can’t compete.

The machines keep changing and getting cheaper, which makes older machines less valuable. Big companies can buy these old machines very cheap and still make money. Finally, using steam power instead of people is the last step in this change.

At first, using steam was tricky because the machines didn’t run smoothly and broke easily. But people figured out how to fix these problems. When many machines are in big factories, steam power is used, and because steam is stronger than human muscles, it pushes more workers and machines into large factories.

Right now, in England, the making of clothes and many other jobs are changing from being done by hand or at home into big factory work. These changes have caused many problems like before, but without any of the benefits that factories can bring.

This big change in industry happens naturally but is also helped by laws that control the work of women, young people, and children in factories.
