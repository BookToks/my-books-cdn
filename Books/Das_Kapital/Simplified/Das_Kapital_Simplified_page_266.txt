The big changes in cotton spinning led to the invention of the cotton gin, a machine that separates seeds from cotton fibers. Without this invention, making cotton on a huge scale like we do now wouldn’t be possible.

Also, the big changes in how industries and farming worked meant we needed better ways to communicate and transport goods. In old times, when farming was small and people made things by hand in towns, the ways to move stuff around were not good enough for the new factories and big markets. So, transport and communication had to be completely changed.

The old methods from the factory days couldn’t keep up with modern industry, which works super fast, is huge, and constantly moves money and workers between different jobs all over the world. That’s why new systems like river steamers, railways, ocean steamers, and telegraphs were created to fit the needs of modern factories.

Because machines had to work with huge amounts of iron that needed cutting, shaping, and joining, giant new machines were needed. The old factory methods just couldn’t handle this.

Modern industry had to make machines that build other machines. Only when this happened did industry get a strong technical base and become independent. In the early 1800s, machines slowly started making other machines. But it wasn’t until the 1850s and 1860s, when huge railways and ocean steamers were built, that giant machines were made to create powerful engines.

To make machines building machines, a strong power source was needed that could be controlled perfectly. The steam engine provided this power. At the same time, it was important to make exact shapes like straight lines, circles, and cylinders for machine parts. Henry Maudsley solved this problem in the early 1800s by inventing the slide rest, a tool that became automatic and helped make machine parts very accurately and quickly. This tool replaced the hand’s work in shaping parts.

If we look at the big machines used to build other machines, we see huge versions of simple tools. For example, the boring machine uses a giant drill powered by steam to make big steam engine parts. The mechanical lathe is a huge version of a small lathe you operate with your foot. The planing machine works like a carpenter’s tools but on iron instead of wood. Some machines cut thin layers of wood like giant razors, others shear iron like enormous scissors, and the steam hammer is like a giant hammer so heavy no god could lift it.
