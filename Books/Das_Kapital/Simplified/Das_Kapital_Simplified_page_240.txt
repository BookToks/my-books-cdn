In Birmingham alone, 500 different kinds of hammers are made. Each one is designed for a specific job, and sometimes several types are used for different steps in the same process. Making things this way makes work easier, better, and faster by giving each worker the right tools for their exact task. This also helps create machines, which are just a mix of simple tools working together.

The worker and their tools are the simplest parts of making things. Now, let’s look at the whole process.

There are two main ways to organize making things. Even though they sometimes mix, these two ways are very different and play different roles in turning manufacturing into modern machine-powered industry. The difference depends on what’s being made. The product is either put together by fitting separate parts made on their own, or shaped by a series of connected steps and actions.

Take a train engine, for example. It has over 5,000 separate parts. But it’s not a good example of the first type of manufacturing because it’s made by modern machine industry. A watch is a better example, and William Petty used it to explain the division of labor in making things. 

A long time ago, one person made a whole watch in Nuremberg. Now, many workers each make a small part, like springs, dials, screws, and cases. There are even more detailed jobs like making wheels, polishing screws, painting figures, and putting everything together at the end. Most parts only pass through one or two hands before being combined into the final watch.

Because the parts come from so many different workers, it’s random whether they all work in one place or not. Sometimes, workers do their parts separately at home, like in the Cantons of Vaud and Neufchâtel. In Geneva, big watch factories have all the workers working together under one boss. But even there, some parts like dials and cases are usually made outside the factory.

Making watches this way, with many workers in one place, only works well in special cases. That’s because there’s a lot of competition among workers who want to work from home. Also, since the work is split into many different jobs, it’s hard to share tools and machines. Spreading out the work helps the boss save money on workshops and equipment.
