546 Chapter 33 9 l.c., vol.ii, p.5.

“Land, to be part of colonization, must not only be unused, but it has to be public land that can be turned into private land.” (l.c., Vol.II, p.125.)

Merivale and others explain that in colonies where slavery ended but forced work wasn’t replaced by enough free work, something strange happened. Instead of workers being taken advantage of, the workers started to take advantage of the business owners. They demanded wages that were way higher than what was fair.

The sugar planters couldn’t sell their sugar for enough money to cover these higher wages. So, they had to pay the extra money first from their profits, and then from their own savings. Many planters went broke or even shut down their businesses to avoid losing everything.

Molinari says it’s better for money to be lost than for people to suffer, but he wonders if it wouldn’t be best if neither money nor people were hurt.

Mr. Molinari talks about the “legitimate share” that workers and business owners should get. He points out that in Europe, business owners often don’t pay workers what they deserve, but in the colonies, the workers are the ones cutting into the owners’ fair share. He seems to want the police to fix this problem in the colonies, even though the law of supply and demand usually works on its own in Europe.

Wakefield and others also say that it’s because land and money are owned by individuals that people who only have their own strength can find jobs and earn money. But the opposite can happen too. When you take land away from someone, it’s like putting them in empty space with no air to breathe. Taking land from people takes away their chance to survive and work.
