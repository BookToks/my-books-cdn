But if all his fellow business owners did the same thing, where would he get his products to sell? And money can’t be eaten. So, he tries to convince others. “Look, I didn’t waste the 15 shillings; instead, I used it well and made yarn with it.” Okay, and as a reward, he now has good yarn instead of feeling guilty. But being stingy like that isn’t a good idea; we’ve already seen where that leads. Also, if there’s nothing to sell, the king has no power. No matter how good his self-control is, there’s nothing to pay him back with because the value of the product is just the sum of the things used to make it. So, he should just be happy that doing the right thing is its own reward.

But no, he keeps pushing. He says, “The yarn isn’t useful to me; I made it to sell.” If that’s true, then he should sell it. Or even better, he should just make stuff for his own needs from now on, which is what his doctor MacCulloch suggested as the perfect cure for making too many things.

Now he’s stubborn. “Can a worker, just using his hands and feet, make things out of nothing? Didn’t I give him the materials that his work needed? And since most people are like that, haven’t I helped society a lot with my tools, my cotton, and my spindle? I even gave the worker what he needs to live. Shouldn’t I get something back for all that?”

But didn’t the worker give him back the same value by turning cotton and spindle into yarn?

Also, this isn’t about “helping” each other. Helping means using something useful, like a product or work. But here, it’s about value. The boss paid the worker 3 shillings, and the worker gave back the same value, added to the cotton. He gave value for value.

Our proud businessman suddenly acts humble like his worker and says, “Haven’t I worked too? I managed and watched over the spinner. Doesn’t that work create value?” His managers try not to laugh. After a good laugh, he goes back to his usual self. Even though he talks like an economist, he really doesn’t care about their theories. He leaves all those tricks to the economics professors who get paid for it. He’s a practical guy and knows what he’s doing in business, even if he doesn’t always think about outside ideas.

Let’s look closer. The value of one day’s work is 3 shillings because half a day’s work is needed to keep a worker alive — that’s the cost of the stuff he needs to live. But the past work built into the worker’s ability and the actual work he does now are two different things. The first sets the price of his work, the second is what his work is really worth. Just because it takes half a day’s work to keep him alive, doesn’t mean he can’t work a full day.

So, the value of the worker’s ability to work and the value he creates by working are two very different things. That difference is what the boss wanted when he hired the worker. The useful power of the worker, which helps make yarn or boots, was just a necessary condition. To make value, the work has to be useful.

What really mattered to the boss was that this worker’s ability isn’t just a source of value, but a source of more value than what it costs.
