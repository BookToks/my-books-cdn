In a strict way, the farmer is just as much an industrial capitalist as the manufacturer.

Even as late as 1794, small cloth-makers in Leeds sent a group to Parliament to ask for a law that would stop merchants from becoming manufacturers.

William Howitt wrote about how Europeans treated native people badly in their colonies, especially slaves. To really understand how the middle class treats workers and themselves, you need to study this carefully.

Thomas Stamford Raffles, who was the Lieutenant Governor of an island, wrote a history of Java in 1817.

In 1866, over a million Hindus died of hunger just in the Orissa province.

Still, officials tried to make money for the Indian government by charging high prices for food that starving people needed.

William Cobbett said that in England, all public institutions are called "royal," but in return, people have to deal with the "national" debt.

Montesquieu once said that if the Tartars invaded Europe today, it would be hard to explain to them what a financier is like in our society.

Mirabeau, a political thinker, wrote about similar ideas.

Eden, another writer, also discussed these topics in his books.

John Fielden and others wrote about the terrible conditions in factories. When steam engines moved factories to towns, factory owners found lots of children to work without having to get slaves from workhouses. In 1815, when a law was introduced to protect children, some people said that children were treated like property and even sold. There were cases where children were found starving, and in one horrible example, it was agreed that for every 20 healthy children, one disabled child had to be taken by a manufacturer.

In 1790, in the English West Indies, there were ten slaves for every free person; in the French colonies, fourteen slaves for one free person; and in the Dutch colonies, twenty-three slaves for every free person.

The term “labouring poor” started being used in English laws when wage workers became a big group. This was different from the “idle poor,” who were beggars. Some people believed that the laws of business were the same as the laws of nature and God. Edmund Burke, a famous thinker, sold himself to the highest bidder but was still seen as talented. Today, many people follow the same ideas, but often without Burke’s skill or honesty.
