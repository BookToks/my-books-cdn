Workdays can be 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, or even 18 hours long—lots of different lengths.

The boss buys a worker’s time for one day. That means the boss has the right to make the worker work for one day. But what exactly is a working day? It’s shorter than a full natural day, but how much shorter? The boss decides this limit. As the boss, he represents capital, which means money and resources used to make more money. Capital’s main goal is to create value and extra value by getting the most work possible out of the worker.

Capital is like a vampire—it’s “dead” work that survives by sucking the energy from living workers, and it lives more the more work it takes. The time a worker spends working is when the boss uses the worker’s energy that he paid for. If the worker uses his time for himself instead, he is cheating the boss.

The boss follows the rules of buying and selling. Like any buyer, he wants to get the most out of what he buys. But the worker speaks up: the work I sell is different from other things because it creates more value than it costs. That’s why you bought it. What you see as your profit is extra effort from me.

We both know that on the market, things are traded by rules. The boss owns the use of my daily work, but because he pays me each day, I should be able to rest and come back the next day ready to work just as well as today. You always tell me to save and not waste. Fine! I will take care of my only real asset—my ability to work—and will only use it as much as is healthy and normal.

If you make me work too long, you can use up more of my energy in one day than I can recover in three. What you gain is what I lose. Using my energy is one thing; wearing me out is another. If a normal worker can work for 30 years, the value of my work each day is 1/10,950 of that total. But if you make me work so hard I only last 10 years, you’re paying me just 1/3 of what my work is really worth every day and stealing the rest.

You pay me for one day’s work, but you use three days’ worth. That breaks our deal and the rules of buying and selling. So, I demand a normal-length workday. I’m not asking you to be nice—I’m talking money. You might be a good person or care about animals, but as the boss, you have no heart. The only heart here is mine.

I want a normal workday because, like any seller, I want to get the true value of what I’m selling. We see that, besides some flexible limits, the rules of buying and selling don’t stop bosses from making workdays longer or forcing extra work. The boss tries to get as much work as possible, even trying to turn one workday into two.
