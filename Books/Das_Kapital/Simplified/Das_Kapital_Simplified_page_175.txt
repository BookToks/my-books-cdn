He works hard; because he produces 25% more work for a short time, he ends up dying at 37 instead of 50.

Section 4: Working Day and Night. The Relay System

The tools and machines used to make things only exist to use workers’ labor and get extra work from them. When these tools aren’t being used, they cost money without making anything. This loss becomes even bigger if it costs more money to start using them again.

Making people work longer hours, even at night, only helps a little. It doesn’t satisfy the constant need to get more work from workers. Capitalist businesses want to make workers work all 24 hours of the day. But it’s impossible for the same person to work day and night without resting.

So, they switch workers. Some work during the day, others at night. Sometimes workers change shifts every week. This system, called the relay system, was very common in English cotton factories and still happens in places like Moscow’s cotton spinning industry.

Today, many industries in Great Britain use this 24-hour system, like blast furnaces, forges, and rolling mills in England, Wales, and Scotland. Work happens not just six days a week but also a lot on Sundays. The workers include men, women, and children aged from 6 or 8 up to 18.

In some jobs, girls and women work at night with men. Night work is usually bad for health. Still, working all day and night lets companies make workers work longer than normal hours. Most workers officially work 12 hours a day, night or day, but often they work much more. Official reports call this overwork “truly fearful.”

The reports say it’s hard to imagine how much work boys aged 9 to 12 have to do, and that such abuse by parents and employers should not be allowed anymore. Boys working day and night shifts often end up working very long hours, which is cruel and unbelievable for children.

Sometimes when some boys don’t show up, others have to work extra shifts to cover for them.
