These steamhammers were invented by Nasmyth. One of them weighs over 6 tons and can strike down from 7 feet high on an anvil that weighs 36 tons. It’s strong enough to crush a block of granite into powder, but it can also tap a nail lightly into soft wood.

Machines replace human strength with natural forces like steam or water. They also use science instead of just guessing. In factories, workers are organized in a way that depends on the machines. The worker becomes just a small part of the big system. In simple teamwork, workers still have some independence, but machines need workers to work together closely. This kind of cooperation is necessary because of how machines work.

  
Section 2: The Value Machines Add to Products  
We saw that working together or sharing jobs costs nothing extra. Natural forces like steam or water also don’t cost anything when used in production. But just like a person needs lungs to breathe, workers need tools made by humans to use these forces. For example, a water-wheel is needed to use water power, and a steam-engine is needed to use steam power.

Some scientific laws, like how magnets and electric currents work, cost nothing to discover. But using those laws in technology like telegraphs needs expensive equipment. A machine doesn’t replace a tool; it actually makes the tool bigger and more powerful. Now, capital makes workers use machines that control tools instead of just hand tools.

It’s clear that using big natural forces and science makes work much more productive. But this doesn’t mean it costs less work. Machines don’t create new value by themselves; instead, they pass their own value to the products they help make. The product actually becomes more expensive because of the machine’s value. Machines today are much more valuable than the simple tools used in old-fashioned crafts.

First, we should understand that machines work as a whole in production but only add value little by little. They never add more value than they lose by getting worn out. So, there’s a big difference between how much a machine is worth and how much value it adds to products over time. The longer a machine lasts, the bigger this difference becomes.
