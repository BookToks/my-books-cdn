The tools and machines shared by workers don’t grow as fast as the number of workers, but they do grow a lot. So, having a lot of resources owned by a few bosses is needed for workers to work together. How much they work together and how big the production is depends on how much stuff the bosses control.

Before, we learned that a certain amount of money and resources is needed so that many workers can be hired at the same time. This helps the boss stop working with their hands and become a real capitalist, which means running a business and making profit. We now see that having enough resources is also needed to turn many separate jobs into one big team effort.

We also saw that at first, workers worked for themselves, but then they started working for the capitalist, which made them controlled by the capitalist.

When many workers cooperate, the power of the capitalist becomes necessary to run the work itself. Just like a general leads an army, a capitalist must lead the production process.

Big group work needs someone to lead and organize everything so all the parts work well together. Like one violin player doesn’t need a conductor, but an orchestra does. Leading and organizing work becomes a job of the capitalist when workers cooperate. This leadership has special features.

The main goal of capitalist production is to get as much profit as possible by making workers work hard. When more workers join together, they resist the capitalist’s control more. So, the capitalist has to push back harder to keep control. This control is not just about managing work but also about exploiting workers, which causes conflict between the boss and the workers.

Also, as the amount of tools and machines owned by the capitalist grows, it becomes more important to control how these things are used. The workers’ cooperation happens because the capitalist hires them and connects their work. This connection is not the workers’ choice but the capitalist’s plan and power. To the workers, this control looks like the capitalist’s rules and orders.

The capitalist’s control has two parts because production is two things: making useful products and making profit. This control is strict and can be harsh. As more workers cooperate, this strict control changes but stays strong. Just like the capitalist stops working with their hands once they have enough money and resources, they also hire special workers to supervise and watch over the other workers.
