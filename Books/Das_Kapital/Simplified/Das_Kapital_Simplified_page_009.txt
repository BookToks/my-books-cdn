Preface to the French Edition (Marx, 1872)

Dear Maurice Lachâtre,

I really like your idea of publishing a translation of “Das Kapital” in parts. This way, more working people can read it, and that’s the most important thing to me.

But there is a downside. The way I explain things is new and not easy to understand at first. The first chapters can be hard to read. I worry that French readers, who want quick answers and want to see how ideas connect to current issues, might get frustrated because they can’t get to the main points right away.

This is a problem I can’t fix, except by warning readers who want to learn the truth. There’s no easy way to learn science, and only those who don’t mind working hard have a chance to understand it well.

Trust me, dear friend,  
Your devoted, Karl Marx  
London, March 18, 1872

Afterword to the Second German Edition (1873)

I want to tell readers of the first edition about the changes made in the second edition.
