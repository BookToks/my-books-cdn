Capital A Critique of Political Economy Volume I Book One: The Process of Production of Capital was first published in German in 1867. The English version came out in 1887.  

This version is based on the first English edition from 1887, which includes some changes from the 4th German edition. The spelling has been updated a bit to be easier to read.  

It was published by Progress Publishers in Moscow, USSR. The translation was done by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling and edited by Frederick Engels.  

The text was typed up by Zodiac, Hinrich Kuhls, Allan Thurrott, Bill McDorman, Bert Schultz, and Martha Gimenez between 1995 and 1996.  

Later, people named Andy Blunden, Chris Clayton, Mark Harris, and Dave Allinson checked it carefully for mistakes between 2008 and 2015.
