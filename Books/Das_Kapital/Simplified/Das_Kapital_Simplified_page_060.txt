Chapter 2: Exchange

It’s clear that things we buy and sell can’t go to the market and trade by themselves. So, their owners have to do it for them. Things don’t have feelings or will, so if they don’t cooperate, people can just take them by force. To trade, the owners have to agree with each other that they won’t steal the other’s stuff and will only trade when both say yes. They have to respect each other’s ownership rights. This agreement, or contract, even if it’s not part of a formal legal system, is really just two people agreeing to trade. This shows the real economic relationship between them. The people involved are just acting as owners of their things. In economics, the people we see are basically just examples of the relationships between their goods.

What makes a thing different from its owner is that the thing only sees other things as a way to show its own value. It doesn’t care what the other thing is like. The owner, however, uses their senses to understand the real worth of the thing. The owner doesn’t use their own item directly; otherwise, they wouldn’t bring it to market. The item is useful to others, but for the owner, it’s mainly a way to trade for other things they need. So, the owner wants to swap it for something useful to them. All things are useless to their owners but useful to others. That’s why things have to be traded. Trading connects things by their value and makes their value real. Things must first prove they have value before they can be useful.

At the same time, things have to show they are useful before their value can be real.

The work put into making them only counts if it helps others. Whether the work is really helpful can only be proven when the thing is traded.

Every owner only wants to trade their thing for something that they will find useful. So, trading seems like a personal deal. But they also want to get something of equal value, no matter if the other person finds their thing useful or not. From this view, trading is a social deal that affects everyone. But a trade can’t be both just a personal deal and a social one at the same time for everyone.

Let’s look closer. To an owner, every other thing is a way to measure the value of their own thing. So, their own thing is like a universal way to compare all other things.
