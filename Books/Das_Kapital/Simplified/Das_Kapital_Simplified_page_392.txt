If his work is low quality, he gets punished. If he doesn’t do enough work in the set time, he gets fired and someone better is hired. 

When work passes through many people, and only the last person actually does the job, the worker at the end gets paid way less than they should. 

Even Watts, who tries to defend the system, says it would be better if everyone working on a job shared the profits based on how good they are, instead of one person pushing others to work too hard just to make more money for himself. This system is really unfair.

Sometimes this unfairness is made worse on purpose. For example, in London’s engineering trade, they pick a strong and fast worker as the leader and pay him extra. He is supposed to push the others, who get normal pay, to keep up with him. This explains why bosses often complain that workers don’t work as hard or as skillfully as they should. The author, who is a worker and union leader, might seem biased, but even respected farming guides recommend this method to farmers.

People paid by piece-work often work overtime without extra pay. This is especially true for women who work as weavers and reelers. This system, which benefits employers, makes young pottery workers overwork themselves for several years but still get low wages. This is a big reason why many potters end up in poor health.

When workers get paid per piece, their wages can vary a lot. But when workers get paid by the day, there’s usually a steady wage rate agreed on by both bosses and workers.

Journeyman artisans get paid by the day or by the piece. Experienced masters know how much work a journeyman can do each day and pay them accordingly. So the journeymen work as much as they can because it benefits them, without needing anyone to watch over them.

Cantillon, who influenced many famous economists, said that piece-work is just a changed form of time-based pay. His English edition of his work contains more details about English business than the French one, but the claim on the title page that the work was adapted from a dead man’s manuscript is probably not true and was a common trick back then.
