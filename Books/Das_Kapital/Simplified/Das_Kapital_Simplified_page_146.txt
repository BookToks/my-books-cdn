The ability of living labor to keep value while also adding new value is something Nature gives for free. This costs the worker nothing but helps the capitalist a lot because it keeps the value of their capital safe. When business is good, the capitalist is too busy making money to notice this free gift from labor. But if there is a big problem or crisis, the capitalist suddenly realizes how important it is.

When it comes to the tools and materials used to make things, what really gets used up is their usefulness, not their value. Labor uses up this usefulness to create the product. So, the value of these tools and materials doesn’t get used up—it just shows up again in the new product. The original value isn’t made again, it’s just kept because the old thing disappears into the new product. So, in the product’s value, the value of the tools and materials appears again. But this is different for labor itself.

The worker, by doing a special kind of work, keeps and adds the value of the tools and materials to the product. At the same time, just by working, the worker creates new extra value. Imagine if the work stops right when the worker has made the same value as their own labor cost, like after six hours of work adding a value of three shillings. This extra value is the surplus value, the part of the product’s value beyond the value of the tools and materials. It’s the only original new value made during the work process. Of course, this new value just replaces the money the capitalist gave the worker to live on. So, for the money spent, the new value is just a replacement, but it’s a real replacement, not just an appearance like with the tools and materials. This happens because new value is actually created.

We also know that the work can go on longer than the time needed to just replace the worker’s labor value. Instead of six hours, the worker might work twelve hours. So, labor not only replaces its own value but also makes extra value beyond that. This extra value is the difference between the product’s value and the combined value of the tools, materials, and labor.

By explaining how the different parts of the work process create value, we understand the roles of the different parts of capital in making its value grow.

The extra value in the product, over the total value of its parts, is the extra value of the capital beyond what was first invested. The tools and materials on one side and labor on the other are just different forms the original capital takes after changing from money into parts of the work process. The part of capital made up of tools, raw materials, and instruments doesn’t change its value during production. This part is called constant capital.
