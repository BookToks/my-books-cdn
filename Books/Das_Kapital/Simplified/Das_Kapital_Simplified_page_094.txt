In Political Economy, people often make a big deal out of things that are actually pretty obvious. For example, J. B. Say thinks he can explain economic crises just because he knows that a commodity is something made by people.

Money moves through the economy in a special way, different from just circulating. When a product is sold for the last time, it stops being part of buying and selling and becomes something people use, either to live or to make other things.

Money only moves because products make it move. The faster money moves, the less you need of it. When people need money, it just passes quickly from one person to another without stopping.

Some people think that if there isn’t enough money, their goods won’t sell. But that’s not really true. The problem is usually one of three things: there might be too much of the product for the buyers available, goods aren’t being shipped out to other places, or people don’t have enough money to spend because they are poor. So, just adding more money won’t fix the problem; you have to fix these causes.

Merchants and shopkeepers face the same problem—they can’t sell their goods because the market isn’t working well. A country does best when money moves around a lot, changing hands quickly.

Some people wrongly think that if products don’t sell or money doesn’t keep moving, it’s because there isn’t enough money. But sometimes, the real problem is bad rules about money that stop it from working right.

There is a right amount of money needed for trade. Too much or too little can cause problems, just like you need the right change to buy things in a store. The amount of money needed depends on how often people buy and sell, and how big the payments are.
