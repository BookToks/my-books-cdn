So, when we say how much linen is worth compared to a coat, the coat only counts as equal to the linen in that one specific case.

But the basic way of showing value can easily change into a more complete form. At first, the value of one thing (like a coat) is only shown by comparing it to one other thing (like linen). But that other thing can be anything, like coats, iron, corn, or something else. So, depending on what you compare it to, the same thing can have many different value comparisons. The number of these comparisons depends on how many different things there are. So, one value comparison can turn into a long list of different ones.

For example, 20 yards of linen might equal 1 coat, or 10 pounds of tea, or 40 pounds of coffee, or 1 quarter of corn, or 2 ounces of gold, or half a ton of iron, and so on.

This is called the Expanded Relative form of value. Now, the value of linen is shown by comparing it to many other things. Every other commodity reflects the value of linen. This shows that the value comes from human work, no matter what kind of work it is—like tailoring, farming, mining, etc. It doesn’t matter if the work makes coats, corn, iron, or gold. Linen, because of how its value is shown, is connected to all kinds of things, not just one other thing. It is like a part of the whole world of goods. Also, it doesn’t matter what form the commodity takes; its value stays the same.

At first, when we say 20 yards of linen equals 1 coat, it might seem like a random fact that these two things can be traded in those amounts. But when we compare linen to many things, we see something deeper. The value of linen stays the same whether it’s compared to coats, coffee, or iron. The random connection between two people trading one thing for another disappears. Instead, it’s clear that the value decides how much things can be traded for, not the other way around.

Each thing, like a coat, tea, corn, or iron, acts as an equivalent when showing the value of linen. This means each thing represents value in its own special way. The different kinds of work that make these things are all just different ways human work shows up.

But the Expanded form has problems too. First, it’s never finished because new things are always being made, and each new thing adds another way to show value. This means the list of value comparisons can keep getting longer forever.
