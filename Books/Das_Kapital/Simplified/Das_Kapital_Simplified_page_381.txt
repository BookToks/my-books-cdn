If you trade a certain amount of money made by the same amount of work, then past work would trade for the same amount as present work. But the value of work compared to other things isn’t decided by equal amounts of work.

There needs to be a new agreement (like a new social contract) that whenever work is traded for more work, the boss should get more value than the worker. 

Labour is the only real measure of value and the creator of all wealth, not any product.

Some people say talking about labour as value is just a fancy way of speaking. But I say that labour is a real thing that creates value, not just a figure of speech. Society is built on labour being a commodity, so it’s not just about changing words. For example, some people say value just means what something is worth in money. That’s a simple way to explain why things like land have value—they have a price.

Later, I explain how making things based on the value of work time leads to the value of work being less than the value of what the work produces.

During the American Civil War, a newspaper complained that slaves in the South worked for nothing. But it should have looked at how much it cost to keep a slave compared to a free worker in London.

I give so you can give; I give so you can make; I make so you can give; I make so you can make.

Adam Smith only talks about changes in the workday when he mentions piece-wages.
