The second form, B, shows the difference between what a product is worth and what it’s used for better than the first form. It compares the value of a coat with things like linen, iron, or tea, but never with the coat itself. It doesn’t say what value means in general; instead, it shows each product’s value by comparing it to other things. This way of showing value only works when people often trade one product, like cattle, for many different products.

The third and final form uses one special product, linen, to show the value of everything else. Now, the value of every product is compared to linen, which makes it clear that value is different from what the product is used for. This shows what all products have in common when it comes to value.

With this form, products are truly connected as values, meaning they can be compared and exchanged based on their worth.

The first two forms show value by comparing one product to another or to many others. Each product tries to explain its value on its own, with others just acting as examples. But the third form happens because all products work together. A product’s value only makes sense when all other products show their values in the same way. Since products have value because of society, their value form must be something everyone agrees on.

When all products are compared to linen, they don’t just seem equal in value; their value amounts can also be measured against each other. For example, 10 pounds of tea equals 20 yards of linen, and 40 pounds of coffee also equals 20 yards of linen. So, 10 pounds of tea equals 40 pounds of coffee. This means 1 pound of coffee has only a quarter of the value-labor that 1 pound of tea has.

This general way of showing value makes linen the universal equivalent—it stands for the value of all products. Linen becomes the common form that all products’ values take, so it can be traded for any product. The labor that goes into making linen becomes a symbol for all kinds of work. Weaving linen, which is one kind of work, gains a social meaning because it represents the value of all types of labor. The many comparisons that make up this form show that the labor in linen equals the labor in every other product, making weaving a way to show all human labor equally.

This way, the labor behind products is shown not just as something general and abstract but also clearly as real, positive work.
