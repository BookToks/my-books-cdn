The system of protection was a way to create manufacturers, take away independent workers, and control the country’s resources and food. It forced the change from old-fashioned medieval work to modern work really fast. European countries fought each other over who invented this system first. Once they started using it to make extra profits, they made their own people pay through taxes and special trade rules. They also destroyed industries in the countries they controlled, like how England did to Ireland’s wool business.

In Europe, after Colbert’s example, the government helped build new industries by giving money directly. Mirabeau said that Saxony’s success in manufacturing before the war came from huge government debts. Things like colonies, public debts, heavy taxes, protection, and trade wars grew a lot during the early days of modern industry. The start of this new industry came with a lot of suffering. Just like the navy forced people to join, factories forced children to work. 

Sir F. M. Eden didn’t seem to care much about how farmers were pushed off their land from the late 1400s to his time. He thought this was necessary for modern farming and balancing farmland, but he didn’t understand how important stealing children and making them work was for turning small manufacturing into big factory work. He asked if any factory that needs to take poor kids from homes and work them long hours at night, while risking bad behavior, can really make people or the country happier.

In places like Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, and especially Lancashire, new machines were used in big factories by rivers to power water wheels. These factories suddenly needed thousands of workers, but these areas didn’t have many people. So they started bringing child apprentices from workhouses in London, Birmingham, and other places. Thousands of kids aged 7 to 14 were sent north. The factory owners gave the kids clothes, food, and a place to sleep in special houses near the factories. Supervisors made sure the kids worked as hard as possible because they were paid based on how much work the children did.
