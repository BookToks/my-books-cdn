The difference between them is that one buys and the other sells. The fact that the owner of goods, called the producer, sells them for more than they are worth, and the consumer pays too much, doesn’t really explain anything new. To believe that extra profit comes from prices going up or sellers charging too much, you would have to imagine a group of people who only buy and never sell—people who only consume but don’t produce.

Such a group doesn’t make sense if we only think about simple buying and selling. But let’s think ahead. The money that this group spends must come from somewhere, and it has to come from the producers’ pockets without any trade or exchange. Selling goods for more than their value to this group is just getting back some of the money that was given to them before. For example, towns in ancient Asia Minor paid money to Rome every year. Rome bought goods from these towns and paid too much. The townspeople tricked the Romans and got back some of their money through trade. But the conquered towns still lost because their goods were paid for with their own money. That’s not how you get rich or create extra profit.

So, let’s stick to a system where sellers also buy, and buyers also sell. Maybe the problem comes from thinking about these roles as types of people instead of real individuals.

Person A might be smart enough to get an advantage over B or C without them fighting back. A sells wine worth £40 to B, but gets corn worth £50 in return. A has turned £40 into £50, making more money from less and turning goods into capital. Let’s look closer. Before the trade, A had £40 worth of wine, and B had £50 worth of corn—a total of £90. After the trade, the total value is still £90. The value hasn’t grown; it just moved from B to A. What B lost is what A gained. It’s like A stole £10 from B without the trade. The total value doesn’t increase just because it’s shared differently, just like how you can’t make a country richer by selling a cheap coin for a lot of money. The whole group of capitalists in a country can’t trick themselves. No matter how you look at it, if equal things are traded, no extra profit is made, and even if unequal things are traded, no extra profit is made. Buying and selling doesn’t create value. 

This is why, when studying capital in modern society, we ignore old kinds like merchants’ capital and moneylenders’ capital.

The process of buying goods to sell them for more money is clear with real merchants. But this happens only in buying and selling. Since just trading can’t explain how money turns into capital or how extra profit is made, merchants’ capital seems impossible if equal trades happen. So, merchants only make money by taking advantage of both the sellers and buyers and acting like parasites in the middle.
