I will talk more about these laws and the new Mining Act of 1872 in Volume II.

The team in charge had 2 inspectors, 2 assistant inspectors, and 41 sub-inspectors. In 1871, they added 8 more sub-inspectors. The total cost to manage these laws in England, Scotland, and Ireland for the year 1871-72 was only £25,347, which also included legal costs from prosecuting bosses who broke the rules.

Robert Owen, who started Co-operative Factories and Stores, didn’t share some of the hopeful ideas his followers had. He focused on the factory system and believed it was the starting point for social change. Herr Vissering, a professor from the University of Leyden, seemed to disagree. In his book from 1860-62, he supported handmade crafts instead of factories.

[Added later — The confusing and conflicting English laws about factories and workshops became too much. So, all these laws were combined into the Factory and Workshop Act of 1878. I can’t go into all the details here, but here are some key points:

1) Textile Mills: Children over 10 could work 5½ hours a day or 6 hours with Saturday off. Young people and women worked 10 hours for 5 days and up to 6½ hours on Saturday.

2) Non-Textile Factories: The rules here were made closer to those for textile mills but still had some exceptions that helped factory owners, sometimes with special permission.

3) Workshops: These were similar to non-textile factories when it came to rules for children, young workers, and women, but some details were easier.

4) Workshops with only adults over 18 had even easier rules.

5) Family Workshops: These had the loosest rules. Inspectors could only check rooms not used for living, and family members had almost complete freedom to work on things like straw-plaiting, lace, and glove-making.

Even with its flaws, this Act, along with the Swiss Factory Law of 1877, was the best law of its kind. Comparing the two shows the good and bad sides of English and continental ways of making laws. The English laws changed when needed, while the continental laws were based on bigger general ideas from the French Revolution. Sadly, because there weren’t enough inspectors, the English law wasn’t always properly enforced in workshops. — F. E.]

David Urquhart once said, “You split people into two groups: rude, uneducated farmers and weak, powerless city workers. How crazy is that? A country divided between farming and business, calling itself smart and civilized, but actually made worse by this unnatural split.” This quote shows both the strength and weakness of this kind of criticism—it can judge and criticize the present but doesn’t really understand it.
