In some factories, even though they have stopped working at night regularly, workers are still forced to work way too much. This happens especially in the dirtiest, hottest, and most boring jobs.

People today like to think they have good reasons for everything, even if those reasons are crazy or bad. Many bad things have been done because people thought they had good reasons for them.

Glass factory owners say children can't have regular meal times because it would waste heat from the furnaces. But Commissioner White says that losing some heat is not as bad as making kids work without enough time to eat and rest.

In 1865, kids in glass factories walked 15-20 miles every 6 hours while working, and their shifts could last 14 or 15 hours! They only got about 6 hours of rest during the workweek, and even that included time for traveling, washing, dressing, and eating. So, they barely had any real rest or time to play.

Some boys worked for 36 hours straight. Others worked until 2 a.m. and only got 3 hours of sleep before starting again. The amount of work done by boys, girls, and women was unbelievable.

Meanwhile, rich factory owners would get drunk and say things like, “Britons never, never shall be slaves!” even though they were making others work like slaves.

In England, some workers even go to jail for working in their garden on Sundays because it’s against the rules. But if they skip work on Sunday for religious reasons, they get punished for breaking their contract.

In 1863, London day-laborers who worked in fish and poultry shops said they worked 15 hours a day for six days, and 8-10 hours on Sundays. Some rich, hypocritical people actually want workers to keep working on Sundays. They act very religious but don’t care about the workers’ hunger and exhaustion.
