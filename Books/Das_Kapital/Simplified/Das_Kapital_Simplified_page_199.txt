The French chemist Chevallier wrote about how many products are often mixed with other things to make them look better or cheaper. He found 10, 20, or even 30 different ways people trick buyers in over 600 products. He also said that he didn’t know all the ways and didn’t mention everything he did know.

For example, he listed 6 ways sugar can be messed with, 9 ways for olive oil, 10 for butter, 12 for salt, 19 for milk, 20 for bread, 23 for brandy, 24 for meal, 28 for chocolate, 30 for wine, and 32 for coffee. Even things used in religious ceremonies aren’t safe from this trickery.

In the late 1600s and early 1700s, agents who sold goods in many trades were seen as a big problem. People called them “public nuisances” because they hurt the clothing business and should be stopped.

In the 1860s, farm workers in Scotland and England started to form unions and fight for better pay after many years of being oppressed. For example, in Buckinghamshire in 1867, workers went on strike to raise their weekly wages from 9-10 shillings to 12 shillings. This was an important moment in their struggle for rights.

At the same time, railway workers were working extremely long hours without enough rest, which caused many accidents. One worker shared how he sometimes worked over 29 hours straight with hardly any breaks and ended up working around 88 hours in a week but was only paid for about six and a quarter days. This showed how unfair and dangerous their working conditions were.
