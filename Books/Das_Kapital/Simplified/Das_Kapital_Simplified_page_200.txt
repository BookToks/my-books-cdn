Thinking it might be a mistake, he asked the time-keeper what counted as a day’s work. He was told it was 13 hours for a goods man, which means 78 hours a week.  

He then asked if he could get paid for the extra hours he worked beyond 78 per week, but they said no. In the end, they agreed to give him a little more money, about a quarter more, which was 10 pence.

Dr. Letheby, a health expert, said that each adult should have at least 300 cubic feet of air in their bedroom and 500 cubic feet in their living room. Dr. Richardson, a hospital doctor, explained that women who sew for a living face three big problems: too much work, not enough fresh air, and either not enough food or problems digesting it.

He said sewing is better for women than men, but big bosses control the trade and make workers work as hard as possible to save money. If a dressmaker has a few customers, she has to work super hard at home to keep them, and if she hires help, those helpers have to work just as much. If she can’t succeed on her own, she has to work for a company where she still works a lot but at least gets paid safely.  

These women become like slaves, always struggling. Sometimes they’re starving at home in one small room, sometimes working 15 to 18 hours a day in bad air, and eating food that’s hard to digest without fresh air. This bad situation causes diseases like consumption, which happens because of poor air quality.

In 1863, a newspaper called The Times used this situation to defend American slave owners by saying that in England, working women were treated so badly with hunger instead of whips. Another paper, The Standard, criticized a preacher for speaking against slave owners but supporting people who made London workers work 16 hours a day for very little pay.

Thomas Carlyle, a famous writer, made a point that the American Civil War was like two sides fighting because one hired workers by the day and the other by their whole life—meaning slavery.  

So, people’s fake sympathy for city workers, but not country workers, finally disappeared. The result was clear: it was all like slavery.

A report from 1864 said that in places like Staffordshire and South Wales, young girls and women worked at coal mines and coke factories both day and night. This was often reported to Parliament as very harmful.

These women worked alongside men, dressed similarly and covered in dirt and smoke. This kind of work hurt their self-respect and changed their character because it was seen as unfeminine. The same happened in glass factories.
