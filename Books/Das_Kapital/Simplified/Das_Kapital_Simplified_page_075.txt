When you sell something, it's just the first step in a process that ends with buying something else, like a Bible. On the other hand, when you buy linen, it finishes a process that started with selling wheat. The first part, selling linen for money, is also the last part of another process, buying linen with money. So, when one thing changes from a product to money, that money is also changing back into a product again. This is called buying.

The second change happens when money turns back into a product. Money is special because it comes from all other products, so it can be used to buy anything without limits. Every product has a price that shows how much money it can be turned into. But when money changes hands, you can’t tell what it was before; it doesn’t matter where the money came from. Money represents both a product that was sold and one that will be bought. Buying something is also selling something else. For example, if a weaver sells linen for £2 and buys a Bible, his linen is gone, but the Bible is now his product. If the Bible seller uses the £2 to buy brandy, that is also part of the same process. People usually sell one kind of product but use the money to buy many different things. So, selling one product leads to many purchases of other products.

When we look at the whole process of a product changing hands, we see two opposite but connected actions: selling (commodity to money) and buying (money to commodity).

These two opposite actions happen because of two social roles. When you sell, you are a seller; when you buy, you are a buyer. Every seller has a buyer, and every buyer has a seller. When a product changes into money and then into another product, the owner switches roles from seller to buyer. So, being a seller or buyer isn’t permanent; people do both at different times.

The whole process of a product changing hands has four key steps and involves three people. First, the product meets money, which shows its value and is held by the buyer. The product owner meets the money owner. Once the product turns into money, that money is temporary and can be used to get other products. Money ends the first step and starts the second.
