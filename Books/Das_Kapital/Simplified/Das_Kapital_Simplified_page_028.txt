Let’s think about two things, like corn and iron. No matter how much corn you trade for iron, you can always write it as an equation: for example, 1 quarter of corn equals x amount of iron.

What does this equation mean? It shows that there is something equal in both 1 quarter of corn and x amount of iron. So, both must be equal to a third thing, which is not corn or iron itself. This means their value can be compared using this third thing.

Here’s an easy example. When you want to find the area of shapes, you break them into triangles. The area of a triangle isn’t about its shape but about half the base times the height. In the same way, the value of things like corn and iron must be measured by something they both share, just in different amounts.

This shared “something” isn’t about their shape, chemistry, or natural features. Those things matter only because they make the items useful, or “use values.” But trading stuff ignores usefulness. One useful thing is as good as another if their values are equal. Like old Barbon said, “a hundred pounds of lead or iron is worth just as much as a hundred pounds of silver or gold.” When you look at usefulness, things are different, but when you look at exchange value, they’re just amounts, not usefulness.

If we don’t think about usefulness, all these things have one thing in common: they are made by human work. But we also ignore the kinds of work or the material the product is made of. We don’t see a table, house, or yarn anymore. We don’t think about joiners or spinners. All that’s left is human work in general.

So, what’s left in each product is just the same thing: human work, but without caring how the work was done. These things tell us that human effort was used to make them.

When we think of them as made of this shared human work, we call that their Value.

We saw that when things are traded, their exchange value shows up separately from usefulness. If we ignore usefulness, what remains is their Value. The shared thing behind their exchange value is their value. Later, we’ll learn that exchange value is how value shows itself. But for now, we’re just thinking about what value really is.
