Force is what helps old societies give birth to new ones. It is also connected to money and power.

About the Christian colonial system, W. Howitt, who studies Christianity, says: “The terrible and cruel actions of the so-called Christian race, everywhere they went and over every people they controlled, are worse than those of any other group, no matter how wild or merciless, in history.” The Dutch colonial rule in the 1600s was full of lies, bribery, killings, and cruelty. A big part of their system was stealing people to sell as slaves in Java. They trained people to steal others. The thief, the translator, and the seller were the main people involved, and local leaders helped sell people too. Young people who were stolen were put in secret prisons in Celebes until they were sent away on slave ships. An official report said: “The town of Macassar is full of secret prisons, each worse than the last, packed with unlucky victims chained up and taken from their families.” To take over Malacca, the Dutch bribed the Portuguese governor. He let them in in 1641, but they quickly killed him so they wouldn’t have to pay him for his betrayal. Wherever the Dutch went, they caused destruction and made people leave.

Banjuwangi, a part of Java, had over 80,000 people in 1750 but only 18,000 in 1811.

Sweet trade!

The English East India Company controlled India’s government and had exclusive rights to the tea trade, the trade with China, and shipping goods to Europe. But the local trade in India and between islands was controlled by the company’s top workers.

They also controlled salt, opium, betel, and other products, which made them a lot of money.

The workers set prices and stole from the poor Indian people. The Governor-General was part of this shady business. His favorites got contracts that let them make huge amounts of money out of nothing. Rich people got rich very fast without investing anything. The trial of Warren Hastings shows many such cases. For example, a contract for selling opium was given to a man named Sullivan when he was going on a trip far from where opium was grown. Sullivan sold his contract to Binn for £40,000. Binn sold it the same day for £60,000. The final buyer said he still made a huge profit. One list shown to Parliament said the Company and its workers got £6,000,000 from Indians as gifts between 1757 and 1766. In 1769-1770, the English caused a famine by buying all the rice and only selling it at crazy high prices. The way native people were treated was especially terrible in places like the West Indies, which were used only for exporting goods, and in rich countries like Mexico and India that were robbed for their resources. Even in proper colonies, the Christian attitude during this time was very harsh. The Puritans of New England, strict Protestants, in 1703 put a reward of £40 on every Indian scalp or captured native. In 1720, this reward went up to £100 per scalp. In 1744, after Massachusetts-Bay called a tribe rebels, they offered £100 for the scalp of any male 12 or older, £105 for male prisoners, and £50 for women and children prisoners or scalps.
