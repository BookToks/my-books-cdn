So, even though capitalism might seem to go against the original rules of how things are bought and sold, it actually follows those rules exactly. Let’s explain this by looking at the steps that lead to capitalism growing richer.

First, turning money into capital happens by following the rules of trading. One person sells their ability to work, and the other buys it. The worker gets paid for their labor, but the buyer now owns the worker’s effort. The buyer also uses their own tools and materials to make a new product that belongs to them.

The value of this new product includes the value of the tools and materials used up. Work can’t happen without using these things, and their value gets added to the product. The worker’s ability to work must be useful for the kind of job they do.

The product’s value also includes the amount paid for the worker’s labor plus extra value, called surplus-value. This happens because the worker creates more value during their work than they get paid for. The worker is paid fairly for their labor ability, but that labor actually creates more value than the payment.

The fact that labor-power is special because it creates value doesn’t change the basic rules of buying and selling goods. If the product’s value is more than what the worker was paid, it’s not because the worker was cheated—they got paid the value of their labor. The extra value comes from the fact that the buyer used the labor.

The rule of exchange only cares that the things traded have the same value. It doesn’t care about the usefulness of the things or what happens after the trade is done.

So, turning money into capital follows the economic rules exactly and respects property rights.

But the outcome is: (1) the product belongs to the capitalist, not the worker; (2) the product’s value includes the original capital and extra value created by the worker’s labor, which costs the capitalist nothing but becomes their property; (3) the worker still owns their ability to work and can sell it again if they find someone to buy it.

Simple reproduction means repeating this process again and again, turning money into capital each time. The rules aren’t broken; they just keep working over and over. As Sismondi said, several trades just make the last one represent the first.

Still, simple reproduction changes the meaning of this process. Workers earn their share every year by working, but capitalists already have a permanent right to their share because of work done earlier.
