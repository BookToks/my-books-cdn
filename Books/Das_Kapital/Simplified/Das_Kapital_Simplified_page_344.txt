Ricardo explains that landlords and capitalists, who own most of the countryâ€™s wealth, can make workers unnecessary and make their lives worse.

The main goal of new machines is to replace human work completely or to lower wages by using women, children, or less skilled workers instead of skilled men.

For example, machines used in brick-making allow employers to stop relying on skilled workers. Mr. A. Sturrock, who works with trains, says expensive skilled workers are used less and less because better tools let less skilled workers do the job.

Before, skilled workers made all engine parts by hand. Now, parts are made by less skilled workers using machines like lathes and drills.

During a crisis, fast improvements in machines helped English factories flood the world with cheap goods after the American Civil War. In late 1866, cloth was very hard to sell.

To fix this, factories sent goods to India and China, which made the problem worse. In early 1867, factory owners tried to cut wages by 5%, but workers protested and said it would be better to work fewer days instead.

After some time, factory bosses agreed to shorter workweeks, sometimes with lower pay and sometimes not.

In the glass industry, workers often went on strike, so companies started using machines to make pressed glass instead of the old blown-glass methods. One factory in Newcastle went from making 350,000 pounds of blown glass to 3,000,500 pounds of pressed glass.

W. Fairbairn found new ways to use machines to build other machines because of strikes at his workshops.

Ricardo once agreed with some ideas about machines but later changed his mind because he cared about being honest and scientific.

This example follows what other economists have said before.
