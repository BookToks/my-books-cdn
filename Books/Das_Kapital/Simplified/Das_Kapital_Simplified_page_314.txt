Outside the factory, workshop, and warehouse, there are workers called domestic workers. Their jobs are not steady, and they depend completely on the boss for materials and work orders. The boss doesn’t worry about damaging buildings or machines, and he only risks losing the worker’s health if work stops. So, the boss keeps a backup group of workers ready to work anytime. For part of the year, he makes them work super hard, and for the rest of the year, he lets them starve because there’s no work.

The bosses take advantage of this irregular work. When they need extra work done quickly, workers have to stay late—sometimes until 11 p.m., midnight, or even 2 a.m. This happens in places so dirty and smelly that it’s hard to even go inside. One shoemaker said the bosses think it’s okay to make a boy work too hard for half the year if he’s almost not working the other half.

Bosses often say that the way work is done or old habits make these problems normal and impossible to change. For example, cotton factory owners used this excuse when laws were first made to protect workers. But experience proved this wrong. Factory inspectors found these excuses were fake. The Children’s Employment Commission showed that rules about work hours actually helped spread work more evenly throughout the year. These rules stopped the crazy ups and downs caused by fashion trends, which don’t fit well with modern industry. With better ships and communication, the old reasons for seasonal work disappeared. Bigger buildings, more machines, and more workers changed how trade worked. Still, bosses don’t like these changes and only agree to them when the government forces them with laws.

Section 9: The Factory Acts also include rules about workers’ health and education, not just work hours. Factory laws were society’s first serious way of controlling how production worked, just like cotton yarn, machines, and the telegraph are products of modern industry.

Before talking about how these laws spread in England, it’s important to look at some parts of the Factory Acts that don’t deal with work hours.

These health rules are very weak and mostly just say walls must be whitewashed, places kept clean, rooms ventilated, and workers protected from dangerous machines. Later, we will see how strongly bosses fought against spending even a little money to protect workers’ limbs. This fight shows how the idea that everyone’s selfishness helps society really doesn’t work when people’s interests clash.
