John Stuart Mill, using his usual mixed way of thinking, manages to hold both his father James Mill’s views and the opposite ideas at the same time. When we compare his book “Principles of Political Economy” with his introduction to the first edition, where he calls himself the Adam Smith of his time, it’s hard to know whether to admire his simplicity or the public’s, who really believed him. Even though he said this, he’s about as similar to Adam Smith as General Williams of Kars is to the Duke of Wellington. Mill’s own research in Political Economy isn’t very deep or wide, and you can find most of it collected in his small book “Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy” from 1844.

Locke clearly says that gold and silver don’t have real value on their own, and their value depends only on how much there is. He explains that people agreed to give gold and silver an imaginary value, so their real value is just about quantity. I won’t go into details like the cost of minting coins, but I want to share what Sir Dudley North said for those who admire how the English Government coins money for free. North explains that silver and gold prices go up and down. When lots of silver comes from Spain, it’s taken to the Tower and made into coins. Later, if there’s a need to export silver but only coins are available, they just melt the coins back down. This doesn’t cause any loss because minting is free. But this means the country loses out by paying for something useless. North says that if merchants had to pay for minting, they wouldn’t just send silver to be made into coins without thinking, and coins would always be worth more than silver that isn’t made into coins. North was a top merchant during King Charles II’s time.

If there is only enough silver to pay for small purchases, it can’t be saved up for bigger payments. Using gold for big payments means gold is also used for small ones. People pay with gold coins for small things and get silver back as change. This way, extra silver doesn’t pile up with small sellers but spreads out into general use. But if there’s enough silver to handle small payments without gold, small sellers have to accept only silver, which means silver builds up with them. (This idea comes from David Buchanan’s book about British taxes and trade from 1844.)

A Chinese official named Wan-mao-in once proposed to the Emperor that the empire’s paper money should be made into bank-notes that could be exchanged for real money. But a committee in 1854 gave him a harsh rejection, saying his plan only helped merchants and didn’t benefit the emperor. It’s not clear if he also got punished in other ways. A governor of the Bank of England said in 1848 that gold coins lose weight every year because of wear and tear. Coins that were full weight one year get lighter and lighter over time.

Fullarton, another writer, shows how even smart people can get confused about money. He says that for local trade, all the jobs that gold and silver coins do can be done just as well by paper notes that don’t have real value but are accepted because the law says so.
