The list of documents collected by this group can be found in the catalogue of the “Twickenham Economic Museum.” The official “Reports on Public Health” are very important. Also, check out Eduard Reich, M. D.’s book “On the Degeneration of Humans,” published in Erlangen in 1868.

Hegel had some unusual ideas about division of labor. In his book “Rechtsphilosophie,” he said that well-educated people are those who can do everything others can do. Nowadays, only some German professors, like Herr Roscher, believe that individual capitalists are the creative geniuses behind division of labor. He even gives the capitalist different kinds of wages for this. But really, how much division of labor is used depends more on how much money someone has, not on how smart they are.

Older writers like Petty and the unknown author of “Advantages of the East India Trade” talked about how division of labor shows the capitalist side of manufacturing even more than Adam Smith did.

Among modern writers, a few from the 18th century, like Beccaria and James Harris, mostly followed the old ideas about division of labor. Beccaria said that if people keep using their hands and brains on the same kind of work, they can make things easier, better, and faster than if everyone made everything for themselves. This way, people are divided into different groups and jobs, which helps both themselves and society.

James Harris, who later became Earl of Malmesbury and was known for his “Diaries” from his time as an ambassador in St. Petersburg, said the whole idea that society is natural because of division of jobs comes from Plato’s “Republic.” This idea also goes back to ancient texts like the “Odyssey,” where it’s said that different people enjoy different kinds of work.

Every Athenian thought they were better at making things than a Spartan because Spartans had more soldiers but less money. Pericles said that people who produce for themselves would rather fight with their bodies than spend money on war. Still, even for making things, being self-sufficient and not relying on others was the ideal for Spartans. It’s worth noting that when the 30 Tyrants fell, almost all Athenians still owned land.

Plato believed that division of labor happens because people have many different needs and limited abilities. For him, the important thing was that workers should fit the job, not the other way around. If a worker tries to do many jobs at once, some will always suffer.
