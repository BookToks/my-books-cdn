He always notices that there are still peasants around, but fewer than before and living in worse conditions. This happens because England switches between mainly growing crops and mainly raising animals, which changes how many peasants work the land.

Modern industry, especially machines, is the main reason for this. It takes away land and jobs from most farm workers and breaks the connection between farming and small local crafts like spinning and weaving.

Because of this, industry takes over the whole home market for the first time.

Some people back then, like Sir James Steuart, pointed out these changes. The capitalist would say that workers should be happy to serve him, even if they get very little in return.

Mirabeau thought small workshops were better than big factories, but this was because of how things worked in Europe at the time.

David Urquhart explained how wool made quietly by a family seems small, but when it goes to the market and through factories, it creates huge business and involves a lot of money. This system forces workers to support poor factory workers, shopkeepers, and a complicated money system.

During Cromwell’s time, things were different because people from all classes improved their lives compared to the hard times under the Tudors.

Tuckett knew that the modern wool industry grew from machines destroying small rural industries.

Urquhart said that farming tools like the plough and tools for weaving were once noble inventions. But when you separate farming from weaving and spinning, you get factories, poorhouses, and two opposing groups: farmers and merchants.

Carey argued that England tries to make other countries only farm, while England becomes the manufacturer. He said this ruined countries like Turkey because landowners there couldn’t grow strong by combining farming and making goods. Carey even blamed Urquhart for hurting Turkey by promoting free trade for England’s benefit. Interestingly, Carey, who liked Russia, wanted to stop this separation by using protectionism, which actually makes it worse.

Kind people like Mill, Rogers, and Goldwin Smith asked where all the small landowners went. But they came from destroying those small landowners in the first place. They should also ask what happened to the independent weavers, spinners, and craftsmen.
