Sir John Kincaid, a factory inspector in Scotland, shares some stories he experienced.

The first school he visited was run by a Mrs. Ann Killin. When he asked her to spell her name, she made a mistake at first, starting with a C. Then she corrected herself and said it started with a K. But when he looked at her signature in the school books, he saw she spelled her name in different ways. Her handwriting showed she wasn’t really fit to be a teacher.

Mrs. Killin also admitted that she couldn’t keep the register properly. In another school, the room was only 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, but there were 75 children inside, all making noise and speaking in a way he couldn’t understand.

But it’s not just in these bad schools where kids get certificates for going to school without learning much. Even in schools with good teachers, their work doesn’t help much because the room is crowded with kids of all ages, from 3 years old and up. The teachers get paid very little, so they try to fit as many kids as possible into the space.

These schools also don’t have enough furniture, books, or supplies. The air is stuffy and smelly, which makes it hard for the kids to learn. Sir John saw many kids just sitting and doing nothing, but they were still marked as attending school and counted as educated in official reports.

In Scotland, factory owners try hard to avoid hiring kids who have to go to school.

This shows that the rules in the Factory Act, which are supposed to help kids get education while working, don’t really work because factory owners don’t like those rules. It’s even worse in print factories, which have special laws.

According to the law, every child working in a print factory must have gone to school for at least 30 days and 150 hours in the six months before starting work. While working in the factory, they must also go to school for the same amount of time every six months. School hours should be between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., and only days with at least 2½ hours but no more than 5 hours count.

Usually, kids go to school for 5 hours in the morning and afternoon for 30 days. After finishing these hours, they say they’ve “made up their book” and go back to work in the print factory until six months are up. Then they have to go back to school to earn more hours and “make up their book” again.

Many boys who go back to school after working six months are in the same state as when they first started—they have lost everything they learned before.
