Near Market Harboro, there is a big sheep farm about 500 acres in size, but only one man works there. To make it easier for the shepherd to avoid walking long distances across the wide fields, he used to get a cottage on the farm. Now, instead of a cottage, they give him a small amount of money each week for a place to stay, but he has to find this lodging far away in a nearby village.

The houses for farm workers in these open villages are usually built in long rows, very close together. Because of this, they only get light and fresh air from the front, not from the back. Often, the village shopkeeper or pub owner also controls the houses. This means the farm worker has two bosses: the farmer and the shopkeeper. The worker, earning just 10 shillings a week but paying about £4 a year in rent, must buy things like tea, sugar, flour, soap, candles, and beer at the shopkeeper’s prices.

These open villages are like punishment places for farm workers. Many cottages are just cheap places where lots of people come and go. The farm workers and their families, who used to keep a good character even in tough times, often fall into bad habits here. Rich landowners act like they don’t care about these villages, but they know their own fancy villages depend on the poor ones. Without small landowners, most workers wouldn’t even have a place to sleep except under trees on the farms.

The farmer makes money by paying the worker 10 shillings a week but charging him £4 or £5 a year in rent for houses that aren’t worth much. The farmer can force the worker to live in his house or leave without a good reference. If a worker wants to change jobs to something better, like working on the railway or in a quarry, the farmer can threaten to fire him and make him take his belongings and leave quickly. Sometimes the farmer even raises the rent if the worker decides to leave.

Newly married couples in these villages often have a hard time, and sometimes the women suffer serious problems. A rural policeman who worked in bad parts of London said the girls in his village were very bold and shameless, worse than anything he saw in the city. Many families live crowded together, with parents and children all sharing one room.

Farm work is important and gives the worker dignity. He is not a slave but like a soldier of peace, and deserves a place to live provided by the landlord. Like soldiers, farm workers often start young, know only their trade and village, and are tied to the land by laws. Sometimes, a kind landlord feels sorry for the loneliness caused by this system.

Lord Leicester once said it is sad to stand alone in the countryside, showing how lonely life can be for these workers.
