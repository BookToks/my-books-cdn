One rich business owner always pushes out many others. Along with this, big companies take over smaller ones, and work becomes more cooperative. Science and technology get used more carefully and skillfully. Farming gets done in a better, more organized way. Tools and machines become things that can only be used together by many people. All production is done as a combined social effort. People and countries all over the world get connected through trade, making capitalism a global system.

As the number of rich capitalists gets smaller and smaller, more and more people suffer from poverty, unfair treatment, slavery, and being taken advantage of. But at the same time, more workers get angry and start to fight back. These workers grow in number and become organized and united because of how capitalism works. The control of wealth by a few rich people starts to hold back the way things are made and produced. Eventually, the way production is controlled and the way people work together don’t fit with the capitalist system anymore. This system breaks apart. Private ownership by rich individuals ends. The rich people who took everything from others get their wealth taken away.

The capitalist way of owning things comes from the capitalist way of making things. This creates private property owned by the rich, which replaces the old idea of private property that was based on a person’s own work. But capitalism also creates its own opposite, like a natural law. This opposite doesn’t give workers back private property in the old way, but gives them their own property based on working together and sharing land and tools.

Changing scattered private property, made by individual work, into capitalist private property takes a long time and is hard and violent. Changing capitalist private property, which already depends on social work, into property owned by everyone is easier. The first change took many people’s land away and gave it to a few rich people. The second change will take land and wealth away from a few rich people and give it back to the many.

Industry grows because of the middle class, but it also forces workers to come together and fight back. Modern industry destroys the basis of how the rich make and keep their wealth. What the rich really create is the people who will bring them down. The fall of the rich and the victory of workers are certain. Of all the groups fighting the rich today, only the workers are truly revolutionary. Other groups, like small business owners, shopkeepers, and farmers, fight to keep their place in the middle class and try to stop progress. They want to go back, not forward.
