The third law says that if the amount of extra value (surplus-value) changes, it means the value of workers’ labour power has changed. This happens because workers become more productive. The biggest change can’t be more than the new value of labour power.

But sometimes, other things can happen at the same time. For example, if workers become more productive and the value of their labour power drops from 4 shillings to 3, or the time they need to work for basic needs drops from 8 hours to 6, the actual price paid for labour power might not drop all the way to 3 shillings. It might only go down to 3 shillings 8 pence, 3 shillings 6 pence, or 3 shillings 2 pence. This means the extra value doesn’t go up as much as you might expect. How far the price falls depends on how much pressure the bosses put on workers and how much the workers can resist.

The value of labour power depends on how much basic stuff workers need to live. It’s the value, not the amount, of these things that changes when workers become more productive. Sometimes, because workers are more productive, both workers and bosses can get more of these basic things without changing the price of labour power or the extra value made. 

For example, if labour power is worth 3 shillings and workers need to work 6 hours for what they need, and the extra value is also 3 shillings with 6 hours of extra work, then if productivity doubles but the balance of work stays the same, the price and extra value won’t change. But now, both represent twice as many things as before, and those things are cheaper. So even if the price of labour power stays the same, workers actually get more value.

If the price of labour power drops to 2 shillings 10 pence or 2 shillings 6 pence (but not as low as 1 shilling 6 pence, which is the lowest it can go), workers still get more stuff for less money. So, with higher productivity, labour power’s price can keep falling while workers’ living stuff grows. But even then, the drop in labour power’s value means the extra value goes up, making the gap between bosses and workers bigger.

Ricardo was the first to explain these three laws clearly. But he made some mistakes: (1) he thought these special situations were always true in capitalist production. He didn’t consider changes in work hours or how hard people work, so he only saw productivity as the changing factor; (2) and this mistake was worse, he didn’t study surplus-value by itself, separate from things like profit or rent. So he mixed up the rules for the rate of surplus-value with the rules for the rate of profit.

The rate of profit is the ratio of extra value to all the money invested, while the rate of surplus-value is the ratio of extra value to just the money spent on wages.

For example, say you have £500 capital. £400 is for materials and tools, and £100 is for wages. If the extra value is £100, then the rate of surplus-value is £100 divided by £100, which is 100%. But the rate of profit is £100 divided by £500, which is 20%. 

Also, the rate of profit can change because of things that don’t affect the rate of surplus-value. I will explain in Book III that with the same rate of surplus-value, you can get many different rates of profit, and with different rates of surplus-value, you can still get the same rate of profit.
