In 1859, Kent Kennington was very crowded. When diphtheria appeared, the local doctor started checking on the health of poor people. He found that many small homes had been destroyed and no new ones were built.

In one area, there were four small houses called birdcages. Each house had four rooms with these sizes: Kitchen about 9 by 9 feet, Scullery about 8 by 4 feet, and two bedrooms about 8 by 6 feet each.

In some villages in Northamptonshire like Brinworth, Pickford, and Floore, 20 to 30 men were hanging around in winter because there was no work. Farmers didn’t always grow enough crops, and the landlord combined many farms into just two or three. So, there were fewer jobs. While one side of the farm needed workers, the people who wanted work could only watch. They worked hard in summer but were almost starving in winter. They said in their own way, “the parson and rich people don’t care about us.” In Floore, tiny bedrooms held big families, like couples with 4 to 6 kids, or groups with many adults and children, some sick with scarlet fever.

In Wiltshire, at Stratton, 31 houses were checked, and 8 had only one bedroom. In Pentill, a small home was rented for just over one shilling a week. Four adults and four kids lived there, but it was in bad shape, with rough stone floors and a worn-out thatched roof.

In Worcestershire, fewer houses were destroyed compared to before, but from 1851 to 1861, the number of people living in each house went up from 4.2 to 4.6 on average.

In Badsey, there were many small homes and gardens. Some farmers said these homes were a problem because they brought poor people. One man said, “The poor don’t get better from these homes; if you build 500 houses, people will still want more.” He thought houses create more people, and they all need places to live. Dr. Hunter said, “These poor people must come from somewhere else. There’s no special help here, so they must be pushed out from worse places. If they had small gardens near their work, they wouldn’t choose Badsey, where land costs more than for farmers.”

More and more people were moving to towns. Farms were getting bigger and fewer, fields were turned into pastures, machines were used more, and many farm workers were kicked out when their homes were destroyed. The emptier the countryside became, the more people were crowded into small spaces. This caused serious problems with too many people and not enough homes or jobs in the villages.
