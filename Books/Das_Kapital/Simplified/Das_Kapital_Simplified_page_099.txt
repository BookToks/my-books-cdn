Chapter 3

When a country suddenly stops using credit and switches back to using only cash, it causes a lot of fear on top of the real problems people are already facing. The people who handle money and trade get really worried because they don’t understand how everything fits together anymore. 

The poor don’t move forward because the rich don’t have money to hire them, even though the land and workers are still there to grow food and make clothes. That’s the real wealth of a country, not just money.

Sometimes, during tough times, some businesspeople take advantage of the situation. For example, in 1839, an old banker showed a friend a huge stack of banknotes worth £600,000. He was happy because the money was being kept back to make cash harder to get, but he said it would all be spent later that same day. 

In 1864, a newspaper wrote about strange rumors that people were trying to make banknotes scarce on purpose. Even though it seemed unlikely, the rumors were so common they had to be mentioned.

The amount of buying or contracts happening on any day doesn’t change how much money is actually available that day. Instead, most deals depend on money that will be available later, sometimes months from now. Many of today’s bills and credits add up with older debts from different times, all piling into one day’s total.

To show how little actual cash is needed for big business, here’s a summary from a big London company’s money coming in and going out in one year (1856), scaled down to one million pounds:

They received £1,000,000 and paid out £1,000,000, but most of this wasn’t cash. It included things like checks, bills to pay later, banknotes, gold, silver, and even post office orders.

Trade changed from swapping goods for goods to buying and selling everything with money. Now, prices are always stated in money.

Money has become like a cruel force that destroys a lot of goods and products just to create itself. It’s said that money is like a war declared against all people.

On a busy day in 1824, there was such a huge demand for banknotes in Edinburgh that by 11 o’clock, the banks had run out of notes to give.
