Co-operation is the basic way that capitalism works, but simple forms of working together still exist alongside more advanced ways in this system.

There’s definitely a difference in how much work one person can do compared to another, depending on things like strength, skill, and effort. But if you look at any group of five people, together they’ll usually produce about the same amount of work as any other group of five people their age. In a group of five, you’ll usually find one really good worker, one bad one, and three who are in the middle. So even in a small group, you get a mix of skill levels.

Professor Roscher said that one woman sewing for two days does more work than two women sewing together for one day. But he shouldn’t study capitalism in a situation like a nursery, or in places where the main boss, the capitalist, isn’t there.

There are lots of simple jobs that can’t be split up and require many people to work together at the same time. For example, lifting a big tree onto a cart needs many people helping each other all at once.

If one person can’t lift a heavy weight, ten people will have to work really hard to do it, and even 100 people can only lift it with just a little strength from each of them.

Also, when one farmer hires the same number of workers to work on a big farm instead of spreading them across many small farms, it works better. During busy times like harvest, having many workers all working together in the same place lets the job get done faster than if they were split up.

Aristotle said that people are naturally citizens of towns, which was true for ancient times, just like Benjamin Franklin’s idea that humans are tool-makers fits his own culture.

It’s important to notice that even when workers are doing the same job, there can still be a kind of teamwork. For example, masons passing bricks up to a higher level on a building are all doing the same task, but they divide the work by each passing the brick a little further along. This way, together they can get the bricks up much faster than if each mason carried their own brick all the way up alone.
