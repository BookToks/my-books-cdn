Chapter 33: The Modern Theory of Colonisation

Political economy mixes up two very different kinds of private property. One kind is based on the worker’s own effort, and the other depends on using other people’s work. It forgets that the second kind actually only grows by destroying the first.

In Western Europe, where political economy started, this early stage of building capitalism is mostly finished. Here, the capitalist system has either taken over the whole production process or, where things are less developed, it still controls parts of society that belong to old ways of working, which are slowly dying out.

Political economists use old ideas about law and property from before capitalism to explain this ready-made capitalist world. They do this even more strongly when the facts don’t fit their ideas.

But in the colonies, things are different. The capitalist system runs into resistance from producers who own their own work tools and use their labor to better themselves, not the capitalist. This clash between two totally different economic systems shows up as a real fight.

Where the capitalist has the support of the home country, he tries to force out the old ways where producers work independently. The same reason that makes political economists in the home country say capitalism and its opposite are basically the same, makes them admit in the colonies that these two systems are actually enemies.

To prove this, they show that things like working together, dividing tasks, and using machines on a big scale can only happen if workers are kicked off their land and their tools are turned into capital. For the so-called national wealth, they look for ways to keep people poor on purpose.

Here, their excuses fall apart like dry wood. E.G. Wakefield’s big contribution was not finding something new about the colonies, but showing that the colonies reveal the truth about capitalism in the home country.

Just like early protectionist policies tried to make capitalists in the home country, Wakefield’s colonisation theory, which England once tried to enforce by law, tried to create wage-workers in the colonies. He called this “systematic colonisation.”

Wakefield found that in the colonies, having money, food, machines, and other tools does not make someone a capitalist unless there is also a wage-worker — someone who has to sell their work freely. He realized that capital is not just things, but a social relationship between people, made possible by things.

Mr. Peel, Wakefield says, took £50,000 worth of supplies to Swan River, West Australia. He also wisely brought 300 working-class people, including men, women, and children.

But when he got there, “Mr. Peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch water from the river.” Poor Mr. Peel prepared everything except making sure English ways of working came with him to Swan River!

To understand Wakefield’s ideas better, remember: things like tools and food don’t become capital as long as they belong to the person who uses them. They only turn into capital when they are used to control and exploit workers.
