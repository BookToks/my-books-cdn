Here, the comparison stops working. The iron, when talking about the weight of the sugar-loaf, shows a natural thing both objects have, which is weight. But the coat, when talking about the value of the linen, shows something not natural but social — their value.

The way we show the value of something, like linen, means its value is different from what it is made of or its properties. For example, it looks like a coat, but this shows there is a social relationship behind it. The opposite is true for the equivalent form. Here, the coat itself shows value, as if Nature gave it this value form. This only works when the coat is the equivalent to the linen. But since a thing's properties don’t come from its relationships with other things, but only show up in those relationships, the coat seems to have this value-form naturally, just like it is naturally heavy or keeps us warm. This strange feature of the equivalent form is something economists miss until they see it fully as money. Then they try to explain gold and silver’s special character by replacing them with other less fancy things and listing all kinds of things that have been used as equivalents. They don’t realize that even a simple value expression like "20 yards of linen = 1 coat" already holds the mystery of the equivalent form.

The thing used as the equivalent, the coat, shows human labor in an abstract way, but it also comes from a specific kind of useful work. So this specific work becomes the way to show abstract human labor. On one side, the coat is just the symbol of abstract human labor. On the other side, the tailoring that made the coat is just the way that abstract labor is shown. When we talk about the value of the linen, the usefulness of tailoring is not in making clothes but in making something we see as value, which is frozen labor — labor that is the same kind as the labor shown in the linen’s value. For tailoring to act like this value mirror, it must only show its general quality of being human labor.

Both tailoring and weaving use human labor power. So both share the general quality of being human labor. Because of that, when producing value, we sometimes have to look at them only from this side. This is not mysterious. But value expressions turn things upside down. For example, weaving creates the value of linen not because it is weaving, but because it is human labor in general. We show this by putting another kind of concrete labor, tailoring, against weaving. Tailoring creates the equivalent of weaving’s product. Just like the coat shows value, tailoring, as a kind of work, appears as the clear example of human labor in general.

So, the second special thing about the equivalent form is that concrete labor becomes the way abstract human labor shows itself.
