Redgrave says that things look worse for Great Britain because many factories there do both weaving and spinning using machines. But in other countries, most factories only do spinning. If we compared the same kinds of factories, he could show that in his area, one man and two helpers can run a huge spinning machine with 2,200 spindles, making 220 pounds of yarn every day that’s 400 miles long.

We also know that in Eastern Europe and Asia, English companies have built railways. They hired both local workers and some English workers. Because of this, they had to think about how hard people work in different countries. But this didn’t cause them any problems. Their experience shows that even if wages match how hard people work, the cost of labor usually changes in the opposite way.

In an early essay, H. Carey tried to prove that wages in different countries match how productive workers are. He thought that wages go up and down depending on how much work gets done. But our study of how profits are made shows this idea is wrong. Even Carey didn’t really prove his point well; he just mixed up a lot of statistics without clear thinking. The funny thing is, he doesn’t even say things actually work the way his theory says they should. That’s because government actions change the natural economic rules.

So, when we compare wages from different countries, we have to imagine that the part of wages taken by taxes actually goes to the workers. Shouldn’t Carey think about whether those government costs are just a natural part of how capitalism grows? His way of thinking fits with the person who first said capitalism’s rules are like natural laws that only get messed up by the government. But then he found out that England’s bad effect on the world market isn’t natural at all, and that’s why the government has to step in to protect the system. He also realized that the ideas from Ricardo and others, which describe social conflicts, aren’t perfect results of the economy but cause real problems themselves. Finally, he saw that trade actually ruins the natural balance of capitalism. Maybe soon he’ll see that the real problem with capitalism is capital itself. Only someone so uncritical and wrongly knowledgeable could, despite being a protectionist, inspire the positive ideas of Bastiat and today’s free-trade supporters.
