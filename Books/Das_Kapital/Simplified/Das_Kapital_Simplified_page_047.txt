A simple commodity is like the beginning of money.

A commodity looks like a normal thing at first and seems easy to understand. But when you study it, you find it’s actually pretty strange and full of complicated ideas. When you think about what it’s used for, there’s nothing weird about it. It either helps people in some way, or it’s made by people working. For example, wood can be made into a table, which changes its form but it’s still wood.

However, when the table becomes a commodity, it changes into something more than just wood. It doesn’t just sit on the ground; it acts in a weird and surprising way compared to other commodities, almost like it has a strange mind of its own.

The strange nature of commodities doesn’t come from what they do or how useful they are. It also doesn’t come from where their value comes from. Different kinds of work all use human effort, like brain, muscles, and nerves. The value depends on how long the work takes, which is different from how good the work is. No matter what kind of society people live in, how much time it takes to make things to live on is important, though how important it is can change. Also, when people work for each other, their work becomes social.

So why do things made by work become so mysterious when they become commodities? It’s because of the form they take as commodities. All kinds of human work are made equal by their products having equal value. The value is measured by how long the work took. And the relationships between producers show up as social relationships between the products themselves.

A commodity is mysterious because it shows the social nature of people’s work as a property of the product itself. The connection between producers and their total work looks like a relationship between things, not between people. That’s why products become commodities—social things with qualities we can notice but also don’t fully understand. It’s like light: we see light as coming from an object outside our eyes, not just from inside our brain.

But with commodities, unlike light, their value and social relationships don’t depend on their physical features or materials. The value they have as commodities is totally separate from their physical stuff.
