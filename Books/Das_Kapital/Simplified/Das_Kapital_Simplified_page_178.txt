Each man would want half of this profit. This means the Sandersons would have to pay part of the adult men’s wages themselves instead of using the boys’ night work to cover it. Because of this, the Sandersons would make less money, which is why boys can’t learn their skills during the day.

Also, if adults had to work at night instead of the boys, it would be too hard for them to handle. These problems might even cause them to stop night work altogether. E. F. Sanderson says that would be fine for the work itself, but there’s more to it.

The Sandersons have other reasons besides making steel. Making steel is just an excuse to make extra profit. The furnaces, machines, buildings, iron, and coal don’t just turn into steel — they are there to use up extra work time. They work better over 24 hours than just 12. Basically, the Sandersons get paid for workers’ labor all day long, and if they stop, all their stuff just becomes a loss.

“But then we’d lose money because expensive machines would be unused half the time, and we’d have to double our buildings and machines to do the same work,” they say. But why should the Sandersons get special treatment when other bosses only work during the day and their machines sit unused at night?

E. F. Sanderson answers for all the Sandersons: “It’s true that machines sit unused in places that only work by day, but for us, keeping the furnaces running would waste fuel, and turning them off means wasting time reheating them. Also, the furnaces get damaged by temperature changes.” (Even though the furnaces don’t get damaged by day and night work.)

Section 5: The Fight for a Normal Workday.

From the 14th to the 17th century, laws forced longer working days. The question is: what counts as a working day? How long can bosses make workers work beyond what’s needed to keep them alive and able to work again?

Capital answers: a working day is almost 24 hours, minus just a few hours of rest. This shows that workers are seen as nothing more than their ability to work. All their free time belongs to their job and is used to make more profit. Time for learning, thinking, social life, or even resting on Sundays doesn’t really count.
