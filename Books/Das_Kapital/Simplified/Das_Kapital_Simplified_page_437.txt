Chapter 25

When businesses use more machines and tools compared to workers, this changes how money is spent on production. At first, a company might spend half its money on machines and half on paying workers. But later, with better technology, they might spend 80% on machines and only 20% on workers. This pattern happens over time and in different countries.

The change in spending on machines versus workers shows how production changes. For example, today in spinning (making yarn), most of the money goes to machines, while long ago it was half and half. But the amount of materials and tools used today is much bigger than before because machines have gotten better at producing things. Even though machines cost less compared to their size and amount, their total value still increases.

The difference in money spent on machines grows, but not as fast as the difference in how many machines and tools are used compared to workers.

Even though the share of money spent on workers gets smaller, the actual amount spent on workers can still grow. For example, if a company started with £6,000 split evenly between machines and workers, and later the split is 80% machines and 20% workers, but the total money grows to £18,000, the amount spent on workers still goes up from £3,000 to £3,600. But now, to hire more workers, the company needs a lot more money than before.

In Part IV, it was explained that making things more efficiently needs lots of people working together. This teamwork helps organize jobs, save resources, and use big machines that only work when combined. It also allows companies to use big natural forces like water or steam power. Science and technology get used directly to improve production.

Since machines and tools are owned by private people, cooperation on a big scale only happens when these owners grow their businesses. Workers either make things on their own or sell their labor because they don’t own machines. So, large-scale production in capitalism only happens when private owners control the means of production and resources.
