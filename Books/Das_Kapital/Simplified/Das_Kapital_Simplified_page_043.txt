Second, it’s like a colorful puzzle made up of many different and separate ways to show value. Finally, if each product’s value is shown this way, each one will have its own unique value form, with endless ways to express it. The problems with this expanded way of showing value also appear in the matching equivalent form. Since each product’s physical form is just one example among many others, we end up with many separate equivalent forms that don’t fit together. Also, the specific type of useful work in each equivalent form only shows one kind of labor, not all human work in general. The full meaning of labor only appears when you look at all its many different kinds together. But showing it as a never-ending series is always incomplete and not unified.

The expanded way of showing relative value is just the sum of simple value comparisons like: 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, or 20 yards of linen = 10 pounds of tea.

Each of these also means the reverse is true, like 1 coat = 20 yards of linen, or 10 pounds of tea = 20 yards of linen.

When someone trades their linen for many other products, their value is shown in those products. At the same time, the owners of those products trade back for linen, showing their products’ value in linen. If we flip the series, like 20 yards of linen = 1 coat = 10 pounds of tea, we get the General Form of Value, where different things like coats, tea, coffee, corn, gold, iron, and others all equal 20 yards of linen.

1. The changed way value is shown Now, all products show their value (1) in one simple form, using one product; (2) with unity, because they all use the same product. This form is simple and the same for all, so it’s general.

The earlier forms, A and B, could only show a product’s value as something separate from its use or physical form.

Form A gives equations like: 1 coat = 20 yards of linen, or 10 pounds of tea = ½ a ton of iron. The coat’s value equals linen, the tea’s equals iron. But being equal to linen, and also to iron, is confusing because linen and iron are so different. This form mostly happens at the very start, when products first become commodities through random trades.
