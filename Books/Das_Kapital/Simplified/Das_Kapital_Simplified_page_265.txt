Instead of one simple machine, we now have huge machines that fill entire factories. At first, they move slowly and carefully, but soon they start working fast and hard with many parts all working together.

Before there were workers who only made machines like mules and steam engines, just like people wore clothes before there were tailors. Inventors like Vaucanson, Arkwright, and Watt could only make their machines because skilled workers were already available during the manufacturing period. Some of these workers were independent craftsmen, while others worked together in factories where jobs were divided among them. As more machines were invented and more were needed, the machine-making business split into many parts, and work was divided even more. This shows that manufacturing was the technical base of modern industry. Manufacturing made the machines that helped modern industry replace old handmade methods in the areas it first took over.

The factory system started naturally on this old base, but when it grew enough, it had to remove this old base and build a new one that fit its new ways of working. Just like a single machine is small when only powered by humans, and machines couldn’t fully grow before the steam engine replaced power from animals, wind, or water, modern industry couldn’t fully develop as long as its machines depended on human strength, skill, sharp eyesight, and careful hands. Besides being expensive, machines made this way could only grow slowly because the workers needed were highly skilled and could only increase in number bit by bit.

Also, at some point, modern industry didn’t fit well with the old handmade and manufacturing methods. Bigger power sources, more complex machines, and the use of harder materials like iron instead of wood made old methods a problem. The new machines, like hydraulic presses and power looms, couldn’t be made by old manufacturing methods.

When one part of industry changes a lot, other parts have to change too. This happens first in connected industries that work on different steps of the same process but still make separate products. For example, machines for spinning made machines for weaving necessary, and together they pushed big changes in bleaching, printing, and dyeing.
