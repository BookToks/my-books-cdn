As factories and farming improved, all kinds of industries grew and changed. The factory system breaks down making things into smaller steps and uses machines, chemistry, and science to solve problems. Because of this, machines started being used more and more in making products, first for one part of the job, then another. This changed the old way of organizing work, which was based on dividing tasks between workers, and now things kept changing all the time.

At the same time, the type of workers changed a lot. Unlike before, factories began to hire women, children, and unskilled workers because they were cheap. This happened not only in big factories but also in small workshops and even in homes. The new “domestic industry” is very different from the old kind, which needed independent craftspeople, farmers, and homes for workers and their families. Now, the old home-based industries became part of big factories or warehouses.

Besides the factory workers who work in one place, there are also many people working from home or small workshops, connected to factories by invisible links. For example, the Tillie shirt factory in Londonderry has 1,000 workers inside the factory and 9,000 people working at home across the country.

Cheap and young workers are treated worse in these home industries than in factories. This is because machines don’t help as much in home work, and women and very young children often work with harmful substances. The abuse is worse in home industries because workers are spread out and weaker, middlemen take money between the boss and worker, and they have to compete with factories and other producers. Poverty makes it hard for them to have good working conditions like space, light, and fresh air. Their work is often irregular, and many compete for very little work.

The factory system first tried to save money on tools and materials, but it also wasted workers’ energy and ignored their needs. This careless way of working now causes more harm in industries where machines and teamwork are less developed.
