Chapter 5

It’s impossible for capital (money used to make more money) to be created just by buying and selling things. But it also can’t come from anywhere except through buying and selling. So, capital has to start from buying and selling, but it can’t come from that alone.

This means we have two important points.

First, turning money into capital needs to be explained by the rules of trading goods, where people trade things of equal value. Our friend, Moneybags, who is just starting out as a capitalist, has to buy things at their real price and sell them at their real price. But in the end, he has to get more value out than he put in at the beginning. To grow into a full capitalist, he has to do this both by trading and by other ways outside of trading. These are the challenges he faces. Now it’s time to prove it!
