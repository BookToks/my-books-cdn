The value of silver has been going down, and if its price wasn’t kept steady by special methods, it would be even lower now. America has a lot of silver that hasn’t been used yet, so silver’s value will probably keep dropping for a long time. Another big reason is that people don’t need as much silver for everyday stuff or fancy items anymore because things like plated goods and aluminum are replacing it. So, the idea that forcing countries to set silver’s value at an old rate will make it valuable again is pretty unrealistic. It’s more likely that silver will lose its role as money in the world’s markets.

People who didn’t support the old mercantile system—which thought that international trade was all about paying off extra trade balances with gold and silver—didn’t really understand how money works globally. I showed, using Ricardo as an example, how their wrong ideas about how much money should be in use also led to wrong ideas about how gold and silver move between countries. Ricardo wrongly said that a bad trade balance happens because there’s too much money, and that coins leave a country because they’re cheap, which causes the bad trade balance. But actually, Barbon said that money leaves a country because the value of gold and silver is different in each place, not because of trade balances. MacCulloch praised Barbon for this idea but ignored the silly ways Barbon explained it. MacCulloch’s book wasn’t very honest in criticizing money theories because he wanted to please Lord Overstone, who was a famous expert on money.

Sometimes, money is needed for specific things like subsidies, war loans, or helping banks pay out cash again. In these cases, it’s the money itself that’s important, not just the value behind it.

For example, France showed how well money systems can work when it paid a forced tax of nearly 20 million to other countries within 27 months, mostly in coins, without hurting its own money system or causing big problems in trade. Later, between 1871 and 1873, France paid an even bigger tax quickly and smoothly, again mostly with coins.

Money moves between countries based on how much they need it and is attracted by goods and products. Mines keep producing enough gold and silver to meet these needs. Trade and currency exchanges go up and down all the time, sometimes favoring one country and other times another.

But problems can happen when gold and silver have to be used both as money and as reserves to back up banknotes.
