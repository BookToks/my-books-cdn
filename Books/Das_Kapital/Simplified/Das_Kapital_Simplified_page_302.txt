By the end of 1862, wages for workers dropped a lot. Some weavers were only making between 2 and 6 shillings a week. Even when they worked less, their rent was often taken out of their pay. It’s no surprise that in some parts of Lancashire, people were starving and getting sick.

But the biggest change was how work was done, and it wasn’t good for the workers. The owners treated workers like experiments, testing new ways to make things cheaper, even if it hurt the workers.

Mr. Redgrave explained that workers’ pay didn’t stay the same each week. It went up and down a lot because manufacturers kept changing how they mixed cotton. Sometimes workers earned almost as much as before, but other times their pay dropped by half or more.

These changes didn’t just affect their money. The workers’ health also suffered.

People working with Surat cotton said it smelled really bad and made them feel sick. The dust and dirt in the factories caused coughing and breathing problems. Skin diseases were common because of the dirt. Bronchitis and sore throats were also frequent because of the dust.

Weavers had stomach problems from having to suck the thread through their machines when it broke. Meanwhile, manufacturers added stuff to the cotton to make it heavier, which helped them make more money. For example, 15 pounds of raw cotton could weigh 26 pounds after it was made into cloth.

Reports from 1864 showed that some cloth was nearly half made up of added materials, not cotton. This let manufacturers sell cloth cheaper per pound than the cotton alone cost, making big profits. But the workers had to suffer through all this—low pay, no jobs, sickness, and poverty.

Many women lost their jobs because of the cotton famine and became outcasts. Even when the trade got better and work was available, these women stayed in tough situations. There were also more young prostitutes than had been seen in 25 years.

Looking back, between 1770 and 1815, the cotton industry mostly grew with only a few hard years, but that was when they had a monopoly and controlled everything.
