Chapter 15

We’ll see later that when the boss feels he might lose his job, he acts very differently.

If you know the story of Arkwright, you won’t call this barber-genius “noble.” Among all the great inventors of the 18th century, he was the biggest thief of other people’s ideas and one of the meanest guys.

The way factory owners control workers is like slavery. Workers have no freedom at all, either by law or in real life. They must be at work by half past five. If they are a few minutes late, they get punished. If they are 10 minutes late, they can’t come in until after breakfast and lose part of their pay. Workers have to eat, drink, and sleep when told. The loud bell drags them out of bed, breakfast, and dinner. In the factory, the boss is like a dictator. He makes all the rules and can change them anytime. Even if the rules are silly, the courts say the workers must follow them because they agreed to the contract. These workers have to live like this, with mental and physical suffering, from when they are nine years old until they die.

What the courts say is shown by two real examples. One happened in Sheffield at the end of 1866. A worker signed a two-year contract to work at a steelworks. After a fight with the boss, he left and said he would never work for that boss again. He was charged for breaking the contract and sent to prison for two months. If the boss breaks the contract, he only faces losing money in a civil case. After the worker finished his time in jail, the boss asked him to come back. The worker refused, saying he was already punished. The boss took him to court again, and the worker was punished again. One judge called this a crazy law because a person could be punished over and over for the same mistake. This decision came from one of the highest courts in London, not some small local court. Later, this was changed so workers and bosses are treated more equally in contract cases.

The second case happened in Wiltshire in November 1863. About 30 power-loom weavers working for a cloth maker named Harrup stopped working because he fined them for being late in the morning. He charged 6 pence for 2 minutes late, 1 shilling for 3 minutes, and 1 shilling 6 pence for 10 minutes late. This was like paying 9 shillings per hour, or £4 10s per day, while the weavers only earned about 10 to 12 shillings a week. Harrup also had a boy blow a whistle to signal starting time, sometimes before 6 a.m. If workers weren’t there when the whistle stopped, the doors were locked and they were fined. Since there was no clock, the workers had to trust the boy’s whistle timing. The striking workers, many were moms and girls, said they’d go back if the boy was replaced by a clock and the fines were fair. Harrup took 19 women and girls to court for breaking their contract. Everyone was shocked when each was fined 6 pence plus 2 shillings 6 pence for court costs.

Harrup was followed by a crowd who booed him. A common trick bosses use is to take money from workers’ pay if the materials they work on are faulty. This caused a big strike in the pottery districts in 1866. Reports from 1863 to 1866 show cases where workers not only got no pay but ended up owing money to their bosses because of harsh rules. The cotton industry crisis also showed how factory bosses cut wages unfairly.
