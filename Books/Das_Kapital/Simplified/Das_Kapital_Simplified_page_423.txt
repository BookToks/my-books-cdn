In 1782, as Frederick Engels explains, all the wool made in England over the past three years just sat unused because there weren’t enough workers to spin it. This wool would have stayed unused if new machines hadn’t been invented to help spin it. Machines don’t create workers, but they let fewer workers do more work. With these machines, workers could use the wool better, add value to it, and keep its value by turning it into yarn. At the same time, more wool was produced. Living workers naturally pass on old value while making new value. So, as machines and tools get better and more valuable, and as production grows, labour keeps creating more and more capital in new forms. This power of labour looks like it’s a natural part of capital, just like the productive power of all workers looks like it belongs to capital, and how capitalists always take extra work from workers seems like capital is growing by itself.

As capital grows, the difference between the capital used and the capital actually consumed also grows. This means things like buildings, machines, pipes, and tools get bigger in value and amount. These things last a long time and don’t lose their value all at once, but slowly over time, so they only add a little value to products bit by bit. These tools help make products without adding new value, just like natural forces such as water, steam, or electricity help without charging. This free help from past work, when powered by living workers, grows bigger as capital builds up.

Since past work hides itself as capital, meaning the work done by people before (like A, B, C) becomes the active power of a non-worker (like X), economists often praise this “dead” work. For example, the Scottish economist MacCulloch said it deserves special payment like interest or profit. The great help past work gives to living workers through tools and machines is seen as belonging to capital, which is separated from the worker who actually made it. Capitalists and their thinkers can’t imagine machines or tools without thinking of the system that controls them, just like slaveowners can’t think of slaves outside of slavery.

With a set level of worker exploitation, the total extra value made depends on how many workers are exploited at once, which matches the size of the capital. So, as capital grows through saving and reinvesting, more value is created, which is split between money for living expenses and money for further investment. This lets the capitalist live better and still save more. Finally, all parts of production work better and more flexibly as the amount of capital used gets bigger.
