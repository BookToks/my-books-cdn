If having more workers than needed is a natural result of making money and growing wealth in a capitalist system, then this extra group of workers actually helps that system keep going. This extra group is like a backup army of workers that businesses can use whenever they want, as if the businesses had created them themselves. Even if the population doesn’t grow much, this extra group is always ready to be used when businesses want to expand.

As money and productivity grow, businesses get better at quickly using this extra group of workers. This happens not just because businesses have more money or better credit, but also because new machines and transportation allow faster changes in production. The extra wealth pushes into old industries that suddenly need more workers or into new industries like railways, which grow because of the old ones. To make this work, it has to be possible to add lots of workers quickly without hurting other industries. That’s where having extra workers helps.

Modern industry works in cycles that last about ten years. These cycles go from normal work to high production, then crisis, and then slow times. These ups and downs depend on creating, using, and recreating this extra group of workers. The cycles also help create more of these extra workers. This way of working didn’t exist before and was impossible when capitalism was just starting. Back then, the amount of money and capital grew slowly, so the need for workers grew slowly too. It was limited by how many workers were available, and this limit could only be overcome by force, which will be explained later.

Production grows in bursts and then suddenly shrinks, and this shrinking causes new growth again. But this new growth can’t happen without having extra workers ready, even if the total population isn't growing.

This happens because some workers are constantly being "let go" or made partly unemployed as production becomes more efficient. So, modern industry depends on always turning some workers into unemployed or partly employed people. Some economists make the mistake of thinking that changes in credit cause these cycles, but credit changes are just a sign of the cycle, not the cause. Just like planets keep moving in the same patterns once they start, social production keeps repeating its cycle of growth and shrinkage. Causes and effects switch places, and this cycle becomes regular. Once this regular cycle is established, even economists admit that producing extra workers is part of how the system works.
