We saw something similar in the English farm workers. But the difference is that in England, a more industrial country, workers who are not needed on farms move to factories in the countryside. In Ireland, which is mostly farming, the extra farm workers move from the countryside to towns and cities, hoping to find work. In England, farm workers become factory workers. In Ireland, people move to towns but still work as farm laborers and often have to go back to the countryside to find jobs. This also lowers the pay for workers in the towns.

Official inspectors say that farm workers live very simply. Their wages barely cover food for a normal family and rent. They need other help to pay for clothes for themselves, their wives, and children. The small homes are unhealthy, and this causes many workers to get sick with fever and lung diseases. Because of this, the inspectors say these workers feel unhappy and frustrated. They miss the past, hate their current life, and don’t see a better future. They often listen to troublemakers and mostly dream of leaving for America. America is seen as a land of hope, while Ireland feels like it’s been emptied out by bad problems.

Here’s an example of how hard life is for an Irish factory worker. Robert Baker, an English factory inspector, met a skilled worker in Northern Ireland who told him about his life. The man said, “I am a beetler and work from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., Monday to Friday. On Saturday, we finish at 6 p.m. with three short breaks for meals and rest. I have five children. I earn 10 shillings and 6 pence a week. My wife also works and makes 5 shillings a week. Our oldest girl, 12 years old, takes care of the house. She cooks and looks after the younger kids. Every morning, a girl walking by wakes me up at 5:30 a.m. My wife gets up and goes to work with me. We don’t eat before work. The 12-year-old watches the little kids all day. We don’t eat again until breakfast at 8 a.m., when we go home. We have tea only once a week. Other times, we eat a kind of thin porridge made from oats or cornmeal, depending on what we can get. In winter, we add a little sugar and water to the porridge. In summer, we grow a small patch of potatoes, but when those are gone, we go back to porridge. Sometimes we get a bit of milk. This is our life every day, Sundays and weekdays, all year round. I’m always very tired at night. Meat is a treat we hardly ever have. Three of our kids go to school, and we pay one penny each per week. Our rent is 9 pence a week. Heating with peat costs 1 shilling and 6 pence every two weeks.” This is what wages and life are like for Irish workers!
