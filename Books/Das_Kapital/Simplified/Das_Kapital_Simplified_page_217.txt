In tanning, for example, the worker deals with animal skins as his simple job. He is not tanning the skin of the capitalist. But things change when we look at production from the point of view of making extra profit. The tools and machines used in production become a way to control other people’s work.

Now, it’s not the worker using the tools, but the tools that control the worker. Instead of helping the worker, these tools use the worker like an ingredient needed for their own survival. The life of capital is just about constantly growing and making more value.

If the machines and workshops don’t work at night and don’t use any worker’s labor, they become a “loss” for the capitalist. So, these machines and workshops make the workers work at night too. Just turning money into production tools changes those tools into a claim on other people’s work and extra unpaid work.

An example will help show how this strange switch between dead labor (machines) and living labor (workers), and between value and the power that creates value, appears in the minds of capitalists.

During a workers’ revolt in England between 1848 and 1850, the head of a very old and respected company in Scotland, Carlile Sons & Co., which had been running since 1752 and run by four generations of the same family, wrote a letter in a newspaper.

This “very smart man” wrote about “The relay system” and said some very simple and wrong things. He said, “Let’s see what problems will happen if factory workers only work 10 hours instead of 12. If they worked 12 hours before and now only 10, then every 12 machines would be worth only as much as 10. If the factory is sold, the price will drop by one-sixth.” 

To this businessman, the value of the machines is so mixed up with their ability to create more value by using unpaid worker labor, that he actually thinks the machines themselves become less valuable just because workers work fewer hours. He believes that if the workday is shorter by 2 hours, the price of 12 machines will go down to the price of 10!

This simple rule is unknown to many economists, who wrongly think they can control the market price of labor by supply and demand.

More details will be explained later in Book IV.

The total amount of work time in society is fixed, like ten hours a day for a million people, or ten million hours. Capital has a limit to how much it can grow, and sometimes it reaches this limit with the amount of work time used.
