In a country’s economy, good and bad things always balance out. When some people have lots of wealth, others don’t have enough. A few rich people often mean many others lack the basic things they need to live. The amount of wealth a country has matches its population, and the amount of suffering matches its wealth. When some people work hard, others end up doing nothing. The poor and lazy exist because of the rich and busy people.

About 10 years after Ortes, a Church of England priest named Townsend said misery is needed for wealth to exist. 

He thought forcing people to work by law causes too much trouble and violence. But hunger is quiet and constant, and it makes people work hard. So, to keep people working, hunger must stay a permanent problem for the working class. According to Townsend, the population grows mostly among poor people, which keeps hunger going.

Townsend believed it’s natural for poor people to be careless with money so that there are always some who do the worst and most unpleasant jobs in society. This makes the overall happiness of people higher because the more sensitive or delicate people don’t have to do those jobs. Instead, they can focus on the work that suits them better. He thought laws that help poor people with public support ruin the natural order that God and Nature created.

While the Venetian monk saw endless misery as the reason for charity and religious life, this Protestant priest used it as a reason to criticize laws that help poor people survive.

Storch said that as society gets richer, there will always be a group of people who do the hardest, nastiest, and most unpleasant jobs. This lets other people have free time, peace of mind, and respect. But Storch wondered what real progress means if it comes with so much misery and the lowering of many people’s lives. His answer was that progress means security.

Sismondi explained that thanks to industry and science, every worker can make more than they need in a day. But if they had to use all they made themselves, they would become too tired to keep working. He said people might prefer to live without fancy things if getting those things meant everyone had to work as hard as laborers do. Today, work and reward are separated: the person who works is not the one who rests. One person works hard so another can take a break.
