There is a big step forward when people talk about criticizing how property is owned now. For example, a recent report called the Blue Book says that in countries like Germany and France, just like in England, big changes between workers and business owners are clear and unavoidable. At the same time, across the Atlantic Ocean, Mr. Wade, the vice-president of the United States, said in public meetings that after ending slavery, the next big change will be about how land and money are owned. These are signs that things are changing, even if it won’t happen overnight. It shows that even the people in charge realize that society isn’t fixed like a solid rock but can and will change.

The second part of this book will talk about how money moves around (Book II) and the different ways money changes as it grows (Book III). The last part (Book IV) will cover the history of the ideas behind all this.

I welcome any opinion based on careful scientific study. As for the usual opinions of the public, which I have never cared about, I still follow the advice of the great Florentine writer: “Follow your own path and let people talk.” Karl Marx London July 25, 1867

This is important because even in the part of Ferdinand Lassalle’s work that is supposed to explain my ideas, there are big mistakes. If Lassalle has taken many ideas straight from my writings without saying so—like the idea that capital has a history, or how production conditions connect to the way things are made, and even the special words I created—it might be because he wanted to spread these ideas. I’m not talking about how he applied these ideas in detail, which I’m not involved with.
