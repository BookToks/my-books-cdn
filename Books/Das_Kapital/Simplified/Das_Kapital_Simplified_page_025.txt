In any case, it was clear that he didn’t dare to keep accusing his friend Brentano of saying Marx had made a “lying” addition. Actually, Marx didn’t add anything false; instead, he left out an important sentence.

That same sentence is even quoted on page 5 of the Inaugural Address, just a few lines before the supposed “lying insertion.” About the contradictions in Gladstone’s speech, isn’t it Marx himself who talks about “the continual crying contradictions in Gladstone’s Budget speeches of 1863 and 1864” in his book *Capital*? But Marx didn’t try, like Mr. Sedley Taylor, to explain them away as just friendly Liberal opinions.

Eleanor Marx, in her final reply, sums it up this way: “Marx didn’t leave out anything important or add anything false. Instead, he brought back a specific sentence from one of Mr. Gladstone’s speeches that was definitely said but somehow disappeared from the official records.”

After that, Mr. Sedley Taylor gave up. The whole argument, which went on for 20 years and across two countries, ended with no one daring to question Marx’s honesty in writing. And now, Mr. Sedley Taylor probably won’t trust Herr Brentano’s reports any more than Brentano trusts the official records called Hansard.
