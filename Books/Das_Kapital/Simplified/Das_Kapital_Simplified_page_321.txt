In the Speech from the Throne on February 5, 1867, the Tory government said they would introduce new laws based on the final ideas from a Commission that finished its work in 1866.

On August 15, 1867, the Factory Acts Extension Act became law, and on August 21, the Workshops’ Regulation Act also became law. The first law was about big industries, and the second one was about small workshops.

The first law applied to places like blast furnaces, iron and copper mills, foundries, machine shops, metal factories, paper mills, glass factories, tobacco factories, printing places (including newspapers), and book-binding shops. It covered any place where 50 or more people worked at the same time for at least 100 days a year.

To explain what the Workshops’ Regulation Act covered, it said: “Handicraft means any kind of manual work done as a job or to make money, like making or fixing things to sell.” “Workshop means any place, inside or outside, where children, young people, or women do handicraft work, and where the boss has control.” “Employed means working at any handicraft job, whether paid or not, for a boss or a parent.” “Parent means a parent, guardian, or anyone who looks after or controls a child or young person.” One rule said that if children, young people, or women were employed against the law, the workshop owner, the parent, or anyone who benefits or controls the worker could be fined.

The Factory Acts Extension Act, which dealt with big factories, had many exceptions and made compromises that helped the factory owners.

The Workshops’ Regulation Act was full of problems and wasn’t really enforced by local authorities. In 1871, Parliament took away their power to enforce it and gave it to Factory Inspectors, who now had to watch over more than 100,000 workshops and 300 brickworks. But they only added eight assistants to help, which wasn’t enough.

What stands out about the 1867 English laws is that the government had to take big steps to stop the worst abuses by business owners. But at the same time, they were slow, unwilling, and dishonest when it came to making sure these laws actually worked.
