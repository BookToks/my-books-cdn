1 It’s not correct to say that wages go up just because workers can buy more of a cheaper product.

2 Later, we will look at how productivity can change this rule for certain types of work.

3 James Anderson points out in his argument against Adam Smith that even though wages seem lower in poor countries where food is cheap, the real cost of labor is often higher there. This is because the real price of labor is what the employer actually pays for the work done, not just the daily wage. So, labor is usually cheaper in rich countries than in poor ones, even if food costs less in poor countries. For example, daily wages are lower in Scotland than in England, but piecework is usually cheaper in England.

4 On the other hand, low wages can actually make labor more expensive. For instance, labor is more costly in Ireland than in England because wages are much lower there.
