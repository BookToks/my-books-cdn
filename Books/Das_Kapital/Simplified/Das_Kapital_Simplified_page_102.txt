102 Chapter 3 66

Having more money than what is really needed for local trade is useless and doesn’t help the country where it’s kept. Money only makes a profit when it moves through trade or is brought in from outside. (John Bellers, “Essays,” p. 13.)

If we have too much money, we can melt it down and make fancy gold or silver items, or send it to places that want it. We can also lend it out where interest rates are high. (W. Petty: “Quantulumcunque,” p. 39.)

Money is like the fat in a body. Too much fat can slow you down, and too little can make you sick. Fat helps muscles move, keeps you fed when food is scarce, fills in gaps, and makes the body look better. In the same way, money helps a country work well, supports it during hard times, balances things out, and makes everything look good—especially for the people who have a lot of money. (W. Petty, “Political Anatomy of Ireland,” p. 14.)
