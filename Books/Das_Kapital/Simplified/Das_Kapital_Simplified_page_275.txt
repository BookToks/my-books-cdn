In some places, kids go to school only when their work schedule allows it. They have to make up a certain number of school hours every six months, but these hours are spread out in small chunks of 3 to 5 hours at different times.  

For example, a child might go to school from 8 to 11 a.m. one day, then from 1 to 4 p.m. another day, and maybe not show up again for a few days. Then they might go from 3 to 6 p.m., or attend school for a few days in a row, then skip school for weeks. They only go when their boss lets them, switching back and forth between work and school until they finish their 150 hours.  

Because so many women and kids are working, the machines eventually break the resistance that men workers had against the harsh control of the bosses.  

Now, machines are the best way to make work faster and easier. But bosses use machines to make workers work even longer than is healthy or fair.  

Machines work on their own, without needing breaks, but the people using them get tired and have limits. The bosses want to push workers to work as much as possible, ignoring their needs.  

Work seems easier with machines, so bosses hire more women and kids because they are easier to control.  

The longer a machine works, the less its cost adds to each product because the machine’s value spreads over many products.  

How long a machine lasts depends on how many hours it works each day and how many days it works.  

Machines don’t wear out exactly based on how long they run, but if a machine works 16 hours a day for 7½ years, it produces the same total value as if it worked 8 hours a day for 15 years.  

But in the first case, the boss earns back the machine’s cost faster and makes more extra profit in less time.
