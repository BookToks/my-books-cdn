The M—C—M cycle starts with money and ends with money. Its main goal is just to make more money.

When people trade goods, like corn and clothes, both things are products with value, but they are different kinds of useful stuff. Trading different products is the basic idea here. But in the M—C—M cycle, it looks like you’re just trading money for money, which seems pointless. For example, if you trade £100 for cotton and then sell the cotton for £100, it’s just money for money, the same amount. Money is only different by how much there is, not by what it is. The important part is that in M—C—M, you end up with more money than you started with. Maybe you sell the cotton for £110 instead of £100. This is called M—C—M', where M' means the original money plus extra. That extra money is called “surplus-value.” So the money you started with doesn’t just stay the same—it grows. This is what turns money into capital.

Sometimes, when trading goods like corn and clothes, the values might not match exactly. The farmer might sell corn for more than it’s worth, or buy clothes for less. Or the opposite might happen. But in the M—C—M cycle, these differences don’t really matter. The values of the goods being traded need to be equal for the process to work normally.

When you buy to use something (like food or clothes), the buying and selling stops once you get what you need. But when you buy to sell again, you start and end with money, and this can go on forever. Yes, £100 can become £110, but £110 is still just money, like £100. If you just keep that money and don’t use it, it doesn’t grow or change. If you want to grow your money, you have to keep using it to make more. The original £100 and the extra £10 are separate for a moment, but in the end, they just become £110, ready to start the process again. Money ends one cycle only to begin the next.

So, every time you buy and sell, it also sets up the next round of buying and selling.
