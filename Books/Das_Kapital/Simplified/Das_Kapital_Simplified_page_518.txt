My article was printed again in a Scottish newspaper, which caused a big argument between that paper and the supporters of the Sutherland family.

There are interesting details about the fish trade in Mr. David Urquhart’s new Portfolio series. Nassau W. Senior, in a book published after his death, called what happened in Sutherlandshire one of the most helpful clearings ever remembered.

The deer-forests in Scotland don’t have any trees at all. First, sheep are driven away, then deer are brought to the empty hills, and that’s what they call a deer-forest. They don’t even plant trees or grow real forests there.

Robert Somers wrote “Letters from the Highlands: or the Famine of 1847,” which were first published in The Times. English economists said the famine in 1847 was because there were too many people, and they were using up their food. The clearing of estates, called “Bauernlegen” in Germany, happened especially after a war and caused peasants to revolt as late as 1790. This was mostly in East Germany. In many parts of Prussia, Frederick II gave peasants the right to own land. After taking over Silesia, he made landlords rebuild homes and give peasants animals and tools. He wanted soldiers and taxpayers.

Peasants lived a hard life under Frederick’s rule, mixed with strict government and feudal systems. Mirabeau, who admired Frederick, said flax was a big part of the farmer’s wealth in North Germany, but it only helped them survive, not live well. Peasants had to pay many taxes and do forced labor, and they couldn’t sell their goods or buy what they needed in the best way. All this slowly ruined them. They barely managed to pay their taxes with the money from spinning flax, which kept their families busy but was a tough life.

In summer, peasants worked very hard plowing and harvesting, going to bed at nine and waking up at two to finish their work. In winter, they should rest more, but they needed to sell goods to pay taxes or else they wouldn’t have enough grain for bread and planting. So, they had to keep working late into the night. This constant hard work and little sleep made them age faster than people living in cities.
