Value is what turns every product into a kind of social symbol.

Later, we try to understand this symbol to figure out the secret behind our social products. Putting a value on something useful is just as much a social thing as language is. Scientists recently discovered that the value of products comes from the human work that made them. This discovery is a big moment in human history, but it doesn’t clear up the mystery of how the social nature of work shows up in the products themselves.

In the kind of production we’re talking about—making things to sell—the social nature of individual work is that all kinds of work are equal because they are human work. This equality shows up in the product as its value. Even after science explains this, producers still see it as a real fact, just like how the air’s gases were discovered but the air itself stayed the same.

What producers care about most when trading is how much of another product they can get for theirs. When trading habits become steady, it seems like the value comes from the products themselves. For example, one ton of iron and two ounces of gold might seem naturally equal in value, even though they are very different physically. Once products have value, they keep it by reacting with each other as amounts of value. These amounts change all the time without producers controlling them. To producers, their social action feels like objects controlling them instead of the other way around.

It takes a fully developed market before people realize, from experience, that all the different kinds of private work happening separately are actually balanced out by society’s needs. Why? Because beneath all the random and changing trades, the time needed to produce things pushes through like a natural law—like gravity making a house fall down. So, the value of products depends on the socially necessary work time, even if it looks like values are always changing.

Finding this out shows that value isn’t just random, but it doesn’t change how value is actually decided.

People think about social life and study it in a way that’s opposite to how it actually developed. They start after the fact, with the results already there. The features that make things commodities and let them be traded have already become fixed and normal before people try to understand their real history. So, studying prices helped find the size of value, and money helped set products as values. But money actually hides the social nature of private work and the relationships between producers. Saying coats or boots relate to linen because linen shows human work is kind of silly when you think about it.
