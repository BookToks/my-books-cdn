The Act of 1833 said that factory workers could work from 5:30 in the morning until 8:30 at night, which is 15 hours. Young people between 13 and 18 could work anytime during these hours, but no one young person could work more than 12 hours a day, except in special cases. The law also said that everyone had to have at least one and a half hours to eat every day. Children under 9 were not allowed to work, except for some exceptions. Children between 9 and 13 could only work up to 8 hours a day, and no one between 9 and 18 could work at night, which meant between 8:30 p.m. and 5:30 a.m.

The lawmakers didn’t want to stop adults from working as much as they wanted. They called this “the freedom of labour.” So, they made a special system to stop the Factory Acts from making things worse for adults.

The first report from the Central Board in 1833 said the worst problem was that children had to work as long as adults. The only way to fix this, without limiting adult work (which they thought would cause bigger problems), was to have two groups of children working shifts. This was called the System of Relays. For example, one group of children worked from 5:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., and another group worked from 1:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.

To make things easier for factory owners who had ignored child labor laws for years, Parliament made new rules. After March 1, 1834, no child under 11 could work more than 8 hours a day. After March 1, 1835, no child under 12 could work more than 8 hours, and after March 1, 1836, no child under 13 could work more than 8 hours. This was seen as being very kind to the factory owners, even though famous doctors warned that waiting was dangerous. Dr. Farre said the factory system was a cruel way to cause early death.

At the same time, the same Parliament that made kids work 72 hours a week in factories also passed a law to limit slaves to only 45 hours a week. 

Still not happy, factory owners started complaining loudly for years. They argued about who counted as a child, since children were limited to 8 hours of work and had to go to school sometimes. Factory owners believed kids stopped being children at 10, or at most 11 years old. As the big change in 1836 got closer, these factory owners got more and more angry. They scared the government so much that in 1835, the government thought about lowering the age limit for children from 13 to 12. But outside pressure kept growing, and the government started to lose courage.
