To show how bad things were for the workers, I’ll share a report from someone who visited the hardest-hit areas at the end of 1866 and start of 1867. In places like Poplar, Millwall, Greenwich, Deptford, Limehouse, and Canning Town, about 15,000 workers and their families were completely broke. Also, 3,000 skilled workers were forced to break stones in the workhouse yard after being out of work for more than six months. 

When I tried to get into the workhouse, it was hard because a hungry crowd was waiting for food tickets, but they hadn’t started handing them out yet.

The yard was a big square with a covered area all around it. There were piles of snow on the ground. In the middle were small fenced spaces where men usually worked when the weather was better, but they were covered in snow so no one could sit there. Instead, men were working in the covered area, breaking paving stones into smaller pieces. Each man sat on a big stone and chipped away at the frozen granite with a big hammer until he had broken five bushels of it. When they finished, they got paid threepence and some food.

In another part of the yard, there was a shaky wooden shed full of men huddled together for warmth. They were picking oakum (loose fiber) and arguing about who could work the longest for the smallest amount of food – being tough was a matter of pride. Seven thousand people in this one workhouse were getting help, and many of them had been making the highest wages as skilled workers just six or eight months ago. 

There were even more people who didn’t ask for help because they still had a little left to pawn. After leaving the workhouse, I walked through the streets of mostly small, one-story houses around Poplar. My guide was someone from the Unemployed Committee.

Our first stop was at an ironworker’s home. He had been out of work for 27 weeks. I found him sitting in a small back room with his family. The room wasn’t empty, and there was a fire to keep the kids’ bare feet from freezing because it was very cold. On a tray near the fire, his wife and children were picking oakum in exchange for a small parish allowance. The man worked in the workhouse stone yard for food and threepence a day. He had just come home from work hungry, and his dinner was just a couple of slices of bread with dripping and a cup of tea without milk.

Next door, a middle-aged woman let us into a small back room where her whole family sat quietly staring at a dying fire. The sadness and hopelessness in the room were hard to see. The woman said, “My boys haven’t done anything for 26 weeks, and all our money is gone – all the twenty pounds that me and their father saved when times were better, hoping it would help us when we couldn’t work anymore.”
