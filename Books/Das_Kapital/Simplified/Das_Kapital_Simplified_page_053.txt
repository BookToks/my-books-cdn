A person or a group can be rich, and pearls or diamonds are valuable just because they are pearls or diamonds. So far, no scientist has found any special “exchange value” in pearls or diamonds.

Some economic experts say that the usefulness of things comes from how people use them, not from what they’re made of. But their value, they say, is part of the thing itself. They believe this because usefulness happens without trading—people just use things directly. But value only shows up when things are traded between people, which is a social process.

This idea reminds us of Dogberry, a funny character who says that being good-looking is luck, but learning to read and write happens naturally.

People have long thought that value comes from how things meet our needs or wants. For example, a magnet’s power to pull iron wasn’t useful until people understood how it worked. In old English, “worth” meant how useful something was, while “value” meant how much it could be traded for.

In modern societies, we often pretend that everyone knows everything about the things they buy. Value is seen as the relationship between one thing and another when they are exchanged.

Some say nothing has value by itself—only the amount of money it can get. Others explain that the value of things like food or clothes depends on how much work it takes to make them.

Lastly, products of the same kind are thought of as a group, and their price is set generally without looking at special cases.
