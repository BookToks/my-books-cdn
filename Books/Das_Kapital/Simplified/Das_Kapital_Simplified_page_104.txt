Making things, selling them, and trading stuff—this is the history behind how money and business grew. Modern capitalism started in the 1500s when people began trading all over the world.

If we ignore what’s actually being traded and just look at how trading works, the end result is money. Money is the first way capital shows up.

Historically, capital usually started as money, not land. It first appeared as money owned by merchants or lenders. We don’t need history to see this—every day, new capital shows up as money that needs to be turned into capital through a certain process.

The main difference between money that’s just money and money that’s capital is how it moves around.

The simplest trade is C—M—C, which means selling something to get money, then using that money to buy something else. This is like selling to buy.

But there’s another kind: M—C—M, which means starting with money, buying something, then selling it to get more money. This is buying to sell. When money moves this way, it becomes capital.

Let’s look closer at M—C—M. It has two parts: first, M—C, where money buys something; second, C—M, where that thing is sold for money again. Together, this means buying something to sell it. The end result is money for more money. For example, if I buy 2,000 pounds of cotton for £100 and sell it for £110, I’ve basically exchanged £100 for £110.

It wouldn’t make sense to do M—C—M if you just got back the same amount of money, like £100 for £100. A person who just wants to keep their money wouldn’t risk trading it. But whether the merchant sells the cotton for £110, £100, or £50, his money has gone through a special process that’s different from a farmer selling corn and buying clothes. So, we need to understand the real difference between M—C—M and C—M—C.

First, let’s see what these two forms have in common.
