"So far, the semi-mercantilist ideas of Ganilh arenâ€™t completely wrong," said Wilhelm Roscher in his book from 1858. He used a lot of unclear words like "more," "less," "not enough," and "so far," which made his ideas confusing. Roscher called this confusing style the "anatomico-physiological method" of Political Economy.

But, he did have one good point: he said that money is "a pleasant thing."  

In Chapter 3, called "Money, Or the Circulation of Commodities," Section 1 talks about how we measure value.  

For simplicity, I will use gold as the example of money throughout this work.
