It’s true that he owns a certain amount of capital, like buildings and machines, which were already there when he started his business. But what matters here is not the physical stuff, but the value of that capital. When someone uses all their property but also owes debts equal to what they own, their property is basically just the total amount of their debts. The same happens with the capitalist; when he uses up his original capital, the value of what he has left is just the extra value he got without paying for it. None of the value from his old capital is still there.

Even if the business just keeps going as usual, without adding more, the process of making things turns every capital into more capital, or capital made from the extra value created. Even if the capitalist first got his money by working himself, over time it becomes value taken from the unpaid work of others, either as money or things. We saw before that to turn money into capital, more is needed than just making and selling products. On one side, there’s the person with money or stuff, and on the other, the person who can create value by working. One has the tools and resources, the other only has their ability to work. They meet as buyer and seller. The real basis of capitalism is that workers are separated from what they produce and only sell their ability to work.

What started as just the beginning becomes the normal result of capitalist production. The process keeps turning material things into capital, which helps the capitalist make more wealth and enjoy life more. But the worker stays the same: a source of wealth but without any way to own it. Before starting work, the worker’s labor is already taken away from them by selling it to the capitalist, so during work, the product the worker makes doesn’t belong to them. Since production is how the capitalist uses the worker’s labor, the worker’s product is always turned into capital, things that control the worker’s life and work. The worker makes real wealth, but it becomes something that controls and exploits them. The capitalist creates the worker, but only as someone who sells their labor for wages. This constant cycle of making workers like this is absolutely necessary for capitalism.

The worker uses things in two ways. While working, they use tools and materials to make products that are worth more than the money spent on them. This is productive use. At the same time, the capitalist uses the worker’s labor-power during this process. On the other hand, the worker uses the money they earn to buy what they need to live. This is personal use. So, the worker’s use of things while working and their personal use are completely different.

When working, the worker acts as the force driving capital and belongs to the capitalist. When spending money on their own life, the worker belongs to themselves and takes care of their basic needs outside of work.
