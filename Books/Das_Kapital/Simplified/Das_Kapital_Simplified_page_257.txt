The more work is divided into smaller tasks, the more money is needed to keep the same number of workers busy. This money pays for tools, materials, and other things. The way tools and machines are grouped together and the way work is split up go hand in hand, just like how government power and personal interests are connected.

Dugald Stewart called factory workers “living robots” because they only do small, repetitive parts of a job. In coral colonies, each individual acts like the stomach for the whole group, feeding everyone instead of taking for itself like a rich Roman noble.

A worker who knows a whole craft can go anywhere and find work to live on. But a factory worker is just a small part of a machine. If they are separated from other workers, they lose their skills and freedom, and they have to follow whatever rules are given to them.

Some thinkers said that the skilled worker keeps what the factory worker loses. Over time, the people with knowledge and the workers become very different. Knowledge, instead of helping workers get better at their jobs, often works against them by making their work mechanical and controlled.

Adam Smith, a famous economist, learned from A. Ferguson that dividing work too much can cause problems. Smith praised division of labor in his book but also warned it causes social inequality. Later, he explained how this kind of work division is linked to capitalism.

Ferguson even said that thinking can become a special kind of job in times when work is very divided.

In 1713, Ramazzini studied diseases that workers get from their jobs. Since then, many more work-related health problems have been discovered, especially in modern factories. In 1854, a group was set up to study these industrial illnesses.
