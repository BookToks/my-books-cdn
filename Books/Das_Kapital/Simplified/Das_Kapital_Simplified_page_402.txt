The result of one thing is that the capitalist lives; the result of the other is that the worker lives.

When talking about the working day, we saw that the worker often has to treat their own needs as just part of making things. In this case, they get what they need to keep working, like coal and water help a steam engine run. The worker’s needs are just part of the tools needed to produce goods. This idea isn’t something only found in capitalism.

But things look different when we think about the whole capitalist system, with all the capitalists and all the workers. When a capitalist uses some money to pay workers, they actually increase the value of all their money. They get benefits not just from what the worker produces, but also from what they give the worker to live on. The money paid to workers becomes things they need to stay alive and able to work, and also helps create new workers.

Within what is really necessary, the worker’s personal use of things is actually turning those things back into work power that the capitalist can use again. The worker’s personal needs, whether done inside or outside the workplace, are part of producing the worker, who is a key part of production for the capitalist. Just like cleaning machines is part of keeping production going, the worker’s consumption is part of keeping the whole system running.

Even if the worker eats or uses things for their own reasons, not to please the capitalist, it still helps production. Like how a horse eating food is necessary for it to work, even if it enjoys the food. The working class has to be maintained and reproduced for capitalism to keep going. But the capitalist doesn’t worry about this too much; they just want to keep the worker’s needs as low as possible, only enough to keep them working. They don’t force workers to eat better food, like some harsh bosses might.

So, capitalists and their supporters think only the part of the worker’s needs that keeps the worker going is useful, and anything extra the worker uses just for fun is wasted. If wages and worker spending go up without making the worker more productive, that extra money doesn’t help capitalism grow.

In reality, the worker’s personal use doesn’t help the worker themselves make more or better things; it just keeps them alive. But it does help the capitalist and the government, because it helps produce the power that creates wealth. From society’s view, the working class, even when not working, is just another part of capital, like machines or tools.

Even the worker’s personal use of things is, to some degree, part of making things. The system makes sure workers don’t just quit, by taking away what they produce and moving it to capital.
