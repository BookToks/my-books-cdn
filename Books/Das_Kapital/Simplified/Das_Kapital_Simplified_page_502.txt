For a long time, England has been taking resources from Irish soil without helping the farmers there replace what was lost. This has caused the land to become less productive per acre.

Ireland is often seen as a place where population keeps growing a lot. Before his famous work on population, Th. Sadler wrote a book called “Ireland, its Evils and their Remedies” in 1829. He showed that the more people there are, the less poor the area is, which goes against what Malthus said.

Between 1851 and 1874, over 2.3 million people left Ireland.

In 1870, a report showed that almost 95% of farms in Ireland were smaller than 100 acres, while only about 5% were bigger than that.

There were reports about farm workers’ wages in Dublin in 1870, and other official reports from 1861.

The total land area includes peat, bogs, and unused land.

The famine and what happened after it were used on purpose by landlords and the English government to change farming in Ireland and reduce the population to a size landlords liked. I will explain this more in Volume III of this work. For now, here is a quote from Nassau W. Senior’s book from 1868: “We now have our Poor Law, which helps landlords win. Even more powerful is emigration. No one who cares about Ireland wants the fight between landlords and small farmers to last longer, or for the tenants to win. The sooner it ends, and Ireland becomes mostly grazing land with fewer people, the better for everyone.”

In 1815, the English Corn Laws gave Ireland the right to sell corn freely in Great Britain, encouraging corn farming. But when the Corn Laws were ended in 1846, Ireland lost this advantage. This caused many farms to switch from growing crops to raising animals, farms got bigger, and small farmers were kicked out. People who had once praised Irish soil for growing wheat suddenly said it was only good for feeding animals.
