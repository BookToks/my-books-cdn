There are many ways that the length of work, how productive the work is, and how hard people work can change together. Sometimes two of these things change while the third stays the same. Other times, all three change at once. They can change by different amounts and even in opposite ways, which can make their effects cancel each other out, either partly or completely. But it’s easy to understand all these situations by looking at each factor separately while keeping the others the same. So, we will quickly look at two important examples.

A. When work becomes less productive but the workday gets longer

When we talk about work becoming less productive, we mean industries where the value of work depends on things like farming. For example, if the soil gets less fertile, the products become more expensive. Imagine a 12-hour workday creates value worth 6 shillings. Half of this pays for the worker's own needs, and the other half is extra value made for the boss.

Now, if the price of farm products goes up, the cost of keeping a worker goes from 3 shillings to 4, so the worker needs to work 8 hours just to cover their own needs instead of 6. If the workday stays 12 hours, the extra work time shrinks from 6 to 4 hours, and the extra value made drops from 3 shillings to 2.

But if the workday gets longer by 2 hours (to 14 hours), the extra work stays at 6 hours, and the extra value stays at 3 shillings. However, compared to the worker’s own time, the extra value is less. If the day gets longer by 4 hours (to 16 hours), the ratio between extra work and necessary work stays the same, but the total extra value goes up from 3 to 4 shillings, and the extra work time goes from 6 to 8 hours, a 33% increase.

So, when work becomes less productive but the workday gets longer at the same time, the total extra value can stay the same even if its relative size goes down; or the relative size can stay the same while the total value goes up; or if the day gets long enough, both can increase.

Between 1799 and 1815, food prices in England went up, so wages seemed to rise too. But real wages, meaning what workers could actually buy with their pay, went down. Some economists thought this meant that less productive farm work caused the extra value for bosses to fall. They used this idea to study wages, profits, and rent. But actually, during this time, extra value went up both in total and relative terms because workers worked harder and longer hours. This was a time when bosses made rules to extend work hours a lot. It was a time of fast capital growth in some places and extreme poverty in others.
