The result he ends up with is exactly the idea Ricardo wanted to prove wrong. After thinking really hard, he proudly tells Malthus: "This, sir, is the solid idea without which it's impossible, I say, to explain the biggest problems in economics, especially how a country can get richer even when its products lose value, even though wealth is value."

An English economist comments on the tricky ways Say talks in his "Letters": "Those fancy ways of speaking mostly make up what Mr. Say calls his theory, which he really wants Malthus to teach at Hertford, as it’s already taught in many parts of Europe. He says, ‘If you think all these ideas sound strange, look at what they actually mean, and I believe you’ll find them very simple and reasonable.’" Of course, after this, they seem anything but new or original.

MacCulloch came up with the idea of “wages of past labour” long before Senior talked about “wages of abstinence.” Jeremy Bentham also has ideas worth comparing here.

Bentham is a very English figure. Even the German philosopher Christian Wolff doesn’t act as confidently about simple ideas as Bentham did. The idea of usefulness wasn’t Bentham’s discovery. He just repeated, in a boring way, what French thinkers like Helvétius said in the 18th century. To know what’s useful for a dog, you have to understand dog nature. You can’t figure that out just by looking at usefulness.

Applying this to people, if you want to judge all human actions by usefulness, you first need to understand human nature in general and how it changes over time. Bentham skips all that. He just takes the modern English shopkeeper as the “normal” person. Whatever is useful to this odd shopkeeper and his world is totally useful. Then he uses this as a standard for the past, present, and future.

For example, he says Christianity is "useful" because it stops bad behavior, just like laws do. But he calls art criticism "harmful" because it bothers people who like simple, popular things. With ideas like this and his motto “no day without a line,” he wrote tons of books. If I were braver, like my friend Heinrich Heine, I’d call Bentham a genius at being boringly stupid.

Political economists often treat a certain amount of capital and workers as if they always produce the same amount of power or work. But some people argue that saying only goods produce things means production can never grow. That’s because to make more, you first need more food, raw materials, and tools. So, growth would be impossible without already having growth.

John Stuart Mill says in his “Principles of Political Economy” that the worst and most disgusting jobs usually get paid the least. The nastier the job, the more likely it is to get the lowest pay.
