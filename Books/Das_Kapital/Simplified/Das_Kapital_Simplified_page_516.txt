Professor Rogers used to teach Political Economy at Oxford University, which was a center of strict Protestant beliefs. In the introduction to his book "History of Agriculture," he points out that most people became poorer because of the Reformation.

In a letter written in 1795 by a man from Suffolk, he talks about how expensive food had become. Even someone who strongly supported big farms, the author of a 1773 book about food prices, said he was sad to see small landowners disappear. These small landowners used to keep the country independent. Now, their lands were owned by rich lords who rented them out to small farmers. These farmers had to follow strict rules and were almost like servants who had to obey their landlords.

About one rich man’s character, there are stories showing how the king gave large amounts of land to Lady Orkney in 1695 because of her influence. Some say she helped the king in ways that were more personal than political. This is recorded in old letters stored in the British Museum.

The way the Crown’s lands were sold or given away illegally is seen as a huge scandal in English history. It was like a massive trick against the nation. For more details on how the big landowners got their land, you can read the book "Our Old Nobility."

There’s also a pamphlet by E. Burke about the powerful Bedford family, whose member Lord John Russell was known as a weak Liberal politician.

Farmers often told poor people living in cottages they couldn’t keep animals like chickens or cows. They said if these people had animals, they might steal from the farmers’ barns. Farmers wanted to keep the poor people poor so they would work hard. But really, the farmers wanted to control all the common land for themselves.

There are also letters and books from the 1700s discussing big farms, food prices, and land enclosures. Some important writers you should know about are Nathaniel Forster, Thomas Wright, Rev. Addington, Dr. R. Price, and James Anderson. Their work is much better than the boring stuff written by MacCulloch in 1845.

Back in ancient Rome, rich people took most of the land from poor people. They bought some nearby land and forced others to give up their land. This way, they ended up farming large estates instead of small, separate fields.
