The way the economy works in society doesn’t change much, even when politics get messy.

Guilds had strict rules that limited how many apprentices and workers one master could have. This stopped masters from becoming rich business owners.

Also, masters could only use their workers in the specific craft they were trained in. Guilds were very protective and didn’t let merchants’ money take over. Merchants could buy goods but couldn’t buy workers’ labor. They only dealt with finished products, not the work itself. If more specialized jobs were needed, guilds would split into smaller groups or create new guilds, but they never combined different crafts in one place. So, while guilds helped improve and protect crafts, they didn’t let workers and tools separate, which is needed for big manufacturing. Workers still owned their tools, like a snail carries its shell, so there wasn’t any real “capital” or investment from employers.

Dividing work between people in society happens in lots of ways, but dividing work inside a workshop like in factories only started under capitalism.

Section 5: Manufacturing under Capitalism

Having more workers controlled by one boss is the starting point for teamwork and factory work. But in manufacturing, splitting jobs into smaller tasks means you need a certain number of workers just to make it work. To get the benefits of dividing work even more, you have to add more workers in groups doing different tasks. This means the boss needs to invest more money not just in workers but also in tools, workshops, and materials. The amount of materials used grows faster than the number of workers because dividing work makes workers more productive. So, the boss has to keep investing more money all the time. In manufacturing, working together like this belongs to the boss’s capital. The power to produce things comes from the boss’s money, not just the workers.

Manufacturing doesn’t just put workers under the boss’s control—it also creates a hierarchy among workers themselves. Simple teamwork lets workers keep working how they usually do, but manufacturing changes everything. It takes control of the workers’ skills and work habits right from the start.
