Here’s a simple way to understand the changes in farming between 1864 and 1865.

For wheat, the amount of land used went down by 9,494 acres. The amount of wheat produced per acre also dropped a little, from 13.0 to 12.7 quarters. Because of this, the total wheat produced dropped by 48,999 quarters.

Oats were grown on 69,658 fewer acres, but the yield per acre went up slightly. Still, the total oat harvest fell by 166,605 quarters.

Barley was grown on 4,402 more acres, but the amount produced per acre went down a bit. So, total barley production went down by 29,892 quarters.

Bere (a type of barley) was grown on 1,197 more acres, but the yield per acre dropped. Total production also went down by 1,171 quarters.

Rye was grown on fewer acres, but the yield per acre increased. Total rye production went up by 5,684 quarters.

Potatoes were grown on 26,536 more acres, but the yield per acre fell a little. Still, total potato production dropped by 446,398 tons.

Turnips were grown on 3,143 fewer acres, with a small drop in yield per acre. Total turnip production went down by 165,976 tons.

Mangold-wurzel (a root vegetable) was grown on 316 more acres, with a better yield per acre. Total production increased by 44,653 tons.

Cabbages were grown on 1,801 more acres, with a slightly higher yield. Total cabbage production rose by 52,877 tons.

Flax was grown on 50,260 fewer acres, and the yield per acre fell a lot. Total flax production dropped by 24,945 stones.

Hay was grown on 68,924 more acres, with a slightly higher yield. Total hay production went up by 461,554 tons.

Now, about income tax in Britain from 1860 to 1865:

Income from renting land (Schedule A) stayed pretty steady, with a small increase in 1865.

Farmers’ profits (Schedule B) were also steady, with a small rise in 1865.

Profits from industry and other sources (Schedule D) dropped a bit in 1864 but went back up in 1865.

The total income from all these sources combined stayed about the same, with a slight increase in 1865.
