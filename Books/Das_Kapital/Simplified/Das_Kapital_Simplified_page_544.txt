There is a problem when many small producers and owners spread out national wealth. When production is divided among lots of individual people working alone, it stops big projects that need lots of money and time from happening. In Europe, capital is invested quickly because there are always extra workers ready to work. But in the colonies, things are different.

Wakefield tells a sad story. He talked to some rich people in Canada and New York where many immigrants come but then leave. One capitalist said their money was ready to start big projects, but they couldn’t begin because the workers would leave soon. They would have hired workers if they knew they could keep them or get new ones whenever needed.  

Wakefield compares English farming, which uses combined labor, with American farming where peasants work separately. He shows that Americans are better off, independent, and more skilled, while English farm workers are very poor. In England, even farm horses are better fed than people. Still, national wealth often means people suffer.  

How can the colonies fix this problem? If all the land was quickly sold to private owners, it would end the problem but also harm the colonies. The trick is to do both things at once. The government should set a high, fixed price for land that forces immigrants to work for many years before they can buy land and become independent farmers.  

The money from selling the land at this high price comes from the workers’ wages, breaking the normal rules of supply and demand. The government uses this money to bring more poor immigrants to the colonies, keeping plenty of workers for the rich people who own capital.  

This plan is called “systematic colonisation.” Wakefield says the supply of workers will always be steady because no one can buy land until they have worked enough to earn money. When workers finally buy land, their payment helps bring in new workers to replace them.  

The land price must be high enough to stop workers from becoming independent too fast. This “sufficient price” is just a fancy way of saying workers pay a fee to the rich people before they can leave wage labor and farm independently. First, workers create wealth for the capitalists, then they pay to leave and help bring in new workers to take their place.
