“Order has to be set up somehow,” says the famous writer of the “Essay on Trade and Commerce” back in 1770. Then, 66 years later, Dr. Andrew Ure repeats, “Order” was missing in manufacturing because of the strict idea of dividing work into small parts, and “Arkwright brought order.”

At that time, manufacturing couldn’t fully take over how society made things or totally change that process. It grew as an economic masterpiece based on town crafts and rural home industries. But as it developed, the limited technical base of manufacturing started to clash with new production needs that manufacturing itself created.

One of its most advanced results was a workshop that made the tools and machines needed for work, especially the complex machines already in use.

Ure says a machine factory “showed the division of labor in many levels – each tool like a file, drill, or lathe had its own skilled worker.” This workshop, made possible by dividing labor in manufacturing, made machines. These machines eventually replaced the craftsman’s work as the main way society produced things. So, the idea that a worker had to do one small job forever was broken. Also, the limits that idea put on capital (money/business) were removed.

For a more recent example: the silk spinning and weaving in Lyon and Nîmes is “totally family-based; it employs many women and children but doesn’t wear them out or harm them; it lets them stay in their beautiful valleys like Drôme, Var, Isère, and Vaucluse, where they raise silkworms and unwind cocoons. It never became a real factory.

But the division of labor here is special. There are winders, throwsters, dyers, sizers, and weavers, but they don’t work in the same place or under one boss; they all work independently.” Since Blanqui wrote this, some of these workers have joined factories. And since Marx wrote, power-looms have entered these factories and are quickly replacing handlooms by 1886. (The Krefeld silk industry also has its own story about this.)

“The more a complex manufacture is spread out and given to different specialists, the better and faster the work gets done with less wasted time and effort.” (“The Advantages of the East India Trade,” London, 1720.)

“Easy work leads to learned skill.” (Th. Hodgskin, “Popular Political Economy.”)

In Egypt, crafts reached a high level of skill because workers were only allowed to do the job their family clan had done by law, never interfering with other groups.
