Dr. Simon says that more tailors and printers in London between 25 and 35 years old die than expected. This is because many young people from the countryside, up to 30 years old, come to London as “apprentices” or “improvers” to get better at their trade. They are counted as Londoners in the census, which makes the death rate in London look higher since these young people often go back home if they get very sick.

Hammered nails are different from nails made by machines. The information about this comes from reports on child employment.

In England, most millinery (hat-making) and dressmaking happen at the employer’s place. Some women live there and work, while others come from outside.

Mr. White, a commissioner, visited a military clothing factory with 1,000 to 1,200 workers, mostly women. He also saw a shoe factory with 1,300 workers, about half of whom were kids and young people.

One week in 1864, five people died from starvation according to official reports. On the same day, a newspaper reported another case. That’s six starvation deaths in just one week!

The cost of renting workrooms is a big factor in how work is organized. In big cities like London, the old way of giving small jobs to families or small employers has lasted the longest, especially in shoemaking.

In glove-making and some other industries, the workers live in very poor conditions, almost like being very poor or homeless.

In Leicester alone, in 1864, there were 800 sewing machines used in the boot and shoe trade.

Some examples of big factories are the Army Clothing Depot in London, a shirt factory in Londonderry, and a clothes factory in Limerick that employs about 1,200 people.

The way factories work is changing a lot, like it did in lace making and weaving. Stocking making used to be done by hand, but since 1846 machines powered by steam have taken over. In 1862, about 129,000 people in England worked in stocking making, but only 4,063 were covered by factory safety laws.
