Surplus-value comes only from paying workers, and we learned that the amount of surplus-value depends on two things: how much extra work workers do beyond what's needed, and how many workers are working at the same time. The length of the workday affects the first part, which is the extra work done after the necessary work is finished. The number of workers depends on how much money is spent on workers compared to machines and materials.

Using machines can increase the extra work by making workers more productive, but it also means fewer workers are needed for the same amount of money. Machines replace workers, turning money spent on workers into money spent on machines, which don’t create extra value. For example, you can’t get as much extra work from 2 workers as from 24. If each of the 24 workers does one extra hour in a 12-hour day, together they give 24 extra hours, while 2 workers only give 24 hours total.

So, using machines to make more surplus-value brings a problem. You can’t increase the extra work without lowering the number of workers. This problem becomes clear when the price of goods made by machines sets the price for all similar goods. Because of this, the boss, often without realizing it, makes workers work longer days to make up for having fewer workers doing extra work.

Machine use in capitalism pushes bosses to make workdays longer. It changes how people work and how society’s work system works, breaking down any resistance to longer hours. At the same time, machines create a bigger group of unemployed or underemployed workers who have no choice but to accept the boss’s terms. This is why machines have removed almost all limits on how long people work.

This creates an odd situation: the best tool for making work faster and easier actually forces workers to spend more time working. Long ago, Aristotle imagined a world where tools could work by themselves, so no one would need slaves or apprentices. Another ancient poet praised the water wheel—the first kind of machine—for freeing slaves and bringing a golden age. But they didn’t understand, like later economists did, that machinery actually makes workdays longer.

Maybe they thought slavery was okay if it helped others live better, but to say most people should be forced to work longer just so a few could become rich business owners shows they didn’t understand the true meaning of fairness or kindness.
