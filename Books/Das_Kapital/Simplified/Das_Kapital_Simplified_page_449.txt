The bigger the group of poor working people and the extra workers waiting for jobs, the more official poverty there is. This is a basic rule of how capitalism works. Like all rules, it can change a bit depending on different things, but we won’t get into that now.

It’s clear now that it’s silly to tell workers they should just accept having fewer jobs because that’s what capitalism needs. Capitalism itself always adjusts the number of workers. First, it creates extra workers who don’t have jobs, called the industrial reserve army. In the end, this causes more and more working people to suffer and many to become poor.

There’s a rule that says as technology and productivity get better, less human work is needed to make more stuff. But in capitalism, where workers don’t own the tools but are used by them, this rule flips. The better workers get at producing, the harder it is for them to find steady jobs. This means their lives become more unstable because they have to sell their work to make someone else richer. Even though tools and productivity grow faster than workers, workers still grow faster than the jobs available, making their situation worse.

We learned earlier that in capitalism, all ways to make workers produce more actually hurt the workers themselves. These ways turn into ways to control and exploit workers. They break workers down, making them just parts of machines, ruining any joy in their work and making it hated. Workers lose the chance to think and be creative because machines and science take over. Their work conditions get worse, bosses become more controlling and mean, and workers’ whole lives turn into work time, pulling their families down with them. But all these methods also help businesses grow bigger. So, as businesses get richer, workers’ situations get worse, no matter how much they get paid. The rule that links the number of extra workers to how much businesses grow keeps workers stuck to capitalism, like Prometheus chained to a rock. This means that as wealth grows for some, misery, hard work, slavery, ignorance, and mental suffering grow for the workers. This opposite relationship between rich and poor is noticed by many economists, but they often mix it up with similar problems from before capitalism existed.

The Venetian monk Ortes, a famous 18th-century economist, thought this conflict in capitalism was a natural law about how society’s wealth works.
