In 1844, Saunders, a factory inspector, said that some women working in factories had to work from 6 a.m. until midnight for many weeks in a row. They only got less than 2 hours for meals. This meant that on five days each week, they only had 6 hours left to travel home and get some rest.

Sometimes, machines get damaged if they are not used enough. Also, machines often get replaced by newer, better ones before they even wear out. For example, the first version of a new machine can cost about five times more than the second version.

There were big improvements in machines used to make net fabric. One machine that cost £1,200 was sold a few years later for just £60 because better machines came out so quickly. Because of these fast changes, some machines were never finished and were left unused.

During these busy times, tulle makers started having two shifts so their factories ran 24 hours a day instead of just 8 hours.

Manufacturers sometimes use extra money to buy more raw materials without needing more buildings or machines. This helps them make more products when demand changes.

There are always costs that don’t change whether the factory is working a little or a lot, like rent, taxes, insurance, and some workers’ wages. These fixed costs make it important for factories to run long hours to make enough profit.

Some economists don’t realize how this creates problems for factory owners. Ricardo, a famous economist, understood that machines not only produce goods but can also create extra workers who aren’t needed.

Lastly, a poem by Stolberg shows how old and modern ideas about work and machines are very different from each other.
