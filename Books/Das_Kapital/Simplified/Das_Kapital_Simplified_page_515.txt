People who know a lot about wars generally agree that the main strength of an army comes from its foot soldiers, or infantry. To have good infantry, you need men who are raised freely and with enough resources, not as poor or low-status workers.

So, if a country is mostly made up of nobles and gentlemen, while farmers and workers are treated just like laborers or poor villagers, you can have a good cavalry (soldiers on horses), but you won’t have strong infantry soldiers. This is what happens in places like France and Italy, where society is split between nobles and peasants.

Because of this, those countries often have to hire mercenaries, like Swiss soldiers, to make up their infantry. That’s why these nations have many people but not many real soldiers.

In old times, the amount of land given to workers was actually quite large, enough for them to be small farmers rather than just laborers. Also, the poor had a legal right to share in church tithes (a kind of tax or donation).

During the Protestant Reformation, some wealthy farmers in southern England came up with a plan about how to handle the poor under the law. They suggested building a prison in their parish and allowing only those willing to be locked up and work there to get help. They thought this would stop people from asking for help unless they agreed to work hard, and if anyone died while being looked after, the blame would be on the person caring for them.

In Scotland, serfdom (a form of slavery) ended later than in England. In 1698, a man named Fletcher of Saltoun said there were about 200,000 beggars in Scotland and suggested bringing back serfdom to force people to work and stop begging. Some people thought that ending serfdom caused poverty, but actually, it was the loss of land ownership by farm workers that made them poor.

In France, similar laws about poor relief were made in 1571 and 1656, much like the poor laws in England.
