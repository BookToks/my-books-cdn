The time needed to make 20 yards of linen or 1 coat can change if weaving or tailoring gets faster or slower. Now, we will look at how these changes affect the value of things compared to each other.

I. Imagine the value of the linen changes, but the coat’s value stays the same. For example, if the soil for growing flax gets worse and it takes twice as long to make the linen, then the linen’s value doubles too. Before, 20 yards of linen was equal to 1 coat, but now 20 yards of linen equals 2 coats because the coat only has half the work time compared to the linen. On the other hand, if better machines make the linen twice as fast, the linen’s value goes down by half. So, 20 yards of linen would equal just half a coat. The value of one thing compared to another goes up or down depending on how its own value changes, if the other thing’s value stays the same.

II. Now, imagine the linen’s value stays the same, but the coat’s value changes. If bad weather makes wool harder to get and it takes twice as long to make a coat, then 20 yards of linen equals half a coat. But if coats suddenly take less work and their value drops by half, then 20 yards of linen equals 2 coats. So, if one thing’s value stays the same, its value compared to another thing changes in the opposite way as the other thing’s value.

When we compare these two cases, we see the same change in value can happen for totally different reasons. For example, 20 yards of linen equals 2 coats either because the linen’s value doubled or the coat’s value fell in half. And 20 yards of linen equals half a coat either because the linen’s value dropped or the coat’s value doubled.

III. What if the time needed to make linen and coats both change by the same amount and in the same direction? In this case, 20 yards of linen would still equal 1 coat, no matter how their values changed. You would only notice their value change if you compared them to a third thing whose value didn’t change. If all values of things went up or down by the same amount at the same time, their values compared to each other would stay the same. The real change would be seen in how many things can be made in a certain time.

IV. The time needed to make linen and coats can also change at different rates or in different directions. The effects of these changes on their relative value can be figured out using the ideas from I, II, and III.

So, real changes in value don’t always show clearly when we compare one thing’s value to another’s. A thing’s relative value can change even if its real value stays the same. Or its relative value might stay the same even if its real value changes. And sometimes, changes in real value and relative value don’t match up exactly.

3. The Equivalent Form of Value  
We have seen that when linen (commodity A) shows its value by comparing it to a different kind of thing, like a coat, it also gives the coat a special value form called the equivalent.
