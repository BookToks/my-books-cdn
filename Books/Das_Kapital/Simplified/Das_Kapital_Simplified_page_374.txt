According to this, the extra work done by the English farm worker is three times more than the work he needs to do just to get by. This means the worker is exploited 300%.

People often treat the working day as if it always stays the same length. Using certain formulas, they compare the extra work with a fixed working day length. This is also true when only looking at how the value created is shared. The working day that creates value must be a certain length.

The habit of showing extra value and the value of work as parts of the total value hides what really happens with capital. Capital involves the exchange of money for living work, and the worker being cut out from owning the product. Instead of this real situation, it looks like the worker and boss just share the product based on what they put into making it. Also, you can switch between different formulas to show this. For example, if there is 6 hours of extra work in a 12-hour day, then 6 hours is the necessary work and 6 hours is the extra work, both counted as 100%.

There is another formula that shows unpaid work equals extra work, and paid work equals necessary work. After studying this, it’s clear that the boss doesn’t pay for the work itself, but for the worker’s ability to work. The boss pays for the value of this ability and then uses the worker’s actual work. Part of the day, the worker produces value equal to what the boss paid for. The boss gets this product like buying something ready-made. But during the extra work time, the boss gets value without paying anything for it. This extra work is free for the boss, which is why it’s called unpaid labour.

So, capital isn’t just control over work, like Adam Smith said. It really means control over unpaid work. All profit, interest, or rent comes from this unpaid work.
