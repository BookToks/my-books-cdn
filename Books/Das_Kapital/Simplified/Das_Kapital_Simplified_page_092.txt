From experience and history, when two things are supposed to measure value, usually only one actually does that job in real life. (Karl Marx)

In England, gold is used as the main money standard, but the pound sterling isn’t a simple part of that gold weight. This happened because the money system was first made for silver coins, so silver can be divided easily into coins. But gold came later, so an ounce of gold can’t be split into exact coin parts. (Maclaren)

English writers often mix up what “measure of value” and “standard of price” mean, and they use these terms incorrectly all the time.

This mix-up isn’t true everywhere or all the time.

Because of this, the pound sterling now weighs less than one-third of what it used to; other old currencies like the pound Scot, the French livre, the Spanish maravedi, and the Portuguese rei weigh even less compared to their original amounts.

Old coins that we don’t use physically anymore were once real coins, and because they were real, people used them for counting and calculating money. (Galiani)

David Urquhart said it’s strange that a pound sterling today equals only about a quarter of an ounce of gold. He called this a “fake measure,” not a real standard, and blamed modern civilization for messing it up.

When asked why the Greeks used money, Anacharsis said it was for “reckoning,” meaning for counting and keeping track of value.

Money can be confusing because the same numbers can mean both the weight of gold and the price of things. For example, £3 17s. 10½d. could mean an ounce of gold or the cost of a ton of iron. This caused the wrong idea that the government sets gold’s value by naming weights, but that’s not true. (Karl Marx)

Some people thought that by changing the amount of gold or silver that money represented, they could change its value. But smart thinkers like William Petty said this is nonsense, and if wealth could be increased by simply declaring it, governments would have done it a long time ago.

Finally, it must be accepted that having a million in money is worth more than having the same value in goods. (Le Trosne)
