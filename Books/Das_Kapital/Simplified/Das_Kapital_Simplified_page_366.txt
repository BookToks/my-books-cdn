It’s obvious that if you have a fixed amount made up of two parts, one part can’t get bigger without the other part getting smaller. 

Let’s say both parts start off equal: 3 shillings for the value of labor and 3 shillings for surplus value. The value of labor can’t go up from 3 to 4 shillings unless the surplus value goes down from 3 to 2 shillings. And the surplus value can’t go up from 3 to 4 shillings unless the value of labor goes down from 3 to 2 shillings. So, the size of either part can’t change without the other part changing in the opposite way. They can’t both go up or down at the same time.

Also, the value of labor can’t go down, and surplus value can’t go up, without labor becoming more productive. For example, the value of labor can’t drop from 3 to 2 shillings unless workers can now make the same things in 4 hours instead of 6. On the other hand, the value of labor can’t go up from 3 to 4 shillings unless workers take longer—like 8 hours instead of 6—to make the same things. This means that when labor gets more productive, the value of labor goes down and surplus value goes up. When labor gets less productive, the value of labor goes up and surplus value goes down.

Ricardo missed one thing: even though surplus value and the value of labor always move in opposite directions, they don’t always change by the same amount. They go up or down by the same number, but not by the same percentage.

How much they change in proportion depends on their starting sizes before productivity changed. For example, if the value of labor is 4 shillings (or 8 hours needed for necessary work) and surplus value is 2 shillings (or 4 hours of extra work), and productivity improves so the value of labor drops to 3 shillings (or 6 hours), then surplus value will rise to 3 shillings (or 6 hours). The value of labor goes down by 1 shilling or 2 hours, and surplus value goes up by the same amount. But the percentage change is different. The value of labor falls by 25%, while surplus value rises by 50%. So, the smaller the original surplus value, the bigger the percentage change when productivity changes; the bigger the original surplus value, the smaller the percentage change.

Finally, changes in surplus value always happen because of opposite changes in the value of labor—they don’t cause those changes themselves. Since the workday length stays the same, and every change in surplus value matches an opposite change in labor value, and since labor value only changes when productivity changes, it means that changes in surplus value come from opposite changes in labor value. And because labor value and surplus value can’t change in size without changing their relationship to each other, any change in their relationship must come from a previous change in labor value.
