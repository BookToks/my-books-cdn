When the big banks first started, even though they had official names, they were just groups of private investors. These investors worked with governments and, because they got special privileges, they could lend money to the country. So, the amount of national debt grew as these banks got bigger, especially after the Bank of England was created in 1694.

The Bank of England began by lending money to the government with an 8% interest rate. Parliament also let the bank create money by making banknotes from the same money it loaned. The bank used these notes to make more loans, buy goods, and buy precious metals. Soon, the bank’s own money became the way it lent to the government and paid the interest on the public debt. The bank always stayed a creditor to the country, meaning it was still owed money. Over time, it became the place where the country’s metal money was kept and the main center for business loans.

At that time, many people were surprised by the rise of these bankers, investors, brokers, and stock traders. This is shown in writings from that era, like those by Bolingbroke. Along with the national debt, an international credit system started that helped some countries get rich. For example, Venice’s dishonest ways helped build Holland’s wealth, as Venice lent Holland a lot of money. The same happened between Holland and England. By the early 1700s, Holland’s factories were no longer the best, and it was losing its leading role in trade and industry. So, from 1701 to 1776, Holland’s main business was lending huge amounts of money, especially to England, its big rival. Today, a similar thing happens between England and the United States. Much of the money in the U.S. today used to come from England, often from hard work and suffering.

Since the national debt depends on public income to pay interest every year, the modern tax system was needed to support it. Loans let governments pay for big expenses without people feeling it right away, but this means taxes have to go up later. Because debts keep building, taxes keep rising, and governments need more loans to cover new costs. Modern taxes mostly target essential goods, making them more expensive, which causes taxes to rise on their own. In Holland, where this system started, a leader named DeWitt praised it as the best way to make workers obedient, hardworking, and always busy. Although this system hurts workers, the bigger problem is that it forces farmers, craftsmen, and most of the lower middle class to lose their land and money. Even many economists agree on this. The system’s effect gets worse because of protectionist policies, which are part of it.

Because public debt and taxes have helped create wealth for some and take it from many, some writers like Cobbett wrongly think this is the main cause of modern poverty.
