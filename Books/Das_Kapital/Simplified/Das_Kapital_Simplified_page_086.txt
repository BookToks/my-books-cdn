Money is just a thing you can own, like any other object. Because of this, social power becomes personal power for individuals. Long ago, people criticized money because they thought it messed up how the economy and morals worked. But modern society, soon after it began, pulled gold out of the earth and treats it like a treasure, seeing it as the symbol of life itself.

A commodity is something that meets a specific need and is part of material wealth. But the value of a commodity shows how much it is wanted compared to other things, and this value shows how rich its owner is. For people in simple societies, or even peasants in Europe, value and the form value takes are the same. So, for them, having more gold or silver means having more value. The value of money can change because of changes in money itself or in other commodities. Still, 200 ounces of gold always have more value than 100 ounces. Gold continues to be the universal standard for comparing the value of all goods and represents all human work. People want to keep hoarding money endlessly. Money can be turned into anything, so it has unlimited power as a symbol of wealth.

But, at the same time, any amount of money you have is limited, so it can only buy so much. This conflict between money’s endless power and its limited amount pushes people to keep collecting more, like Sisyphus pushing his rock uphill without stopping. It’s like a conqueror who always sees new lands to take after each victory.

For gold to be kept as money and saved up, it must not be spent or turned into things for fun. The person hoarding gold gives up pleasure for the sake of keeping their money. They follow a strict rule of saving and working hard. But they can only take out of circulation as much money as they put in by selling things. So, working hard, saving, and wanting more money are their main qualities. Selling a lot and buying little is their main goal in managing money. Besides just saving gold, people also like to own gold and silver objects to show wealth. This desire to look rich grows as society gets richer. People say, “Let’s be rich or at least look rich.”

This creates a bigger market for gold and silver that isn’t about money but about owning fancy things. It also creates a backup supply of precious metals that people use mostly in tough times or during social problems.

Saving money this way helps the system of gold and silver coins. Because the flow and speed of buying and selling goods change all the time, the amount of money in use goes up and down too. The amount of money must be able to grow or shrink. Sometimes, money needs to be pulled in to be used as coins, and other times, coins need to be taken out so money can stay still as savings. To keep the right amount of money moving around, there must be more gold and silver in a country than what is needed just for coins. This is why money is saved up in hoards.
