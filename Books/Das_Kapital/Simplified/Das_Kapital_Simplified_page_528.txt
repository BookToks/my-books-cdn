Chapter 30: How the Agricultural Revolution Affected Industry and Created a Market for Industrial Capital

When farmers were kicked off their land again and again, many people moved to the towns to work in factories. These new workers weren’t part of old trade groups or guilds, which helped industries grow. Because of this, some people, like historian A. Anderson, thought it was like fate or destiny helping this change happen.

We need to think more about how this happened. When there were fewer independent farmers working their own land, more people crowded into the cities to work in factories, kind of like how stuff in space moves closer together when other things move apart. Even though fewer people worked the land, farms still produced just as much or even more food because farming methods got better, and workers worked harder and more efficiently. Also, the land that farmers worked for themselves became smaller.

Since many farmers lost their land, the food and resources they used for themselves were now free to be sold. These former farmers had to buy food and goods from factory owners by working for wages. The same happened with raw materials from farms used in factories. For example, some peasants in Westphalia, who used to spin flax themselves, were forced off their land and had to work as wage laborers on big farms. 

At the same time, big factories for spinning and weaving flax appeared, where these freed workers now worked for wages. The flax itself didn’t change, but it now belonged to factory owners. Before, many small producers worked the flax themselves or in family groups, but now one capitalist controlled it all and hired others to work for him. The extra work done before gave extra income to many peasant families or paid taxes to the king, but now it turned into profits for a few factory owners. The spinning wheels and looms, which used to be spread out in many small places, were now all together in big factories with the workers and materials.

The machines and materials stopped being tools for independent workers and became tools for factory owners to control workers and make them work without paying for all their effort. When you look at big factories and farms, it’s hard to see that they started by gathering together many small producers who lost their land and independence. But people knew this. Back in the time of Mirabeau, a leader of the French Revolution, big factories were still called “manufactures réunies,” meaning workshops brought together in one place—like how fields were combined into big farms. Mirabeau said, “We are only talking about the big factories, where hundreds of men work under one boss, and which are usually called manufactures réunies.”
