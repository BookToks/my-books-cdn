They say this because, for them, extra value only exists as rent.

When workers have to work longer than the time needed to earn their wages, and the extra work is taken by the boss, this is called producing absolute surplus-value. This is the basic idea behind the capitalist system and is the starting point for producing relative surplus-value.

Relative surplus-value happens when the workday is split into two parts: the time needed to earn wages and the extra work time. To get more extra work time, the time needed to earn wages is shortened by making work faster or easier. Absolute surplus-value depends only on making the workday longer. Relative surplus-value changes how work is done and how society is organized. It needs the capitalist system, which grows naturally once workers are formally controlled by capital. Over time, this control becomes real and stronger.

There are also in-between forms where extra work isn’t forced directly, and workers aren’t fully controlled by capital yet. In these cases, capital doesn’t control the work directly. Independent workers still do their own crafts or farming the old way, while moneylenders or merchants take profits from them like parasites. When this kind of exploitation is common, the capitalist system doesn’t dominate yet, but it can lead to it, like it did near the end of the Middle Ages. Even today, some old-style work exists alongside modern industry, but it looks very different.

If just formally controlling workers is enough to create absolute surplus-value—like when craftsmen who worked for themselves become wage workers under a boss—then the ways to create relative surplus-value also create absolute surplus-value. In fact, making workers work very long hours is something modern industry especially causes. Usually, capitalism stops being just a way to make relative surplus-value once it takes over a whole type of production, or even more so when it controls most big industries. Then it becomes the main way society produces things. It still makes relative surplus-value only when it spreads to industries that were only partly controlled before or when it keeps changing how work is done.

From one view, the difference between absolute and relative surplus-value seems fake. Relative surplus-value forces workdays to be longer than what workers need to live. Absolute surplus-value depends on making work more productive so workers can do their necessary work faster.

But if we look at how surplus-value actually works, this confusion goes away. Once capitalism is fully set up, the difference between absolute and relative surplus-value matters whenever bosses want to increase how much extra work they get from workers.
