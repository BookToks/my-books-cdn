It takes extra time to sell things on top of the time it takes to make them.

To turn money into capital, the person with money has to meet a free worker in the market. This worker is free in two ways: they can sell their work like a product, and they don’t have anything else to sell. They need to sell their labor to survive.

Why the worker is there doesn’t really matter to the person with money. The money owner just sees the labor market like any other market where things are bought and sold. For now, we don’t need to worry about the reasons either. We just accept this fact, just like the money owner does.

One thing is clear—nature doesn’t create people who own money or things on one side, and people who only have their work to sell on the other. This situation isn’t natural or the same for all times in history. It happened because of many economic changes and the end of older ways of producing things.

The economic ideas we talked about also come from history. Certain conditions have to be met for something to become a commodity. It can’t be made just for the person who made it to use themselves. If we looked deeper, we would see that most things only become commodities in a specific kind of production called capitalism. But that’s not what we’re focusing on now. Things can be made and traded even if most are made just for the person who made them, and trading isn’t the main way society works.

For things to appear as commodities, society needs to have a certain way of dividing work so that the value of use and the value of exchange are separated. This separation starts with bartering. Many societies have reached this level, even if they are very different in other ways.

Money shows a certain stage in trading goods. It can work in different ways—like being just a way to measure value, a way to help trade, a way to pay debts, something to save, or something everyone accepts. These different roles of money show different levels of how society produces and trades. Even simple trading can create these money roles.

But capital is different. Capital doesn’t just happen when money and goods are traded. It only appears when someone who owns things needed to produce meets a free worker selling their labor. This one condition is a huge part of history. Capital marks a new chapter in how society produces things.

Now, we need to look closely at this special commodity: labor-power. Like other things, it has value. But how is this value decided?

The value of labor-power is based on the amount of work time needed to produce and maintain it.

Labor-power is just the ability or power of a living person to work. To produce labor-power, the person has to exist. So, producing labor-power means the person has to take care of themselves and stay alive.
