Money works because the same process keeps happening over and over. The seller always has the product to sell, and the buyer always has the money to buy it. Money helps by turning the price of the product into cash. This exchange moves the product from the seller to the buyer and the money from the buyer to the seller, who then uses it to buy another product.

The reason money moves one way is because products move in two opposite ways. This isn’t obvious at first. When a product is first sold, both the product and the money move. But the second time, it looks like only the money moves.

At first, the product swaps places with money. Then, the product is used and disappears from trading. In its place, money takes over. The product’s value shows up as money. So, money keeps moving while the product changes into money and back again. When we look at money’s movement, it seems like money is moving by itself, swapping with different products all the time.

Because of this, it looks like money is the one doing all the work in trading, not the products changing form. Money keeps taking products out of trading and replacing them, moving further away from where it started. Even though money’s movement actually shows products being traded, it feels like the products are moving because of money.

Money only works because it really holds the value of products. So, money’s movement is just the products changing forms while being traded. For example, linen first changes into money when sold. This money then changes again when it’s used to buy something else, like a Bible. Both changes happen because products and money swap places.

The same coins end up in the seller’s hand when they sell the product, and leave their hand when they buy something else. The coins move twice: first when the linen is sold and then when the money is spent.

If only one part of this happens, like only selling or only buying, the same money moves just once. The second move always shows the product changing back from money. The coins moving many times show not just one product changing but many products being traded around the world.

All of this is about simple trading between products and money, which is the basic idea we are talking about here.
