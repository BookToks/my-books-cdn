Not just that: instead of only showing how things relate to each other, money now kind of has a relationship with itself. It splits into two parts: the original value and the extra value it makes. It’s like a dad seeing himself as both a dad and a son, even though they’re the same person and age. The extra £10 makes the original £100 become capital. Once this happens, the difference between the two disappears, and they become one total of £110.

So, value now becomes value that is moving and changing. Money goes out, comes back in, keeps growing, and repeats this cycle over and over. This is called M—M’, which means money that creates more money. This idea comes from early thinkers called the Mercantilists.

Buying stuff to sell it for more money, written as M—C—M’, seems like just what merchants do. But industrial capital works the same way: money turns into products, then selling those products turns back into more money. What happens between buying and selling doesn’t change this pattern. With interest-bearing capital, the process looks shorter because you just get more money without seeing the steps in between, like M—M’, meaning money that grows by itself.

So, M—C—M’ is basically the main way capital works when it’s moving around in the market.

There’s a big difference between power based on owning land and having control over people, and the power money gives, which isn’t tied to anyone. This is shown by two French sayings: “No land without its lord” and “Money has no master.”

People have said, “With money you buy things, and with things you buy money.” When you buy something to sell again, it’s called money advanced; if you buy something just to keep it, it’s money spent.

Some thinkers argued that you don’t exchange money just for money, but for different things, and the profit comes from that difference. Trading the same thing for itself doesn’t make sense, like trading a pound of bread for the same pound of bread.

Others noticed that exchanging money for money is like gambling or speculation. Some even said that buying to sell again is the same as speculation, blurring the line between normal trade and gambling.
