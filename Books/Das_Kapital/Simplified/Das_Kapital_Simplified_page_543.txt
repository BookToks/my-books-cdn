Where does the money for business come from inside the country? In America, almost no one is just a farmer, except slaves and their owners who mix working and owning. Free Americans who farm also do many other jobs. They often make some of their own furniture and tools. They build their own houses and sell what they grow, even if the market is far away. They spin and weave cloth, make soap and candles, and sometimes shoes and clothes for themselves. In America, farming is often a side job for blacksmiths, millers, or shopkeepers.

With people like these, where do capitalists get the money they save by not spending (called “abstinence”)?

The great thing about capitalist businesses is that they not only keep making workers who sell their labor, but they also make more workers than needed when money grows. This keeps the supply and demand for workers balanced, keeps wages within limits that benefit the capitalists, and makes sure workers depend on capitalists. Some economists in the old country like to pretend this is a fair deal between equals — the capitalist who owns money and the worker who owns labor. But in the colonies, this idea falls apart.

The population grows faster in the colonies because many workers arrive already grown up, but there aren’t enough jobs for them. The supply and demand for workers doesn’t work right. On one side, money from the old world wants to invest and earn profits; on the other, workers often stop being wage workers and become independent farmers or craftsmen who work for themselves. They leave the job market but don’t become poor or homeless.

This constant change from worker to independent producer messes up the labor market. Not only do workers get paid better, but they also lose their feeling of depending on the capitalist. This causes problems that a man named E. G. Wakefield describes clearly. He complains that the supply of workers is small, irregular, and unreliable. Even though workers get a good share of what they produce, they quickly become small business owners themselves. Most workers don’t get very rich, but they refuse to let capitalists pay them less than they deserve.

Capitalists might try to bring workers from Europe with their own money, but those workers soon stop working for others and become independent landowners or competitors to their former bosses. Imagine the shock! The capitalist brought his own rivals from Europe! No wonder Wakefield is upset that workers in the colonies don’t feel dependent on capitalists. Because wages are high, another man named Merivale says capitalists want cheaper, more obedient workers — people they can boss around instead of being bossed by.

In old, settled countries, workers are free but naturally depend on capitalists. In colonies, this dependence has to be forced by artificial means. Wakefield worries about what will happen because of this problem in the colonies.
