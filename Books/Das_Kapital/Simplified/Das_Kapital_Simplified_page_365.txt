Chapter 17: Big Changes in the Price of Labour and Surplus Value

The value of labour-power is decided by how much stuff a normal worker needs to live. We know how much of this stuff people usually need at a certain time in a certain society, so we can treat it as a fixed amount. What changes is how much this stuff costs.

There are two other things that affect the value of labour-power. One is the cost to train or develop the worker’s ability, which changes depending on how things are made. The other is the natural differences between workers, like men, women, children, and adults. Using these different types of workers also changes how much it costs to support the worker’s family and affects the value of an adult male’s labour-power. But for now, we won’t think about these two factors.

I assume (1) things are sold for their real value, and (2) the price of labour-power sometimes goes above its value, but never below it.

With this in mind, we know that how much surplus-value and the price of labour-power change depends on three things: (1) how long the working day is, or how much work is done in total; (2) how hard the work is, or how much work is done in a certain time; (3) how productive the work is, meaning how much stuff is made in a certain time, which depends on how developed the tools and methods are.

Different mixes of these three things can happen. Sometimes one stays the same while the other two change, sometimes two stay the same while one changes, and sometimes all three change at once. When all three change, they might not all change in the same way or amount. In what follows, only the main combinations are looked at.

Section 1: Working Day and Work Intensity Stay the Same, Productivity Changes

If we keep the working day and how hard people work the same, but productivity changes, then the value of labour-power and surplus-value follow three rules.

(1.) A working day of a certain length always creates the same amount of value, no matter how productive the work is or how many products are made or how much each item costs.

For example, if a 12-hour workday creates value worth six shillings, then even if more or fewer items are made because of productivity, the total value is still six shillings. The value just gets spread over more or fewer items.

(2.) Surplus-value and the value of labour-power move in opposite ways. When productivity goes up or down, the value of labour-power goes the opposite way, but surplus-value goes the same way as productivity.

So, if a 12-hour workday creates six shillings in value, that total is made up of surplus-value plus the value of labour-power, which the worker gets back in pay.
