One example is enough. Over the last 20 years, the flax industry has grown a lot, and with that growth, the number of scutching mills in Ireland has also gone up. In 1864, there were 1,800 of these mills in the country. Every autumn and winter, women and young people—who are usually farmers’ wives, sons, and daughters and not used to machines—stop working in the fields to feed flax into the scutching mills.

The accidents at these mills are shocking in both number and type. At one mill in Kildinan, near Cork, between 1852 and 1856, there were six deaths and sixty serious injuries. All of these could have been avoided with simple safety tools that would have cost only a few shillings.

Dr. W. White, the factory doctor at Downpatrick, wrote in 1865 that the accidents at these mills are terrible. Sometimes a quarter of a person’s body gets torn off, which either causes death or leaves them disabled and in pain for life. As more mills open, these awful accidents will increase unless laws are made to stop them. Dr. White believed that proper rules and supervision could save many lives and prevent injuries.

This situation shows how the capitalist system works. It needs laws to force business owners to provide even basic safety and cleanliness for workers. For example, in pottery factories, the Factory Act of 1864 forced over 200 workshops to clean up after many years of ignoring health. Around 27,800 workers had been breathing dirty air during long work hours, which caused sickness and death. The Act helped improve air quality a lot.

But this law also shows a problem with capitalism: it stops real improvements beyond a certain point. English doctors agree that each worker needs at least 500 cubic feet of space to breathe properly during continuous work.

However, if laws made it mandatory to give each worker this much space, many small workshop owners would lose their businesses right away. This is because the capitalist system depends on buying and using cheap labor freely. So, factory laws get stuck when it comes to enforcing this breathing space rule. Officials keep saying workers need this space but also say it’s impossible to get it from capitalists.

In fact, they admit that diseases like lung problems among workers are just part of how capitalism works. Even though the education rules in the law seem small, they made it clear that children must get basic schooling to work. These rules showed for the first time that it’s possible to mix education and exercise with manual labor.
