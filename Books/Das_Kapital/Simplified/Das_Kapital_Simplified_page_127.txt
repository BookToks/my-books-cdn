When someone buys labour-power, they use it by making the person who sells it work. When that person works, they become a worker, not just someone who could work. For their work to turn into a product, they have to use their labour to make something useful that people want. So, the boss makes the worker produce a specific useful thing. Even though the boss controls the work and benefits from it, the basic process of making useful things doesn’t change. First, we need to understand the work itself, without thinking about the social setup around it.

Labour is a process where both people and nature take part. People start, control, and manage how they interact with nature. They use their bodies—arms, legs, head, hands—to take what nature offers and change it to meet their needs. By doing this, they also change themselves. They develop their abilities and make them work under their control. We’re not talking about simple, natural work like animals do. There’s a huge difference between someone selling their labour today and early humans who worked only by instinct. We assume labour here is fully human. For example, spiders and bees do amazing work, but humans are different because they imagine what they want to make before they make it. At the end of work, the result was planned in the worker’s mind from the start. The worker doesn’t just change the material, but also follows a purpose that guides how they work. This focus is not just short, but lasts the whole time they work. The worker needs to pay close attention, especially if they don’t enjoy the work or find it interesting.

The basic parts of work are 1) the person doing the work, 2) the thing they work on, and 3) the tools they use.

Land (and water too) in its natural state gives people what they need to live without any work. This land is the main thing people work on. Things like fish caught from water, timber cut from forests, and ores taken from the ground are all natural things people work with. If the thing worked on has already been partly processed by earlier work, it’s called raw material. For example, ore that has already been dug up and is ready for cleaning.
