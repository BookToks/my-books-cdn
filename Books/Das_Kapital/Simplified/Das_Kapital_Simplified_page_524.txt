In the time of Edward VI, the English really tried to support making things and giving jobs to poor people. We know this from a law that said all homeless people should be marked.

Thomas More wrote in his book "Utopia" about greedy landowners. They took huge areas of land and pushed farmers out. The farmers lost their homes and were forced to sell their land. Many poor families, including men, women, and children, had nowhere to go. They had to leave their homes and sell their few belongings for almost nothing. When their money ran out, they had no choice but to steal or beg. If they stole, they were often hanged. If they begged or wandered without work, they were thrown in jail even if they wanted to work but no one would hire them.

During Henry VIII’s reign, 7,200 thieves were executed. Under Queen Elizabeth, many criminals were hanged every year—sometimes hundreds. In one area called Somersetshire, many people were punished: 40 were killed, 35 were burned on the hand, 37 whipped, and 183 sent away as hopeless vagabonds. Still, this was only a small part of all the criminals because judges didn’t always do their job, and people were sometimes too kind. Other parts of England were just as bad or worse.

Adam Smith said that when laws try to control the relationship between bosses and workers, the bosses always get the better advice. Another thinker, Linguet, said the law is always about protecting property.

A lawyer in 1850 wrote that people were quick to help employers, but what about workers? In the time of James I, some clothmakers acted as judges and set wages in their own shops. In Germany, after the Thirty Years’ War, there were many laws to keep wages low. Landowners had trouble finding workers in empty villages. Villagers couldn’t rent rooms to single men or women. Those who didn’t want to work as servants were reported and punished, even if they worked in other jobs like planting seeds or selling grain. For 100 years, German rulers kept saying poor people were lazy and wouldn’t accept low legal wages. Landowners weren’t allowed to pay more than the state’s set wage. Sometimes, after the war, servants had better conditions. For example, in 1652, servants in Silesia got meat twice a week, but 100 years later, some places only had meat three times a year.
