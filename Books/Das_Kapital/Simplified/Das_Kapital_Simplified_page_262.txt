When the steam engine was first made at the end of the 1600s, and even up to 1780, it didn’t cause a big change in industry. Instead, it was the invention of machines that made changing the steam engine important. When people stopped using their own hands to work and started using machines powered by something else, it didn’t matter if the power came from muscles, wind, water, or steam. This change did cause big improvements in how machines were built. Today, many machines, like sewing machines or bread-making machines, can be powered by people or by other energy sources.

The machine that really started the industrial revolution replaced a worker using one tool with a machine that uses many tools all at once, powered by one source of energy. This was just the beginning of using machines to make things.

As machines got bigger and used more tools, they needed stronger engines to run them. People aren’t very good at making steady, continuous power, so natural forces could take over instead. Of the old power sources, horses were the worst because they could be stubborn, were expensive, and didn’t work well in factories. Still, horses were used a lot in early industry. We still use the term “horsepower” today to measure mechanical power because of that.

Wind power was unreliable and hard to control. In England, where modern industry began, water power was used more during the early manufacturing period. By the 1600s, people were already trying to run two millstones with one water wheel.

But as machines got bigger, water power wasn’t strong enough. This problem led to better studies about friction and the invention of the flywheel, which helped smooth out the motion of machines. These early improvements helped start modern mechanical industry. For example, Arkwright’s spinning mill was powered by water from the start.

Even so, water power had problems. You couldn’t make it stronger whenever you wanted, it sometimes stopped flowing, and it only worked in certain places. The real breakthrough came with Watt’s improved steam engine. This engine created its own power by burning coal and using water, which people could control. It could move around, be used in cities (not just in the countryside like water wheels), and allowed factories to be built in towns instead of being spread out. Watt’s steam engine was special because it wasn’t made just for one job—it could be used for many different machines in industry.
