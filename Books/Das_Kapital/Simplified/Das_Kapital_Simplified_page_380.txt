Let’s think about the capitalist for a moment. He wants to get as much work as possible for the least amount of money. So, what really matters to him is the difference between how much he pays for labor and the value the work creates. He tries to buy things as cheaply as possible and makes profit by buying low and selling high. Because of this, he never realizes that if he truly paid the real value of labor, no capital would exist, and his money wouldn’t turn into more money.

Also, how wages actually work shows that workers don’t get paid the full value of their labor power, but something more like the value of the work they do. There are two main things that show this: 1) Wages change when the workday length changes. This is like paying more to rent a machine for a week than for a day, but not paying for the machine itself. 2) Different workers doing the same job get paid differently. We see this even in slavery, where labor power is sold openly. In slavery, the slave owner gains or loses depending on how good or bad the slave’s work is, but in regular jobs, the worker himself gains or loses because he sells his own labor power, not a third person.

When it comes to the idea of “value and price of labor” or “wages,” these are what people usually think about. But the real thing behind this is the value and price of labor power itself, which is harder to see and needs science to understand. Classic economics almost gets the right idea but doesn’t fully explain it because it’s stuck in a middle-class way of thinking.

1 “Mr. Ricardo cleverly avoids a problem that seems to mess up his idea — that value depends on how much labor is used to make something. If you take this seriously, then the value of labor depends on how much labor it takes to produce wages, which sounds strange. So, Ricardo says the value of labor depends on how much labor it takes to produce the things workers get paid with. This is like saying the value of cloth depends not on the work needed to make the cloth but on the work to make the silver used to buy the cloth.”  

2 “If you think of labor as a product, it’s different from other products because labor isn’t made first then sold; it’s created exactly when it’s sold, or even after.”  

3 “If labor is one product and capital (the stuff made by labor) is another, then if their values were based on equal amounts of labor, a certain amount of labor would…”
