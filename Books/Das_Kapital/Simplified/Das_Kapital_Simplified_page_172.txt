The temperature inside a bakehouse is usually between 75 and over 90 degrees. Smaller bakehouses tend to be hotter, closer to the higher number. After making bread, rolls, and other baked goods, the workers start delivering them. Many of these workers, after working hard all night, spend many hours during the day on their feet, carrying baskets or pushing carts. Some go back into the bakehouse to help with more baking and finish work between 1 and 6 p.m., depending on the season and how busy their boss is.

During what’s called the “London season,” workers for the more expensive bakers in the West End start working at 11 p.m. They make bread all night with only short breaks until 8 a.m. Then they spend the whole day delivering bread or helping bake biscuits, sometimes working until 7 p.m. After all this, they might only get four to six hours of sleep before starting again. On Fridays, they start earlier, around 10 p.m., and sometimes work until 8 p.m. on Saturday or even until early Sunday morning. On Sundays, they have to come in two or three times for an hour or two to get ready for the next day’s baking.

The workers for the cheaper bakers, who sell bread for less than the full price, have to work even longer hours. Most of their work happens in the bakehouse. These cheaper bakers usually sell bread in their shops and don’t deliver it to houses. If they do deliver, they hire other people to do it. Toward the end of the week, these workers start at 10 p.m. on Thursday and keep working almost nonstop until late Saturday night.

Even people with some understanding know that these cheaper bakers rely on making their workers work for free or more hours than they get paid for to stay competitive. The more expensive bakers accuse the cheaper ones of cheating customers and making their workers work 18 hours but only paying them for 12. 

Selling cheap bread and adding bad ingredients to it started in the early 1700s. This happened when the bakery trade changed from being run by groups of bakers to being controlled by rich business people like millers. This change led to longer workdays and night shifts, especially after 1824. Because of all this, the report says that bakers are a group of workers who don’t live long. Most don’t live past 42 years old, even though they sometimes get lucky and survive the hard life of working-class children.
