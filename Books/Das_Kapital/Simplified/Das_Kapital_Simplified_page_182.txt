Reasonable wages and limits on the working day were set by law. The part about working hours is important here. In 1496, during Henry VII’s time, the law said that from March to September, workers and farmers should work from 5 in the morning until 7 or 8 in the evening. But they also had long meal breaks: 1 hour for breakfast, 1.5 hours for dinner, and 30 minutes for a midday meal. That’s twice as long as meal breaks are today under factory laws. In winter, work was from 5 in the morning until it got dark, with the same break times.

In 1562, Queen Elizabeth’s law didn’t change the length of the working day for workers paid by the day or week, but it tried to shorten meal breaks to 2.5 hours in summer and 2 hours in winter. Dinner was only 1 hour, and the half-hour afternoon nap was allowed only between mid-May and mid-August. If a worker was late or absent for an hour, they would lose a penny from their wage. But in real life, workers usually had better conditions than these rules said.

William Petty, who is called the father of Political Economy, wrote in the late 1600s that farm workers worked 10 hours a day and ate 20 meals a week: 3 meals on working days and 2 on Sundays. He said that if workers could skip fasting on Friday nights and eat lunch faster, they could work more and spend less time eating, which would help raise taxes. 

Was Dr. Andrew Ure right to say the 12-hour workday law of 1833 was a step backward to the “dark ages”? The rules Petty mentioned also applied to apprentices, but child labor was still a problem. For example, in Germany, apprenticeships lasted 3 or 4 years because kids were trained from a young age. In England, apprenticeships lasted 7 years because kids weren’t trained before starting work, so they learned slower and needed more time to become skilled.

During most of the 1700s, before modern industry and machines, English workers (except farm workers) were not forced to work every day of the week. They could live on what they earned working only four days a week, so they didn’t want to work the other two days. Some English economists criticized workers for being stubborn, while others defended them.

For example, Postlethwayt, an important economist then, said that if poor workers can live on five days’ wages, they won’t work six days. Some people even thought making life more expensive through taxes was necessary to force workers to work all six days without stopping.
