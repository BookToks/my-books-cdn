Here’s the downside. Right now, people’s jobs change because it’s like a natural rule that forces it, even though it causes problems everywhere. But modern industry, with all its mess-ups, shows us that changing work is a basic rule of how things are made. This means workers need to be good at different kinds of jobs and develop many skills. It’s super important for society to change how work is done to match this rule. Modern industry forces society to stop treating workers like machines doing the same boring task forever. Instead, workers should be well-rounded, able to do many jobs, and ready for any changes in work. The different jobs they do should let them use their natural and learned talents.

One step toward this change is that schools have started teaching kids of workers some technology and how to use tools. The Factory Act was the first small rule that mixed basic education with factory work. But when workers get more power, technical lessons—both theory and practice—will become a big part of schools for working kids. These big changes, which will end the old way of dividing work, go against how capitalism works and how workers are treated now. But history shows that when a system has big conflicts inside it, that’s how it breaks down and a new system is made. For example, old craft rules made sense until people like Watt invented the steam engine and changed everything.

Laws about factory work are often seen as just messing with business owners’ rights. But when rules try to control work done at home, people see it as an attack on family power. The English Parliament was slow to act on this. But facts showed that modern industry destroyed traditional family life and family work. Because of this, the rights of children had to be protected. A report from 1866 said children need protection most from their own parents. The system lets parents exploit their kids’ work without limits. Parents shouldn’t have total power to turn their kids into machines just to earn money. So, kids should have the right to laws that protect them from work that harms their bodies and stops them from growing mentally and morally.
