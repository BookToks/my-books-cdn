Variable Capital compared to the Value of labour-power and Necessary labour are shown in the first two formulas as ratios of values. In the third formula, these ratios are shown as the amount of time needed to produce those values. These formulas work together and are very accurate. Because of this, classical Political Economy kind of uses these ideas without really knowing it. In that old economic theory, you also find these related formulas.

Surplus-labour, Surplus-value, and Surplus-product are all shown as ratios too. The same ratio is expressed in three ways: by the time worked, by the value made during that time, and by the products created from that work. When we say “Value of the Product,” we only mean the new value created during a workday, not the value of materials that were already there.

But, all these formulas (II.) don’t really show the true level of how much the worker is being exploited. Let’s say the workday is 12 hours. Using the same ideas as before, the real exploitation looks like this:

6 hours of surplus-labour equals a Surplus-value of 3 shillings, which is 100% compared to 6 hours of necessary labour and Variable Capital of 3 shillings.

But if you use the formulas II., you get a different answer:

6 hours of surplus-labour equals a Surplus-value of 3 shillings, which is only 50% of the 12-hour working day and the value created of 6 shillings.

These formulas actually just show how the working day or the value made during it is split between the capitalist and the worker. If you think these formulas directly show how much capital grows by itself, you’d get a wrong idea: that surplus-labour or surplus-value can never reach 100%.

Since surplus-labour is only part of the working day, or surplus-value is only part of the total value created, they always have to be less than the full working day or total value. For surplus-labour to equal the whole working day (like an average day), the necessary labour would have to be zero. But if necessary labour disappears, surplus-labour also disappears because it depends on necessary labour.

So, the ratio of Surplus-labour or Surplus-value to the Working day or Value created can never reach 100%, or go beyond that.

But the rate of surplus-value, which is the real level of how much the worker is exploited, can be higher.

For example, L. de Lavergne estimated that the English farm worker only gets 1/4 of what’s produced, while the capitalist (farmer) gets 3/4 of it, not counting how the rest is shared between the capitalist, landlord, and others.
