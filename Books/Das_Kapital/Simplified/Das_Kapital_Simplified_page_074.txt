When people divide up work, the things they make become products that can be sold. Because of this, these products need to be changed into money. But this change into money doesn’t always happen the same way every time. Here, we will think of it as happening normally. If something can be sold at all, its change into money will happen, even if the price is higher or lower than expected.

The seller trades their product for gold, and the buyer trades their gold for the product.

What really happens is that a product and gold, like 20 yards of cloth and £2, swap places. This means they are exchanged. But what is the product exchanged for? It is exchanged for the form of its own value, which is money.

And what is the gold exchanged for? It is exchanged for a specific thing it can be used for. Gold becomes money when it is compared to the cloth because the price of £2 shows that the cloth’s value equals that amount of gold. When a product is sold, it loses its original form and gains the power to attract gold, which was only an idea before in its price. So, turning a product into money is also turning money into a product at the same time. It looks like one step, but it’s actually two.

From the product owner’s side, it’s a sale. From the money owner’s side, it’s a purchase. So, selling is buying, and buying is selling. Up to now, we have looked at people only as owners of products, who get the work of others by selling their own work. For a product owner to meet someone with money, either the buyer’s work must be money itself (gold), or their product must already be changed into money. Gold must come into the market somewhere. This happens where gold is made, where it is traded for other things of equal value. From then on, gold always shows the price of some product. No matter who has it, gold is always the changed form of a product sold by its owner; it is the result of a sale, the first step of changing product to money. Gold became the idea of money because all products measure their value by it, comparing it to their own forms as useful things. It became real money when products were actually traded for it, changing places with their normal forms and becoming the real symbol of their values.

When products turn into money, they lose all signs of what they were used for and the type of work that made them. They change into the same kind of human work that everyone agrees on. You can’t tell from a coin what product it was once traded for. All products look the same as money. That’s why money could be something like dirt, even though dirt itself is not money. Let’s say the two gold coins our weaver got for his cloth actually came from selling a quarter of wheat. Selling the cloth for money is also buying the money with the cloth.
