The relative surplus population is made up of workers who are either partly or fully unemployed. This group changes a lot depending on how the economy is doing—sometimes it’s worse during crises, sometimes it’s a steady problem during slow times. But it always has three types: floating, latent, and stagnant.

In big industrial places like factories, mines, and ironworks, workers sometimes leave and sometimes come back in large numbers. Overall, more people get jobs, but not as many compared to how much stuff is being made. This is called the floating surplus population.

In factories with machines and special jobs, many boys work until they grow up. After that, only a few keep working in the same jobs, while most are let go. These let-go workers add to the floating surplus population, which grows as these industries grow. Some move to other places where jobs have moved. Because of this, the number of women workers grows faster than men’s, like in England. Capitalism wants more young workers but fewer adults. This causes problems because even though there are complaints about not having enough workers, many people are still unemployed since they only know one type of job.

Workers use up their energy quickly, and by the middle of their lives, many can’t work as well and fall into the unemployed group or get lower-paying jobs. People working in modern industries often have short lifespans. For example, Dr. Lee said that in Manchester, rich people lived about 38 years on average, but workers lived only about 17. In Liverpool, it was 35 years for the rich and 15 for the workers. So, workers have to have many children quickly to keep enough workers coming, which leads to early marriages and kids working.

When capitalism takes over farming, fewer farm workers are needed even though farming businesses grow. Unlike factories, farming doesn’t attract new workers to replace those who leave. So, many farm workers are ready to move to cities or factories when they can.
