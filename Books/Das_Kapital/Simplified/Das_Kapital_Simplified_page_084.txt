There wouldn’t be any fixed standard anymore. If paper money is more than it should be—the same amount as gold coins that can actually be used—it could lose people’s trust and would only represent the amount of gold that’s needed and can be shown by paper. If there’s twice as much paper money as there should be, then £1 wouldn’t equal 1/4 of an ounce of gold but only 1/8 of an ounce. This would be like gold changing how it sets prices. What used to cost £1 would now cost £2.

Paper money is like a token that stands for gold or real money. The prices of things are thought of in terms of the same amount of gold that the paper represents. Paper money only has value because it represents gold, which itself has value. Someone might ask, why can gold be replaced by tokens that don’t have real value?

Gold can only be replaced by tokens when it’s used just as coins or money that people use to buy and sell things, and nothing else. Money actually has other jobs besides just being coins, but gold coins only work as just money when they are worn down and still used. A piece of money is only really money if people use it. This is true for the smallest amount of gold that paper money can replace. That gold is always used for buying and selling, and it only exists for that reason.

Because of this, money moves around in a cycle where goods are traded for money, and money is traded for goods again. The value of things only shows up briefly when trading happens, then it disappears right away. So, as money changes hands, it only needs to be a symbol. Its function as money is more important than the actual material it’s made of. Since money reflects prices, it can be replaced by tokens like paper. But one thing is needed: the token must be accepted by society, and paper money gets this because the government makes people use it. This rule only works inside the country, but inside that country, money works fully as the thing people use to buy and sell.

Section 3: Money is the thing that measures value and is used to buy and sell either by itself or through something that represents it. Gold (or silver) is money. It works as money when it’s actually present as gold. Then it is real money, not just an idea or a symbol. It also works as money when it becomes the only real form of value, standing for exchange-value instead of use-value, which all other things have.
