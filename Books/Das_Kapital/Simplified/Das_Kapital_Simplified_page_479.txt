He is the leader who signs up people for the gang, and the gang works for him, not for the farmer. He usually makes deals with the farmer for piece-work, and he earns about the same as a regular farm worker. His money depends mostly on how well he can get his gang to work hard and fast.

Farmers have found out that women only work well when men tell them what to do. Once women and kids start working, they use up their energy quickly, while adult men try to save their energy. The gang leader moves from farm to farm and works with his gang for 6 to 8 months each year. Working for him is better and more steady for families than working for farmers, who only sometimes hire kids. Because of this, the gang leader has a lot of control in the villages, and kids can usually only be hired through him. Renting out kids separately is his second job.

The problems with this system are that kids and young people get worked too hard, they have to walk very long distances every day—5 to 7 miles—and the gang becomes a bad influence. The gang leader, sometimes called "the driver," carries a stick but rarely uses it, and reports of him being violent are rare. He’s like a boss everyone listens to and kind of like the Pied Piper. He stays popular by making the gang life exciting. The gang enjoys a rough kind of freedom, loud fun, and rude behavior. Usually, the gang leader pays the workers at a pub, then leads them home drunk, supported by strong women, while the kids follow behind, loud and singing rude songs.

On the way back, what Fourier called “phanerogamie” happens a lot. Boys and girls as young as 13 or 14 often get each other pregnant. The villages that supply the gang become places like Sodom and Gomorrah, with twice as many kids born out of wedlock compared to other areas. The girls who grow up in this gang life rarely have good morals when they become wives. Their children, if they don’t die from drugs like opium, usually end up joining the gang too.

This kind of gang is called the public, common, or tramping gang. But there are also private gangs. These are smaller and run by old farm workers the farmer can’t find other work for. There’s no fun in these gangs, but the kids are paid and treated even worse.

The gang system has grown a lot in recent years. It doesn’t exist to help the gang leader but to make rich farmers richer and landlords too. For farmers, it’s a smart way to keep workers paid very little, always have extra hands for busy times, get the most work for the least money, and make adult male workers less needed. That’s why, on one hand, people admit there isn’t always enough work for farm workers, but on the other hand, they say the gang system is needed because so many adult men move to the cities. The clean, well-kept farms and the rough, poor people of Lincolnshire are two sides of how capitalist farming works.
