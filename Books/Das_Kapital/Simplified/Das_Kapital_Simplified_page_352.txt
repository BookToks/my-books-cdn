Modern industry changes a lot more than just how things are made—it also changes the way people think. You can see this if you compare a speech from 1863 to one from 1833. Back then, in some parts of England, poor parents weren’t even allowed to send their kids to school because they might lose government help if they did.

For example, in Somersetshire, poor people who asked for help had to take their kids out of school. A priest in Feltham said some families got no help just because they sent their children to school.

When machines powered by people had to compete with bigger machines powered by steam, workers who ran the machines had to work much harder. First, steam engines replaced these workers, and then the workers had to work like steam engines themselves. This was especially tough for children who had to do this hard work.

One official found boys aged 10 to 15 in Coventry working on ribbon-looms, and even younger kids working on smaller machines. The work was really tiring because the boys were basically acting as steam engines. This system was so bad that an official report called it a kind of slavery.

Not long ago, in parts of Scotland, families made almost everything themselves. They made their own shoes, clothes, and even dyes from plants. Almost nothing was bought from outside except a few small tools.

In the past, workers had strict rules about supporting each other and not talking badly about each other’s work. But now, the modern working class always changes how things are made and how society works. Unlike older times, nothing stays the same for long. Old ways and ideas are broken down, and people are forced to see their real situation clearly.

As Marx and Engels said, “All that is solid melts into air,” meaning everything changes quickly and nothing stays the same. Shakespeare also said, “You take my life when you do take the means whereby I live,” showing how important work and tools are to people’s lives.
