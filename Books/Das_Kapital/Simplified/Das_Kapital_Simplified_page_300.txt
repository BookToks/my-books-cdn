Modern industry goes through cycles where things are sometimes okay, then really good, then too much stuff is made, followed by problems and slow times. Because machines control jobs, workers often don’t know if they will have work or good conditions. This ups and downs happen regularly.

When business isn’t doing well, the owners fight hard to get the biggest share of the market. The cheaper the product, the more they can sell. This leads to using better machines and new ways to make things, which can replace workers or force their pay down to make products cheaper. For more workers to be hired, more money needs to be invested in factories, but this depends on how the industry is doing. New technology sometimes means fewer workers are needed, while sometimes more factories mean more jobs. Workers are pushed out and pulled in all the time, with changes in who is hired by age, gender, and skills.

To understand this better, let’s look at the English cotton industry’s history.

Between 1770 and 1815, the cotton industry was mostly steady, with only five years of trouble. During this time, English factories had control over machines and most of the world’s markets.

From 1815 to 1821, business was bad; 1822 and 1823 were good years. In 1824, laws against worker unions were removed, and factories grew a lot. In 1825, there was a crisis. In 1826, factory workers suffered and riots happened. Things got a bit better in 1827. In 1828, power-looms and exports increased. By 1829, exports, especially to India, were the highest ever. In 1830, there was too much product and a lot of trouble. Between 1831 and 1833, business stayed bad, and the East India Company lost its trade monopoly with India and China. In 1834, more factories and machines appeared, but there weren’t enough workers. New laws caused farm workers to move to factories, leaving countryside children behind. There was also a harsh labor trade.  

In 1835, factories did great, but hand-loom weavers starved. 1836 was also good. Then in 1837 and 1838, there was a crisis. 1839 saw a comeback. In 1840, there was a big depression, riots, and soldiers were called in. 1841 and 1842 were very hard for workers. In 1842, factory owners locked workers out to force the government to change the Corn Laws. Thousands of workers marched into towns but were pushed back by soldiers, and their leaders were arrested. 1843 was a year of great hardship. 1844 saw improvement. 1845 was prosperous again. In 1846, things got better at first but then got worse. The Corn Laws were repealed.  

1847 brought a crisis and wages were cut by over 10% as a kind of “big loaf” punishment. 1848 was still bad; Manchester was guarded by soldiers. 1849 improved, and 1850 was good. In 1851, prices dropped, wages were low, and strikes happened often. 1852 began to get better, but strikes continued, and factory owners threatened to bring in foreign workers. 1853 had growing exports but an 8-month strike caused great suffering in Preston. 1854 was prosperous but markets were flooded. News came in of businesses failing in the United States, Canada, and Eastern markets.  

1856 was very good. 1857 brought a crisis. 1858 saw improvement. 1859 was very good with more factories. By 1860, the English cotton trade was at its peak, but markets in India, Australia, and elsewhere were so full that even by 1863 they hadn’t sold all the goods. A French trade treaty and huge growth in factories and machines happened.  

In 1861, business was good for a while but then dropped because of the American Civil War and a cotton shortage. From 1862 to 1863, the industry completely collapsed.
