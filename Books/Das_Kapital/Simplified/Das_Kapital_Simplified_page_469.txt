The repeal of the Corn Laws gave a big boost to English farming. Farmers started doing a lot of new things like better drainage, new ways to feed animals, growing green crops artificially, using machines for spreading manure, and working clay soils differently. They also used steam engines and lots of new machines. Farming became more intense and productive.

Mr. Pusey, who is the head of the Royal Agricultural Society, says that using new machines almost cut farming costs in half. At the same time, the amount of crops grown on the land increased quickly. Farmers put more money into their land, which meant farms got bigger and more focused on using these new methods. From 1846 to 1856, the amount of land used for farming grew by 464,119 acres, even turning poor land and rabbit warrens into great cornfields.

But even though farms got bigger and better, the number of people working on farms went down. Between 1851 and 1861, the number of farm workers dropped from 1,241,396 to 1,163,217. The official English report says that the number of farmers and farm workers hasn’t grown at all compared to how much farming has increased. In fact, fewer people are working on farms even though there is more land being farmed, farming is more intense, and farming businesses are making more money than ever before.

With all these improvements and the growth of towns and free trade, you might think that farm workers would be really happy. But Professor Rogers says the opposite is true. He believes that the life of farm workers today is much worse than it was in the late 1700s. He even says that farm workers have become more like serfs—people who are tied to the land and treated badly—and they are worse fed and clothed than before.
