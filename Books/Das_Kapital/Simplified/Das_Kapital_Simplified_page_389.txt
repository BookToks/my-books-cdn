Piece-wage is basically just a changed version of time-wage.

Now, let’s look more closely at what makes piece wages different.

Here, the quality of work is judged by the work itself. The work has to be good enough to get full pay for each piece. Because of this, piece wages can often lead to lower pay and cheating by the bosses.

Piece wages also give the boss a clear way to measure how hard someone is working. Only the work that fits a certain standard, which is decided ahead of time, counts as necessary and gets paid. For example, in big London tailor shops, making a waistcoat might be called “one hour” of work and paid 6 pence. They know how much work someone usually does in an hour.

When new styles or repairs come up, the boss and worker sometimes argue about how long a piece takes, until experience settles it. The same happens in furniture workshops. If a worker can’t keep up and make the average amount of work each day, they get fired. Since the pay system controls how good and how hard the worker has to work, bosses don’t have to watch workers as much. Piece wages help create the modern “home work” system and a way to control and exploit workers.

There are two main ways this happens. First, piece wages let middlemen come between the boss and the worker. These middlemen pay the worker less than what the boss gives them, keeping the difference for themselves. In England, this is called the “sweating system.” Second, the boss can make a deal with a lead worker to pay them per piece, and then that lead worker hires and pays others. So, workers end up exploiting other workers.

With piece wages, workers want to work as hard as they can because it’s in their interest. This makes it easier for the boss to push workers to work harder. Also, workers want to work longer hours to earn more money, which can cause problems like overwork and lower pay per hour.

With time wages, most workers get the same pay for the same job. But with piece wages, pay changes depending on how much work each person does. Some workers do just the minimum, some average, and some more than average. So, pay varies a lot based on skill, strength, energy, and how long someone can work.

This doesn’t change how bosses and workers relate overall. First, the differences between workers balance out in the whole workshop, which produces an average amount of work, and total pay matches that average. Second, the ratio between pay and the extra work workers do stays the same.

But piece wages also encourage workers to feel more independent and free because their pay depends on their own work. At the same time, it makes them compete against each other.
