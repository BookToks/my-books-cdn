The daily value of labor is 3 shillings, the price for one hour of work is 3 pence, and the wage for making one piece is half a penny. It takes half an hour of work to make one piece. 

If workers can now make 48 pieces instead of 24 in the same day because they work faster, and nothing else changes, the pay for each piece goes down from 1½ pence to ¾ pence. This is because each piece now only takes a quarter of an hour instead of half an hour. So, 24 pieces at 1½ pence each equals 3 shillings, and 48 pieces at ¾ penny each also equals 3 shillings. 

In other words, the pay per piece drops as the number of pieces made in the same time goes up, and the time spent on each piece goes down. This change in pay causes fights between bosses and workers. Sometimes bosses use it as an excuse to actually pay less, or they make workers work harder. Other times, workers get upset because they think they should be paid for their work, not just for the things they make, and they don’t like getting paid less when the price of what they sell doesn’t go down.

Workers pay close attention to the price of the materials and finished goods, so they can figure out how much profit their bosses are making. Bosses don’t like this and say workers don’t really understand how wages work. They argue that how productive workers are doesn’t matter to the workers themselves.

Piece-work shows a stage in the history of workers. It’s between being day-laborers who depend on the boss and being independent artisans who own their work. Piece-workers are kind of their own bosses, even though they work with the boss’s materials. 

I mention this because the ideas come from old, outdated thinking. The same author once said that “property is theft,” but that was a long time ago.

Sometimes factories have two types of pay at once: half the workers get paid per piece and want to work longer, while the other half get paid by the day and don’t get extra money for overtime. This means the boss gets extra work for free from the day workers. Overworking is still a big problem, especially for those who don’t get paid by the piece.

Wages can be measured in two ways: by how long someone works or by how much they produce. For example, a spinner gets paid for delivering a certain amount of yarn by a deadline.
