The Inquiry Commission of 1862 suggested new rules for the mining industry. Mining is special because landlords and business owners work together there. Usually, these two groups fight, which helped make laws for factories. But since they agree in mining, laws about mines were delayed and tricky.

The Inquiry Commission of 1840 found terrible things happening in mines that shocked people all over Europe. To make up for this, Parliament passed the Mining Act of 1842, which only banned children under 10 and women from working underground.

Later, the Mines’ Inspecting Act of 1860 said mines should be checked by special public officers. It also said boys aged 10 to 12 could only work if they had a school certificate or went to school for some hours. But this law didn’t work well because there were too few inspectors and they had little power.

One of the latest reports about mines is from a Parliamentary Committee in 1866. This committee could call witnesses to talk. The report is very thick, but the main part only says the committee has nothing to say yet and needs to ask more witnesses.

The way witnesses were questioned was like a court trial. Committee members asked tricky, confusing questions to scare or confuse the miners who spoke. Some committee members were mine owners, and most witnesses were workers. This made the whole thing seem unfair. I picked some parts from the report to explain.

1. Boys 10 years and older work in mines for 14 or 15 hours a day, sometimes starting as early as 3 or 4 a.m. Adults work two shifts of eight hours each, but boys don’t get shifts because it costs too much. Younger boys open and close ventilation doors, and older boys do heavier jobs like carrying coal.

These boys work long hours underground until they are 18 to 22 years old, then they do real miner jobs. Kids and young people are treated worse and work harder now than before. Most miners want a law to stop children under 14 from working in mines. 

Then a mine owner named Hussey Vivian asked if poor families might need their kids to work. Mr. Bruce answered that even if a family is sick or has only a mother, laws must protect all children under 12 or 14 from working in mines, no matter the family’s situation.
