When a worker reaches this very low point, even a small increase in food prices, stopping work, illness, or other problems make their situation much worse and can completely ruin them. They get into debt, lose credit, have to pawn their most needed clothes and furniture, and finally, the family has to ask for help as poor people. In this “capitalist paradise,” even a tiny change in the price of basic food causes more deaths and crimes!

In all of Belgium, there are 930,000 families. According to official numbers, 90,000 families are rich and can vote, which means 450,000 people. Then there are 390,000 middle-class families in towns and villages, most of whom are slowly becoming workers, which totals about 1,950,000 people.

Finally, there are 450,000 working-class families, or 2,250,000 people. Only a few of these families live the good life described by Ducpétiaux. Out of the 450,000 working-class families, more than 200,000 are on the list of poor people.

Now, looking at British farm workers: nowhere is the harsh fight between rich owners and poor workers clearer than in English farming and cattle raising, where the workers’ lives have gotten worse. Modern farming in England started in the mid-1700s, but the big changes in land ownership began much earlier.

If we trust Arthur Young, who watched farming closely but didn’t think deeply, farm workers in 1771 had it worse than those at the end of the 1300s, when workers “could live well and even save money.” The 1400s were known as the “golden age” for workers in towns and countryside. But even just 40 years before 1777, things got worse. A report showed that landlords and tenants worked together to keep wages low for workers. Between 1737 and 1777, real farm wages dropped by about 25%.

Dr. Richard Price said that the government’s policies helped the rich more and more, and warned that soon the country might have only rich people and poor beggars, or rulers and slaves. Still, from 1770 to 1780, farm workers had better food, homes, respect, and fun than at any time since. In 1770-71, their average wage could buy 90 pints of wheat, but by 1797 it was only 65, and in 1808 just 60 pints.

At the end of the Anti-Jacobin War, when landlords, farmers, merchants, bankers, and others got very rich, farm workers’ wages went up a bit. This was partly because paper money lost value and partly because food prices rose independently of that.
