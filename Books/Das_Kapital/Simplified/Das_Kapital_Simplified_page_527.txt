Prices for everything have gone up a lot, so when you sell your goods or services, you have to charge more. But we don't have anything to sell that would help us raise our prices to cover the higher costs of what we need to buy.

In another part, the knight asks the doctor: "Who do you mean will not lose money from this?" The doctor says: "I mean people who make money by buying and selling because they buy things at high prices and then sell them at even higher prices." The knight then asks, "Who else will make money from this?" The doctor replies: "People who rent land at old cheap rates and grow crops on it. They pay little for the land but sell their products at the new higher prices." The knight asks, "Who will lose more money than these people make?" The doctor answers: "Noblemen, gentlemen, and others who live on fixed rents or salaries, or who don’t work the land or buy and sell goods."

In France during the Middle Ages, the régisseur (a manager or collector for feudal lords) became like a businessman who often used cheating or extortion to become rich. Sometimes these managers were even noblemen themselves. For example, a knight named Jacques de Thoraine kept accounts for the Duke of Burgundy in the late 1300s. This shows how middlemen took most of the profits in many parts of life. For example, in the economy, bankers, traders, and shopkeepers take the best profits; lawyers charge their clients a lot; politicians are more important than the people who vote; and in religion, priests stand between God and the people, pushing God aside.

In France and England, large feudal lands were divided into many small farms, but conditions were better for the people in France. During the 14th century, farms called "terriers" appeared, and their number kept growing past 100,000. These farms paid rent that was between 1/12 and 1/5 of their produce, either in money or goods. These farms were part of bigger estates, and many were very small, only a few acres. The farmers also had some legal power over the people living on their land, divided into four levels. The farmers often suffered under many small rulers who treated them badly. Monteil said there were once 160,000 judges in France, but today only about 4,000 courts, including local justices, are needed.
