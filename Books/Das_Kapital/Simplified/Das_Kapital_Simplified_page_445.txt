They say wages go up because there’s more money (capital) available. When wages rise, more people want to work and have kids, so the number of workers grows fast. This keeps happening until there are too many workers, and not enough money to pay them all. Then wages go down.

When wages fall, fewer people can survive, so the number of workers slowly drops. This means there’s more money compared to workers again. Some people say that lower wages make workers work harder, which helps money grow again, but also stops the number of workers from growing too fast. Then, when there aren’t enough workers for all the jobs, wages rise again. This cycle keeps repeating. It’s like a constant back-and-forth in capitalist systems.

Between 1849 and 1859, wages went up a little bit in English farming areas, even though the price of food dropped. For example, in Wiltshire, weekly pay went from 7 shillings to 8 shillings; in Dorsetshire, from 7 or 8 shillings to 9 shillings. This happened because many workers left the farms to work in war efforts, railroads, factories, and mines.

When wages are low, even a small increase sounds like a big deal. If someone makes 20 shillings a week and gets 22, that’s a 10% raise. But if they make 7 shillings and get 9, that’s a 28% raise, which sounds huge. Farmers complained a lot, and a newspaper called the London Economist called this a “general and substantial advance” in wages.

So what did farmers do? Did they wait for the number of workers to grow so wages would drop again? No. They brought in more machines, and suddenly, they didn’t need as many workers anymore.

Because of this, more money was spent on farming, but in a way that used machines and was more productive.

This made the need for workers go down, not just compared to money, but in total.

The economic idea mixed up two things. One is how wages change overall depending on the total number of workers and total money. The other is how workers get spread out over different jobs. For example, if one industry is doing really well and making more money, it gets more investment, so it needs more workers and pays them better.

Because of better pay, more workers move to that industry until there are too many workers again, and wages drop back to normal or even lower if there’s too much competition. Then workers stop moving there and might even leave. Economists think this shows why wages and worker numbers change together, but really, this only shows how workers move between different jobs depending on where the money is.

During slow times or normal times, there’s a reserve group of unemployed or underemployed workers who keep pressure on those who have jobs. During times when too many goods are made and the economy is struggling, this reserve group keeps workers from asking for too much pay.

So, having extra workers who aren’t fully employed is the key part of how the supply and demand for labor works.
