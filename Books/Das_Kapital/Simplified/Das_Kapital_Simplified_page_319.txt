It wasn’t parents misusing their power that caused kids to be exploited for work. Instead, it was the way capitalism works that destroyed the economic reasons for parents to control their kids. This made parents’ control turn into a bad kind of power.

Even though the old family bonds break down under capitalism, modern factories give women, young people, and kids important jobs outside the home. This helps create a new, better kind of family and relationships between men and women.

It’s silly to think the old Christian family model is the only right one. Families have changed over time, like in ancient Rome, Greece, and other places. Also, when men and women of all ages work together, it can help people grow and learn. But under capitalism, where workers only exist to make money for bosses, this can turn into a bad system that hurts and controls workers.

There was a need to make laws, called Factory Acts, that didn’t just protect workers in the first factories but all workers everywhere. Old ways of making things by hand changed into factory work, and this happened fast. Handcrafts and home work became places where workers were treated very badly and unfairly.

Two things made this worse: first, when laws controlled one part of work, bosses found other ways to exploit workers even more. Second, bosses wanted fair competition, which meant they didn’t want any rules stopping them from using cheap labor.

For example, some bosses, like the Cooksley family in Bristol, followed the Factory Act rules, but they lost workers to other places where kids worked later. They said it was unfair because they didn’t get the full work from the boys.

Another boss, Mr. Simpson from London, said he supported laws to control work hours. He worried that if other factories worked longer hours, they would get more orders and beat him in business.

In the end, the people making laws said it wasn’t fair if big factories had rules but smaller workshops didn’t, because then the smaller places would have an advantage.
