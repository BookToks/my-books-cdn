The farmer can’t just do all the work by himself, and if he tries, I believe he actually loses out. His job is to watch over everything: he has to keep an eye on the thresher, or else he’ll lose money because some corn won’t get threshed. He also has to watch the mowers, reapers, and other workers. He needs to check his fences all the time and make sure nothing is ignored. If he stayed in just one place, things would get neglected.

This book is really interesting. It explains how the “capitalist farmer” or “merchant farmer” came about. This type of farmer is proud of himself compared to small farmers who only work enough to survive. The capitalist farmers don’t have to do all the manual labor themselves. At first, they do some work, but eventually, they don’t have to do any physical labor at all.

The modern chemistry idea called the molecular theory was first explained by Laurent and Gerhardt. This idea is about groups of carbon compounds that follow specific patterns. For example, paraffins follow the formula CnH2n+2, normal alcohols have CnH2n+2O, and fatty acids have CnH2nO2. By adding parts like CH2 to these formulas, new and different compounds are created. Some people think Laurent and Gerhardt’s role was bigger than it really was. 

Martin Luther called these kinds of businesses “The Company Monopolia.”

A report from April 30th, 1849, talks about these companies.

Factory Inspector Stuart, who was from Scotland, was different from other English inspectors because he liked the capitalist way of thinking. He said a certain letter from factory owners was very helpful for others in the same business. He believed it would convince people who were worried about changing work hours to be okay with it.
