I haven’t been to bed since the night before last. Last night, there were eight or nine other boys working. All but one of them showed up this morning. I get paid 3 shillings and sixpence. I don’t get extra money for working at night. I worked two nights last week.

Fernyhough, a ten-year-old boy, says, “I don’t always get an hour for dinner. Sometimes I only get half an hour, especially on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.”

Dr. Greenhow says that people in the pottery areas of Stoke-on-Trent and Wolstanton don’t live very long. In Stoke, only about 36.6% of men over 20 work in the potteries, and in Wolstanton, only 30.4% do. But in Stoke, more than half of the deaths among men that age are because of lung diseases from working in the potteries. In Wolstanton, nearly 40% of deaths are from these diseases.

Dr. Boothroyd, a doctor in Hanley, says, “Each new generation of potters is smaller and weaker than the last one.” Another doctor, Mr. M’Bean, has noticed the same thing over 25 years. He says potters are getting shorter and less broad.

These facts come from Dr. Greenhow’s report in 1860.

In 1863, the Commissioners’ report said Dr. J. T. Arledge, a senior doctor, described potters as a group who are not just weak physically but also morally. They are usually small, have misshaped bodies and chests, get old too fast, and don’t live long. They are often tired and pale and suffer from stomach problems, liver and kidney troubles, and rheumatism. But mostly, they get lung diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis, bronchitis, and asthma. There is even a special kind of asthma called “potter’s asthma” or “potter’s consumption.”

Two-thirds or more of potters also get scrofula, a disease that attacks glands, bones, or other body parts. The reason the potter population isn’t even worse is because new people from nearby areas move in and marry healthier people.

Mr. Charles Parsons, a former hospital doctor, wrote to Commissioner Longe saying he was upset when he saw poor children losing their health because their parents or bosses made them work too hard. He said the main cause of the potters’ diseases is “long hours.”

The Commission’s report hopes that such an important industry won’t keep being known for causing bad health, lots of suffering, and early death for the workers who made it successful.

All of this is true for potteries in Scotland too.

The making of lucifer matches started in 1833 after they found out how to put phosphorus on the matches.
