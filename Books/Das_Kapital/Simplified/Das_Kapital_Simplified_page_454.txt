We were mostly focused on how workers live and work. But to fully understand how money builds up in society, we also need to look at how workers live outside their jobs, like what they eat and where they live. This book mainly talks about the poorest workers in factories and on farms, who make up most of the working class.

First, a quick note about official poverty, which means the part of the working class that can’t find jobs and has to rely on government help. In England, the number of people officially counted as poor was 851,369 in 1851; it went up to 877,767 in 1856, and 971,433 in 1865. Because of the cotton shortage, these numbers rose to over a million in 1863 and 1864.

The crisis in 1866 hit London the hardest. London is very crowded, even more than Scotland, and poverty there increased by almost 20% in 1866 compared to 1865, and by almost 25% compared to 1864. It went up even more in early 1867. Looking at these numbers, we see two things: first, the number of poor people goes up and down depending on how the economy is doing. Second, the official numbers don’t always show the full picture, especially as workers become more aware of their struggles and fight for their rights.

For example, the harsh treatment of poor people in workhouses (places where the really poor had to live) has been happening for a long time. Newspapers complained about it in recent years, but the same problems were reported back in 1844. The fact that many people were dying of starvation in London over the last ten years shows how terrible life was in these workhouses, which were like punishment for being poor.

During the cotton shortage in 1862, Dr. Smith was asked to study how well workers in Lancashire and Cheshire were eating. He had studied nutrition before and said that to avoid starvation diseases, an average woman needs about 3,900 grains of carbon and 180 grains of nitrogen in her daily food, which is like 2 pounds of good bread. An average man needs about 4,300 grains of carbon and 200 grains of nitrogen daily, a bit more than women. For a whole week, men and women need about 28,600 grains of carbon and 1,330 grains of nitrogen. His numbers matched closely with what the cotton workers were actually eating in December 1862, which was just enough to survive.

In 1863, the government ordered another study of the worst-fed workers in England. Dr. Simon chose Dr. Smith again to do this. The study looked at farm workers and also people like silk-weavers, needlewomen, glove-makers, stocking-weavers, and shoemakers. Most of these workers lived in towns except for the stocking-weavers. The study only looked at the healthiest families who were doing a bit better than others.

The study found that in only one group of indoor workers did the average nitrogen intake just barely meet the minimum needed to avoid starvation. In another group, it almost reached that level. But in two other groups, there was a serious lack of both nitrogen and carbon in their diets.
