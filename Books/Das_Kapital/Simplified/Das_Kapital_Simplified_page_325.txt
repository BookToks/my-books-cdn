When about 400 or 500 girls become the wives of coal miners, the men feel really bad about it, and this makes them leave their homes and start drinking. 

If women were not allowed to work in the coal mines, you would also have to stop them from working in the ironworks, right? I can’t speak for any other jobs.

Do you see any difference between women working in ironworks and women working above ground in coal mines? I haven’t really checked on that.

Can you tell if one group is treated differently from the other? I don’t know, but from visiting houses, I know things are really bad in our area.

Would you stop women from working if the job is degrading? I think that could be harmful because a mother’s teaching is very important to English families.

That also applies to farm work, doesn’t it? Yes, but farm work is only for two seasons, while mining work lasts all year.

These women often work day and night, getting soaked and ruining their health. Have you looked into that? I have noticed it, and I haven’t seen anything worse than the effect of women working at the coal pit. It is really a man’s job—a strong man’s job.

You think that the better coal miners who want to improve themselves don’t get help from the women but instead get pulled down? Yes.

After some tricky questions, it becomes clear why the bosses “care” about widows and poor families. The coal owners hire certain men to watch over the work, and they try to save money by hiring girls who earn 1 shilling to 1 shilling 6 pence a day, instead of paying a man 2 shillings 6 pence a day.

About the coroner’s inquests when accidents happen, do the workers trust these investigations? No, they don’t.

Why not? Mostly because the juries are made up of men who know nothing about mining.

Are workers ever on the juries? Never, only as witnesses.

Who usually gets picked for the juries? Usually local tradesmen who might be influenced by the mine owners. They don’t know much and can’t really understand the mining terms or the witnesses.

Would you want people who have worked in mines to be on the jury? Yes, at least some. The workers often feel the verdict doesn’t match the evidence.

One big reason for having a jury is to make sure it’s fair, right? Yes, that’s true.

Do you think the jury would be fair if many of its members were workers? I don’t see why the workers would be unfair.
