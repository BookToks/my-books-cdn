A big group of workers, led by a business owner, needs managers and supervisors to tell everyone what to do, just like in a real army. These managers’ main job is to keep an eye on the work while it’s happening. When we compare how farmers and small craftsmen work alone with how slaves were forced to work, economists think that supervision is an extra cost. But in capitalism, they see supervision as necessary because workers have to work together, and because the boss and workers have different interests. A person is a boss not because they’re good at leading, but because they own the business. Being a leader is part of owning capital, just like in old times, landowners had power as judges or generals. Workers own their ability to work until they agree to sell it to the boss, and they can only sell their own individual work power.

This doesn’t change just because a boss hires 100 workers instead of one and makes separate deals with each. The boss can make those 100 people work without letting them team up. He pays each worker for their individual work, not for working together. Since the workers don’t connect with each other before starting, they’re separate people who only deal with the boss. They only start working as a team when they begin the job, but by then, they don’t belong to themselves anymore.

Once they start working, they become part of the boss’s capital. As team members, they are like parts of a machine owned by the boss. The extra power that comes from working together is actually the power of capital. This power shows up for free when workers are put in certain conditions, and it’s the boss who creates these conditions. Because it costs the boss nothing, and because the workers don’t develop this power before their work belongs to the boss, it looks like this power is something natural that capital has.

The huge results of workers teaming up can be seen in the giant buildings made by ancient people like the Egyptians and others.

In the past, these ancient states, after paying for their armies and governments, had extra resources they used to build amazing and useful things. Their control over almost all the non-farming people made it possible to build huge monuments that still show their power today. The Nile Valley produced enough food to support many non-farming workers, and this food, owned by the rulers and priests, helped build the giant monuments. Moving the huge statues and heavy stones needed lots of human labor. The number of workers and their focused effort was enough. We see huge coral reefs rising from the ocean floor into islands and solid land, but each individual coral is tiny and weak.
