Every product, when it first enters the market and changes its form, does so only to leave the market again and be replaced by other products. Money, however, stays in the market as the tool for buying and selling, moving around all the time. So, the question is, how much money does the market need all the time?

In any country, every day, many sales and purchases happen at the same time but in different places. The prices of products are imagined as certain amounts of money. Because money and products always meet each other directly—money on the buying side and products on the selling side—the amount of money needed is decided by adding up all the prices of the products. Actually, money represents a certain amount of gold that matches the total prices of all products. This makes sense.

We know that if the value of products stays the same, their prices can still change depending on the value of gold, which is what money is made of. If gold’s value goes down, prices go up, and if gold’s value goes up, prices go down. When this happens, the amount of money in use must change in the same way. This change happens not because money is used for buying and selling, but because it measures value. First, prices move opposite to the value of money, and then the amount of money moves the same way as the prices.

The same thing would happen if silver replaced gold as money, or if gold replaced silver. More silver would be used if it replaced gold, or less gold would be used if it replaced silver. The value of the metal used as money changes, so do the prices of products, and so does the amount of money needed to pay for those prices.

We know that gold (or the metal used as money) enters the market as a product with its own value. When money shows prices, its value is already set. If its value drops, this first shows up in the prices of products that are traded directly for precious metals where they are made. Most other products, especially in less developed societies, will keep being valued by old and wrong ideas for a while.

Still, products affect each other through their shared value, so their prices in gold or silver slowly adjust to the true values. Finally, all products are priced based on the new value of the metal used as money. This happens along with more precious metals coming into the market because they replace the products directly traded for them at their sources.

So, as products get their true prices and their values match the lower value of the precious metal, the amount of that metal needed to pay those prices is ready beforehand.
