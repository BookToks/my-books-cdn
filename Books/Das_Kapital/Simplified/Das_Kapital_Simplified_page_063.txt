Chapter 2

Money, like gold, has two kinds of uses. First, it can be used as a regular thing, like gold being used to fix teeth or make fancy items. Second, it has a special use because of its role in society.

All products are basically just different forms of money, and money is the one thing everyone agrees on. So, when we think of money, it’s like the main product, and other things are just different products. Money shows the value of all other things.

Some people thought that because money can be replaced by symbols like paper bills, its value must be fake. But that’s not true. Money is more than just a symbol.

What’s really going on is that money shows social relationships between people. Every product is like a symbol of the work put into it. But some people wrongly said these social meanings are just made-up ideas everyone agrees on. This was a common way to explain things in the 18th century when people didn’t understand why social relationships looked so strange.

Knowing that gold is money doesn’t tell us how much a certain amount is worth. The value of money, like any product, depends on how much work it took to make. This value is shown by how much other products, made with the same amount of work, it can be traded for. This is figured out through trading at the place where the product is made. When money starts being used, its value is already set.

By the late 1600s, people understood that money is a product, but this was just the beginning. The real challenge is understanding how and why a product becomes money.

When two products are traded, one shows the value of the other. It might seem like the product used to measure value has a natural value of its own. But this is just an illusion. What really happens is that one product, like gold, becomes the universal way to show value because everyone agrees on it.

It’s not that gold becomes money because other products use it to show value. Instead, all other products show their value in gold because gold is money.

This process happens so smoothly that we don’t see the steps. Products find their value already shown perfectly in another product that exists alongside them. Gold and silver, straight from the earth, seem to represent all human work right away.
