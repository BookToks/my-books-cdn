In earlier reports, several experienced manufacturers said that working too many hours makes workers tired and weak too soon.

John Ward wrote about the town of Stoke-upon-Trent in 1843. In 1863, Ferrand gave a speech in the House of Commons. Cotton manufacturers used the same words to describe the problem.

Mr. Villiers wanted to help but had to say no to the manufacturers because of the law. Still, the local poor law boards helped the manufacturers get what they wanted. Mr. A. Redgrave, an Inspector of Factories, said that orphans and poor children were legally treated as apprentices. This system didn’t have the old abuses, but there was some abuse when girls and young women were brought from Scotland to work in factories in Lancashire and Cheshire.

Under this system, the manufacturer made a deal with the workhouse. The manufacturer fed, clothed, and housed the children and gave them a small amount of money. Mr. Redgrave made a strange comment considering that 1860 was a very good year for the English cotton trade, with high wages. Even though many people were leaving Ireland, England, and Scotland to go to Australia and America, and some places had fewer workers because of harsh conditions, there was still a big demand for work.

Mr. Redgrave said this kind of labor was only wanted when no one else was available because it was expensive. A 13-year-old boy would usually earn about 4 shillings a week. But to take care of 50 or 100 boys—feeding, clothing, housing, giving medical care, and supervising them—would cost more than 4 shillings per boy each week.

He didn’t explain how a worker could do all that for their children on just 4 shillings a week, while the manufacturer couldn’t do it for many children all at once.

It’s important to know that since the Factory Act of 1850, the English cotton industry was seen as the best in England. English cotton workers had it better than workers in other countries. For example, workers in Prussia worked at least ten hours more each week than English workers. If they worked at home on their own looms, they worked even longer hours.

After the Industrial Exhibition in 1851, Mr. Redgrave visited factories in France and Germany. He said the Prussian workers earned just enough to buy simple food and a few small comforts. They lived on coarse food and worked hard, but their situation was worse than English workers.

Many overworked workers died quickly, but their jobs were quickly filled by others, so the situation didn’t change.

A report from 1863 focused on farm workers. It said that Sutherland, a county in England, was often seen as a place that had improved a lot.
