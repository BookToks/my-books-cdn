The idea of capitalism is so closely tied to money and stuff in the minds of political economists that they call everything capital, even when it’s actually the opposite. This is true for Wakefield. Also, when many workers each own their own tools and work for themselves, he calls that equal division of capital. Political economists are like old feudal lawyers who used the old labels from feudal law to describe money matters.

Wakefield says, “If everyone in society has an equal share of capital, no one would want to gather more than they can use themselves. This kind of thing happens in new American settlements, where people really want to own land, so there aren’t many hired workers.” So, as long as workers can keep their tools and work for themselves, capitalism and the idea of building up capital don’t really happen. The class of wage workers needed for capitalism doesn’t exist.

But how did it happen in old Europe that workers lost their land and had to work for wages? It was because of a special kind of social agreement. People decided to split themselves into owners of capital and workers. This division was planned together. In short, most people gave up their own land and freedom to help the growth of capital.

You might think this kind of self-sacrifice would be strongest in the colonies, where conditions could make this social contract real. So why do we need “systematic colonization” instead of just letting colonization happen naturally? Wakefield says that in the Northern States of America, less than a tenth of people are hired workers, but in England, most people are workers. The idea that workers give up their land for capital is weak, so slavery is the real base of wealth in colonies, according to Wakefield. His plan for organized colonization only works because he deals with free people, not slaves.

The first Spanish settlers in Saint Domingo didn’t bring workers from Spain. Without workers, their capital would have disappeared or shrunk to only what each person could use alone. This also happened in the Swan River Settlement, where lots of seeds, tools, and animals were wasted because there weren’t enough workers to use them. No settler kept much more capital than they could handle on their own.

We have seen that taking land away from most people is the foundation of capitalism. But a free colony is different – most land is public, and every settler can claim some land as their own and use it without stopping others from doing the same. This is why colonies can be both successful and flawed – they don’t support big capital growth.

Where land is cheap and everyone is free to get some, not only is labor expensive for the worker, but it’s also hard to get workers to work together. Since in colonies workers mostly keep their land or only lose it a little, farming and industry stay connected, and small family businesses don’t disappear.
