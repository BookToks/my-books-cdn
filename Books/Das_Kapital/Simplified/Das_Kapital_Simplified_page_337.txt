“Don’t bother the girls who grind the corn, miller girls, and let them sleep peacefully. Let the rooster crow in the morning for nothing! God has told the Nymphs to do the girls’ work, and now the Nymphs jump lightly over the wheels, making the axles spin with their spokes and turning the heavy stones around.

Let’s live like our ancestors did, and take a break from work to enjoy the gifts that the Goddess gives us.”

Of course, different jobs require different amounts of hard work. But, as Adam Smith explained, small differences like these are balanced out by other things that are special to each kind of work. The amount of work done, measured by time, doesn’t really change because how long you work and how hard you work are just two ways of saying the same thing.

This is especially true for piece-work, which we will talk more about later in this book.

Workers said they worked better when they got paid by how much they made. They felt happier and more motivated because they could finish earlier and help each other, from the youngest to the oldest workers.

Reports from different years show changes in how factories measured power and work, including new ways to count machines and different types of mills. These reports also started to include more details about the kinds of work done, like stocking-weaving, and made better distinctions between different industries.
