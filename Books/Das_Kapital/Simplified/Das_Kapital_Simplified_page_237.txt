That time period was from around the middle of the 1500s to the late 1700s.

Manufacturing started in two main ways. First, a boss would bring together workers from different crafts into one workshop. Each worker had a special skill, and a product, like a carriage, would pass through many hands before it was finished. For example, making a carriage used to involve many independent workers like wheel makers, tailors, locksmiths, and painters. But in this new system, all these workers were brought together in one place to work together.

At first, everyone still did their full job, like a tailor only making clothes, but now only for carriages. Over time, because they did just one part all the time, they got really good at that one thing but lost the skill to do their old full craft. So, making a carriage became split into many small jobs, each done by a different worker, all working together. This way of making things also happened with cloth and other products, where different crafts worked under one boss.

The second way manufacturing started was almost the opposite. One boss hired many workers who all did the same job, like making paper, type, or needles. Each worker made the whole product by themselves at first. But when they needed to make more products faster, the work was divided. Instead of each person doing everything, the job was split into small parts. Each worker did only one small task, all at the same time with others.

This change made the work more organized and efficient. The product stopped being made by one person from start to finish and became a group effort, with each worker doing one small part. For example, a papermaker used to do all steps alone, but in Dutch paper factories, many workers did different parts at the same time.
