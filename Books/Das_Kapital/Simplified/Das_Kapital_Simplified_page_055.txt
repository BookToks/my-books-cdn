The work that creates useful things is called Work, which is different from Labour, the kind that creates Value and is measured by quantity. Some economists, like S. Bailey, have tried to study value but failed because they mixed up what value really is with its form. Also, they only looked at the amount side of value, influenced by practical business thinking. Bailey said, “Having a certain amount is what makes something valuable.”

Benjamin Franklin, one of the first economists after William Petty, understood value better and said that trade is basically exchanging one person's work for another’s. He believed the value of everything should be measured by labor. Franklin didn’t realize that by doing this, he ignored the differences between types of work and treated all human labor as equal. Even so, he talked about “one labor” and “another labor,” then just “labor” as the main source of value.

Humans are a bit like products. We don’t come into the world seeing ourselves clearly or thinking “I am me” like a philosopher. Instead, people understand who they are by comparing themselves to others. Peter knows he is a person by seeing that Paul is also a person. So, Paul becomes an example of what it means to be human for Peter.

Here, value sometimes means how much value something has, or its size.

Some economists have used the difference between the size of value and how it’s expressed to confuse people. For example, if the value of thing A falls because thing B’s value rises, even though the work to make A hasn’t changed, this idea challenges the belief that the value of something depends only on the work put into it. J. Broadhurst said that if A’s rising value changes B’s value too, even though B’s work cost stayed the same, then the idea that value depends on work or cost doesn’t work. But this is like saying if you look at fractions like 10/20, 10/50, or 10/100, the number 10 stays the same but looks smaller compared to bigger numbers. So, the idea that the size of a number depends on how many times 1 fits in it would also be false.

Some relationships, called reflex categories by the philosopher Hegel, are interesting. For example, a man is a king only because other people are his subjects. But those people think they are subjects just because he is king.

F. L. A. Ferrier and Charles Ganilh wrote about government and economics in the early 1800s.
