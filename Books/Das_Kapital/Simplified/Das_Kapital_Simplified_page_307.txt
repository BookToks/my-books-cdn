Now, let’s talk about something called domestic industry. To understand how bad it can be, you can look at nail-making in some small villages in England. But here, I’ll just give examples from lace-making and straw-plaiting, which aren’t done by machines yet and don’t compete with factory work.

About 150,000 people in England make lace. Only 10,000 of them follow the Factory Act of 1861, which sets some rules. Most of the other 140,000 workers are women, young people, and kids, with very few men. Their health is pretty bad. A doctor named Dr. Trueman checked 686 female lace-makers, mostly aged 17 to 24, and found that more and more were getting sick with consumption (a serious lung disease) over the years.

The Factory Act of 1861 controls how lace is made by machines, which is common in England. But now, we’re looking at workers who do finishing and mending at home, not in factories. Finishing means adding final touches to machine-made lace, and it includes many small tasks.

Finishing lace happens either in “mistresses’ houses” or in women’s own homes, sometimes with their kids helping. The mistresses are also poor. They work in private homes and get orders from manufacturers or warehouse workers. They hire as many women, girls, and young kids as their space and work demand allows. Usually, 10 to 40 women work in these rooms. Kids start working at around six years old, sometimes even younger.

They work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., with only 1.5 hours for meals, which are often eaten at strange times and in dirty rooms. When business is busy, they might work from 6 or 8 a.m. until 10 or even midnight. The space each worker has is tiny—much smaller than what soldiers get in barracks or hospitals. The rooms have gas lights that use up the oxygen. To keep the lace clean, kids often have to take off their shoes, even in winter.

In Nottingham, it’s common to see 14 to 20 children crowded into a small room about 12 feet wide, working 15 hours a day at boring, tiring jobs. Even the youngest kids work fast and never stop moving their fingers.
