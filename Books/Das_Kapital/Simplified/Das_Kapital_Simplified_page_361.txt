If capitalist production started, the honest person might have to work six days a week just to keep the product of one day’s work. Nature’s gifts don’t explain why he would need to work six days or why he has to give five days of extra work. Nature only explains why he needs to work one day a week to survive. His extra product doesn’t come from some mysterious power in human labor.

So, both the natural and the social productivity of labor actually show the productivity of the capital put into that labor.

Ricardo never tried to explain where surplus value comes from. He thought it was just part of capitalism, which he saw as the normal way society works. When he talked about labor’s productivity, he wasn’t looking for the cause of surplus value, just what affects how much it is. His followers said labor’s productivity causes profit (which means surplus value). This was better than the mercantilists, who said profit came from selling products above their value during trade. But still, Ricardo’s group didn’t really solve the problem. They knew it was a risky topic to dig into. But John Stuart Mill, many years later, said he was better than the mercantilists by copying Ricardo’s early ideas without real improvement.

Mill said, “Profit happens because labor makes more than what is needed to support itself.” That’s just the old idea. Then he added, “Capital makes profit because things like food, clothes, and tools last longer than the time it took to make them.” But this mixes up how long labor lasts with how long its products last. For example, a baker’s product lasts one day, so he wouldn’t get the same profit as a machine maker whose products last 20 years. It’s true that if a bird’s nest didn’t last longer than the time it took to build, birds wouldn’t have nests.

Once this basic fact is clear, Mill says he’s better than the mercantilists.

He says, “Profit doesn’t come from buying and selling, but from labor’s ability to produce; the country’s total profit is always what labor’s productivity creates, even if no exchange happens. If there was no trade or job division, there still would be profits.”

For Mill, buying and selling are just side things in capitalism, and profits would exist even without selling labor power!

He also says, “If workers as a group produce 20% more than their wages, profits will be 20%, no matter what prices do.” This is a simple way of saying if workers create extra value equal to 20% of their wages, the capitalist’s profit is 20% compared to total wages.
