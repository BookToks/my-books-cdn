These reserves act like channels that let money flow in or out of circulation, so the system never gets overloaded.

B. Means of Payment

When we first looked at how buying and selling works, we saw that value shows up in two ways: as a product on one side and as money on the other. The people owning the products met as equals because their goods and money had the same value.

But as buying and selling got more complex, sometimes selling a product and getting paid for it didn’t happen at the same time. For example, some things take longer to make than others. Different products depend on different seasons. Some goods are sold right where they’re made, while others have to be brought from far away. So, one seller might be ready to sell before the buyer is ready to buy.

When the same people keep trading regularly, they adjust their deals based on how long it takes to make things. Also, sometimes you sell the right to use something, like renting a house for a set time. The buyer only really gets to use it after paying. So, they pay after they get the use. The seller sells something that already exists, but the buyer is like a promise to pay later. The seller is now a creditor (someone owed money), and the buyer is a debtor (someone who owes money).

Because buying and selling changed like this, money got a new job: it became a way to pay later.

Being a creditor or debtor comes from normal buying and selling. At first, these roles change back and forth between the same people. But this difference can cause bigger problems and last longer. Sometimes, these roles happen even outside buying and selling.

In history, fights between rich and poor often looked like fights between debtors and creditors. In ancient Rome, poor people who owed money lost out and were replaced by slaves. In the Middle Ages, feudal lords who owed money lost their power and land.

Still, the debtor and creditor roles showed deeper conflicts between social classes.

Back to buying and selling: the moment when goods and money appear on opposite sides of a sale doesn’t happen at the same time anymore.

Money now first acts as a way to set the price of what’s sold. The price shows how much the buyer owes and when they have to pay. Second, money works as a promise to buy.

Even if the buyer hasn’t paid yet, this promise lets the product change hands. The actual money doesn’t move until the payment day. When this happens, money stops moving around for a bit because it’s waiting to be paid later.

Money only enters the process after the product has already been sold. It no longer starts the exchange but finishes it by showing the final value or the universal item everyone agrees on.
