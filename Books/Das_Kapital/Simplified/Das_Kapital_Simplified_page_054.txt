Marx wrote that the real thing that gives value to something is labor. The amount of labor is measured by the time spent working. But before we talk about how value becomes exchange-value (what something is worth when traded), we need to understand more about what we’ve already learned.

I added a note here because sometimes people think that Marx means any product used by someone other than its maker is a commodity, but that’s not quite right.

Pietro Verri said that everything in the universe, whether made by humans or natural laws, isn’t truly created new but just changed in form. The human mind only understands creating by putting things together or taking them apart. This is true for making things and for making value or wealth. For example, when earth, air, and water turn into grain, or when a person turns insect secretions into silk, or pieces of metal into a watch, it’s all just transformation, not new creation.

Hegel also talked about ideas like this in his book “Philosophy of Right” in 1840.

Here, we’re not talking about the wages a worker gets for their labor time, but about the value of the product that contains that labor. Wages are a different idea that we haven’t reached yet in this discussion.

To show that labor alone can measure the value of all commodities, Adam Smith said, “Equal amounts of labor must always have the same value for the worker. When healthy and skilled, a worker always gives up the same rest, freedom, and happiness to work.” But Adam Smith mixed up the idea of value being based on labor time with value being based on the value of labor itself. He also thought of labor as just a sacrifice of rest and happiness, not as normal work activity. He was thinking about modern wage workers.

Another thinker before Adam Smith said it better: if one person works a week to make something needed for life, and someone else trades for it, the fair trade is based on how much labor and time each person spent. It’s like swapping one person’s labor in one thing for another person’s labor in something else for the same time period.

English has different words to explain the two sides of labor in this idea.
