This process is different from the one before because it only involves changing how money that already exists is shared and used. It doesn’t depend on making more wealth overall or on limits to how much can be saved. Capital can get really big in one place because it was lost by many others somewhere else. This is called centralisation, which is different from just gathering or concentrating capital.

The rules about how capitals come together or attract each other can’t be fully explained here. But some basic facts can be shared. Competition happens by making products cheaper. To make things cheaper, labor has to be more productive, which often needs bigger production. So, bigger capitals beat smaller ones. Also, as capitalism develops, the smallest amount of money needed to run a business properly gets bigger. This means small capitals try to work in areas that big industries don’t fully control yet. There, competition is really tough because many small capitals compete against each other, and this usually leads to many small businesses failing. Their money either goes to the winners or just disappears. Besides this, capitalist production also brings in the credit system, which starts off quietly helping small capitals grow by gathering money scattered around society. But soon, credit becomes a powerful tool in competition and turns into a huge system that helps centralise capitals.

As capitalism grows, two strong forces for centralisation develop – competition and credit. Also, as more money is made and saved, there is more capital to centralise. At the same time, growing industry creates new needs and new technology that require huge amounts of capital to work. So, now more than ever, individual capitals are drawn together and centralisation is stronger. But just because centralisation is happening doesn’t mean total social wealth has to grow. This is the main difference between centralisation and concentration. Concentration means producing more on a bigger scale. Centralisation means just changing how existing capital is grouped. Capital can become very powerful in one place because it was taken away from many others. In one industry, centralisation would be complete if all the money invested was combined into one big capital. In a whole society, centralisation would be complete only if all social capital was controlled by one person or company.

Centralisation finishes the job of accumulation by allowing business owners to grow their operations. Whether this happens violently, by breaking up smaller capitals and taking their money, or smoothly, by merging companies into joint-stock companies, the result is the same economically.
