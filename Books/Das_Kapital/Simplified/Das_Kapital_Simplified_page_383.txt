The daily or weekly wages depend on the price of labor, which changes based on the value of the worker’s effort or the difference between its price and value. Also, given the price of labor, wages depend on how many hours or days the worker actually works.

The price for one hour of work is found by dividing the value of a day’s work by the number of hours in that day. Let’s say a working day is 12 hours long and the daily value of the worker’s effort is 3 shillings, which equals the value of 6 hours of work. In this case, one working hour costs 3 pence, but the value created in that hour is 6 pence. If the worker works less than 12 hours, like 6 or 8 hours, they get paid less accordingly. Since the worker needs to work about 6 hours to earn a day’s wage, and they spend half of every hour working for themselves and half for the employer, they can’t earn the full value if they work less than 12 hours. Too much work can be harmful, but not enough work can also cause problems for the worker.

If the wage is set by the hour instead of by the day or week, the employer can decide how many hours to pay for and might use the worker less than the usual full day. Since the hourly wage is based on a full working day, this system doesn’t make sense if the work hours change all the time. The connection between paid work and unpaid work breaks down. The employer can make the worker do extra work without giving enough time for their own needs. Work might be very long sometimes and then stop completely at other times, depending on what the employer wants. The employer might say they are paying the normal hourly wage but make the worker work extra hours without extra pay. That’s why in 1860, London workers protested against being paid by the hour. Laws that limit the working day can stop these problems, but they don’t stop job losses caused by machines, changes in workers, or economic crises.

Even if the daily or weekly wage goes up, the price of labor per hour might stay the same or even go down. This happens when the workday gets longer than usual but the hourly wage doesn’t change. When the workday gets longer, the value of the worker’s effort actually increases faster than the length of the day because the worker gets more worn out. In many jobs where workers are paid by the hour and there are no legal limits on work time, people have started to see the normal workday as only up to about 10 hours long.
