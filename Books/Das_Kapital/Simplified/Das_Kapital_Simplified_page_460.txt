Bristol is a rich city, but it also has a lot of extreme poverty and family problems.

Now, let’s talk about a group of people who come from farming backgrounds but mostly work in factories and construction. They move around a lot, like soldiers, going wherever they are needed. When they’re not working, they live in temporary camps. These workers, called nomads, help build things like railways, bricks, and drains.

Unfortunately, when these workers set up their camps, they often bring diseases like smallpox, typhus, cholera, and scarlet fever to the areas nearby. For big projects like railways, the bosses usually give them wooden huts to live in. These huts are like makeshift villages but have no proper toilets or clean water. The workers have to pay rent for these huts, which makes the bosses earn money twice – from their work and their living spaces.

Here’s an example. In September 1864, Dr. Simon shared a report from a man in charge of cleaning up bad living conditions in Sevenoaks. The report said that before railway work started nearby, smallpox was almost unknown there. But when the railway from Lewisham to Tunbridge began, lots of workers had to live in huts built by the contractor, Mr. Jay. These huts had no fresh air or drains and were very crowded. Each family had only two rooms but had to take in extra people to pay rent.

The conditions were awful. At night, the workers suffered from bad smells and dirty water near their homes. A doctor who saw the huts said they were in terrible shape and warned that serious health problems would happen if nothing changed. About a year ago, Mr. Jay promised to set aside a hut for sick workers with contagious diseases, but even after smallpox cases and deaths, he never did.

On September 9th, a surgeon reported more smallpox cases in the huts and called the conditions shameful. There was also a special house for sick people that had been full for months. In one family, five children died from smallpox and fever. Between April and September, ten people died from smallpox in the parish, with four deaths in the huts. It’s hard to know exactly how many people got sick because families tried to keep it a secret.
