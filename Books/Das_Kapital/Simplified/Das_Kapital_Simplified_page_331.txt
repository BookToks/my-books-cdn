The steam engine is the reason manufacturing towns exist. Weaving was not an easy job; it was actually very detailed and needed skill. So, the power loom is a machine that does a lot of complicated work. It’s wrong to think that early machines only took over simple tasks. Spinning and weaving were broken down into different parts and the tools got better, but the work still needed skill. It’s not the work itself but the tools that started the idea of machines.

Before machines became common, wool production was the main industry in England. That’s why most early experiments with machines happened in wool making during the early 1700s. Cotton was easier to work with and benefited from the lessons learned in wool, and later wool machines were improved using ideas from cotton machines. Only in the ten years before 1866 did some parts of wool production, like combing wool, start to be done in factories. Using machines for combing wool replaced many hand workers. Before, wool was combed by hand, usually at the worker’s home. Now, it’s mostly done in factories, and hand combing is rare except for special cases. Some hand combers got jobs in factories, but most lost work because machines produce much more.

The factory system works by breaking a process into simpler steps, instead of having skilled workers do everything. At first, power looms were mostly made of wood, but modern ones are made of iron.

Old tools influenced the first machines a lot. For example, early power looms looked like old ones, and early blast furnace machines copied the shape of old bellows. Before the modern train was invented, people even tried to make a train with legs like a horse. It took a lot of mechanical knowledge and experience before machines were designed based on science instead of copying old tools.

Eli Whitney’s cotton gin didn’t change much for a long time. Only in the last ten years (since 1856) did someone named Mr. Emery from New York improve it with a simple but very useful change.

A small part added to lathes might seem unimportant, but it helped improve and spread the use of machines as much as Watt’s steam engine improvements did.
