People say that the problems and conflicts that come with using machines in capitalism don’t actually come from the machines themselves, but from how capitalism uses them. Machines by themselves can make work hours shorter, but when used by capitalists, they actually make work longer. Machines can make work easier, but under capitalism, they make work harder and more intense. Machines show how humans can control nature, but in capitalism, they make people slaves to those forces. Machines can create wealth for workers, but capitalism makes those workers poor.

Because of all this, some economists say these problems aren’t real—they only happen because of capitalism, not because of machines. They avoid thinking too hard about it and act like anyone who argues against capitalism using machines is actually arguing against machines themselves.

Sure, they admit that capitalism using machines can cause some short-term problems. But they think machines can only be used by capitalists, so any problem workers face from machines is the same as the problem of machines being used by workers. So, anyone who points out how capitalism uses machines badly must be against machines and progress!

This is like the story of Bill Sykes. He says, “Yes, someone was hurt, but it’s not the knife’s fault. Should we stop using knives because of that? Knives are useful everywhere—farming, surgery, eating. If we stop using knives, we go back to being uncivilized.”

Even though machines can put people out of work in some jobs, they can also create more jobs in other areas. But this doesn’t match the old idea that machines always make up for lost jobs. Because machine-made products cost less than hand-made ones, this means:

If machines make the same amount of stuff as hand workers did before, less work is needed overall. The work spent making machines and fuel is less than the work saved by using machines. But in real life, machines don’t just make the same amount—they make way more. For example, if fewer workers produce 400,000 yards of cloth with machines, when before they only made 100,000 by hand, that means four times more raw materials are needed. So, raw material production must increase a lot.

For other things like buildings, coal, and machinery, how much extra work is needed depends on how much more machine-made stuff is being produced compared to hand-made stuff.

So, as machines get used more in one industry, this actually boosts production in other industries that supply materials and tools. How many new jobs this creates depends on how long people work, how hard they work, and what kind of capital is used.
