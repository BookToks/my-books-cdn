Let’s start with an example. Imagine a boss needs to spend 300 shillings to pay 100 workers for one day. If the boss makes a 50% profit on their work, those 300 shillings create an extra 150 shillings worth of work, which means the workers put in 300 hours but only get paid for 150 of them.

Now, if the boss doubles the extra work by making the workers stay longer—from 6 hours to 12 hours—but pays only half as many workers (150 shillings instead of 300), the boss still makes the same extra 150 shillings. This means fewer workers can be balanced out by making each work more hours.

However, there’s a limit to this. No matter how much the boss pushes, a worker can’t work 24 hours straight. So, even if the boss pays fewer workers but makes them work longer, there’s a maximum amount of extra work they can get from each one.

For example, if 500 workers work 12 hours a day and the boss makes 100% profit, they get 1,500 shillings extra. But if the boss has 100 workers working 18 hours a day with a 200% profit, they only get 600 shillings extra. The total value created can never go beyond what 24 hours of work from all workers combined would be.

This limit is important because bosses want to hire fewer workers but still make the most profit. But if they cut too many workers and don’t increase how long each one works enough, the total profit actually goes down.

Finally, how much extra value the boss makes depends on two things: how much profit they get from each worker and how many workers they pay. If the working day is fixed and the pay per worker is fixed, the total profit depends only on how many workers the boss hires. So, more workers mean more total profit, and fewer workers mean less profit, assuming the profit rate stays the same.
