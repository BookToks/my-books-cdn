Spinning adds new value to cotton and the spindle because it uses human work in a general way. At the same time, spinning is a useful process that moves the value of the tools and materials into the finished product and keeps that value there. So, spinning creates two results at once.

When you add a certain amount of work, new value is created. Also, because of the kind of work spinning is, the original value of the tools and cotton stays in the product.

This two-part effect of work shows up in different situations.

Imagine someone invents a way for a spinner to spin in 6 hours what used to take 36 hours. Now, their work is six times more efficient. The amount spun in 6 hours goes from 6 pounds to 36 pounds. But each pound of cotton only gets one-sixth as much new work as before, so each pound adds less new value. However, the total value transferred from the cotton to the yarn is six times higher because more cotton is spun. This shows that work has two different roles: adding new value when taking more time, and preserving value by spinning more cotton in the same time.

Now, suppose the spinner’s speed stays the same, taking the same time to spin one pound of cotton. But the value of the cotton changes—it either becomes six times more valuable or one-sixth as valuable. The spinner still adds the same amount of new value because the work time is the same. But the value moved from the cotton to the yarn changes with the cotton’s worth. The same thing happens if the value of the tools changes but their usefulness stays the same.

Also, if the spinning process and the value of materials don’t change, the spinner uses the same amount of raw cotton and tools in the same time. The value kept in the product grows just as the new value added grows. For example, in two weeks, the spinner works twice as much, adds twice as much value, uses twice as much cotton, and wears out twice as much machinery. So, the value kept in two weeks’ product is twice that of one week. As long as things stay the same, the more new value the worker adds, the more old value he keeps, but this happens only because the conditions don’t change and are outside his control. You could say the worker always keeps old value in proportion to the new value he adds.
