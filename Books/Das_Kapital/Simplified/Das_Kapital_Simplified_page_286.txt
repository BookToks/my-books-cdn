The way factories run is all about saving money and being super efficient, but this often means they steal things that workers need while they’re on the job. Workers lose out on space, light, fresh air, and protection from dangerous or unhealthy conditions. They also don’t get basic things that would make their work easier or more comfortable. Some people, like Fourier, even called factories “tempered bagnos,” which means they saw them as harsh and tough places.

There has always been a fight between bosses (capitalists) and workers since the start of big businesses. This fight went on through the whole time when everything was made by hand. But once machines showed up, workers started fighting against the machines themselves. These machines were the tools that represented the power and control of the bosses.

Back in the 1600s, many people in Europe got really upset about the ribbon-loom, a machine used for weaving ribbons. It was first made in Germany. A man named Anthony Müller invented a machine that could weave 4 to 6 pieces at once. But the mayor was scared it would put lots of workers out of jobs, so he had Müller secretly killed. In Leyden, the machine wasn’t used until 1629, but the ribbon weavers protested so much that the town leaders banned it.

A man named Boxhorn wrote in 1663 that in Leyden, about 20 years earlier, some people made a machine that let one person weave more cloth than many people could before. This caused protests from the weavers, and the town council stopped the machine from being used. There were many rules made to stop the loom in 1632, 1639, and later, but by 1661, Holland allowed it again under some conditions.

The machine was also banned in Cologne in 1676, while its use in England caused fights among workers. In 1685, all of Germany forbade the machine, and in Hamburg, the city government even burned them in public. The Emperor Charles VI renewed this ban in 1719. It wasn’t until 1765 that the machine was allowed openly in Saxony.

This weaving machine was a big deal because it started huge changes in Europe. It was the first step toward the inventions that led to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s. It was so simple that even a beginner kid could work it by just moving a rod back and forth. The improved version could make 40 to 50 pieces of cloth at once.
