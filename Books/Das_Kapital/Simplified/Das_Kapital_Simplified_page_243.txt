Finally, just like manufacturing started by combining different crafts, it also grew by combining different kinds of manufacturing. For example, big English glass makers make their own clay pots for melting glass because the quality of these pots really affects how well the glass-making works. So, making one tool needed for production is connected to making the final product.

Also, making one product can be linked with making other products that use it as a raw material or mix with it later. For instance, flint glass making is combined with glass cutting and making brass parts, which are used to hold glass items. These different kinds of manufacturing work as separate parts of a bigger process but still have their own special jobs and workers. Even though mixing these makes things better, it doesn’t become a full technical system until machines take over.

Early on, people understood that the goal was to spend less time making things. Machines started being used for simple, big jobs that need a lot of power. For example, paper mills tore up rags to make paper, and metal works used stamping mills to crush ores. The Romans gave us the water-wheel, the first kind of machine. Craftspeople also gave us big inventions like the compass, gunpowder, printing, and automatic clocks. But machines were still less important than dividing up work, as Adam Smith said. The few machines in the 1600s were important because they helped scientists study mechanics.

The “collective worker” is a group of workers who each do a small part of the job, and together act like a machine during manufacturing. When making something, a person needs strength, skill, and focus, but one person can’t be good at all of these. So, manufacturing split the work into parts, and workers were grouped based on what they were best at. While natural talent helped decide jobs, manufacturing also helped workers get better at specific tasks.

The collective worker has all the skills needed to make a product, using different workers who each do their special job very well. The weaknesses of individual workers become strengths when they work together. Doing the same task over and over makes a worker very reliable, and being part of the group means they work like machine parts, steadily and on time. Because the group does both simple and complex tasks, workers need different kinds of training and are valued differently.
