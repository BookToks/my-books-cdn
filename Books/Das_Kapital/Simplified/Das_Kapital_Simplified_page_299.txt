Machines quickly help make more raw materials, just like the cotton gin helped produce more cotton.

Because machine-made goods are cheaper and transport and communication have improved, countries can sell their products to other countries more easily. This hurts small, handmade businesses in other countries and forces those places to focus on growing raw materials for the machine-using countries. For example, East India had to grow cotton, wool, hemp, jute, and indigo for Great Britain.

Modern industry also makes some workers unnecessary, which pushes people to move to new countries. These new places, like Australia, became colonies mainly for growing raw materials like wool. This created a new global system where some parts of the world focus on farming, while others focus on making products in factories.

This big change also affected farming in many ways, but we won’t go into that now.

In 1867, Mr. Gladstone asked the British government to report how much grain, corn, and flour the UK imported and exported between 1831 and 1866. Here’s a summary of the results:

- Imports grew a lot over time, from about 1 million quarters of grain to over 16 million.
- Exports stayed much smaller, around a few hundred thousand quarters.
- The difference between imports and exports increased steadily.
- The UK’s population also grew during this time.
- On average, each person consumed more grain over time than what was produced at home.

The factory system can grow very fast, but it relies on selling to the whole world. This causes fast production, then too many goods on the market, which leads to a slowdown and problems in making products.
