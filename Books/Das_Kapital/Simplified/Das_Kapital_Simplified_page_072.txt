We often forget that gold by itself isn’t money when it’s just a regular thing, and that when other things show their prices in gold, the gold is actually just the money form of those things.

At first, things (or commodities) enter trade just as they are. Then, the process splits them into two groups: things and money. This creates an obvious difference between them that matches the fact that things are useful and also have value.

Things, as useful items, are now different from money, which is used to trade. But both are still things with value and usefulness. This connection shows itself in two opposite ways. On one side, we have a regular thing that is useful. Its value is only shown in its price, which matches the gold that represents its real value. On the other side, gold in its real form is the symbol of value and money. Gold itself is exchange-value. Its usefulness is mostly an idea, shown in how it relates to all other things, because the uses of gold come from the uses of all other things. These opposite forms of things are how trading actually works.

Now, imagine the owner of some product – let’s say, a linen weaver. He has 20 yards of linen worth £2. He trades the linen for £2 in gold, and then, being a good man, he uses that £2 to buy a family Bible that costs the same. The linen, which he sees as just a thing holding value, he trades for gold, which is the linen’s value form. Then he trades the gold for the Bible, which will be useful and important to his family. This trade happens in two steps – changing the product into money, and then changing the money back into another product. These two steps are different trades for the weaver: selling (trading the product for money) and buying (trading the money for a product). Together, they make one act: selling to buy.

In the end, for the weaver, instead of having linen, he now has a Bible. He swapped one product for another that has the same value but a different use. He gets other things he needs the same way. For him, this whole process is just trading his work for someone else’s work – swapping products.

So, trading things goes through these changes in form:

Thing – Money – Thing.

C – M – C.

The final result is just trading one thing for another, the flow of work made real in things. When this happens, the trade is finished.

C – M. The first change, or sale. The jump of value from the thing into the gold is what I call the salto mortale (a big leap) of the product. If it doesn’t succeed, the thing isn’t hurt, but the owner definitely is. Because people’s jobs are specialized but their needs are many, this is a big deal for them.
