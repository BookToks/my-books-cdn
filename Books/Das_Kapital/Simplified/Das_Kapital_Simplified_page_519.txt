So, he has to work extra hard to make up for the gap in what he needs to do. The peasant often goes to bed very late in winter, like midnight or one o’clock, and wakes up early at five or six. Sometimes, he even goes to bed at nine and gets up at two, doing this every day except Sundays. These very short sleep hours and long work hours really wear people out, so men and women in the countryside get old faster than those in towns.

In April 1866, 18 years after Robert Somers’ book came out, Professor Leone Levi gave a talk about how sheep farms in Scotland were being turned into deer forests. He explained that many areas in the Scottish Highlands were being emptied of people to make money without spending much. Landowners kicked out sheep, just like they had kicked out people before, and brought in wild animals like deer and birds instead.

You can walk a long way—from the Earl of Dalhousie’s land in Forfarshire all the way to John O’Groats—without leaving forest land. These woods have lots of wild animals like foxes, wild cats, martens, polecats, weasels, and Alpine hares. Rabbits, squirrels, and rats have recently shown up too. Huge areas of land that used to be good for farming or grazing are now just for hunting and only used by a few people for a short time each year.

The London Economist newspaper in June 1866 shared news from Scotland that a top sheep farm in Sutherlandshire, which could have been rented for £1,200 a year, was going to be turned into a deer forest. This shows how old-fashioned ideas of land ownership are still around, like when the Norman Conqueror destroyed 36 villages to make the New Forest.

Two million acres of land, including some of Scotland’s most fertile areas, have been wasted. For example, Glen Tilt had some of the best natural grass in Perth, and the deer forest of Ben Aulder was the best place for grazing in Badenoch. Part of the Black Mount forest was perfect for raising black-faced sheep in Scotland.

To understand how much land was wasted just for hunting, know that it was bigger than the entire county of Perth. The Ben Aulder forest could have supported 15,000 sheep, and that was only a small part of all the old forests in Scotland. Now, all that land is totally useless for farming or anything else productive. It might as well be underwater. These made-up wild areas should be stopped by the government.
