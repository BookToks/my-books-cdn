In 1863, factory workers in Lancashire wanted to form a group to help them move to other countries. They said many workers had to leave because jobs were too hard to find. Back in 1814, the official value of cotton goods sold was about £17 million, but the real value was over £20 million. By 1858, the official value was over £182 million, but the real value was only about £43 million. This means a lot more cotton was sold for just a little more money.

This happened because there were too many workers and not enough jobs. The cotton mills often had to stop working when business was bad, which was very common. Even though many people left the country in the last 25 years, there were still too many workers, and many men couldn’t find factory jobs at all.

In the United States, small crafts using machines are still common, so when they switch fully to big factories, it will happen much faster than in Europe or England.

In Birmingham, Mr. Gillott started the first big factory making steel pens. By 1851, it made over 180 million pens a year and used 120 tons of steel. Birmingham was the only place in the UK making so many steel pens, and thousands of millions were produced. In 1861, about 1,428 people worked there, mostly girls and women, some as young as five years old.

In Sheffield, children were working cutting files, which was a tough job. Usually, machines replace workers, but here, young people were doing the jobs machines normally would do.

Reports also showed many details about the rag trade and public health issues related to these industries. The government’s reports from 1864 and 1866 talked a lot about these problems and how they affected workers’ lives.
