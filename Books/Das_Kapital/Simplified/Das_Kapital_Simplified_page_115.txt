Franklin said, “war is robbery, commerce is usually cheating.” If we want to explain how merchants turn their money into capital without just cheating producers, we would need a lot of steps that don’t exist right now, since we only think about simple buying and selling.

What we said about merchants’ money applies even more to money-lenders. Merchants’ money changes hands through buying and selling, but money-lenders just lend money to get more money back without buying or selling anything. This doesn’t fit with how money is supposed to work. Aristotle said that making money from money (like charging interest) is wrong because money was made to help trade things, not to make more money by itself. He called interest “money from money,” and said this way of making money is against nature. Later, we’ll see that both merchants’ money and interest money come from other forms of capital and existed before modern capital did.

We’ve shown that just buying and selling can’t create extra value. So, something else must happen behind the scenes that we don’t see in buying and selling. But can extra value come from anywhere else besides buying and selling, which is how all commodity owners relate to each other? Outside of buying and selling, a commodity owner only deals with their own product. The value of the product is based on the amount of work put into it, measured by a social standard. This value is shown by the price, like £10.

But the owner’s work can’t create value that grows by itself. They can add more work to make something more valuable, like turning leather into boots. The boots are worth more because of the extra work, but the leather’s value stays the same. The leather doesn’t add extra value on its own. So, without trading with others, a producer can’t make value grow or turn money or products into capital.
