Pinto, who was a big fan of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said, “Trade is like a game, and you can’t win by taking from poor people. If you won all the time from everyone, you’d have to give back most of the money to start the game again.”  

Capital can be split into the original money and the profit, which adds to the capital. But usually, this profit is quickly turned back into capital and used again.

Aristotle talked about two kinds of money-making: Œconomic and Chrematistic. Œconomic is about earning a living by getting things needed for life, like food or tools, which help a family or society. True wealth means having useful things to live well, but there’s a limit to how much you need.  

Chrematistic, on the other hand, is about making unlimited wealth and owning lots of stuff. Trade started as barter—swapping goods. But when money was invented, trade changed into buying and selling things. This led to Chrematistic, where the goal is to make money itself grow.  

Chrematistic is focused on money as both the start and the end of trading. Since the goal is endless wealth, there’s no limit to what it aims for. But Œconomic is different because it’s about meeting needs, so it has limits. Some people confuse the two and think making and saving money forever is the main goal of Œconomic, but that’s not true.  

Th. Chalmers said that for a trading capitalist, the goal isn’t the goods they sell but the money they get.  

A merchant doesn’t care much about the money made now; they always look toward the future.  

MacCulloch said that the endless desire to make money will always drive capitalists. But sometimes, when explaining tricky problems like producing too much stuff, people like MacCulloch imagine the capitalist as someone who only cares about useful things, like boots and food, and who always wants more of these everyday items.
