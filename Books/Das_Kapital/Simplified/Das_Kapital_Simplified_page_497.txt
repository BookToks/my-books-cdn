James E. Thorold Rogers, a professor at Oxford, wrote a book called “A History of Agriculture and Prices in England.” It took a lot of hard work to make. The two volumes published so far only cover the years 1259 to 1400. The second volume mostly has numbers and facts. This is the first real “History of Prices” we have from that time.

There was a book in London in 1777 called “Reasons for the Late Increase of the Poor-Rates,” which compared the prices of work and food.

Dr. Richard Price wrote about payments in 1803. He said that the wage for day labor is only about four or five times higher now than in 1514. But the price of corn is seven times higher, and meat and clothes are about fifteen times more expensive. So, wages have not kept up with the cost of living and don’t cover half the expenses like they used to.

The number of middle-class farmers has gone down. In 1851, there were 216,851 family members working on farms, but by 1861, there were only 176,151. Small farms under 20 acres dropped by over 900 between 1851 and 1871. Farms between 50 and 75 acres also decreased. But during the same time, bigger farms grew. Farms with 300-500 acres increased from 7,771 to 8,410. Farms over 500 acres went up from 2,755 to 3,914, and those over 1,000 acres rose from 492 to 582.

The number of shepherds went up from 12,517 to 25,559.

It wasn’t unusual for landlords to raise a worker’s rent when they heard the worker was making more money. Sometimes farmers would even lower a laborer’s wages if his wife started earning money through a job.

The landed aristocracy helped themselves by getting money from the government at very low interest rates, but farmers had to pay back at much higher rates.
