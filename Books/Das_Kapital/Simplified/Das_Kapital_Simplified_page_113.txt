For example, “Commerce adds value to products because the same products are worth more to buyers than to the people who made them. You could even say this is part of making the product.” But people don’t pay twice for things—once for how useful they are and again for their value. Even though the product is more useful to the buyer, it’s easier for the seller to use the money they get from selling it. Otherwise, why would they sell? So, you could also say the buyer “makes something” by turning things like stockings into money.

If things and money of equal value are traded, nobody gains or loses extra value. No extra profit is made. Normally, trading things means swapping equals. But in real life, this doesn’t always happen. So, let’s think about trading things that aren’t equal in value.

The market is only full of people who own something to sell. Their power comes from what they own. The different kinds of things make trading necessary because no one has exactly what they want but holds something others want. Besides the difference between the things themselves, the only other difference is between the things and the money they turn into when sold. So, people are just buyers (who have money) or sellers (who have things).

Now, imagine a seller can somehow sell their things for more than they’re worth. Something worth 100 sells for 110, which is 10% more.

The seller gets 10 extra. But after selling, they become a buyer too. Then, another seller sells to them also at 10% above value. Our first seller gains 10 as a seller but loses 10 as a buyer. In the end, everyone sells to each other at 10% more, which is like selling things at their real value. Prices go up, but the real value of things stays the same.

Now, imagine the buyer can buy things for less than they’re worth. Then, the buyer loses 10% when they sell and gains 10% when they buy. So, nothing really changes.

Making extra value, or turning money into capital, can’t be explained by selling things for more or buying them for less. Adding confusing ideas doesn’t help.

People meet as buyers and sellers. Saying producers get extra profit because buyers pay more isn’t quite right. The seller might sell for more, but the buyer also “produced” the money they use to buy. Both have part in producing value.
