Capital is like a crazy machine that always wants to get more work out of people, no matter what. It doesn’t care about what’s fair or healthy. It makes people work so much that they don’t have enough time to grow, get stronger, or stay healthy. It even takes away time for fresh air and sunlight.

Sometimes, workers have to eat while they’re still working, like they’re just parts of a machine. They don’t get enough good sleep either—only the bare minimum needed to recover from being completely worn out. The goal isn’t to keep workers healthy but to get as much work as possible from them every day, even if it hurts them or makes them sick. Capital doesn’t care how long workers live; it only cares about how much work they can do each day. It’s like a greedy farmer who tries to get more crops by ruining the soil.

The way capitalism works means that making workers work longer hours doesn’t just wear them out faster, it actually makes them die sooner. So, workers spend more time working, but their total life gets shorter.

The cost of keeping workers alive and able to work includes the things they need to live and take care of themselves. If workers are forced to work too much and die younger, then capital has to spend more money replacing them faster, just like when a machine wears out quickly and needs new parts. You’d think this would make capital want a normal working day, but it doesn’t.

Slave owners treated their slaves like property, like horses. If a slave died, the owner lost money and had to buy another one.

Even if working in some places is really bad for people’s health, slave owners didn’t care. Because there were always more slaves to buy, it was more important to get as much work as possible from a slave while they were alive than to keep them healthy for a long time. This meant slaves were pushed to work as hard as they could in the shortest time. This was especially true in tropical farms where the profits were very high, so slaves’ lives were wasted without much care.
