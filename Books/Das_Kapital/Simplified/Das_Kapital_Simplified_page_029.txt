A useful thing has value only because people put work into making it. So, how do we figure out how much it’s worth?

It’s simple: by how much work is in it. The amount of work is measured by how long it takes, using hours, days, or weeks.

Some might think that if a product’s value is based on how much work goes into it, then slow or unskilled workers would make more valuable things because they take longer. But the kind of work that counts is average, normal work—work done with average skill and effort. Society’s total work is like one big pool of the same kind of work. Each worker’s effort counts as average work, meaning it takes no more time than usual to make something.

For example, when power-looms were invented in England, they cut the time needed to weave cloth in half. Even though handloom weavers still spent the same time as before, their products were now worth only half as much because one hour of their work counted as only half an hour of social work.

So, what decides how much something is worth is the average time society needs to make it. Each product is seen as a typical example of its kind. Things that take the same amount of time to make have the same value. The value of one thing compared to another depends on how long it takes to make each. All products are basically frozen amounts of work time.

A product’s value stays the same only if the time needed to make it stays the same. But this time can change depending on how good the workers are, how advanced the tools and technology are, how well work is organized, and other conditions. For example, in good farming seasons, the same work produces 8 bushels of corn, but in bad seasons only 4. Rich mines give more metal for the same work than poor mines.

Diamonds are very rare, so finding them takes a lot of work. That’s why a small diamond has a lot of value. Some experts think gold and diamonds have never really been sold for their full value because they cost so much work to find. If mines were richer, diamonds would be easier to get, and their value would drop. If people could make diamonds easily with little work, they might become cheaper than bricks.

In general, the more productive the work is, the less time it takes to make something, so it has less value. The less productive the work, the more time it takes, and the more valuable the thing is.
