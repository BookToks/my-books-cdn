117 Chapter 5

11 When the price of goods goes up, sellers don’t actually get richer because whatever extra money they make from selling, they end up spending as buyers.

12 If someone has to sell a product for 18 livres even though it’s really worth 24, when they use that same money to buy something else, they will get the same amount as if they had 24 livres before.

13 A seller can only raise prices if they also agree to pay higher prices for other sellers’ goods. Similarly, a buyer can only pay less if they also accept getting less money when they sell something.

14 Torrens wrote about how wealth is made in his book in 1821.

15 Saying that consumers pay profits is silly because who exactly are the consumers?

16 Someone asked if a person with no buyers should pay someone else to buy their goods, criticizing Malthus’s ideas that praise simple buyers.

17 Destutt de Tracy said industrial capitalists make profits because they sell things for more than it costs to make them, and they mostly sell to each other.

18 Trading two things of equal value doesn’t change how much value there is in society. Trading things of different values just moves wealth from one person to another without increasing the total. Say borrowed this idea from earlier thinkers called Physiocrats. His famous saying was “Products can only be bought with products,” which comes directly from them.

19 Wayland said that trading doesn’t add any value to products.

20 If trade always meant things were exactly equal in value, commerce wouldn’t work. The difference between real value and trade value shows that the price given in a trade isn’t really equal to the thing’s true worth.
