When self-acting mules replaced the old mules, most of the adult men spinners lost their jobs, and only teenagers and children were kept. The factory system grew fast because of experience, better machines, and ongoing improvements. This was clear when working hours got shorter. But in 1860, the best year for the English cotton industry, nobody could have guessed how quickly machines would improve and push workers out during the next three years, thanks to the American Civil War.

For example, a Manchester factory used to have 75 carding engines but now only had 12 to do the same work. They also needed 14 fewer workers, saving Â£10 a week in wages and using about 10% less cotton. Another factory in Manchester cut workers by a quarter in one area and by more than half in another by speeding up machines and using self-acting processes. They also replaced a second carding machine with a combing machine, which reduced workers in the carding room a lot. One more mill saved about 10% of labor.

The Gilmour company in Manchester said their new machines in the blowing-room, jack-frame, drawing-frame, and spinning rooms cut workers and wages by about one-third. Plus, their yarn was better, so manufacturers could make more cloth more cheaply than before.

Mr. Redgrave also noted that fewer workers were needed even as production went up. For example, in woollen mills, changes in machinery caused 70 fewer girls to attend a nearby school because fewer workers were needed.

The table below shows changes in the English cotton industry because of the American Civil War:

Number of Factories:  
- England and Wales: 2,046 (1857), 2,715 (1861), 2,405 (1868)  
- Scotland: 152, 163, 131  
- Ireland: 12, 9, 13  
- United Kingdom: 2,210, 2,887, 2,549  

Number of Power Looms:  
- England and Wales: 275,590, 368,125, 344,719  
- Scotland: 21,624, 30,110, 31,864  
- Ireland: 1,633, 1,757, 2,746  
- United Kingdom: 298,847, 399,992, 379,329  

Number of Spindles:  
- England and Wales: 25,818,576, 28,352,125, 30,478,228  
- Scotland: 2,041,129, 1,915,398, 1,397,546  
- Ireland: 150,512, 119,944, 124,240  
- United Kingdom: 28,010,217, 30,387,467, 32,000,014  

Number of People Employed:  
- England and Wales: 341,170, 407,598, 357,052  
- Scotland: 34,698, 41,237, 39,809  
- Ireland: 3,345, 2,734, 4,203  
- United Kingdom: 379,213, 452,569, 401,064  

So, between 1861 and 1868, 338 cotton factories closed. This means fewer but bigger factories with better machines were owned by fewer rich people.
