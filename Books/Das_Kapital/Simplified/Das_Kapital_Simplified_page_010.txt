Right away, you notice the book is organized much better. There are extra notes everywhere marked as notes for the second edition. Here are the most important points about the text itself:

In Chapter 1, Section 1, the way value is explained using equations is done in a more scientific and careful way. Also, the connection between what value really is and how the amount of value is decided by the socially necessary labor time, which was only mentioned briefly in the first edition, is now clearly explained. Chapter 1, Section 3 (the Form of Value) has been totally rewritten because the first edition had two different explanations, which was confusing. By the way, that happened because my friend Dr. L. Kugelmann in Hanover convinced me that most readers needed an extra, simpler explanation when I visited him in spring 1867 and saw the first proofs from Hamburg. The last part of the first chapter, called “The Fetishism of Commodities, etc.,” has also been changed a lot. Chapter 3, Section 1 (The Measure of Value) was fixed carefully because the first edition treated it carelessly and just told readers to look at another book published in Berlin in 1859. Chapter 7, especially Part 2, was rewritten quite a bit too.

It wouldn’t make sense to talk about every small change, many of which were just about style. These happen all through the book. Still, while checking the French translation coming out in Paris, I saw that parts of the original German text needed serious rewriting, other parts needed heavy editing to sound better, and some parts had mistakes that needed fixing. But I didn’t have time for that. I only found out in autumn 1871, while I was busy with other work, that the first edition was sold out and the second edition had to start printing in January 1872.

The best reward for my work is how much “Das Kapital” was appreciated by the German working class so quickly. Herr Mayer, a manufacturer from Vienna who thinks like a business owner, wrote a pamphlet during the Franco-German War. He said that the ability to understand theory, which used to be seen as something only Germans naturally had, had almost disappeared among educated Germans but was coming back strongly among the working class.

Until now, Political Economy in Germany was like a foreign subject. Gustav von Gülich, in his “Historical Description of Commerce, Industry,” especially in the first two volumes published in 1830, looked closely at why capitalism and modern bourgeois society didn’t develop in Germany. Because of this, the background needed for Political Economy was missing. This “science” had to be brought in from England and France as something ready-made. German professors were still like schoolboys. They turned the theory of a foreign reality into a set of fixed ideas, which they explained based on small-scale trade they knew, so they misunderstood it. Their feeling that they couldn’t really do good science, and their uneasy awareness that this subject was actually foreign to them, showed through. Sometimes they hid this by showing off their knowledge of literature and history or by mixing in unrelated stuff from “Kameral” sciences, a jumble of small facts that German bureaucrats have to learn.
