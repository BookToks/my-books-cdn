This kind of change only affects how much money is put into machines (constant capital) versus how much is spent on workers (variable capital). It doesn’t change the basic difference between these two types of capital at all.

1. “Work creates something new when it replaces something old.” We’re not talking about fixing tools here. When a machine is being fixed, it’s not being used to work but is itself being worked on. For simplicity, we can say the work to fix machines is already counted in the work needed to make them. But here, we mean the kind of damage that can’t be fixed and slowly wears the machine out until it’s useless, like a knife that’s too dull to sharpen anymore.

We explained that a machine is part of every work process as a whole, but it only adds value little by little. So it’s confusing when someone says, “Mr. Ricardo says the engineer’s work on making machines is part of the value of each pair of stockings.” Another person argues, “No, the total work includes all the engineer’s work because one machine makes many pairs, and no pair could be made without the machine.”

The author who made this argument is confused but right to some extent because neither Ricardo nor other economists have clearly explained the two different roles of labor or how labor affects value.

3. From this, we can see how silly it is when J. B. Say tries to explain extra value (like interest or profit) by the “services” that things like land, machines, and materials provide during work. Mr. Wm. Roscher, who often writes fancy ideas, says: “J. B. Say correctly notes that the value made by an oil mill, after all costs, is something new and different from the work that built the mill.” That’s true! The oil made by the mill is different from the work used to build it.

Mr. Roscher thinks “value” means things like oil because oil has worth, even though nature makes oil naturally but in small amounts, which doesn’t have much exchange value. It’s like someone saying they had a baby but it was very tiny, so it doesn’t count much.

Mr. Roscher also says that Ricardo’s group is wrong to call capital “accumulated labor” because the owner of capital does more than just make or keep it—he also waits to use it and expects payment for waiting, like interest. This way of thinking turns just wanting something into a source of value, which isn’t very smart.

4. “Out of all the farmer’s tools, the worker’s labor is the most important for paying back his investment. The other tools, like animals, carts, and plows, are nothing without some of the worker’s effort.” (Edmund Burke)
