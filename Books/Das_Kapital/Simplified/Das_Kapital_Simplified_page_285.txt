Making work easier can actually feel like a kind of punishment because machines don’t free workers from working—they just make the work boring. In capitalist production, the tools don’t serve the workers; instead, the workers serve the tools. This idea becomes real and obvious in factories.

Machines turn workers into robots controlled by capital, which is dead labor that uses up living labor power. The smart parts of making things get separated from the manual work, and this power becomes capital’s control over workers. The special skills of each worker don’t matter because the science, power, and mass labor in the factory machine are way bigger and stronger.

The boss, who owns the machines, looks down on the workers and tells them their skills are low-level and easy to learn. The boss says the machines are more important than the workers and their skills, which anyone can pick up in a few months.

Workers have to follow the strict pace of the machines, and because the workers include men, women, and kids, the factory creates a strict “barrack” style discipline. This divides workers into regular workers and supervisors, like soldiers and sergeants in an army. 

The hardest part was training people to stop working randomly and instead match the machines’ steady rhythm. Creating and managing strict factory rules was a huge challenge and a big achievement. Even now, it’s almost impossible to train people over a certain age to work well in factories.

The factory rules, made by the boss, give them total control over the workers. Unlike other systems where responsibility is shared, the boss’s rules are strict and one-sided. Instead of a whip, factory overseers use fines and wage cuts to punish workers, often making more money when workers break the rules than when they follow them.

The conditions in factories are really bad. Workers’ senses get hurt by the hot air, dust, and loud noise. There’s also a big risk of getting seriously hurt or killed by the crowded machines, which regularly cause accidents and injuries.
