Before capitalism really starts, some individual producers need to gather a certain amount of money or resources. This is called "primitive accumulation" because it happens at the beginning of capitalism, not as a result of it.

We don’t need to explain exactly how this accumulation began right now. What matters is that it sets the stage. All the ways workers become more productive also help create more profit, which then leads to more accumulation. So, making more profit helps grow capital faster. This profit keeps getting turned back into capital, making the amount of capital used in production bigger and bigger. This allows businesses to produce more, work better, and earn even more profit. So, having some capital to start with is needed for capitalism, and capitalism helps capital grow faster. These two things work together, changing how capital is made up, with less money spent on workers compared to machines and tools.

Each business owner controls some tools and workers. When they get richer, they can use that to get even richer. As capital grows, wealth becomes more and more concentrated in the hands of individual capitalists. This helps businesses get bigger and use new capitalist ways of working. Society’s total capital grows as many individual capitals grow. Usually, individual capitals grow as parts of the total social capital. Sometimes, parts of these capitals break off and become new separate capitals, like when families split their wealth. So, as capital grows, the number of capitalists can increase too. Two important things happen here: first, the amount of wealth each capitalist controls depends on how much total wealth there is; second, the capital in each type of business is split among many competing capitalists.

So, accumulation and concentration happen in many places, but the growth of each capitalist's wealth is limited by new capitals forming and old ones splitting up. Accumulation means both the growing concentration of tools and workers under some capitalists, and the splitting apart of capital into many competing owners.

This breaking up of total social capital into many parts is balanced by forces that bring capitals together. This doesn’t just mean adding up tools and workers, which is accumulation. It means combining already formed capitals, destroying their independence, pushing some capitalists out, and turning many small capitals into fewer big ones.
