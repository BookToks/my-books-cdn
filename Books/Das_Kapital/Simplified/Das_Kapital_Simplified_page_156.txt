In the last study, we looked at the total amount of product made during a 12-hour workday as the finished result, ready to use. But we can also track this product through all the steps of making it. If we do this, we'll get the same answer as before by looking at the smaller parts created at each step as parts of the final product.

The spinner makes 20 pounds of yarn in 12 hours, or 1⅔ pounds in 1 hour. So, in 8 hours, he makes 13⅔ pounds, which is the same value as all the cotton spun in a whole day. Next, in 1 hour and 36 minutes, he makes 2⅔ pounds of yarn. This shows the value of the tools he uses up in 12 hours. Then, in 1 hour and 12 minutes, he produces 2 pounds of yarn worth 3 shillings, which equals the value of the wages he earns for 6 hours of work. Finally, in the last 1 hour and 12 minutes, he makes another 2 pounds of yarn, which represents the extra value he creates for the employer during his overtime.

This way of calculating is what English manufacturers use every day. They say that in the first 8 hours, or two-thirds of the workday, they get back the cost of the cotton, and the same goes for the rest of the time. This method is correct because it looks at time instead of space, showing the parts of the product made one after another.

However, some people misunderstand this and think the spinner produces or replaces the cotton's value in the first 8 hours, the tools' value in the next 1 hour and 36 minutes, the wages in the next 1 hour and 12 minutes, and creates extra profit only in the last hour. This idea makes the spinner seem like he magically produces raw materials, tools, and more while working, and somehow turns one workday into five. In reality, making the raw materials and tools takes four 12-hour days, plus another day to turn them into yarn.

Greed can make people believe in such impossible ideas, and there are always people ready to support these wrong beliefs, as shown by a famous story.

In 1836, Nassau W. Senior, a well-known English economist famous for his smart ideas and nice writing, was invited from Oxford to Manchester to learn about the real-life economics he taught at school. The manufacturers picked him to defend them against a new Factory Act and a movement to limit work to ten hours a day. They realized that Senior still had a lot to learn, so they wrote for him.

Senior wrote a pamphlet called "Letters on the Factory Act, as it affects the cotton manufacture" in 1837. In it, he explained the manufacturers' point of view, showing how they argued about working hours and the cotton industry.
