Both circuits can be broken down into two opposite parts: C—M, which means selling something, and M—C, which means buying something. In both parts, the same things are involved—a product and money—and the same people—a buyer and a seller—interact with each other. Each circuit is made up of these two opposite parts, and three people are involved: one only sells, one only buys, and the third both buys and sells.

What mainly separates the C—M—C circuit from the M—C—M circuit is the order in which things happen. In the simple buying and selling of products, it starts with selling and ends with buying. But in the buying and selling of money as capital, it starts with buying and ends with selling. In the first case, you start and end with products; in the second, you start and end with money. The first moves because of money; the second moves because of products.

In the C—M—C circuit, money is finally turned into a product that you use; the money is spent once and done. But in the M—C—M circuit, the buyer spends money so they can sell the product and get the money back. They spend money to make money again by selling what they bought.

They let the money go but plan to get it back. So, the money isn’t really spent; it’s just used for a while. In C—M—C, the same money moves twice: the seller gets it from the buyer and pays it to another seller. The cycle starts when money is received and ends when money is paid for products. In M—C—M, it’s the product that moves twice: the buyer gets it from the seller and then sells it to another buyer. Just like in C—M—C, where money changes hands twice, here the product changes hands twice, which brings the money back to where it started.

This return of money doesn’t depend on selling the product for more than it cost. That only changes how much money comes back. The money comes back as soon as the product is sold again and the M—C—M cycle is complete. So, there’s a clear difference between money moving as capital and money just moving as money.

The C—M—C cycle ends completely when the money from selling one product is used to buy another.

If money comes back to the seller, it only happens if the process starts again. For example, if I sell some corn for £3 and then buy clothes with that £3, the money is spent and now belongs to the clothes seller. If I sell more corn later, money comes back to me, but that’s because I’m doing the process again. The money leaves me again when I buy something else. So in C—M—C, spending money and money coming back are not connected. But in M—C—M, money coming back depends on how it was spent. Without money coming back, the process fails because selling is the last and important step.

The C—M—C cycle starts with one product and ends with a different product, which is taken out of the market and used. The goal is to use the product and satisfy needs.
