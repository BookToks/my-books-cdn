14 When you figure out the best way to break down a job into smaller steps, and how many people should work on each step, then factories that don’t use the right number of workers will end up making things more expensively. This is one reason why factories get so big.

15 In England, the furnace that melts glass is separate from the furnace where the glass is shaped. But in Belgium, they use the same furnace for both melting and shaping.

16 This idea can be seen in the work of people like W. Petty, John Bellers, Andrew Yarranton, and J. Vanderlint.

17 Near the end of the 1500s, in France, people still used mortars and sieves to crush and wash ores.

18 You can learn about how machines developed by looking at the history of the corn mill. In England, factories were still called “mills.” In Germany, even in the early 1900s, the word “Mühle” meant any machine powered by nature or any factory using machines.

19 As will be explained more later, Adam Smith didn’t come up with new ideas about dividing work. But he is important because he focused a lot on the division of labor during the time when factories were growing. He didn’t think machines were that important, which caused some people like Lauderdale and Ure to argue against him. Smith mixed up the idea of different tools used by workers with the invention of machines, which were created by experts, craftsmen, and even farmers, not just factory workers.

20 The factory boss can split the work into different steps that need different skills or strength. This way, he can hire exactly the right number of skilled or strong workers for each step. If one person did all the work, they would have to be skilled and strong enough to do every part, which is hard.

21 This can cause some body problems, like muscles getting too big or bones bending the wrong way.

22 One question asked was how young workers stay focused on their jobs. Mr. William Marshall, who runs a glass factory, said they can’t really skip work because once they start, they have to keep going. They are like parts of a machine.

23 Dr. Ure, who praised modern factories, explained the special way work is divided better than earlier thinkers. He said giving each worker the right job based on their skills and cost is the core of dividing labor. He called it “adapting work to different talents” and described the whole factory system as sorting work by skill levels.
