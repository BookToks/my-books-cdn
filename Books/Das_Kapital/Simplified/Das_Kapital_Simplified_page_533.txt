Some decades later, the colonial system got back at the descendants of the religious pilgrims, who had started to rebel. With England’s help and money, Native Americans attacked them. The British Parliament said using bloodhounds and scalping was something “God and Nature had given them the right to do.” The colonial system grew like a greenhouse, boosting trade and shipping. Powerful companies called “societies Monopolia” helped gather lots of money. The colonies provided markets for new products and, because they controlled the market, they made even more money. Treasures taken from outside Europe through stealing, slavery, and killing were sent back to the home country and turned into wealth. Holland, the first to fully develop this system, was at the peak of its business power by 1648. It controlled most of the East Indian trade and trade between parts of Europe. Its fishing, navy, and factories were better than any other country’s. The total money of the Republic was probably bigger than all the rest of Europe combined. But people in Holland were working too hard, poorer, and more badly treated than anywhere else in Europe.

Today, being the top industrial country means being the top trading country too. Back when manufacturing was just starting, being the best at trade helped a country become the best at industry. That’s why the colonial system was so important then. It was like a new, strange god that took over and pushed out the old European gods. This new god said making extra profit was the most important goal for people.

The system of public credit, or national debt, started in places like Genoa and Venice in the Middle Ages and spread across Europe during the manufacturing period. The colonial system with its sea trade and trade wars helped it grow. It first took hold in Holland. National debts, which means the state owes money, became a big part of capitalism. The only part of a country’s wealth that really belongs to its people is its national debt. So, people started to believe that a country gets richer the more debt it has. Public credit became the main belief of capitalism. Not trusting the national debt was seen as the worst kind of sin.

Public debt became a powerful way to gather early capital. Like magic, it made money grow without needing to risk it in businesses or loans. When the government borrowed money, it gave bonds that worked like cash and could be easily traded. Besides creating a class of people who earned money just by holding these bonds, and besides helping rich people and businesses, national debt led to the creation of joint-stock companies, trading of financial papers, stock market gambling, and modern banks.
