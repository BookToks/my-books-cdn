In 1849, Factory Inspectors Howell and Saunders explained the “shifting system,” which is talked about in reports from that time. The local church leaders near Ashton even sent a petition to the Queen asking her to stop this system.

In 1837, R. H. Greg wrote about the “Factory Question and the Ten Hours’ Bill,” which was an important topic back then.

F. Engels wrote about the English Ten Hours’ Bill in 1850. He also mentioned how the Court of Justice found a tricky wording during the American Civil War that changed the meaning of a law about pirate ships.

By 1850, working hours in winter could sometimes be from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. instead.

The law passed in 1850 was a compromise. Workers gave up the benefits of the Ten Hours’ Act in exchange for having a set, uniform work schedule.

Reports from 1844 and 1846 also discuss working conditions during that time.

By 1861, most workers covered by the Factory Act had better physical health according to medical reports and personal observations. However, child deaths were still very high, and health in factory areas was worse compared to farming areas. For example, in places like Wigan, Halifax, and Stoke-on-Trent, many adults worked in manufacturing, and the death rates from lung diseases were higher than in healthier farming districts.

English Free-traders didn’t want to keep taxes on silk from other countries. Without these taxes to protect English silk makers, factory children had to suffer more.

In 1859 and 1860, during the best years of the cotton industry, some factory owners tried to get male workers to accept longer workdays by offering higher pay for overtime.
