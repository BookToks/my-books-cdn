The organized group of workers in old-fashioned manufacturing is now replaced by a small team led by a head worker and a few helpers. The main groups are workers who actually run the machines (including some who watch over the engines) and attendants, who are mostly kids, helping those machine operators. Among these attendants are the “Feeders,” who give the machines the materials to work on. Besides these two main groups, there is a small group of people who take care of all the machines and fix them when needed, like engineers and mechanics. These workers are more skilled and sometimes have scientific training. They are different from the regular factory workers but still part of the workplace. This setup is based on technical needs.

To work a machine well, a person needs to learn from a young age so they can match their movements to the steady, automatic motion of the machine. When lots of machines work together as a system, different groups of workers are needed for the different machines. But using machines means workers don’t have to be stuck doing one exact job all the time like in old manufacturing. Since the machines control the work, workers can switch jobs without stopping the process. This was shown when factories used a relay system during the revolts of 1848-1850. Also, young people learn machine work quickly, so there’s no need to train a special group of workers just for machines. The simple jobs of the attendants can sometimes be done by machines, and because the work is easy, workers can be changed often without problems.

Even though machines changed the way work is divided, the old system still stays in factories as a habit from the past. Over time, bosses made this system worse to take advantage of workers. Instead of learning many skills, workers now spend their whole life working with just one machine. Machines are used to turn workers, from childhood on, into parts of the machine itself. This lowers the cost of training workers and makes them completely dependent on the factory and the boss. We have to see the difference between the increase in productivity from better work methods and the increase from bosses exploiting workers. In crafts and old manufacturing, the worker controls the tool. In factories, the machine controls the worker. In the past, workers were part of a living system, but now the machine is a lifeless system that the worker just becomes a part of.

Doing the same boring, endless work over and over is like the story of Sisyphus, who had to push a rock up a hill only for it to roll back down again. Factory work wears out workers’ nerves and stops them from using their muscles in different ways. It also takes away all their freedom, both physically and mentally.
