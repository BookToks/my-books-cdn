Having more workers than needed for the usual growth of business is an important part of modern industry.

H. Merivale, a former professor and government worker, says, “Imagine if, during a crisis, a country sent away hundreds of thousands of extra workers by encouraging them to move abroad. What would happen? When jobs come back, there wouldn’t be enough workers. It takes a whole generation to replace adult workers who leave. Manufacturers make money by using good times when people buy a lot to make up for slow times. They need machines and workers ready to work more or less depending on how the market is doing. Without enough workers, they can’t compete or help the country’s economy grow.” Even Malthus agrees that having more people than needed is necessary for modern industry. But he thinks this happens because the working population grows too fast, not because they become extra compared to what is needed. He says, “If workers get too careful about marrying and having kids, it might hurt a country that depends on manufacturing and trade. New workers don’t show up right when they’re needed because it takes 16 to 18 years. Money saved can grow faster than the number of people. So, a country often has more money to support workers than workers themselves.” After showing that capitalism needs extra workers, the idea of a capitalist is shown saying to the extra workers who lose their jobs: “We manufacturers try to help you while growing our business, and you have to adjust your numbers to match what jobs are available.” Capitalism doesn’t just want the number of workers that naturally grow; it needs extra workers ready to work beyond natural population limits.

So far, it was assumed that if the money spent on workers changes, the number of workers changes the same way.

But sometimes, the number of workers stays the same or even drops, while the money spent on them goes up. This happens if each worker works more, so they get paid more, even if wages don’t rise much or fall slowly compared to how much work increases. Spending more money on workers here means more work is done, not more workers are hired. Every capitalist wants to get more work from fewer workers if it costs about the same.
