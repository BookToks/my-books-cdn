Also, when looking at farming families, more than one in five didn’t get enough starchy food, and over one-third didn’t get enough protein. In three counties—Berkshire, Oxfordshire, and Somerset—most people didn’t get enough protein in their diets. Among farm workers, those in England, which is the richest part of the UK, were actually the worst fed. Usually, women and children didn’t get enough food because “the man has to eat to do his work.” People who worked in towns were even poorer and hungrier.

They were so badly fed that many of them must have suffered serious problems from not having enough food. This “privation” means the bosses didn’t pay enough for the food workers needed to just survive. The table below shows how much food these town workers ate compared to the minimum needed and what cotton workers ate during their hardest times.

Half of the workers studied didn’t have any beer, and 28% didn’t have any milk. The amount of liquid food they got each week ranged from just seven ounces for needle-women to nearly 25 ounces for stocking-makers. Most of the people who didn’t get milk were needle-women in London. The amount of bread eaten each week went from about 7¾ pounds for needle-women to 11½ pounds for shoemakers, with an average of almost 10 pounds per adult.

Sugar (or syrup) eaten each week ranged from 4 ounces for kid-glovers to 11 ounces for stocking-makers, with an average of 8 ounces per adult. Butter and fats averaged 5 ounces weekly per adult. Meat eaten varied from about 7¼ ounces for silk-weavers to 18¼ ounces for kid-glovers, with an average of 13.6 ounces.

The weekly cost of food for each adult was: silk-weavers paid 2 shillings 2½ pence, needle-women 2 shillings 7 pence, kid-glovers 2 shillings 9½ pence, shoemakers 2 shillings 7¾ pence, and stocking-weavers 2 shillings 6¼ pence. Silk-weavers in Macclesfield spent even less, only 1 shilling 8½ pence. The worst off were needle-women, silk-weavers, and kid-glovers.

Dr. Simon said in his health report that many cases of illness happen or get worse because people don’t have enough good food. Anyone who works with poor people or in hospitals can see this for themselves.
