When cotton is spun, it turns into yarn because work is added to it. The yarn shows how much work went into the cotton. For example, if 1 2/3 pounds of cotton can be spun into the same amount of yarn in one hour, then 10 pounds of yarn means 6 hours of work were used. So, the amount of yarn just shows how much work has been put in, like frozen time of work.

We don’t need to worry about the fact that the work is spinning or that the cotton is the material being worked on. If the worker was mining coal instead, the amount of coal taken out would still show how much work was done.

We said before that one day of work costs three shillings, and six hours of work is part of that. This is how much work a worker needs to live each day. If the spinner can turn 1 2/3 pounds of cotton into yarn in one hour, then in six hours they can spin 10 pounds. So the cotton takes in six hours of work. The same amount of work is in a piece of gold worth three shillings. This means spinning adds a value of three shillings to the cotton.

Now, think about the whole 10 pounds of yarn. It has two and a half days of work in it. Two days come from the cotton and the worn-out spindle, and half a day comes from the spinning itself.

This two and a half days of work is worth fifteen shillings in gold. So, fifteen shillings is a fair price for the 10 pounds of yarn, or eighteenpence per pound.

The business owner is surprised. The product’s value is exactly the same as the money spent to make it. No extra value was created, so no profit was made. The yarn costs fifteen shillings, and that’s exactly what was spent on the cotton, the spindle, and the work. Ten shillings went to the cotton, two shillings to the spindle, and three shillings to the labor. The higher value of the yarn doesn’t help because it’s just the total of the values already in the cotton, the spindle, and the labor. No new value has been added. These values were already there in the money spent before.

This isn’t really strange. If one pound of yarn costs eighteenpence, then buying 10 pounds costs fifteen shillings. Whether the owner buys the yarn ready-made or makes it himself, the price is the same.

The owner complains, “I spent my money to make more money.” But just wanting to make money doesn’t mean it will happen. He even threatens to change his ways and says he’ll buy things from the market next time instead of making them himself.
