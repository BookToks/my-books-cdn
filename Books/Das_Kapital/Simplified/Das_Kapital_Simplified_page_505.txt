But building up capital needs extra value; extra value needs capitalist production; capitalist production needs lots of capital and workers already owned by people who make goods. So, it feels like a never-ending cycle. We can only break out of it by thinking about a first accumulation (what Adam Smith called primitive accumulation) that happened before capitalist accumulation. This first accumulation didn’t come from capitalism itself, but started it all.

This first accumulation is like original sin in religion. Adam ate the apple, and sin spread to everyone. It’s explained as a story from long ago. Long ago, there were two kinds of people: one group worked hard, was smart, and saved money; the other group was lazy and spent everything on wild living. The religious story tells us why people have to work hard to live, but the economic story shows that some people don’t have to. Anyway, the first group got rich, and the second group ended up with nothing but their own labor to sell. Since then, most people have stayed poor, even though they work hard, and a few rich people keep getting richer, even though they stopped working. This silly story is often used to defend owning property. For example, M. Thiers once told the French people this as if it were very wise. Whenever property is discussed, people act like this simple story is true for everyone, no matter the time or place. But in real history, conquest, slavery, stealing, and murder were important. In the nice stories of Political Economy, everything’s always peaceful. In reality, the way the first accumulation happened was definitely not peaceful.

By themselves, money and goods aren’t capital, just like tools and food aren’t capital. They have to be changed into capital. But this change only happens when two very different kinds of people meet: on one side, people who own money, tools, and food and want to grow their wealth by buying other people’s work; on the other side, free workers who sell their own labor because they don’t own tools or land themselves. These workers are free in two ways: they’re not owned like slaves, and they don’t own the tools they need to work, like peasants who own their farms. This split in the market creates the basics for capitalism. The capitalist system needs workers to be separated completely from owning what they need to work. Once capitalism starts, it keeps this separation going and spreads it even more. So, the process that makes capitalism possible is really the process that takes away workers’ ownership of what they need to work and turns the things people use to live and work into capital, while turning the workers themselves into people who only have their labor to sell.
