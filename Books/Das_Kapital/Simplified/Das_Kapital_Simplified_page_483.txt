From 1853 to 1864, the average yearly income increase was only 0.93 in Ireland, while in Great Britain, it was much higher at 4.58. The table below shows how profits (except for farmers) were spread out in Ireland in 1864 and 1865.

In 1864, the total yearly income was £4,368,610 shared among 17,467 people. In 1865, it was £4,669,979 shared among 18,081 people.

Yearly incomes between £60 and £100 were shared among 5,015 people in 1864 and 4,703 in 1865.

The rest of the total income was shared among 11,321 people in 1864 and 12,184 in 1865.

Other groups received parts of the income, with different amounts shared among smaller numbers of people.

England, a fully industrial and capitalist country, would have struggled a lot if it lost as many people as Ireland did.

Right now, Ireland is mostly an agricultural area of England, separated by a channel, and it provides England with things like corn, wool, cattle, and soldiers.

Because many people left Ireland, a lot of land stopped being farmed, and the amount of goods produced went down. Even though more land was used for raising animals, some parts of farming went down and others only grew a little, often with setbacks.

Still, even with fewer people, rents and farmers’ profits went up, but farmers’ profits didn’t grow as steadily as rents.

This happened because small farms were combined into bigger ones, and more land was used for pasture instead of crops. This meant more of the total produce became surplus — extra goods that could be sold.

Even though the total amount produced went down, the extra goods (surplus) increased.

Also, the money value of these extra goods went up faster than the amount produced because prices for meat, wool, and other products rose a lot in England over the last 20 years, especially in the last 10.
