In industries like pottery, where machines aren’t used much, shortening the workday has clearly made work more regular, steady, and energetic.  

But it wasn’t clear if the same thing would happen in factories where machines run constantly and workers have to keep up with them. When people talked about cutting the workday to less than twelve hours in 1844, factory owners said their supervisors already made sure workers didn’t waste time. They thought workers couldn’t work any harder or faster without changing the machines.  

However, experiments showed this wasn’t true. Mr. Robert Gardner shortened the workday in his two big factories from twelve to eleven hours in April 1844. After about a year, they produced the same amount of goods for the same cost, and the workers earned just as much money in eleven hours as they did before in twelve.  

In some parts of the factory, the machines were sped up by 2%, but in the weaving section, where many fancy products were made, nothing else changed. The result was that workers made even more in eleven hours than they did in twelve, because they worked more steadily and used their time better. They kept the same pay, gained an extra hour free, and the factory saved money on things like coal and gas.  

Similar tests with good results were done in other mills too.  

Making work hours shorter helps workers use more energy in less time. But when shorter hours become a rule, factory owners use machines to get even more work out of the workers. They do this by speeding up the machines or giving workers more machines to handle.  

Better machine designs are needed so owners can push workers harder and watch production costs closely.  

Steam engines have been improved to work faster and use fuel more efficiently, allowing more machines to run with the same or less coal. New transmission parts reduce friction and make machine shafts smaller and lighter.  

Finally, machines themselves have become smaller but faster and more powerful, like modern power-looms. Some machines have grown bigger with more working parts, like spinning mules, and small changes have made parts move faster, such as increasing spindle speed by one-fifth in self-acting mules over ten years.
