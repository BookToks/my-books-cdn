Cruelty was the result, of course. In many factory areas, especially in my own county of Lancashire, terrible things happened to innocent and helpless people who were put under the control of factory owners. They were pushed to the edge of death by working too much. They were beaten, chained, and treated cruelly in very harsh ways. Many were starved while being forced to work, and some were even driven to kill themselves.

The beautiful and peaceful valleys of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, and Lancashire, hidden away from the public, became places of suffering and even murder. Factory owners made huge profits, but that only made them want more. So, they started a system called “night-working,” where one group worked all day and another group worked all night, swapping beds without rest. There is a local saying in Lancashire that the beds never get cold.

As capitalism grew during the factory period, Europe's public opinion lost any sense of shame or guilt. Countries openly boasted about terrible things they did to make money. For example, England, after the Peace of Utrecht, forced Spain to allow them to trade African slaves to Spanish America. This gave England the right to supply 4,800 slaves a year until 1743. This also covered up British smuggling. Liverpool became rich from the slave trade, which helped build its wealth. Even today, Liverpool’s reputation is tied to the slave trade.

In 1730, Liverpool used 15 ships for the slave trade; by 1792, it had 132. While the cotton industry caused child slavery in England, in the United States it helped turn older kinds of slavery into a harsh business. The hidden slavery of workers in Europe needed the obvious slavery in the New World to support it.

It was a huge task to set up the “natural laws” of capitalism. This meant separating workers from their tools and resources, turning these tools into capital, and turning most people into wage workers, or “free laboring poor,” a fake product of modern society. If money, as Augier said, “comes into the world with a blood-stain on one cheek,” then capital comes covered in blood and dirt from head to toe.
