Commodity production becomes a big deal for society only when wage labour is the main part of it. That’s also when it shows all its hidden powers. Saying that wage labour messes up commodity production is like saying commodity production shouldn’t grow if it wants to stay pure.

As commodity production grows into capitalist production, the rules about property change into rules about how capital is taken and used. We’ve seen that even when things keep going the same way, all capital, no matter where it started, turns into accumulated capital, which is basically saved-up profit. But as production increases, the original capital becomes less important compared to the new capital made from profits that get put back into the business. So, Political Economy calls capital “accumulated wealth” that is used again to make more profit, and the capitalist is called “the owner of surplus-value.” This is just another way of saying that all capital is like saved-up interest, since interest is just a part of the profit.

Before we look more into how profits get turned back into capital, we need to clear up a confusion made by classical economists.

The stuff a capitalist buys with some of the profits for personal use doesn’t help make more products or create value. Also, the labour bought for the capitalist’s personal needs isn’t productive labour. Instead of turning surplus-value into more capital, the capitalist spends it as income. Back when the old feudal nobility lived by just spending what they had, the new capitalist economy had to stress that saving and growing capital is the main job of everyone. They said you can’t grow wealth if you spend all your income instead of using some of it to hire more productive workers who earn more than they cost.

At the same time, economists had to fight the common idea that capitalist production is just about hoarding wealth. People thought that saved-up wealth was stuff kept from being used or spent, or taken out of circulation. But if money stopped circulating, it couldn’t grow as capital, and saving a bunch of goods would be pointless. Big piles of goods happen either because too much is made or because trade stops.

People often notice how the rich keep large stores of goods for slow use and make reserve stocks. Saving reserves happens in all types of economies, and we’ll talk about that more when we look at how goods move around.

So, classical economists are right when they say that saving surplus products by productive workers, not unproductive ones, is a key part of growing capital.
