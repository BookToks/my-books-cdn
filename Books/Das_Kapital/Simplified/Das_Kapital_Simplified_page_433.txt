People in England complained about this issue throughout the fifteenth century and the first half of the eighteenth century. The way that workers live and grow in number does not change the basic nature of how capitalism works.

The system keeps recreating the relationship between capitalists (owners) and workers (people who sell their labor). When the system grows, it produces more capitalists or bigger capitalists on one side, and more workers on the other. The workers depend on capital to survive and have to keep selling their labor to the capitalists. This dependence is a key part of how capitalism keeps going. So, as capital grows, the number of working-class people grows too.

Economists like Adam Smith and Ricardo understood this well but made some mistakes. They thought that capital growth meant workers used up all the extra wealth or turned it into more workers. As early as 1696, John Bellers said that without workers, even the richest people would be useless, because workers are what make people rich. Bernard de Mandeville said in the early eighteenth century that society couldn’t do without poor people, because who else would do the work?

Mandeville believed the poor should be kept from starving but not given too much, so they would keep working hard. A little money makes workers motivated, but too much money could make them lazy or proud. He said that in a free country, the best wealth is having many hardworking poor people. They are important because they help build armies and create goods, and without them, society couldn’t enjoy anything. He also thought it was good that most poor people stay uneducated, so they don’t want too much and their needs are easier to meet.

What Mandeville didn’t realize is that the way capital grows actually creates more poor workers who depend on selling their labor. These workers help the capital grow, but by doing so, they stay stuck depending on the capitalists who own what they produce.
