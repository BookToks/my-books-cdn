Hard work and money earned don’t usually match up fairly. In a fair society, if you work harder, you should earn more. But often, it’s the opposite.

To clear up any confusion, I want to say that people like John Stuart Mill, who have some old ideas about economics but also some modern ones, shouldn’t be blamed like other common economic defenders.

I should remind you that I was the first to use the terms “variable and constant capital.” Since Adam Smith’s time, economists have mixed up these important ideas with simple differences that come from how money moves around in the economy. You can find more details about this in Book II, Part II.

It could be said that not only money but also workers, like people who move away from England, leave each year. But here, I’m not talking about the money those emigrants have. Most of these people aren’t workers; many are farmers’ sons. The extra money sent abroad to earn interest is much bigger compared to how many people leave each year compared to the overall population growth.
