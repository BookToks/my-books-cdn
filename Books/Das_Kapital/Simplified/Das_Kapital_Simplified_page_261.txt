The tool or working machine is the part of machines that started the industrial revolution in the 18th century. Even today, it is the starting point whenever a handmade craft or small factory work turns into a big industry using machines.

If we look closely at a working machine, we usually find that it has tools and parts similar to those used by a craftsman. The difference is that these tools are not used by a person directly but are part of a machine. Sometimes the whole machine is just a changed version of an old handmade tool, like the power loom. Other times, parts of the machine are familiar tools, like spindles in a spinning machine, needles in a stocking loom, saws in a sawing machine, or knives in a chopping machine. These tools are mostly still made by hand but are put into the machine’s body, which is made by machines. When the machine starts working, it uses these tools to do the same jobs people used to do by hand. It doesn’t matter if the machine is powered by a person or another machine.

The moment a tool is taken from a person and put into a machine, it becomes part of the machine, not just a simple tool. You can see the difference right away, even when a person still powers the machine. A person can only use as many tools at once as their body allows. For example, in Germany, they tried to have one spinner work two spinning wheels at the same time using both hands and feet, but it was too hard. Later, a spinning wheel with two spindles was made, but people who could spin two threads at once were very rare. The Jenny machine, however, could spin 12 to 18 threads at the same time from the start. The stocking loom can knit with thousands of needles at once. Machines can use many more tools at the same time than any person can.

In many hand tools, the difference between the person as power and the person as worker is clear. For example, in a spinning wheel, the foot just powers the wheel, but the hand does the real spinning work. The industrial revolution first took over the part done by the hand, while the worker’s job became watching the machine and fixing its mistakes. The worker now also just provides the power to run the machine. Some tools, where the person only provided power, like turning a crank, pumping, or moving a bellows, soon started using animals, water, or wind for power. These tools sometimes became machines before the industrial revolution, but they didn’t change how things were made. In modern industry, we see that these tools were already machines in a way. For example, the pumps that the Dutch used to drain Lake Harlem in 1836-7 worked like regular pumps, but their pistons were powered by big steam engines instead of people. The simple bellows used by blacksmiths in England are sometimes changed into blowing engines by connecting them to steam engines.
