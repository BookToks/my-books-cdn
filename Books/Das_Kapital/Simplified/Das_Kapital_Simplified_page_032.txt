The value of something you can buy comes from the amount of human work put into making it. Just like in society, where important people like generals or bankers have big roles, but regular people don’t get as much attention, here, regular human work is what counts. This is the simple kind of work that an average person can do, without any special skills.

Simple work can be different in different places and times, but in one society, it stays pretty much the same. Skilled work is just seen as regular work done harder or more times. So, a skilled worker’s job is considered equal to doing more simple work. This idea is used all the time. Even if something is made by very skilled workers, its value is measured by comparing it to simple unskilled work. How much skilled work counts as simple work is decided by society, and it feels like a tradition. To make things easier, we will think of all work as simple work without special skills.

When we look at things like coats and linen, we forget about their different uses and the different kinds of work that made them, like weaving or tailoring. Coats and linen are made by different special jobs, but when we talk about their value, we only think about the fact that human work was put into them. Tailoring and weaving are important because they are different kinds of work, but for value, we only care that they both involve human labor.

Coats and linen don’t just have value, but different amounts of value. For example, a coat might be worth twice as much as ten yards of linen. This is because making the coat took twice as much work as making the linen.

When we think about the usefulness of something, the kind of work matters. But when we think about its value, only the amount of work matters, no matter what kind it was. Value is about how much work was done, or how long it took. Because value shows the amount of work, things made with the same amount of work should have the same value.

If the skill needed to make a coat stays the same, the total value of all the coats made will go up as more coats are made.

If one coat takes x days of work, then two coats take 2x days, and so on. But what if the time to make a coat changes?

If making a coat suddenly takes twice as long, one coat is now worth as much as two coats used to be. If it takes half as long, two coats are worth as much as one used to be. Even though the coat still works the same and the quality of the work is the same, the value changes because the amount of work done changes.
