The price of labor compared to both surplus value and the value of the product is higher in the second case than in the first. J. W. Cowell, a member of the Factory Commission in 1833, studied the spinning trade carefully and found that in England, wages are actually lower for the factory owners but higher for the workers than in other parts of Europe.

Alexander Redgrave, an English Factory Inspector, wrote a report on October 31, 1866. He showed with statistics that even though workers in continental Europe earn less and work longer hours, their labor costs more compared to the product than in England. A cotton factory manager in Oldenburg said workers there worked from 5:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., including Saturdays. Under English bosses, the workers produced less during that time than English workers did in 10 hours, but under German bosses, they produced even less. Wages were much lower than in England, sometimes half as much, but there were more workers per machine, sometimes five workers for every three machines.

Mr. Redgrave also shared detailed information about Russian cotton factories. An English manager who worked there recently gave him the data. In Russia, working conditions were terrible, like the worst days of early English factories. The managers were English since Russian capitalists didn’t handle factory business well. Even with very long hours and very low pay, Russian factories only survived because foreign competition was banned.

At the end, I share a table from Mr. Redgrave comparing the average number of spindles per factory and per worker in different European countries. He said the numbers were collected a few years ago and that since then, English factories have grown bigger and have more spindles per worker. But he thinks other countries have grown similarly, so the numbers are still useful for comparison.

AVERAGE NUMBER OF SPINDLES PER FACTORY  
England: 12,600  
France: 1,500  
Prussia: 1,500  
Belgium: 4,000  
Saxony: 4,500  
Austria: 7,000  
Switzerland: 8,000  

AVERAGE NUMBER OF WORKERS PER SPINDLES  
France: 1 worker to 14 spindles  
Russia: 1 worker to 28 spindles  
Prussia: 1 worker to 37 spindles  
Bavaria: 1 worker to 46 spindles  
Austria: 1 worker to 49 spindles  
Belgium: 1 worker to 50 spindles  
Saxony: 1 worker to 50 spindles  
Switzerland: 1 worker to 55 spindles  
Smaller German States: 1 worker to 55 spindles  
Great Britain: 1 worker to 74 spindles
