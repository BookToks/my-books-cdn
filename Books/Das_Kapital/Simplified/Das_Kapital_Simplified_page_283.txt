Between 1848 and now, English industry grew much faster than it did between 1833 and 1847, even though workers had a shorter workday of 10 hours instead of 12. This growth was way bigger than the growth seen after factories first started, when people worked unlimited hours.

At the start of this chapter, we looked at the factory’s main part: the machines working together as a system. We saw how machines use the work of women and children, increasing the number of workers who can be exploited. Machines also take up all the workers’ free time by making them work long hours. As machines get better, they can produce more in less time, which means workers are pushed to work harder and faster. Now, let’s look at the factory as a whole, especially the most advanced kind.

Dr. Ure, who really praises automatic factories, describes them in two ways. First, as many skilled workers, both adults and kids, working together to take care of machines powered by a central source. Second, as a huge machine made of different parts, both mechanical and human, all working together under one controlling power. These two ideas are different. In the first, the workers are the main force, and the machine is just a tool. In the second, the machine is the main force, and the workers are just parts of it, controlled by the central power. The first shows any big use of machines, but the second shows how machines are used by bosses in modern factories. Ure even calls the main machine an "autocrat," like a boss controlling everything. He says steam power commands thousands of workers like servants.

With machines, the skill of the worker moves to the machine itself. The machine can do things better than a human alone. This changes how work is divided. Instead of having a group of skilled workers doing different jobs, the automatic factory makes all the machine operators do similar tasks. The only real differences between workers are their age and gender now.

When work is divided in the factory, it mostly means assigning workers to specific machines or departments. They work with similar machines in groups, but their teamwork is pretty simple.
