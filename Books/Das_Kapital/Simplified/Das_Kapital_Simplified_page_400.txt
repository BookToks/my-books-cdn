The confusion caused by money disappears right away if we stop thinking about just one boss and one worker, and instead think about all bosses and all workers together. The bosses keep giving the workers money that represents part of the stuff the workers make, and the workers give this money back to the bosses to get their share of what they produced. This trade is hidden because the products look like things to buy and sell, and money is used to buy them.

Variable capital is just a way of showing the money that workers need to live, which they have to produce themselves no matter what kind of society they live in. If workers get this money as wages, it’s because the things they make are owned by the bosses. But the important thing is that the bosses are really giving back to workers the value of the workers’ own labor, shown as money.

Imagine a farmer who has to work part of the week for his boss without getting paid. He works on his own farm for some days and works for the boss for the rest. He keeps providing for himself and his family without getting wages. But the work he does for the boss is forced and not paid. If one day the boss takes everything the farmer owns, the farmer will have to sell his work to the boss like a regular worker. Then he’ll work the same amount, but now he’ll get wages from the boss. The farmer will still use tools and land to make things, and part of what he makes will go to keeping everything going. But now, the money he earns from the boss is like capital given to him as wages.

Some economists don’t understand that this money form is just one way of showing what’s really happening. They don’t see that, even now, in many places, workers don’t get wages but work in other ways. Variable capital, or wages, only stop being money the boss spends when you look at the whole ongoing process of how capitalism works.

This process must have started somehow. Probably, the first bosses got their money from savings or other ways that didn’t depend on unpaid work from others. That’s how they started buying workers’ labor. After this, the system keeps running and changes in interesting ways that affect all capital, not just wages.

If a boss uses £1,000 to make a profit of £200 every year, and spends all that profit, after 5 years the total spent will be £1,000, the same amount the boss first invested. If the boss spends only half the profit each year, it will take 10 years to spend the original £1,000. The rule is: the original money invested divided by the yearly profit spent equals the number of years it takes to use up the original investment.

The boss thinks they are just spending the extra value created by workers and keeping their original money safe. But no matter what the boss thinks, after some years, the money they have equals all the extra value taken from workers during that time, and the total spent equals their first investment.
