Let’s say that after farming improves, only a quarter of the people can stay, so about 921,174 people need to leave. Groups 4, 5, and 6, who own between 15 and 100 acres, have farms too small to grow corn or raise sheep successfully. So, another 788,761 people will have to move away, making a total of 1,709,532 people leaving.

As more leave, people like Rentroll will notice that Ireland, with 3.5 million people, is still poor and unhappy because it has too many people.  

So, even more people must leave so that Ireland can become what it’s really meant to be: a place for sheep and cattle farming.

But this way of making money has problems. As landlords in Ireland get richer, many Irish people move to America. The Irish, pushed out by sheep and cattle farms, show up across the ocean as Fenians—people who oppose British rule—and they challenge the powerful new country, the United States.

Karl Marx said that the more workers a country has, the richer it becomes, but these workers get pushed out once they’re no longer needed by the owners of capital.

The idea of a “sickly worker from the early forests” is just a fancy myth. Early forest dwellers owned their land and used it freely, so they weren’t workers controlled by others. They were probably healthier than today’s workers and even healthier than the upper classes who were sick from diseases.

Some writers long ago said that poor people find happiness by living simply and working constantly, which also makes the country stronger—but really, this benefits landlords and rich people more than the workers themselves.

One thinker should have asked who really owns the laws, because laws come from property and who owns what, not the other way around.

If you think about Malthus, who wrote about population in 1798, remember that his work just copied others and didn’t have any original ideas.
