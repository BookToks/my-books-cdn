First, the capitalist buys the worker’s ability to work and uses it by making the worker use tools and materials to do a job. The way work is done doesn’t really change just because the worker is working for the capitalist instead of for themselves. Also, the specific ways of making things, like making boots or spinning thread, don’t change right away when a capitalist gets involved. The capitalist has to accept the worker’s skills as they are when they start, which are like the skills workers had before capitalism began.

Any changes in how things are made because of capitalists controlling work happen later, so we’ll talk about that in another chapter.

When the capitalist uses the worker’s labor, two main things happen. First, the worker works under the capitalist’s control. The capitalist makes sure the work is done right and that tools and materials are used carefully so nothing is wasted or broken unnecessarily.

Second, the product made belongs to the capitalist, not the worker who made it. Imagine a capitalist pays a worker for a day’s work—then the capitalist has the right to use that work for the whole day, just like renting a horse for a day. The worker only gives up the right to use their labor when they work. From the moment the worker starts, their labor belongs to the capitalist. By buying labor, the capitalist mixes the worker’s effort with the tools and materials he owns. For the capitalist, work is just using the labor he bought, but this can only happen if he also provides the tools and materials. The whole process uses things the capitalist owns, so the final product belongs to him, just like wine made in his cellar belongs to him.

The product the capitalist gets is useful, like yarn or boots. But even though boots help society move forward, the capitalist doesn’t make boots just because he likes them. Useful things are only made by capitalists because they can be sold for money. The capitalist wants two things: first, to make something useful that can be sold; and second, to make something worth more money than what he spent on tools and paying workers. His goal is not just to make useful things, but to make things that have value and, at the same time, extra value called surplus-value.

Remember, we are talking about making things to sell as commodities. Just like commodities have two sides—they are useful and they have value—making them is both working and creating value at the same time.
