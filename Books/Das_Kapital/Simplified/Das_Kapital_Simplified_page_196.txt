This question is way more important than the famous question Sir Robert Peel asked the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce: What is a pound? Peel asked this because he didn’t really understand what money is, just like the “little shilling men” of Birmingham.

The goal of a capitalist is to get the most amount of work done with the money they spend.

Losing one hour of work in a day is a huge problem for a business-focused country. Many poor workers, especially in factories, spend a lot on luxuries and waste their time, which is the worst kind of waste.

If a worker takes even a short break, the strict and controlling bosses watch closely and act like the worker is stealing time.

During the big London builders’ strike in 1860-61, workers fought to reduce the workday to 9 hours. Their leaders pointed out, with some sarcasm, that the richest building boss, Sir M. Peto, was seen as a good guy, even though he was all about making profits. (After 1867, Peto’s business failed badly.)

People who work actually support both the rich, who live off their money, and themselves.

A historian named Niebuhr said that big impressive ancient buildings only existed because there were rulers and servants. Another writer, Sismondi, said that fancy things like Brussels lace only exist because there are bosses and workers.

It’s heartbreaking to see workers in gold mines between Egypt, Ethiopia, and Arabia who can’t even keep clean or wear clothes. They get no kindness or help when they are sick, old, or weak. They are forced to work until they die.

This talks about life in the Romanian areas before things changed after the Crimean War.

The same was true in Germany, especially in Prussia east of the Elbe River. In the 1400s, German peasants were mostly free, paying some rent in goods and work. German settlers in Brandenburg, Pomerania, Silesia, and Eastern Prussia were even legally free. But after the peasants’ war, the nobility won and many peasants were enslaved again. By the mid-1500s, peasants in Eastern Prussia, Brandenburg, Pomerania, Silesia, and later Schleswig-Holstein became serfs, which means they lost their freedom.

More details can be found in E. Regnault’s book about the history of the Danubian Principalities.
