Machines have gotten a lot better, which has made work faster and easier. Shortening work hours helped push these improvements. Even though people worked fewer hours (about two hours less), they still produced as much as before because they worked harder during that shorter time.

This made factory owners much richer. For example, from 1838 to 1850, English cotton factories grew by 32%, but from 1850 to 1856, they grew by 86%.

Between 1848 and 1856, English industry made big progress with a 10-hour workday. But from 1856 to 1862, they did even better. In silk factories, the number of machines like spindles and looms increased a lot, but the number of workers actually went down. For example, spindles went up by 26.9%, looms by 15.6%, but workers dropped by 7%.

In worsted mills, spindles increased a lot between 1850 and 1856, but then stayed about the same until 1862. However, the machines started working twice as fast. Power-looms also increased in number from 1850 to 1862. The number of workers went up a bit until 1856 but then slightly dropped by 1862. Sadly, the number of children working under 14 years old went up during this time.

In 1863, a man named Mr. Ferrand told the government that thanks to better machines, one person who used to watch two looms with help now watches three or even four looms alone. Work that used to take 12 hours now happens in less than 10 hours. This means workers are under a lot more pressure than before.

Even though laws made work hours shorter, factory inspectors say that workers now have to work much harder, which is bad for their health and ability to work well.

In cotton, worsted, and silk mills, workers have to stay very alert because machines run much faster. This stress might be why more workers are getting lung diseases.

Itâ€™s clear that when work hours are cut, bosses try to make workers work harder to make up for lost time. This can wear workers out quickly. So, it looks like work hours will have to be cut again in the future to protect workers.
