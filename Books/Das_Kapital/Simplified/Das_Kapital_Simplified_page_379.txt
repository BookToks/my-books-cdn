The value that a worker’s effort creates is 6 shillings because they actually work for 12 hours. The value depends not on how much their work is worth, but on how long they work. This sounds strange at first: the work creates value worth 6 shillings, but the worker’s own value is only 3 shillings.

Also, the 3 shillings pay only for half the working day—6 hours of work—but this amount is seen as the price for the whole 12-hour day. So, the other 6 hours are unpaid. The wage system hides the fact that part of the workday is paid and part is not. It makes all work seem like it’s paid.

In older systems, like corvée labor, the worker’s own work and the forced work for their lord were clearly different. In slave labor, even the hours when the slave is just working to survive appear as work for the master. All the slave’s work looks unpaid. But in wage labor, even the unpaid work looks like it’s paid. The system hides the fact that workers are actually working more than they are paid for.

This shows why it’s so important how the value and price of work change into wages. This way of thinking hides the real relationship between workers and bosses, and it makes everything look fair and normal. It’s the basis for all the legal ideas about workers and capitalists, and for all the confusion about freedom and fairness in capitalism.

While it took a long time for history to understand wages, it’s actually easy to see why this happens.

At first, buying and selling labor looks like buying and selling any other thing. The buyer pays money, the seller gives something different. Lawyers see this as just a deal of “you give, I give.” Also, the ideas of “value of labor” and “price of labor” don’t seem stranger than “value of cotton” or “price of cotton.” Plus, the worker is paid after working.

Money, as a way to pay, shows the value or price of what is given—in this case, labor. But the worker doesn’t sell their power to work itself, but the actual work they do, like tailoring or shoemaking. The fact that work creates all value, and is different from other things sold, is hard for most people to understand.

Imagine the worker who works 12 hours but only gets paid for 6 hours, which is 3 shillings. For the worker, their 12 hours of work help them buy things worth 3 shillings. The value of their ability to work can change depending on how expensive things they need to live are, maybe from 2 to 4 shillings. Or, if the value of their work ability stays the same, the price they get can go up or down because of supply and demand. But the worker always gives 12 hours of work.

Any change in how much money they get feels like a change in how much their whole 12 hours of work is worth. This confused Adam Smith, who thought the length of the working day was always the same, and so said the value of labor never changes, even though the cost of living changes and the same day of work might be worth more or less money to the worker.
