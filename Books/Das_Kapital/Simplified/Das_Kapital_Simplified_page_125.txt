Since they don’t get paid until the end of the week, workers can’t pay for the bread their families eat during the week before they get their wages. Tremenheere says that, according to witnesses, it’s well known that bread mixed with other stuff is made just to be sold this way.

In many farming areas in England and even more in Scotland, wages are paid every two weeks or even once a month. Because of these long waits between paydays, workers have to buy things on credit. They end up paying higher prices and have to stick to the shop that gives them credit. For example, in Horningham in Wilts, where wages are paid monthly, the same flour that costs 1 shilling 10 pence elsewhere costs 2 shillings 4 pence there.

The block printers in Paisley and Kilmarnock went on strike to make their bosses pay wages every two weeks instead of monthly. Another example is in many English coal mines where miners aren’t paid until the end of the month. Meanwhile, they get some money or goods from the owners, but these goods often cost more than regular market prices. This is called the Truck system.

It’s common for coal mine owners to pay once a month but give some cash to workers every week. This cash is given in the company shop, which belongs to the owner. The workers then use this money there, which keeps them tied to the owner’s shop.
