In 1855, a report said that French law limits factory work to 12 hours a day. But it doesn’t say the hours have to be in one block. For children, work must be between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. Some factory owners take advantage of this by having two groups of workers who each work 12 hours, so the factory runs all day and night without stopping. The law is followed, but is it fair to people? Night work is harmful to health, and having men and women together in dark workshops at night is also dangerous.

One inspector said there was a factory owner who did different jobs in the same place, like bleaching, dyeing, printing, and finishing. Because these jobs fall under different laws, it’s hard to enforce the rules when the owner wants to break them. This causes many legal fights.

Factory inspectors finally said that bosses’ rights over workers have limits. Workers have their own time and right to rest, even if they don’t feel tired. In 1866, workers in Dunkirk said the workday was too long and made them feel like slaves. They decided 8 hours should be the legal limit, and anyone who opposes this is against workers’ rights.

Reports from the mid-1800s showed that workers are not free agents because they need laws to protect them. Even in free countries, workers need legal help to avoid being forced to work 14 hours a day without breaks.

The 10 Hours’ Act helped workers by stopping the early breakdown of people who worked too many hours. Factories can’t keep machines running all day without hurting workers’ health and morals, and workers can’t protect themselves. A big improvement was that workers now clearly know when their work time ends and their own time begins, so they can plan their lives better.
