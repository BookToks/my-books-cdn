When two people trade things, neither one actually gains more value than before. Each person already owned something worth as much as what they get in the trade. Using money to buy and sell doesn’t change that. The value of something is shown by its price before it’s sold, so the price isn’t made by trading but comes before it.

Basically, when things are traded, it’s just a change in form. The value stays the same—it just moves from one thing to money, then to another thing. This is like changing a £5 note into smaller coins; the total amount doesn’t change, just the way it looks. So, trading things without any outside problems means no one really gains or loses value.

Some people don’t understand this well and think that when things are exchanged, both sides get more value. But actually, if the values are equal, no one gains extra value. Sometimes prices aren’t exactly the same as value, but that’s breaking the normal rules of trading. Trading itself isn’t a way to make more value.

Some thinkers, like Condillac, get confused and mix up how useful something is (use-value) with what it’s worth in trade (exchange-value). He said that in trading, people give less to get more, because what one person doesn’t need is more useful to someone else. But this idea wrongly assumes that people make everything they need themselves and only trade extra stuff. Even though his idea is wrong, some modern economists still use it to say that trading makes extra value.
