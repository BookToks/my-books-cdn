Chapter 27: Taking Land Away from Farmers

In England, serfdom—where peasants were tied to the land—almost disappeared by the end of the 14th century. Most people were then free farmers who owned their own land, even if the legal titles seemed complicated.

On large estates, the old bailiffs, who were once serfs, were replaced by free farmers.

Farm workers were partly peasants who worked on big farms in their free time and partly a small group of wage workers. These workers also farmed their own land, usually about 4 acres, and lived in cottages. They and other peasants used common land for grazing animals and collecting wood or fuel. In all of Europe, feudal farming meant dividing land among many small landowners. Feudal lords were powerful not because they had big rents, but because they had many subjects, and the number of subjects depended on how many peasant landowners there were. So, even though after the Norman Conquest England had huge baronies, the land was still mostly divided into small peasant farms with only a few big estates. This, along with rich towns in the 15th century, made the people fairly wealthy but stopped the growth of big capitalist wealth.

The start of the big changes that led to capitalism happened in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Many free workers were pushed into the labor market when feudal groups of retainers—people who lived and worked for nobles—broke up. The king’s power, which grew with the rise of the middle class, helped break up these groups, but it wasn’t the only cause. The big feudal lords fought against the king and parliament and pushed peasants off the land they had rights to, also taking the common lands for themselves. The rise of wool making in Flanders and the higher price of wool in England pushed these evictions. The old nobility had been weakened by wars, and the new nobility cared most about money.

Changing farmland into sheep pastures was their goal. Harrison, who wrote about England, said taking land from small farmers was ruining the country. He described how peasants’ homes and cottages were destroyed or left to fall apart. Harrison wrote that many villages shrank or disappeared because of sheep farming, and towns became smaller or vanished. Some towns were even torn down for sheep farms, leaving only the lord’s buildings standing. His complaints might be a bit over the top, but they show how much these changes affected people back then.
