Since 1845, this kind of factory work has grown quickly in England, especially in crowded places like London, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Bristol, Norwich, Newcastle, and Glasgow. Along with it, a disease called lockjaw spread. A doctor in Vienna found in 1845 that this sickness mostly happened to people who made lucifer matches. Half of the workers are kids under thirteen and teens under eighteen. The job is so unhealthy and awful-smelling that only the poorest people, like half-starved widows, let their kids work there. These kids are often ragged, hungry, and didn’t go to school. In 1863, an official named Commissioner White found that out of the workers he checked, 270 were under 18, 50 were under 10, 10 were only 8 years old, and 5 were just 6 years old. They worked 12 to 15 hours a day, sometimes at night, with weird meal times, often eating in rooms full of dangerous phosphorus. The place was so bad that even Dante’s hell would seem better.

For making paper-hangings (wallpapers), the rougher ones are printed by machines, and the nicer ones are printed by hand with blocks. The busiest months are from October to April. During this time, the work is really fast and nonstop from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. or even later.

J. Leach said, “Last winter, six out of nineteen girls were too sick to work because of overwork. I have to shout at them to keep them awake.” W. Duffy said, “I saw the kids couldn’t keep their eyes open at work; actually, none of us could.” J. Lightbourne said, “I’m 13... Last winter we worked until 9 p.m., and the winter before until 10. My feet hurt so much I used to cry every night.” G. Apsden said, “When my boy was 7, I carried him on my back through the snow to work, and he worked 16 hours a day. I even had to kneel down to feed him while he stood by the machine because he couldn’t stop working.” Smith, who runs a factory in Manchester, said, “We work without stopping for meals, so we finish a 10½-hour day by 4:30 p.m., and after that, it’s overtime.” (Does Mr. Smith not eat during those 10½ hours?) He also said, “We usually don’t stop working before 6 p.m., so really, we’re working overtime all year.” For all the workers, including 152 kids and young people and 140 adults, the average work time for the last year and a half was at least 78.5 hours a week.

For six weeks ending May 2, 1862, the average was even higher—84 hours a week. Still, Mr. Smith smiled and said, “Machine work isn’t that hard.” Employers in block-printing said, “Hand work is healthier than machine work.” Most factory owners got angry at the idea of stopping machines even during meal breaks. Mr. Otley, who manages a wallpaper factory, said, “Working from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. would be fine for us, but working only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. isn’t good. Our machine always stops for lunch.” (How kind!) He also said there’s no paper or color wasted.
