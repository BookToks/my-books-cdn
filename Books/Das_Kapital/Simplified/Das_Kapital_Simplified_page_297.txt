What a crazy result of using machines to make money!

All serious economists agree that when new machines are introduced, they hurt the workers who do traditional crafts and jobs that the machines replace. Most of them feel sorry for factory workers who have to work in tough conditions. What’s their main argument? That even after the hard times of introducing machines are over, the number of workers forced to work in factories doesn’t go down—it actually goes up!

Yes, economists believe that after some growth, the factory system with machines ends up using more workers than it did at the very start, even though it also puts some people out of work at first. Sometimes, like in English wool and silk factories, when factories get bigger, they actually use fewer workers. For example, in 1860, special government checks showed that factories in parts of England had 94,119 workers with lots of machines running.

By 1865, those factories had even more machines, but the number of workers dropped to 88,913. So, even though there were 11% more machines, the workers decreased by 5.5%. Between 1852 and 1862, wool factories grew a lot, but the number of workers stayed about the same, showing how machines replaced people’s work.

Sometimes it looks like there are more workers, but that’s only because factories started including related jobs. For example, in the cotton trade between 1838 and 1856, more machines and workers appeared because the business was growing. But in other trades, machines replaced people who used to work by hand, so the total number of workers actually went down.

Lastly, it’s important to remember that in most factories, except metal ones, most workers are young people under 18, women, and children.
