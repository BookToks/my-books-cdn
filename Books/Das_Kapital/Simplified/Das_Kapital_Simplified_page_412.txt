It’s well known that the way the oldest child inherits everything isn’t just important in work and jobs.

It doesn’t matter if a business just keeps things the same or tries to grow bigger. If it stays the same, the boss spends all the extra money on themselves. If it grows, the boss shows they’re smart by spending some money and saving the rest.

The extra money made belongs to the boss, not anyone else. When the boss invests money to make more stuff, it’s always their own money, just like when they started. It doesn’t matter that this money comes from the unpaid work of their workers.

If worker B gets paid from the extra money worker A made, first, A made that money without losing any value, and second, it’s not B’s problem. What B should get is fair pay for their work. Both workers and bosses benefit: the worker gets paid early, and the boss makes more money than they pay in wages.

Things look different if we think about all bosses and workers together, not just one of each, and how they keep working over time.

But when we look at buying and selling things, only the buyer and seller matter. Their deal ends when their contract ends. If they trade again, it’s a new deal and doesn’t depend on the old one.

So, when judging buying and selling, we have to look at each trade on its own, without thinking about past or future trades. Since deals are made between individuals, it doesn’t make sense to think about whole social groups.

No matter how many times money has been saved and used again, each trade is fresh and clean. As long as trade rules are followed, the way people own things can change a lot, but property rights in buying and selling don’t change.

These rights are the same whether a product belongs to the person who made it and they trade it fairly, or in capitalism, when rich people own more because they keep using the unpaid work of others.

This happens when workers freely sell their ability to work as a product. Only then does buying and selling become normal, and every product is made to be sold, with all wealth passing through the market.
