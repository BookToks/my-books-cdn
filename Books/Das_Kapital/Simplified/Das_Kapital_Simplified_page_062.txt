From that moment, people started to clearly see the difference between how useful something is for using or consuming it, and how useful it is for trading or exchanging it. The value of something for using it is called its use-value, while the value it has when trading is called its exchange-value. How much one thing is worth compared to another depends on how they are made. Traditions decide their exact value.

When people trade products directly, each item is useful to its owner and is equal to other items only if the other person finds it useful too. At this stage, the things traded don’t have a value separate from their usefulness or from what the people trading need. But as more different things are traded, people need a way to compare values easily. This problem and its solution happen at the same time. People don’t trade big amounts without agreeing that different things can be equal in value to one special item. That special item becomes a general equivalent, meaning it can be traded for many other things. But this idea only lasts during the trade and moves from one item to another. As trade grows, the special item becomes fixed and takes the form of money. Which item becomes money at first is mostly by chance. Still, two main reasons decide this.

Money usually comes from items that are important for trade with outsiders, which are natural ways to show the value of things made at home. Or money comes from useful things like cattle, which are a big part of wealth that can be traded. Nomads were the first to create money because everything they owned was movable and easy to trade. Also, their lifestyle made them meet other groups often, encouraging trade. People have sometimes used slaves as early money, but never land. The idea of using land as money only appeared much later, in well-developed societies, starting in the late 1600s, and was tried on a national level during the French revolution a century later.

As trade expanded beyond local areas, and the value of things became more about human labor in general, money started to be linked to things naturally suited to be universal trade items. These were precious metals like gold and silver.

The saying, “gold and silver are not naturally money, but money naturally is gold and silver,” is true because these metals have qualities that make them perfect for money. So far, we know money mainly shows the value of things and expresses their worth in society. For money to work, it must be something that is the same no matter the piece, showing equal human labor. Also, since value differences are about amount, the money item must be easy to divide and put back together. Gold and silver have these natural qualities.
