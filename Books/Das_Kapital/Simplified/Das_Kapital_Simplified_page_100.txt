They asked different banks to lend money, but no one could. Many deals were done just by exchanging slips of paper. Still, by three o’clock, all the banknotes were given back to the banks that issued them! It was just money moving from one person to another.

Even though the usual amount of banknotes used in Scotland is less than three million pounds, on certain paydays, every single note the banks have—about seven million pounds—is used. On these days, the notes have a special job to do, and once that job is done, they go back to the banks they came from. Back then in Scotland, people used notes instead of checks to take money out of their accounts.

There’s a note saying the author made a small mistake, meaning to say “direct” instead of “inverse.”

When asked if six million gold coins would be enough to handle forty million pounds a year in transactions, Petty answered yes. He explained that if money changes hands every week, you only need a small amount of money at a time. But if payments happen every few months, like rent or taxes, you need more money available. So, depending on how often money moves, having about five and a half million pounds in money would be enough.

This shows how silly it is to have laws that force banks to keep only gold as reserves. The Bank of England had problems because of this. To fix it, Sir Robert Peel’s Bank Act of 1844 let the Bank of England use silver too, but only up to a quarter of the gold reserves. The value of silver was based on its price in London.

About 25 years ago, the value of gold compared to silver was about 15.5 to 1. Now it’s about 22 to 1, and silver keeps getting cheaper compared to gold. This is because the way we get these metals has changed a lot. Gold used to be mostly collected by washing it out from river deposits. Now, miners dig into quartz rocks to get gold, which is harder and takes more work.

Also, big new silver deposits were found in North America’s Rocky Mountains. Railways helped bring in machines and fuel, making it cheap and easy to mine lots of silver. Gold and silver appear differently in rocks. Gold is spread out in tiny amounts, so miners have to crush a huge amount of rock to get just a little gold. Silver is usually found in separate quartz that has a lot of silver or mixed with other ores that are worth mining too.

Because gold takes more work to get, its value has gone up. Silver, which is easier to mine now, has become less valuable.
