During a crisis, the difference between things we buy (commodities) and money, which shows their value, becomes a big problem.

In these times, it doesn’t matter what kind of money is used. There is still a shortage of money, whether it’s gold or paper money like banknotes. If we look at all the money used during a certain time, we see that the total money equals the prices of goods to be sold plus payments that need to be made, minus payments that cancel each other out, and minus cases where the same money is used multiple times.

So, even if prices and how fast money moves are steady, the amount of money and goods moving around don’t always match. Money can represent goods that aren’t being sold right now, and goods can be moving without their money value showing up until later. Also, the debts people make and the payments they have to make each day don’t always match.

Credit money comes from using money to make payments. Debt certificates are passed around so debts can be transferred to other people. As credit grows, money’s role as a payment tool grows too. In big business deals, money takes different forms, while gold and silver coins are mostly used for small everyday shopping.

When making goods grows a lot, money starts being used beyond just buying and selling stuff. It becomes the thing that all contracts are based on. Payments like rent and taxes change from paying with goods to paying with money. How much this happens depends on how the economy works. For example, the Roman Empire tried twice but failed to collect all taxes in money.

In France under King Louis XIV, poor farmers suffered not only because taxes were high but also because taxes changed from goods to money payments. In Asia, taxes are mostly paid with goods, which fits with their way of producing things. This helps keep their old way of farming going. It also explains why the Ottoman Empire lasted so long. If Japan’s farming changed to money rents because of trade with Europeans, their great farming system would be ruined.

In every country, certain days become regular times to pay big bills like taxes and rent. These dates depend on the seasons and other cycles. They also affect payments not directly linked to buying and selling, like taxes. The money needed for these payments causes temporary ups and downs in how money moves around the economy.  

From how fast money moves, we know that the amount of money needed for these regular payments is smaller if the payments are spread out over longer periods.
