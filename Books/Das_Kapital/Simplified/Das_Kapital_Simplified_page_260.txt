Chapter 15: Machinery and Modern Industry  
Section 1: The Development of Machinery  

John Stuart Mill said in his book “Principles of Political Economy” that it’s not clear if all the machines invented so far have actually made people’s work easier. But in capitalism, that’s not really the point of machines. Like other ways to make work more productive, machines are meant to make products cheaper. They also shorten the time workers spend working for themselves but make them work longer for the boss without extra pay. Basically, machines help create extra profit for the boss.  

In factories, big changes in how things are made start with the tools workers use. In modern industry, changes start with the machines themselves. So, we first need to understand how simple tools turn into machines, and what makes a machine different from regular tools. We’re only interested in the most obvious differences because changes in history don’t happen suddenly or clearly, just like changes in the Earth’s history.  

Some mathematicians and engineers, and a few English economists, say a tool is a simple machine, and a machine is just a complex tool. They think there’s no real difference between them. They even call simple things like levers, screws, and wedges machines. Every machine is made by combining these simple parts, even if you can’t see it. But from an economic point of view, this doesn’t help because it doesn’t look at the history or reasons behind it.  

Another way to tell the difference is that tools are powered by people, while machines are powered by something else, like animals, water, or wind. So, a plough pulled by oxen is a machine, but a super-fast loom worked by one person is just a tool. But if that same loom is powered by steam, then it becomes a machine.  

Since people started using animals for power a long time ago, machines probably came before hand tools. When John Wyatt made his spinning machine in 1735 and started the industrial revolution, he didn’t mention an animal power source, but it was actually powered by a donkey. He called it a machine that could spin without fingers.  

All advanced machines have three main parts: the motor, the parts that transfer power, and the tool or working part. The motor makes the machine move. It can create its own power, like a steam engine, or use natural power, like a water wheel or windmill. The parts that transfer power, like wheels, shafts, gears, belts, and ropes, control and change the movement so the working parts can do their job. These first two parts only exist to make the working part move, which then changes the material being worked on in the way the machine is designed to do.
