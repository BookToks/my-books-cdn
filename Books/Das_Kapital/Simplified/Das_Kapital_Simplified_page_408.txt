Chapter 24: Turning Extra Profit into More Capital  
Section 1: How Capitalist Production Grows Bigger and Bigger  

So far, we’ve looked at how extra profit (called surplus-value) comes from capital. Now, we need to see how capital actually grows from that extra profit. Using surplus-value as capital again is called capital accumulation.

Let’s think about this from one capitalist’s point of view. Imagine a spinner starts with £10,000. Out of that, £8,000 is spent on cotton, machines, and stuff, and £2,000 goes to paying workers. He makes 240,000 pounds of yarn every year, worth £10,000. Since the surplus-value rate is 100%, the extra profit comes from 40,000 pounds of yarn, which is one-sixth of the total yarn. This extra yarn is worth £2,000 and will be sold for that amount. £2,000 is just £2,000. You can’t see or smell extra profit in money. Knowing it’s surplus-value just tells us how the owner got it, but it doesn’t change what money or value actually are.

To turn this extra £2,000 into more capital, the spinner will spend £1,600 (four-fifths) on cotton and other materials and £400 (one-fifth) on hiring more spinners. These new workers will buy things they need to live, and the spinner pays for those things.

This new £2,000 of capital works in the spinning mill and then makes another £400 of extra profit.

Originally, the capital was money. The extra profit first comes as part of the total product’s value. When this product is sold and turned into money, the capital and the extra profit both become money. Turning this money back into capital happens the same way for both. The capitalist spends it on things that let him start making goods again—this time, bigger than before. But to do this, the things he wants to buy must already be available in the market.

His yarn sells because he brings it to the market, just like other capitalists bring their goods. But before these goods get to the market, they were part of all the products made in the year by everyone. Each capitalist only has a part of this big total. Buying and selling just swaps these parts between people. It doesn’t make the total product bigger or change what the products are.  

So, what people can do with the total product depends on what it’s made of, not on how it gets bought and sold.
