The needlemaker from the Nuremberg Guild was the foundation for making needles in England. In Nuremberg, one person did about 20 steps in a row to make a needle. But in England, there were soon 20 needlemakers working side by side, each doing just one of those steps. Later, each of those steps was broken down even more and given to different workers to do.

Making things by hand grows in two ways. First, it brings together different crafts that used to be separate and changes them into smaller tasks for making one product. Second, it breaks down one craft into many small steps, with each step done by a different person. So, making things by hand either starts or increases the division of work or brings different crafts together. No matter how it starts, it ends up as a system where people are the parts working together.

To really understand division of work in making things, you need to know this. Breaking down making something into steps is the same as breaking down a craft into the hand movements needed. Each step, easy or hard, must be done by hand and needs skill, strength, speed, and accuracy. The craft stays important. Because of this, each worker is assigned one small job and spends their whole life doing just that.

Also, division of work is a type of teamwork. Some problems with it come from working together in general, not just from this kind of work.

Section 2: The Detail Labourer and his Tools

If we look closer, a worker who does the same simple task all their life becomes like a tool made for that task. They do it faster than someone who does many steps. The group of workers in a factory is made up of many workers each doing a small part. So, compared to a single craftsperson, more is made in less time, meaning work is more productive. Also, when one person only does one small task, the way they do it gets better.

Doing the same simple task over and over helps the worker learn how to do it easily and well. Since many workers from different generations work together, the skills and tricks they learn get saved and passed on.
