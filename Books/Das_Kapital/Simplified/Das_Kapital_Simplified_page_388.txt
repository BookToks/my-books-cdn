At first, piece wages seem like you’re paying for finished work, not the actual time or effort someone spends working. It looks like the price is based on how much work the person can do, not how long they work. But this idea isn’t totally right.

Both piece wages and time wages exist at the same time in the same industries. For example, in London, most compositors get paid by the piece, but outside London, they usually get paid by the hour. Shipwrights in London get paid by the job, while others get paid by the day. Even in the same factory, some workers get piece wages and others get time wages. This shows that the way wages are paid doesn’t change what wages really are. One way might help bosses make more money, but the basic idea of wages stays the same.

Imagine a working day is 12 hours long, with 6 hours paid and 6 hours unpaid. The value made in the day is 6 shillings, so one hour of work is worth 6 pence. A worker who works at an average speed can make 24 pieces in 12 hours. After taking away the value of materials, those 24 pieces are worth 6 shillings, so one piece is worth 3 pence. If the worker gets paid 1.5 pence per piece, they earn 3 shillings in 12 hours. It doesn’t matter if you think the worker works half the time for themselves and half for the boss or if each piece is half paid and half unpaid — the math works out the same.

Piece wages are just as confusing as time wages. For example, two pieces made in one hour might be worth 6 pence, but the worker only gets paid 3 pence for them.

Piece wages don’t clearly show the value of the work. They don’t measure the value of each piece by the time spent, but instead, they measure how much time the worker spent by counting how many pieces they made.

With time wages, you measure work by how long someone works. With piece wages, you measure work by how many products they make in a certain time. In the end, the price of a day’s work equals the value of the worker’s ability to work for that day.
