Since 1848, business and industry have grown fast in Germany, and right now, there's a lot of risky money-making and cheating going on. But things haven’t been easy for professional economists. When they could study the economy clearly, the modern economic situation didn’t really exist in Germany. And when the economy did change, it happened in ways that made it hard to study fairly, especially because people only looked at things from the point of view of the rich and powerful. As long as economists think capitalism is the final and best way for society to work, they can only study it as a science when the fight between rich and poor is hidden or only shows up sometimes.

Let’s look at England. Their economic ideas come from a time when the fight between social classes hadn’t developed yet. The last big thinker, Ricardo, started by accepting the fight between classes (like workers vs. owners) as just a natural part of life. But this was as far as their economic science could go. Even while Ricardo was alive, people like Sismondi criticized his ideas.

Between 1820 and 1830, England saw lots of new economic thinking. People argued a lot about Ricardo’s ideas and old ideas too. These debates are not well known today because they were mostly in magazines and pamphlets. The arguments were fair because industry was still young, just starting to grow, as shown by the crisis in 1825. Also, the fight between workers and owners was less important politically, because governments and old aristocrats were fighting the common people and rising middle class. Economically, the struggle was between factory owners and landowners. In France, this fight was hidden by other landowner conflicts, but in England, it became clear after the Corn Laws. The economic debates in England at this time were like a short warm spell before a big change. That big change came in 1830.

By 1830, the middle class had taken control of politics in France and England. After that, the class struggle became more obvious and more serious. This marked the end of old economic science. It wasn’t just about whether ideas were true or not, but whether they helped or hurt the rich, or whether they were politically okay or dangerous. Instead of honest researchers, there were paid fighters for certain ideas; instead of real science, there was dishonesty and bias. Even the loud pamphlets by groups like the Anti-Corn Law League, led by Cobden and Bright, are interesting today—not for science, but because they fought against the landowning aristocracy.
