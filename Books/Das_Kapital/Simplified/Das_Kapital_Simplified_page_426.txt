14 “Stockpiling goods ... not selling them ... too much production.” (Th. Corbet, p. 104.) 15 Necker talks about “fancy and luxury stuff,” which “has piled up over time,” and “property laws have put it all in the hands of one social class.” (Works of M. Necker, Paris and Lausanne, 1789, vol. ii., p. 291.) 16 Ricardo, p. 163, note.

17 Even though John St. Mill uses “Logic,” he never spots mistakes like this that his teachers made. These mistakes, even from a business point of view, need fixing. He blindly accepts his teacher’s confusing ideas. For example: “Capital eventually just becomes wages, and when replaced by selling products, it turns back into wages again.” 18 When Adam Smith talked about how business grows and keeps going, he didn’t improve much and even messed up compared to earlier thinkers, especially the Physiocrats. He believed something strange: that the price of things is made up of wages, profit (interest), and rent—that is, wages plus extra value. Based on this, Storch admits, “It’s impossible to break down the necessary price into its simplest parts.” (Storch, 1815, vol. ii., p. 141, note.) What kind of economics says you can’t figure out the basic parts of a price? We’ll look more into this in Book III, part seven.

19 You’ll see the word “revenue” used in two ways here: first, to mean the extra value made by capital over time; second, to mean the part of that extra value the capitalist spends or uses for themselves. I keep both meanings because that’s how English and French economists talk.

20 Using the moneylender—an old but always around type of capitalist—as an example, Luther shows that the desire for power is part of wanting to get rich. “Non-religious people could reason that moneylenders are major thieves and murderers. But we Christians honor them, almost worship them for their money.

Anyone who takes away what others need to live is as bad as a murderer who starves someone. That’s what a moneylender does, but they sit safely while they should be punished badly, maybe even hanged and eaten by birds, if there was enough flesh for that. Meanwhile, small thieves get punished. Little thieves get stuck in stocks; big thieves walk around in gold and silk. So, after the devil, there’s no bigger enemy to people than greedy moneylenders, who want to be like gods over everyone. Even bad rulers let people live and admit they’re bad sometimes and show some mercy. But a moneylender would let the whole world starve and suffer just so they can have everything and make everyone else their slaves forever. They wear fancy clothes, gold chains, rings, wipe their mouths nicely, and try to look holy so no one sees the poor people they’ve dragged down.”
