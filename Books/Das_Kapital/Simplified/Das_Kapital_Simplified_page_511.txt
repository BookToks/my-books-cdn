In the 18th century, the law started being used to take land away from regular people. Big farmers also used their own tricks to do this. The government passed laws called Acts for enclosures of Commons, which let landlords make the people’s shared land into their own private property. This was basically a way for landlords to steal land from the people.

Sir F. M. Eden tried to argue that this shared land belonged to the big landlords, not the community. But he also asked for a “general Act of Parliament for the enclosure of Commons,” which shows that he knew the government had to approve this land takeover. He even wanted the poor people who lost their land to be paid compensation. At the same time, small farmers lost their independence and became tenants who had to do what landlords wanted. The common lands were taken away, helping big farms get even bigger. This also pushed many farmers off the land and forced them to find jobs in factories.

Back then, people didn’t fully understand that the country’s wealth often meant poor people stayed poor. Because of this, many writers argued strongly against the enclosure of commons. One person wrote that in Hertfordshire, 24 farms, each about 50-150 acres, were combined into just three farms. In places like Northamptonshire and Leicestershire, common lands were enclosed on a big scale and turned into grazing land. This meant fewer crops were grown and many old houses and farms were left empty. Villages shrank from having 100 families to only 8 or 10. A few rich farmers ended up owning what used to belong to many small farmers and tenants, throwing out lots of people and their families.

Not only was land wasted, but land that was cared for by communities or rented by them was also taken by rich neighbors under the excuse of enclosure. Even people who supported enclosures admitted that this made farms bigger, raised food prices, and caused villages to shrink. Enclosing waste land also hurt poor people by taking away part of their food source and making farms even larger.

Dr. Price explained that when land goes to a few big farmers, small farmers lose their land and have to work for others to survive. They no longer grow enough food for themselves and must buy everything they need. This means more people have to work for others and cities grow because more people move there looking for jobs.
