This law only works in a way that helps bosses keep control and make money.

Now, think about something people who support the system often say. They claim that when new machines replace workers, it actually "frees" capital (money and resources) for the workers. But really, what happens is the opposite: the workers who lose their jobs because of machines are the ones who are "set free," meaning they’re pushed out of work.

Not just those workers, but also the new workers coming in and anyone else who would normally get jobs when business grows—they all get pushed out too.

All these people are now out of jobs, and any new money looking to create jobs can hire them. But if this new money only replaces the jobs lost to machines, the total number of jobs doesn’t actually go up. If it creates fewer jobs, more people become unemployed. If it creates more jobs, then only the extra jobs beyond those lost matter. So, even when more money is invested, it doesn’t always mean more jobs overall.

The system is set up so that even when capital grows, it doesn’t always lead to more work for people. Supporters say this balances out the suffering of workers who lose their jobs, but really, it just hides the problem.

The number of jobs doesn’t just depend on how much money is invested, and the number of workers doesn’t just grow by itself. These things affect each other in a tricky way.

Capital controls both sides: when it grows, it can create more jobs, but it also creates more unemployed workers by pushing some out. Because there are more unemployed people, those who still have jobs have to work harder and produce more.

This makes the job market unfair, and workers don’t have as much power.

As soon as workers figure out that working harder and making more doesn’t mean better security for them, and that competition between workers depends on how many are unemployed, they try to work together through unions and groups to protect themselves.

But when they do this, bosses and their supporters complain that they are breaking the "natural" and "sacred" rules of supply and demand.

If workers join together, it messes up how bosses want things to run.

On the other hand, when in some places, like colonies, there aren’t enough unemployed people to keep workers dependent on bosses, the bosses fight back and try to stop workers from gaining power by using force and government help.
