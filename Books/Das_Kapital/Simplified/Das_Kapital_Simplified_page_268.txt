It’s true, as we’ve already seen, that every tool or machine is part of the work process as a whole. But only a small part of it, based on how much it wears out each day, actually adds value to what’s being made. This difference is much bigger for machines than for simple tools because machines are made of tougher materials and last longer. Also, machines use energy and materials more efficiently because their use is guided by scientific rules. Plus, machines can make a lot more stuff than tools.

When you consider the daily cost of using a machine or tool—like the value lost from wear and tear and things like oil or fuel—they actually do a lot of work for free, kind of like natural forces such as wind or water. The more powerful a machine is compared to a tool, the more work it does for free. In modern industry, humans have finally figured out how to make the products of their past work help make new things on a large scale without extra cost, just like nature does.

We also learned before that things like buildings, which many workers share, help reduce costs because they’re used together instead of separately. In a system with machines, not only is the main frame shared by many parts, but the engine that powers them all is shared too.

The difference between the total value of a machine and the value it adds each day depends mostly on how much product it makes. For example, Mr. Baynes from Blackburn said in 1858 that one unit of mechanical power can run 450 spinning machines, or 200 other types of spindles, or 15 cloth-making machines with all their extra equipment. So, the daily cost of running that power and the wear on the machine is spread over all those products, making the extra cost per item very small. The same goes for a big steam hammer: even though it uses a lot of coal and wears out, the cost is tiny when spread over tons of iron it shapes, but it would be expensive if it were only used for small jobs like hammering nails.

How much a machine produces depends on how many tools it uses and how fast they work. For example, some huge hammers hit seventy times a minute, and special machines can hit as many as 700 times a minute.

How much value a machine adds to a product depends on how much it costs. The less labor it took to make the machine, the less value it adds to the product. The less value it adds, the more productive it is, and the more like natural forces its work becomes. Also, when machines are made by other machines, their cost goes down compared to how much work they can do.
