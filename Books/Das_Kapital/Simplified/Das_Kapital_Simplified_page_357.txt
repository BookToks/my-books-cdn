We talked about work as a process between people and Nature, without focusing on its history. We said, “If we look at the whole work process by its results, both the tools and the things worked on are part of making stuff, and the work itself creates something useful.” We also mentioned that this way of figuring out what counts as productive work doesn’t really apply to how capitalism works. Now, we will explain this more.

When work is done by just one person, that person does all the jobs that later get split up. When someone gathers things from nature to live, only they control themselves. Later, other people start controlling them. One person can’t work on Nature without using their own muscles and brain together. Just like your head and hands work together, the work process joins thinking and doing. But later, these get separated and even fight each other. The product stops being made by just one person and becomes a social product—made by a group of workers, each doing part of the job. As working together becomes more important, our idea of productive work and who is productive grows. To be productive now, you don’t have to do manual work yourself; it’s enough to be part of the group and do one small job. The first definition of productive work still works for the whole group, but not for each person alone.

But our idea of productive work also becomes smaller. Capitalist production isn’t just about making things; it’s about making extra value, called surplus-value. The worker doesn’t produce for themselves but for the capitalist. So it’s not enough just to produce; the worker has to produce surplus-value. Only the worker who makes surplus-value for the capitalist is productive, helping the capitalist’s money grow. For example, a teacher is productive when, besides teaching, they work hard to make money for the school owner. It doesn’t matter if the owner runs a school or a sausage factory; the relationship is the same. So being a productive worker is not just about work and its results but about a social relationship where the worker helps create surplus-value.

Being a productive worker is not lucky, but actually a bad thing. In Book IV, about the history of these ideas, it will be clearer that making surplus-value has always been the main way classical economists decided who is productive. Their idea of a productive worker changed as they understood surplus-value better. For example, the Physiocrats said only farming work is productive because they thought only farming creates surplus-value.
