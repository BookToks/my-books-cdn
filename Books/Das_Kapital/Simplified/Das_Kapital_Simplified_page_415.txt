Chapter 24 Section 3: Separation of Surplus-Value into Capital and Revenue. The Abstinence Theory

In the last chapter, we talked about surplus-value (extra value made from work) only as money the capitalist spends on themselves. In this chapter, we looked at it only as money saved to make more money. But actually, it’s both at the same time. Part of it is spent by the capitalist, and part is saved and used to grow their business.

If there is a lot of surplus-value, the more the capitalist spends, the less they save, and vice versa.

All things being equal, how much they spend or save decides how much their business grows. But only the capitalist decides how to split it. When they save some of the surplus-value instead of spending it, we say they are saving because they want to make more money and get richer.

The capitalist only matters because they own capital (money and resources to invest). Without this, they don’t have a real role or right in history. Their job is not to enjoy things but to make money grow.

The capitalist is obsessed with making money grow and forces society to produce more just to keep producing. This pushes society to develop better ways to make things and creates conditions for a better future where everyone can grow freely.

The capitalist is only respected because of their role as owner of capital. Like a miser who just loves money, the capitalist’s drive for wealth is part of the system, not just a personal quirk. Capitalism forces each capitalist to keep investing more to stay in business and beat competitors.

Because of this, the capitalist’s personal spending is like stealing from what should be saved to grow the business. To save and invest means controlling more wealth and more people’s work, increasing the capitalist’s power.

But as capitalism grows, the capitalist stops being just a money owner. They start to understand and feel more comfortable with spending on themselves, seeing saving as giving up pleasure rather than spending as a sin.

“Two souls, alas, do dwell within his breast; The one is ever parting from the other.” At the start of capitalism, every new capitalist feels greed and the desire to get rich as their main motivation.
