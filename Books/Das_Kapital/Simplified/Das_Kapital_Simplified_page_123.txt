Chapter 6

Now we understand how the price paid by the buyer to the owner of this special thing called labour-power is decided. The value the buyer gets only shows up when the labour-power is actually used. The person with money buys everything needed for this, like raw materials, and pays the full price for them. Using labour-power at the same time creates products and extra value. The use of labour-power happens outside the market, unlike other goods.

With Mr. Moneybags and the worker, we leave the noisy market where everything happens openly. We follow them into the hidden place of production, where a sign says, “No admittance except on business.” Here, we will see how capital works and how it is made. We will finally discover the secret of making profits.

The market where labour-power is bought and sold is like a paradise of human rights. Freedom rules here because both buyer and seller agree freely. They make contracts as free people, and their agreement shows their shared choice.

Equality exists because both sides meet as owners of things, trading equal value for equal value. Property is respected since each person only controls what they own. Bentham’s idea of selfishness fits because everyone looks out for themselves. The only thing bringing them together is their own interests. Everyone cares only about themselves, but because of this, they all end up working together for everyone’s benefit, like a perfect system.

Leaving this simple market of buying and selling things, where the “Free-trader Vulgaris” gets his ideas, we notice a change in our characters. The money-owner now walks ahead as a capitalist, looking important and busy. The worker follows behind, shy and cautious, like someone selling themselves and expecting trouble.

In money form, capital does not create profit by itself. Some old writings wrongly say that ancient times had full capital systems but lacked free workers and credit. Even historians like Mommsen made mistakes here.

Because of this, laws in many countries limit work contracts. Where free labour exists, laws control how contracts end. In some places, like Mexico before the American Civil War, slavery hid as peonage. Workers and their families became tied to others through debts paid in work, passed down generations. Juarez ended peonage, but Emperor Maximilian brought it back with a law that was called a return to slavery. A person can give another the right to use their body and mind for a limited time, but this means those abilities are partly separated from the person as a whole.
