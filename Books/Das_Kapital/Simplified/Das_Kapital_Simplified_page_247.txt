People who really support the factory system often say that if we organized all work like a big factory, it would turn the whole society into one huge factory. That’s the worst thing they can think of about organizing work better.

In capitalist societies, work is chaotic and bosses have total control over workers. But in older societies where jobs developed naturally and then became fixed by law, work was planned carefully for the whole community. In these societies, people didn’t divide work inside small workshops much at all.

Some ancient Indian communities, which still exist today, share land and mix farming with crafts. They have a set way of dividing jobs that stays the same whenever a new community is started. These communities cover areas from 100 to several thousand acres and produce almost everything they need. Most products are used by the community itself, not sold as goods. Only extra products become things to trade, and even then, the state gets some as rent.

Different parts of India have different versions of these communities. In the simplest ones, land is farmed together and the food is shared. Each family also spins and weaves cloth.

Along with most people doing the same work, there are special roles like the “chief” who acts as judge, police, and tax collector; a bookkeeper who handles farm records; someone who protects travelers; a guard for the community borders; a water manager; a priest; a teacher; an astrologer who tells the best days for farming; a blacksmith and carpenter who fix tools; a potter; a barber; a washerman; a silversmith; and sometimes a poet. The whole community supports these people.

If the population grows, a new community is started nearby, copying the old one. This system shows a clear division of work, but not like factories where workers do only one tiny job. Here, the blacksmith or carpenter works in the usual way, doing all parts of their craft alone and without anyone bossing them around.

The simple way these communities organize their work helps explain why Asian societies stay the same for so long, even though their governments and rulers change all the time.
