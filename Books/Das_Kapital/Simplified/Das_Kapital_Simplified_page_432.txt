Chapter 25: The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation  
Section 1: More Need for Workers When Capital Grows, If Capital's Makeup Stays the Same  

In this chapter, we look at how growing capital affects workers.

The most important thing to understand is what capital is made of and how it changes as it grows.

Capital has two parts. One part is the value: how much is spent on tools and materials (constant capital) and how much is spent on paying workers (variable capital). The other part is the physical side: the tools and materials used plus the actual workers who use them. The first is called the value composition, and the second is called the technical composition of capital.

These two parts are closely linked. When the technical composition changes, it changes the value composition too. This connected way of looking at capital is called the organic composition of capital. When I talk about the composition of capital, I mean this organic composition.

Different businesses in the same industry have different capital makeups. If you average all their capital makeups, you get the average for that industry. Then, if you average all industries, you get the total capital makeup of the whole country. That’s what we focus on here.

When capital grows, the part spent on paying workers (variable capital) also grows. Some of the profit is turned back into capital, and some of that must be spent on more workers.

If everything else stays the same and the capital’s makeup doesn’t change (meaning the same amount of tools always needs the same number of workers to operate), then the need for workers and the money to pay them grow at the same rate as the capital. The faster the capital grows, the faster this need grows.

Since capital produces profits every year, and part of those profits are added to the original capital, this extra capital grows year by year. Sometimes, new markets or new needs allow capital to grow even faster. Because of this, the demand for workers might grow faster than the supply, which could make wages go up.

This will definitely happen if these conditions keep going. Every year more workers are needed, so eventually, the demand for workers will be bigger than the usual supply. When that happens, wages start to rise.
