The main difference between different types of economies, like one based on slave labor and another based on wage labor, is how the extra work done by the worker is taken by the person in charge.

The value of the worker’s pay matches the value of their work needed to survive, which sets how long they must work to cover that pay. Any extra work beyond that is the “surplus” work, which creates surplus value. This surplus value is linked to how much the worker is being used by the boss.

The rate of surplus value shows exactly how much the worker is being exploited by the boss. In our example, the total value made is £410 constant capital + £90 variable capital + £90 surplus value, with £500 total capital used. Usually, people might say the rate of surplus value is 18% (90 divided by 500), which sounds low.

But actually, the rate of surplus value is the surplus value divided by the variable capital, so it’s 90 divided by 90, or 100%. That means the worker is working half the day for themselves and half for the boss.

To find the rate of surplus value, you look at the total value made and ignore the constant capital (the stuff that just gets used up). What’s left is the value actually created by work. If you know the surplus value, subtract it to find the variable capital (worker’s pay), or the other way around. Then divide surplus value by variable capital to get the rate.

Even though this is simple, it helps to see examples.

For example, imagine a spinning mill with 10,000 spindles making yarn. Each spindle makes 1 pound of yarn a week, but 6% of cotton is wasted. So, the mill uses 10,600 pounds of cotton weekly, with 600 pounds wasted.

Cotton costs about £342 a week. The 10,000 spindles and machines cost £10,000 total. The wear and tear on the machines is 10% a year, or £20 a week. The building rent is £6 a week. Coal costs about £4.50 a week, gas £1, and oil and other stuff about £4.50 a week.
