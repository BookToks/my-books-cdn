If I give up all the time I spend working and all the work I do, I would be turning myself—my actions and my whole being—into someone else’s property. (Hegel, 1840)

The time of capitalism is known for this: workers see their ability to work as something they own and sell. So, their work becomes wage-labor. Also, from this point, the things workers make become products to be sold.

A person’s value, like other things, is seen as a price—how much someone would pay for their work. (Hobbes, 1839-44) For example, in ancient Rome, supervisors of slaves got less food than the slaves themselves because their work was easier. (Mommsen, 1856)

The natural price of work is about how much food and comfort a worker needs to live and raise a family, keeping enough workers in the market. (Torrens, 1815) Here, “work” actually means the power to work.

All work is paid for after it’s done. Commercial credit started when workers could save money and wait to get paid at the end of a week or month. (Ganilh, 1821) Workers lend their effort, but they don’t give away anything physical and only risk losing their wages. (Storch, 1815)

In London, there are two types of bakers: those who sell bread at full price and those who sell it cheaper. Most bakers sell cheaper bread, which is often mixed with harmful stuff like alum, soap, chalk, and stone dust. (Tremenheere, 1862) Because of this, poor people who eat a lot of bread get much less real food and might even harm their health. Still, many working-class people accept this bad bread because they have no choice.
