Even though he doesn’t really understand how production works, he feels that machines must be a very bad thing if they turn hard-working people into poor beggars. He thinks that new machines create more workers who are like slaves than the ones they replace.

You can see how wrong his view is from his own words: “The groups of people who have to work and buy stuff are getting smaller, and the groups who control the work, help, comfort, and teach everyone are growing. These groups take all the benefits that come from cheaper work, more products, and lower prices. Because of this, humans rise to great achievements, understand deep religious ideas, and set up important rules about morality, freedom, power, obedience, justice, duty, and kindness.” 

At the same time, there were new jobs ready in 110 new factories with thousands of machines and lots of power from steam and water.

In 1871, Mr. A. Redgrave, a factory inspector, said that wool factories have changed a lot. They used to have many women and children working, but now machines do most of the work. A factory owner told him, “Before, I had 63 workers. After new machines, I needed only 33. Now, with even better machines, I only need 13.”

There was a special investigation into the hard times of hand-loom weavers. Even though people knew about their suffering and felt sorry for them, improving their situation was left to time and changes. Now, about 20 years later, things have gotten much better, mostly because of the power-loom.

There are other ways machines affect the production of raw materials, which will be explained later.

Exports of cotton and wool from India and other places to Great Britain grew a lot between 1846 and 1865. For example, cotton exports from India went from about 34 million pounds in 1846 to over 445 million pounds in 1865. Wool exports from India and other regions also increased greatly during this time.
