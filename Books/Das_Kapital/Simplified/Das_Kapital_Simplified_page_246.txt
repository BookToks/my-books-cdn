Ferguson, who learned from Adam Smith, said: “We make a nation of slaves, and have no free citizens.” Even though there are many connections between them, the division of labor inside a society and inside a workshop are not just different in amount, but also in type.

The comparison makes the most sense when there is a hidden link connecting different jobs. For example, a cattle-breeder raises animals for hides, the tanner turns hides into leather, and the shoemaker makes boots from that leather. Each person’s work is just one step toward the final product, which is made by combining all their efforts. Also, many other industries help supply the cattle-breeder, tanner, and shoemaker with what they need.

Adam Smith thought the difference between social division of labor and division in manufacturing is only how it looks. In a workshop, you can see all the work happening in one place, but in society, the work is spread out over large areas with many people, so it’s harder to see the connection.

What links the work of the cattle-breeder, tanner, and shoemaker is that their products are things to be sold. But in a factory, the workers don’t make things to sell individually; only the final product they all help make is sold.

Division of labor in society happens because people buy and sell products from different industries. Inside a workshop, the connection comes from several workers selling their labor to one boss who puts their work together. Division of labor in a workshop means one boss owns all the tools and machines. Division of labor in society means many independent producers own their tools and products.

In a workshop, the number of workers doing certain jobs is fixed and planned. Outside, in society, who does what is more random and can change. Different industries try to balance out over time. Each producer makes things people want, and the amount of these wants changes, but there is a natural system that keeps things balanced. Also, the value of products decides how much time society spends making each type of product.

This balance is always changing because things keep disrupting it. In a workshop, the division of labor is planned ahead. In society, it happens naturally and controls the random choices of producers, seen in changing market prices.

Division of labor in a workshop means the boss has total control over workers, who are just parts of the machine he owns. Division of labor in society means independent producers compete with each other, and no one has full control except competition and their shared interests. It’s like animals fighting for survival but still keeping their species alive.

The same business mindset that praises division of labor in workshops—where workers do one small job and are controlled by the boss because it makes work more productive—also strongly opposes any attempts to control or regulate production in society. They see that as an attack on private property, freedom, and the individual capitalist’s freedom to do what they want.
