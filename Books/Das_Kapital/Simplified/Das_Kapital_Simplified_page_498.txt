The English farm workers get only a quarter as much milk and half as much bread as the Irish do. Arthur Young noticed this better food in Ireland over 100 years ago. The reason is simple: poor Irish farmers are much kinder than rich English ones. In Wales, this is mostly true only in the southwest. All doctors there agree that more people are dying from diseases like tuberculosis because the population’s health is getting worse due to poverty.

Farm workers have to live on very little money, sometimes even less than five pence a day. They often eat salty, dry meat that is hard to digest, mixed into broth or porridge made of meal and leeks. This is their usual meal every day. When industry grew, these workers stopped wearing strong homespun clothes and started wearing cheap cotton stuff. They also switched from drinking stronger alcohol to just tea.

After working outside in bad weather, the farmers go home to small cottages warmed by a fire burning peat or coal balls. The fire gives off bad gases. Their walls are made of mud and stones, floors are just bare dirt, and roofs are made of soggy thatch. They try to keep warm by sealing cracks, but the air inside smells awful. They often eat and sleep together with their family in these cabins. Doctors who stayed overnight said their feet would sink into the muddy floors, and they had to make a hole in the wall to get some fresh air. Many people saw that these dirty conditions and poor food made the peasants weak and sick.

Reports from officials in Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire show the same problem. There is also a terrible problem with many people being mentally disabled. The weather there is bad too. A strong southwest wind blows for 8 or 9 months each year, bringing heavy rain mostly on the western hills. Trees only grow in protected spots because the wind twists and breaks them. Cottages are built low in banks or valleys to hide from the wind. Only small sheep and local cattle can live on the pastures. Young people move away to work in mining towns in the east.

Carmarthenshire is where many miners come from, and it has the hospital for them. The population there barely stays the same size. For example, in Cardiganshire between 1851 and 1861, the number of males dropped slightly from 45,155 to 44,446, and females increased a bit from 52,459 to 52,955.

In 1865, the law was improved a little, but soon people learned that small changes like this did not help much.

To understand what comes next, remember that “Close Villages” are owned by one or two big landlords. “Open Villages” have land owned by many small landlords. In open villages, builders can put up cottages and houses to rent.

These fancy villages look nice but are not real, just like the fake villages that Catherine the Great saw on her trip to Crimea. Recently, even shepherds have often been kicked out of these showy villages.
