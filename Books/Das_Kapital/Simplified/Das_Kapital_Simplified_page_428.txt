In the early stages of society, profits weren’t the main way people saved or invested money. Instead, wages and rents were more important. But when a country’s industry grows a lot, profits become more important for saving and investing money.

Ricardo said that how fast people save and invest money depends on how productive workers are. Workers are usually most productive when there’s lots of good land. But even if land is very fertile, people don’t always save more money.

Back in 1866 and 1867, English newspapers wrote about Belgian miners, saying they were lucky because they only asked for enough money to live for their "masters." But the Belgian miners actually had a tough time. Soon after, they went on strike, which was stopped violently.

A manufacturer from Northamptonshire tried to compare the lives of workers in England and France, but he actually ended up talking about French farm workers instead of factory workers.

Today, because of global competition, things have changed a lot. If China becomes a big manufacturing country, European workers might have to accept much lower wages to keep up. The goal for English businesses is no longer to match wages in Europe but to compete with much lower wages, like those in China.

Benjamin Thompson wrote about poor people in England and Scotland in the late 1700s and early 1800s. He said that many poor people, especially in Scotland, lived on simple food like oat-meal and barley-meal mixed with water and salt. This was seen as normal and even comfortable in Scotland, probably because people there were better educated. But in England, poor workers were in worse shape.

Reports also showed that in England, food and even medicines were often mixed with harmful or useless substances. For example, many samples of opium bought in London were mixed with things like flour, gum, clay, or sand.
