Some economists in the 17th and 18th centuries thought that prices went up because there was more gold and silver available. But this idea was wrong. From now on, we'll assume the value of gold stays the same when we talk about prices.

If we think about money as the way prices are paid, then the amount of money needed depends on the total prices of all things sold. For example, if one quarter of wheat costs £2, then 100 quarters cost £200, 200 quarters cost £400, and so on. So, the more wheat there is, the more money is needed to buy it.

If the amount of stuff for sale stays the same, then the amount of money needed changes when prices go up or down. It doesn’t mean every price has to change at once. If some important prices go up, the total price of everything goes up, and more money is needed. If prices go down, less money is needed. It doesn’t matter if prices change because things are actually worth more or just because of market changes; the money needed still changes.

Imagine four things being sold at the same time: one quarter of wheat, 20 yards of linen, one Bible, and 4 gallons of brandy. If each costs £2, the total is £8, so £8 in money must be used. But if these items are sold one after the other, the same £2 can be used four times to buy all of them. This means the £2 moves around a lot, making several purchases in a day.

The number of times money changes hands in a certain time is called the “velocity” of money. If the four items are bought in one day, the total price is £8, the money moves four times, and only £2 is actually needed in circulation. So, the amount of money needed equals the total prices divided by how many times money is used.

In a country, many sales happen at the same time. Some coins are used only once, while others are used many times in different buying and selling chains. How often money moves depends on the situation.
