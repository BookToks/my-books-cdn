All the things needed for work suddenly become ways the capitalist has to hold back and not use everything right away. If the farmer doesn’t eat all the corn but plants some seeds instead, that’s the capitalist holding back. If the wine is left to age before drinking, that’s also the capitalist being patient. 

The capitalist actually harms himself when he “lends” tools and machines to workers. This means he uses them with workers to make extra profit instead of just using them up or wasting them on fun stuff. Ordinary economists explain this as not spending the value on luxuries. But how capitalists do this as a group is a mystery that normal economics hasn’t explained well. Still, the world keeps running because capitalists control themselves like they’re punishing themselves. 

To keep and grow their wealth, capitalists have to fight the urge to spend it all. So, people should stop making capitalists suffer by expecting them to always hold back, just like how slave owners were freed from deciding whether to waste their profits or invest in more slaves and land.

In different types of societies, people don’t just make enough to survive—they make more and more over time. This means they need to turn more products into things to help make even more products. But this doesn’t look like building capital or being a capitalist unless the worker’s tools and products are controlled by capital. 

Richard Jones, who studied economics, explains this well. Most Hindus are farmers who work their own land, so their tools and food don’t come from saving money but from their own work. In places where English rule hasn’t changed things much, non-farming workers are hired by rich landowners who get some of the farming products as rent. The landowners use part of what they get for themselves, some is made into luxury goods by workers, and the rest is wages for the workers who own their tools. Here, making more and more happens naturally without the capitalist who has to hold back and save everything.
