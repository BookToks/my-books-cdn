It turns the worker into someone broken and limited by making them focus only on tiny parts of a job, instead of using all their skills and instincts. It’s like in some places where they kill a whole animal just to use its skin or fat. Not only is the small work shared out to different people, but each person becomes like a machine doing just one small part. This idea that a person is only a small piece of a whole becomes real.

At first, the worker sells their ability to work because they don’t have the tools to make things on their own. But now, their ability to work only works if it’s sold to a boss. They can only do their job in the boss’s workshop. Since they can’t make things by themselves, the worker becomes just a small part of the boss’s business. Just like some groups show they belong to their leader by marks on their bodies, the division of work shows the worker belongs to the boss.

The knowledge, decision-making, and willpower that a farmer or craftsman uses a little bit, like how a warrior uses their own skill, are now only needed for the whole workshop. The worker’s intelligence in making things grows in one way but disappears in many others. What the small workers lose is collected by the boss who hires them. Because of divided work, the worker sees the power of making things as something owned by someone else and controlling them. This starts with simple teamwork, where the boss represents the unity and control of the group.

This grows in factories, where the worker is cut down to doing only small jobs. It’s finished in modern industry, where science becomes a tool separate from workers and is used to help the bosses. To make the group of workers and their bosses powerful and rich, each worker must become poor in their own skills.

“Not knowing much is the mother of working hard and also of believing weird things. Thinking and imagining can be wrong, but moving your hand or foot a lot doesn’t need thinking. Factories do best where people don’t use their minds much, and the workshop can be seen as a machine made up of people.” Some factory owners in the 1700s even hired people who weren’t very smart for secret jobs. Adam Smith says most people’s brains are shaped by their work. A person who only does a few simple tasks all their life doesn’t need to think much and often becomes very dumb. After talking about how dumb these workers get, he says their boring, unchanging jobs ruin their courage and even their body’s strength. They only get good at their own small job but lose their brain power, social skills, and fighting spirit.
