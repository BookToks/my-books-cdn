The value of things goes down when workers become more productive. The same happens with the value of workers' ability to work because it depends on the value of things. But the extra value that comes from working more efficiently goes up when productivity goes up and goes down when productivity goes down. If money's value stays the same, a 12-hour workday always creates the same new value, like six shillings, no matter how much of that is wages or extra profit.

If workers can make things faster and cheaper, the cost of basic needs goes down. So, the value of a day’s work drops from five shillings to three, and the extra profit goes from one shilling to three.

Before, workers needed 10 hours just to earn their wages. Now, only 6 hours are needed. The other 4 hours become extra work for the boss, without extra pay.

Because of this, bosses always want workers to be more productive to make things cheaper and workers cheaper too. The boss doesn’t care about the value of things themselves, only the extra profit they can get from selling them. When productivity goes up, the value of things goes down, but the extra profit goes up. This explains why bosses want to lower the price of things even though they only care about making money.

A smart economist named Quesnay asked why this happens, and no one could answer him. He said that if costs and workers’ pay can be lowered without hurting production, it’s good because things cost less. But people still think making more money means the price of products should go up.

Capitalists don’t want to shorten the whole workday; they want to shorten the time workers need to make a certain amount of stuff. If a worker makes 10 times more items in the same time, they still might work the same 12 hours and make 1,200 items instead of 120. Sometimes, the workday even gets longer, and the worker makes even more.

Some economists say workers should be thankful because they work less to make what they need. But then they also say workers should work longer hours anyway. The goal of making workers more productive is to reduce the time they work for themselves and increase the time they work for free for the boss. Next, we’ll look at how bosses do this in different ways.
