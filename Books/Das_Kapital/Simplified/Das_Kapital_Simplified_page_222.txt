If workers get better at making things that aren’t necessary for survival or for making things we need to live, it doesn’t change how much workers’ labor is worth.

When something gets cheaper, it only lowers the value of workers’ labor a little bit, depending on how much that thing is used to keep workers going. For example, shirts are needed, but they are just one of many things people need to live.

All the things people need to live come from different industries, and the value of each thing helps decide how much workers’ labor is worth. The value of labor goes down when less time is needed to make these things. The total drop in value comes from cutting down the time needed to make all these different items. This result happens overall, even if each business doesn’t try to lower the value of labor on purpose. For example, if a business makes shirts faster and cheaper, it might not mean they want to lower workers’ labor value, but if they do, it helps increase the overall profit rate. We need to see the big picture, not just what each business does.

We won’t talk here about how the laws of capitalism show up in how businesses compete and how business owners think about their actions. But it’s clear that you can’t really understand competition without knowing how capital works inside, like you can’t understand how planets move without knowing their real motions. Still, to understand how making goods cheaper creates more profit, let’s look at this example using what we’ve learned.

If one hour of work is worth sixpence, then working 12 hours creates six shillings of value. If in those 12 hours 12 items are made, and each item uses sixpence worth of materials, then each item costs one shilling—sixpence for materials and sixpence for work.

Now, if a business owner finds a way to make twice as many items in 12 hours, so 24 items, but the materials still cost sixpence each, then each item’s value drops to ninepence: sixpence for materials and threepence for the work. Even though workers made twice as many items, the total value created in the day is still six shillings. But now this value is spread over twice as many items. Each item has only half an hour of work in it instead of a full hour, so it costs less labor time. These cheaper items are below the average price, meaning they took less work than most others made under usual conditions. Usually, one item costs one shilling and equals two hours of social labor, but now it costs only ninepence and represents 1½ hours of labor.
