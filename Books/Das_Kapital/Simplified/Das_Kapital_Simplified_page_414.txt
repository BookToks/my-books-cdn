But now mistakes start to happen. Adam Smith made it popular to think that accumulation is just about productive workers using extra products they made. This basically means that turning surplus value into capital is just turning it into labor power.

Let’s look at what Ricardo says: “All the stuff a country makes gets used up, but it really matters who uses it—whether it’s used by people who make more value or by people who don’t. When we say revenue is saved and added to capital, we mean that the part of revenue added to capital is used by productive workers, not unproductive ones. It’s totally wrong to think capital grows by not using things.”

Ricardo and other economists, following Adam Smith, say that the part of revenue added to capital is used by productive workers. They believe all surplus value turned into capital becomes variable capital. But that’s not true. Surplus value splits into constant capital (things like machines and materials) and variable capital (labor power), just like the original capital. Labor power is used up by the capitalist during production, while the materials are used up by the workers while they work.

Also, the money paid for labor power is turned into things workers need, which the workers use, not the “productive labor” itself. Adam Smith made a big mistake by saying that even though a single capital is split into constant and variable parts, society’s total capital is only variable capital, meaning it’s all spent on wages.

For example, if a cloth maker uses £2,000 for capital, some of it goes to pay weavers and some goes to buy yarn and machines. But the people selling yarn and machines then use some of that money to pay their workers, and so on, until the whole £2,000 ends up as wages paid to workers. The main point of this argument depends on the phrase “and so on,” which just sends us in circles. Adam Smith stops looking at the problem right when it gets tricky.

It’s easy to understand the yearly production if we just look at the total amount made in a year. But each part of that product has to be sold as a commodity, and that’s where things get complicated. Different capitals and incomes mix and change hands all over, making it confusing and hard to solve.

In the third part of Book II, I will explain the real meaning of these facts. The Physiocrats did a great job in their Tableau économique by being the first to show yearly production as it looks after going through circulation.

Lastly, it’s clear that Political Economy, which supports the capitalist class, has used Adam Smith’s idea that all the surplus product turned into capital is used up by the working class.
