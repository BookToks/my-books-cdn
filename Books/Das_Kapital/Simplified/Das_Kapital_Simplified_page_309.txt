These mothers often make their kids work at home after school until 10, 11, or even midnight. The straw they work with hurts their mouths and fingers because they have to keep wetting it. Dr. Ballard, a doctor in London, says that each person should have at least 300 cubic feet of space in a bedroom or workroom. But in the straw-plait schools, kids get a lot less space—sometimes as little as 12 to 22 cubic feet each. One commissioner, Mr. White, said that the smallest space is less than half the size of a box that’s 3 feet long, wide, and high. This is how kids live until they’re 12 or 14 years old. Their poor parents are only focused on making their children work as much as possible. When the kids grow up, they don’t care about their parents and usually leave them.

It’s no surprise that in these conditions, there is a lot of ignorance and bad behavior. Their morals are very low, many women have children without being married, and often at such a young age that even experts are shocked. And this happens in what’s supposed to be a very Christian country, as Count Montalembert, an expert on Christianity, says.

The pay in these jobs is terrible. Sometimes a child in the straw-plait schools makes up to 3 shillings, but that’s rare. Also, the “truck system” makes things worse, especially in lace-making areas. This system means workers get paid in goods or credit instead of money, so their real wages are even lower. 

The change from home-based work to factory work is speeding up because of laws called Factory Acts. The cheap labor from abusing women and children, making them work too much and at night, can only go so far. When this breaks down, machines start to replace people’s work. This change quickly turns small home businesses and workshops into big factories.

A huge example of this is the clothing industry. This includes making straw hats, ladies’ hats, caps, suits, dresses, shirts, corsets, gloves, shoes, and smaller things like ties and collars. In 1861, over half a million women worked in these jobs in England and Wales. More than 115,000 were under 20, and over 16,000 were younger than 15. Across the whole UK, the number of women working in these jobs was over 750,000. About 438,000 men worked in hat making, shoe making, glove making, and tailoring in England and Wales. Around 15,000 of these men were under 15, nearly 90,000 were between 15 and 20, and over 333,000 were over 20 years old. These numbers don’t even include smaller jobs. But even with these numbers, over a million people worked in these trades in England and Wales alone in 1861, about the same number as those working in farming and raising animals. This helps us understand where all the huge amounts of clothes and goods made by machines come from, and the huge number of workers those machines need.
