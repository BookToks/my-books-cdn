They have to know more about how the mine works.  

You don’t think the workers would give unfairly harsh judgments?  
No, I don’t think so.  

V. Fake weights and measures. – The workers want to be paid every week instead of every two weeks, and they want to be paid by the weight of what they mine, not by how much space it takes up in the tubs. They also want protection against fake weights.  

If the tubs were changed to cheat the workers, a man could stop working by giving 14 days’ notice.  
But if he goes to another mine, the same cheating happens there.  
But can’t he just leave the place where the cheating happened?  
It’s everywhere; wherever he goes, he has to deal with it.  
Can a man leave by giving 14 days’ notice?  
Yes.  
And still, they are not happy!  

VI. Checking the mines. – Explosions aren’t the only problem for the workers.  
The men complain a lot about the bad air in the mines. The air is so bad that it’s hard to breathe. After working there for a while, they can’t work anymore. Some even have to quit and stay home for weeks because of the bad air, even where there’s no gas that can explode.  

There is usually enough air in the main tunnels, but no one makes sure fresh air gets to the places where the men work.  

Why don’t they tell the inspector?  
To be honest, many men are scared to do that. Some have lost their jobs for complaining.  
Why is the man treated badly for complaining?  
Yes... and it’s hard for him to find work in another mine.  
Do you think the mines nearby are checked enough to follow the rules?  
No, they aren’t checked at all. The inspector has only been down the mine once in seven years. There aren’t enough inspectors in our area. One old man over 70 years old has to check more than 130 mines.  
Do you want to have more junior inspectors?  
Yes.  

But do you think the government can afford to have so many inspectors without help from the workers?  
No, I think that’s almost impossible.  
Would it be better if inspectors came more often?  
Yes, and they should come without being asked.  
Don’t you think if inspectors came so often, the mine owners might try to blame the government for bad air instead of fixing it themselves?  
No, I don’t think so. I think inspectors should make sure the existing laws are followed.  
When you say junior inspectors, do you mean cheaper and less skilled men?  
I wouldn’t want them to be less skilled if it’s possible to get better ones.  
Do you just want more inspectors, or do you want a lower class of inspectors?
