The period from 1815 to 1863 had only 20 years of good times and growth, while the other 28 years were full of hard times and no progress. Between 1815 and 1830, competition with Europe and the United States started to grow. After 1833, markets in Asia got bigger, but this happened by destroying many Indian hand-loom weavers’ jobs. From 1846 to 1863, after the Corn Laws ended, there were 8 years of some growth and 9 years of struggle. Even in the good years, life for working men was still tough.

Now, about how modern industry changed things for crafts and small home businesses: machines replaced teamwork based on hand skills. For example, the mowing-machine took over the job of several people working together to mow fields. Another example is the needle-making machine. Back in Adam Smith’s time, 10 men working together could make about 48,000 needles a day. But one needle-making machine could make 145,000 needles in 11 hours! One woman could watch over four machines and produce almost 600,000 needles a day, or over 3 million in a week.

Sometimes, a single machine could start a small craft-based industry. But this was just a step toward the big factories, which usually appeared when machines were powered by steam or water instead of by people.

Sometimes, small industries used steam power by renting it, like some trades in Birmingham, or small engines for weaving. In Coventry, they tried “cottage factories” where a central engine powered looms in nearby cottages. Workers had to pay rent for each loom every week, whether they used it or not. Each cottage had 2 to 6 looms, some owned by the workers, some bought on credit, some rented. This competition between cottage factories and big factories lasted 12 years and ended with the cottage factories going out of business.

For industries that didn’t need large-scale production, like making envelopes or steel pens, they usually started as handcrafts, then moved to small manufacturing, and finally became factory-based. It was hard to switch to factories when making a product involved many separate steps that didn’t connect smoothly. This made it tough to start steel-pen factories. But about 15 years ago, a machine was made that could do 6 steps at the same time. Steel pens were first made by hand in 1820 and cost £7 4s. per gross (a gross is 144 pens). By 1830, they were made in small factories for 8 shillings per gross. Today, big factories make them for just 2 to 6 pence per gross.
