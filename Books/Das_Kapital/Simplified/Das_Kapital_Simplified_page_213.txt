Chapter 11: Rate and Mass of Surplus-Value

In this chapter, we keep assuming that the value of labor power—basically, the cost to keep a worker able to work—and the time needed for that are fixed and don’t change.

If that’s true, then both the rate and total amount of surplus value a worker creates for the boss in a certain time are fixed too. For example, if the worker needs to work 6 hours to cover their own cost, which equals 3 shillings, then 3 shillings is the daily value of that worker’s labor power, or how much the boss spends to hire that worker each day.

If the surplus value rate is 100%, this means the boss gets an extra 3 shillings worth of work each day from that worker—the worker works 6 hours total but only needs 3 hours to cover their own cost, so the extra 3 hours create surplus value.

The total variable capital a boss spends is the money used to pay all the workers at once. This total equals the average value of one worker’s labor power multiplied by the number of workers hired. So, if one worker costs 3 shillings per day, then to hire 100 workers, the boss must pay 300 shillings daily.

Similarly, if 3 shillings of variable capital from one worker produces 3 shillings of surplus value daily, then 300 shillings of variable capital for 100 workers will produce 300 shillings of surplus value daily. For any number n of workers, the surplus value equals n times 3 shillings.

So, the total surplus value made depends on how much surplus value one worker creates, multiplied by the number of workers hired. Since the surplus value per worker depends on the rate of surplus value, the total surplus value depends on the number of workers and how much each worker is exploited.

If we call the total surplus value S, the surplus value per worker s, the daily cost of one worker’s labor power v, the total variable capital V, the value of one average worker’s labor power P, the rate of exploitation (surplus labor divided by necessary labor) (a'/a), and the number of workers n, then the formula is:

S = P × (a'/a) × n

We always assume that the value of an average worker’s labor power stays the same, and that the workers hired are average workers. Sometimes, the total surplus value doesn’t grow exactly with the number of workers, but then the cost of labor power changes.

So, to produce a certain amount of surplus value, if one factor goes down, another can go up to keep the total the same. For example, if the variable capital (money spent on wages) goes down but the rate of surplus value goes up by the same amount, the total surplus value stays unchanged.
