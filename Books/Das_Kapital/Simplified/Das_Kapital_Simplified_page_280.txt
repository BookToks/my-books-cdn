In England, the workday was reduced to 12 hours starting in 1832. By 1836, a factory owner said that workers were doing much harder work than 30 or 40 years before because machines were running faster and needed more attention.

In 1844, Lord Ashley (later Lord Shaftesbury) told the House of Commons that workers were doing three times as much work as when factories first started. Machines did work that would have needed millions of people, but they also made the workersâ€™ jobs much harder. For example, in 1815, a cotton spinner had to walk 8 miles following the machines during a 12-hour day. By 1832, that distance was 20 miles or more. The amount of work spinners had to do increased a lot over the years, with more stretches of yarn to manage every day.

He also said that the work was getting harder because the cotton was sometimes lower quality and more difficult to spin. In other parts of the factory, one person did the work that used to be done by two. In the weaving rooms, mostly women worked, and their work got about 10% harder because machines were faster. For example, in 1838, 18,000 hanks of yarn were spun each week, but by 1843, it was 21,000. The speed of weaving machines also increased a lot between 1819 and 1842, showing how much harder the work had become.

Because the work was already so intense in 1844 under the 12-hour rule, factory owners said it was impossible to reduce working hours any more without making less stuff. Leonard Horner, a factory inspector, explained this by saying that the amount of work depends on how fast the machines run. Factory owners want machines to run as fast as possible but without breaking them, ruining the products, or making workers work harder than they can handle all day. So, the big challenge for factory owners was finding the fastest machine speed that still met these conditions.
