I have to disagree with some important politicians who want the working people in this country to be slaves forever. They forget the saying, “all work and no play.” Haven’t the English been proud of how clever and skilled their workers and makers are? This is probably because workers have time to relax in their own way. If they had to work all year, six days a week, doing the same job over and over, wouldn’t that make them less creative and sharp? Wouldn’t our workers lose their good reputation because of such never-ending hard work? What kind of work could we expect from people pushed too hard? Many English workers can do as much in four days as a French worker does in five or six. But if English workers are forced to work nonstop, they might become worse than the French. We say our people are brave in war because they eat good food and enjoy freedom. So why couldn’t the skill and cleverness of our workers come from the freedom to work their own way? I hope they never lose these rights and good living, which help both their skill and courage.

Then, the writer of the “Essay on Trade and Commerce” answers: “If having one day off every week is seen as a rule from above, since the other six days are for work, it’s not cruel to make people work those six days.”

He says people naturally like to take it easy, and we see this in factory workers who usually only work about four days a week, unless food prices go up a lot. Let’s say all the things poor people need are called “wheat.” If a bushel of wheat costs five shillings and a worker earns one shilling a day, then the worker needs to work five days to pay for it. If wheat costs four shillings, the worker only needs to work four days. But since wages here are higher compared to prices, a worker who works four days still has extra money to take time off the rest of the week. I hope I’ve shown that working six days a week isn’t slavery. Our workers do this and seem to be the happiest poor people. The Dutch do the same in their factories and seem happy. The French, too, work like this when they don’t have holidays. But our people think that, as Englishmen, they have the right to be freer and more independent than anyone else in Europe. This idea might help soldiers be brave, but the less workers believe they are independent, the better it is for them and the country. Workers should never think they are free from their bosses. It’s very dangerous to encourage angry crowds in a business country like ours, where maybe seven out of eight people own little or no property.
