The amount of money people use can go down if the number of things to buy drops faster or if money starts moving faster in buying and selling than prices go up.

If prices for things go down, the amount of money used will stay the same if the number of things to buy goes up the same amount as prices drop, or if money moves slower by the same amount. The amount of money will go up if the number of things to buy grows faster or money moves slower faster than prices fall.

Different factors can balance each other out, so even if things keep changing, the total prices and amount of money used stay about the same. This is why, over long times, the amount of money in a country doesn’t change as much as you might think, except during big problems like economic crashes or changes in money’s value.

The rule that the amount of money depends on the total prices of things and how fast money moves can also be said like this: if you know the total value of goods and how quickly they are traded, the amount of gold money depends on gold’s value. Some people wrongly thought prices change because of how much money or gold there is. They imagined goods had no price and money had no value at first, but that’s not true.

Money is usually coins because it needs to be easy to use for buying and selling. The prices we think of are like the weight of gold, and this gold has to be real coins with set values. Making coins and setting prices is the government’s job. Different countries have their own coins, which shows the difference between buying inside a country and trading with the world.

The only real difference between coins and gold bars is their shape, and gold can change between these forms anytime. But once coins leave the mint, they start to wear down. Coins lose some weight as they are used, so coins that are supposed to be the same can end up different in value. This means the gold weight used as a price standard doesn’t match the actual coins, causing confusion, especially in history.

Because coins naturally wear down and stop being exactly what they say, laws now say how much weight loss makes a coin no longer valid as money.
