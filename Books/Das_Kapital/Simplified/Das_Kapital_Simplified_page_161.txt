These kids work longer hours than the workers in nearby villages. Calling them lazy or bad is really unfair and dishonest.

About 12 years ago, some important people said that all the extra profit a factory owner makes comes from the very last hour of work. They claimed that if you cut the workday by one hour, the owner’s profit would disappear. Now, it turns out they also say that if kids work less than 10 hours, both their good behavior and the bosses’ profits would disappear too. Both depend on that last, harmful hour.

A report showed how some factory owners tricked and pressured workers into signing petitions. Then, they lied to Parliament, pretending those petitions represented all workers or the whole industry. It’s strange that experts have never been able to explain why the first idea about the “last hour” was wrong. They look at what actually happens, but the real reason remains a mystery.

Still, the professor learned something from visiting Manchester. In his letters about the Factory Act, he said that all profit and interest come from one unpaid hour of work. A year before, he had said profit comes from the work of the owner and interest comes from their self-control or sacrifice, which he called “abstinence.” This idea wasn’t new, but the word was.

He explained that for a person with £20,000 capital making £2,000 profit a year, it doesn’t matter if they hire 100 or 1,000 workers or sell their products for £10,000 or £20,000, as long as their profit stays the same. Some old thinkers said the same about countries — it doesn’t matter if a country has 10 or 12 million people, as long as the money made stays the same.

Long ago, Arthur Young said that dividing land among many small farmers might only be good for making more people, which alone isn’t very useful. Others noticed people often say that net wealth helps workers, but really it’s not because it’s net wealth.

We started with the idea that work power is bought and sold at its true value.
