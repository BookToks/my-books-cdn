With him, everything is upside down. You have to turn it the right way up again if you want to find the sensible part hidden inside the confusing outer shell.

In its confusing form, dialectic became popular in Germany because it seemed to make the current situation look better and more important. But in its clear and logical form, it is shocking and unacceptable to the middle class and their strict teachers. That’s because it not only understands and accepts the current state of things, but also recognizes that this state will break down eventually. It sees every social system as always changing, so it remembers that nothing stays the same forever. It doesn’t let anything fool it, and is naturally critical and wants change.

The problems built into capitalist society show up most clearly to practical middle-class people in the repeating economic cycles that modern industry goes through. These cycles end in a big crisis that affects everyone. That crisis is coming again, though it’s still in the early stages. Because the crisis will be so widespread and intense, it will force even the new leaders of the Prusso-German empire to understand dialectics.

3 The weak critics of German economics didn’t like the style of my book. I know “Das Kapital” isn’t perfect in writing style. But to help these critics and their readers, I’ll share one English and one Russian review. The Saturday Review, which usually doesn’t agree with me, said about the first edition: “The subject is explained in a way that makes even the driest economic questions interesting.” The St. Petersburg Journal said on April 8 (20), 1872: “The subject is explained clearly so that anyone can understand it, and even though it’s scientific and complicated, it’s lively. In this way, the author is very different from most German scholars who write in a dry, confusing way that makes ordinary people’s heads hurt.”
