Sir F. M. Eden, in his book “The State of the Poor,” explains that the land we have doesn’t produce enough food and goods for everyone to live without working first. Some people have to work very hard all the time so others can have what they need.

There are others who don’t work themselves but still get to enjoy the goods made by workers. These people don’t work because society and laws allow them to own things and make money in ways other than working. People with money or land get their advantages mostly because others work for them. It’s not just having money or land that makes someone rich, but being able to control the work others do.  

Eden says this system gives rich people enough power over workers, but it shouldn’t be too much. Workers aren’t treated like slaves but live in a kind of easy dependence, which is needed for everyone to be comfortable. Eden was one of the few important followers of Adam Smith in the 1700s.

Under these conditions, which are the best for workers so far, workers depend on capital (money and resources) in a way that is bearable or “easy and liberal.” As capital grows, this dependence doesn’t get worse, it just spreads to more people. Workers get more things over time, like better clothes and some savings, because they get paid more as the economy grows.

But having better stuff and more money doesn’t stop workers from being exploited. When wages go up, it just loosens the “golden chain” of control workers have put on themselves a little bit. One important fact is often ignored: in capitalism, people buy workers’ labor not to simply meet their own needs but to make more money. The goal is to produce goods that have more value than the cost of paying the workers. This extra value, called surplus-value, is the main rule of capitalism.

Workers sell their labor only as long as it helps keep the system going and creates more capital. The conditions of work, whether good or bad, require workers to keep selling their labor and producing more wealth in the form of capital. Wages always include some amount of unpaid work by the laborer. This remains true even if wages rise or prices change.
