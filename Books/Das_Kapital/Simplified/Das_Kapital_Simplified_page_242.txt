In manufacturing, making a certain amount of product in a set time depends on how the work is done. Different tasks take different amounts of time, so in the same time, workers finish different amounts of work. If one worker does the same task every day, you need different numbers of workers for each task. For example, in making type, there are four founders, two breakers, and one rubber. The founder makes 2,000 pieces an hour, the breaker breaks 4,000, and the rubber polishes 8,000. This shows how people work together by doing the same job at the same time, but now it also means there is a fixed number of workers needed for each task. Division of labor in manufacturing not only breaks down work into different parts but also creates a math-based rule for how many workers are needed for each part.

Once the best number of workers for each task is found by trying it out, the whole operation can only grow by adding more workers in the same ratio. Some jobs, like supervising or moving products between steps, can be done by the same person no matter how big the factory is. These special jobs only make sense when there are many workers, but the number of workers in all groups must increase in the right proportion.

Each group of workers doing a specific task is made up of similar workers and is part of the whole system. Sometimes, each group is like a small team that repeats inside the big system. For example, making glass bottles has three main steps. First, preparing the glass ingredients like sand and lime and melting them. Different workers do small tasks in this step and also in the last step, where bottles are taken out, sorted, and packed. In the middle is the real glass melting. At each furnace opening, a group of five workers — a bottlemaker, blower, gatherer, putter-up, and taker-in — work closely together like parts of one body. If one is missing, the group can’t work properly.  

A glass furnace usually has several openings (in England, 4 to 6), each with its own group of five workers. These groups work together by sharing the furnace, which saves resources. This furnace with its groups is called a glass house. A glass factory is made up of many glass houses plus the workers and equipment needed for the first and last steps.
