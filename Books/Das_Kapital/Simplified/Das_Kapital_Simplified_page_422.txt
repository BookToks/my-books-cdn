The same amount of constant capital is used to make more tools, materials, and supplies. This means it helps produce more useful things and value, and also uses more labor. Even if the value of this extra capital stays the same or gets smaller, the process of building up capital still speeds up. Not only does the amount of production grow a lot, but the extra profit made grows faster than the value of the extra capital.

When workers get better at making things, it also affects the original capital already being used. Some of this capital is made up of tools and machines that aren’t used up right away and last a long time. But every year, some of these tools break down or stop working well.

So, each year, some tools need to be replaced with new ones. If workers have become more productive during the time the old tools were used, the new tools will be better and cheaper because of new science and technology. This means the old capital is replaced by more efficient versions, not just small improvements. Other parts of the capital, like raw materials, get used up and replaced much faster, often every year. New methods and inventions affect both new capital and the capital already in use at the same time. For example, advances in chemistry not only create more useful materials but also show how to recycle waste back into production, making new resources without extra cost.

Just like using natural resources more intensely, science and technology help capital grow even if the current amount of capital stays the same. They also improve the part of capital that is being renewed by adding new social progress for free while the old capital is used up. However, this progress also causes some of the current capital to lose value.

When this loss of value becomes a big problem in competition, workers usually have to suffer by being made to work harder, which the capitalist uses to make up for the losses.

Work adds the value of the tools and materials it uses to the product. At the same time, as work becomes more productive, the value and amount of tools and materials used by that work increase. Even though the same amount of work always adds the same new value, the old capital value passed on to the product grows as work gets more productive.

For example, an English spinner and a Chinese spinner might work the same hours and energy, so they create the same value in a week. But the English spinner uses a powerful machine, while the Chinese spinner uses a simple spinning wheel. While the Chinese spinner makes one pound of cotton, the English spinner makes several hundred pounds. This means the English spinner’s product contains a much larger amount of old capital value, which shows up again in a useful form and can be used as capital again.
