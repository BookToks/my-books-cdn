Sometimes, he realizes he’s working too fast, and this causes more breakages and mistakes, which are worse than the extra speed helps. So, he has to slow down. I thought that a smart mill-owner would figure out the fastest safe speed, and that it wouldn’t be possible to make as much in eleven hours as in twelve. I also guessed that workers paid by how much they make would work as hard as they can without burning out.

Because of this, Horner believed that working less than twelve hours would definitely lower production. Ten years later, he said he was wrong in 1845 and didn’t realize how much machines and workers could stretch their limits when the workday was forced to be shorter.

Now, let’s talk about what happened after the Ten Hours’ Act was introduced in 1847 in English cotton, wool, silk, and flax mills.

The speed of the spinning machines got faster. For example, the throstle spindle went from 4,500 spins per minute in 1839 to 5,000 in 1862. The mule spindle increased from 5,000 to 6,000 spins per minute. This was about a 10% increase for the throstle and a 20% increase for the mule.

James Nasmyth, a well-known engineer near Manchester, wrote to Leonard Horner in 1852 about improvements in steam engines from 1848 to 1852. He said that the official power numbers for steam engines were based on engines from 1828, so they didn’t show the real power. He believed that with the same size engine, they were now getting at least 50% more work done. Some steam engines that used to produce 50 horsepower were now making over 100 horsepower.

The new steam engines could work harder because of better design and stronger boilers. Even though the number of workers per horsepower stayed the same, there were fewer workers needed for the amount of machinery.

In 1850, factories in the UK used 134,217 horsepower to run 25,638,716 spindles and 301,445 looms. By 1856, the number of spindles and looms had grown to 33,503,580 and 369,205. Based on 1850 power levels, they would need 175,000 horsepower in 1856, but official records showed only 161,435 horsepower was used—over 10,000 less than expected.

These facts show that factories were growing quickly. Even though the number of workers per horsepower didn’t change, fewer workers were needed for the machines. Steam engines were able to run more machines using less power because of better efficiency. More work could be done thanks to better machines, faster speeds, and new manufacturing methods.
