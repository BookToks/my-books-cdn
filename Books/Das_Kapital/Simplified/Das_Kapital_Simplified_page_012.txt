Since then, the Free Trade laws started by Sir Robert Peel have taken away the last big advantage of simple money-saving ideas.

The big changes in Europe during 1848-9 also affected England. Some people who wanted to be more than just followers of the rich tried to mix the economy of business with the needs of workers, who could no longer be ignored. This mixing was shallow, and John Stuart Mill is the best example of it. It showed that the economy of the rich was failing. A great Russian thinker, N. Tschernyschewsky, explained this well in his book about Mill’s ideas. 

In Germany, the system of capitalism was at a breaking point, while in France and England, fights between rich and poor were already strong. The German workers understood their situation better than the German rich did. So, even when it seemed like Germany could have its own economic science, it actually couldn’t.

Because of this, the teachers of economics in Germany split into two groups. One group, made of practical business people, followed Bastiat, who was the simplest and most fitting defender of the basic economy. The other group, proud of being professors, followed Mill, trying to bring together ideas that didn’t really fit. Just like before, the Germans were still just followers copying others, not original thinkers.

Germany’s history made it impossible for them to create new ideas about the economy, but they could still criticize it. When they did this, they only spoke for the workers, the class that wants to end capitalism and all social classes.

At first, the German rich tried to ignore "Das Kapital" by staying silent, just like they did with my earlier writings. When silence didn’t work anymore, they pretended to criticize my book but really tried to calm down the rich people. But they found strong opponents in the workers’ newspapers, like Joseph Dietzgen’s articles, who pushed back and still do. A great Russian version of "Das Kapital" came out in spring 1872, and most of the 3,000 copies sold quickly. In 1871, N. Sieber, a professor in Kiev, said my ideas about value, money, and capital were a necessary next step after Smith and Ricardo. Western Europeans are surprised by how clearly Sieber understands the theory.

Many people haven’t understood the way I wrote "Das Kapital," which is why different and opposite opinions about it exist.

For example, the Paris Revue Positiviste complained that I both use abstract ideas and also stick to real facts, instead of giving simple advice for the future. Professor Sieber answered that my method is the same deductive way used by the best British economists, who have both good and bad points.
