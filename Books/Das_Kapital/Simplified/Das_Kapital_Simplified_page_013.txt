M. Block, in his article “Les Théoriciens du Socialisme en Allemagne” from 1872, says that my way of studying things is very clear and logical. He writes, “By this work Mr. Marx ranks among the most important analytical thinkers.” Some German critics, however, shout that my ideas are just confusing “Hegelian sophistry.” 

A magazine from St. Petersburg called the European Messenger reviewed my book “Das Kapital” in 1872. They said that my way of studying is very realistic, but the way I explain things sounds like confusing German philosophy. They wrote, “At first glance, if you only look at how Marx presents his ideas, he seems like a very idealistic philosopher, but in a bad way. But actually, he is much more realistic than anyone before him in economic criticism. He can’t really be called an idealist.” I think the best way to respond is by sharing some parts of this review because many readers can’t read the original Russian article.

The review quotes from my 1859 book “Criticism of Political Economy,” where I explain the material facts behind my method. The writer says, “What matters most to Marx is finding the law that controls the things he studies. This law is not just about how things look at one time but about how they change and develop from one form to another over history. Once Marx finds this law, he looks closely at how it shows up in real social life. So, Marx focuses only on proving, through strict scientific study, that there must be a certain order in society, and that this order will change into a new one. This happens whether people believe it or not, and whether they are aware of it or not. Marx treats social change like natural history, following laws that don’t depend on what people want or think, but instead shape their thoughts and actions.”

The review continues, “Since people’s awareness plays only a small role in history, any serious study of civilization cannot be based on ideas or consciousness. Instead, it must start with real, material facts. This kind of study compares one fact with another fact, not with ideas. The important thing is to study these facts carefully, seeing how they relate to each other as parts of a process of change. Most important is to analyze clearly the order and connection between the different stages of this change.”
