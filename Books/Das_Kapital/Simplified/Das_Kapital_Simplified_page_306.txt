Wearing just some dirty old clothes, with their legs bare well above the knees and their hair and faces covered in dirt, these kids learn to ignore any feeling of shame or decency. At meal times, they lie down in the fields or watch boys swimming in a nearby canal. After a hard day of work, they change into better clothes and go with the men to the pubs. It’s normal for people in this group to start drinking a lot from a young age.

The worst part is that brickmakers don’t believe they can change or improve. One respected person even said to a chaplain, “Trying to help a brickmaker is as hopeless as trying to change the devil!” When it comes to how bosses save money by cutting corners on workers’ needs in modern workshops (not counting big factories), there is a lot of official proof in health reports from 1863 and 1864.

The workshops, especially those of London printers and tailors, are described as worse than any horrible story you could imagine. The bad conditions clearly hurt the workers’ health. Dr. Simon, the main medical officer, said in his 1863 report that workers can’t even demand basic health and safety rights. They can’t fix these problems themselves, and the health inspectors don’t really help. Because of this, many workers suffer and die early due to the terrible conditions at work.

To show how workrooms affect health, Dr. Simon shared a table of death rates. For example, among 958,265 people working in farming across England and Wales, the death rates per 100,000 men aged 25-35, 35-45, and 45-55 were 743, 805, and 1141. But for 22,301 London tailors, the rates were much higher: 958, 1,262, and 2,093. For 13,803 London printers, the numbers were even worse: 894, 1,747, and 2,367. This shows how dangerous these jobs really were.
