The general value form means that all kinds of work are seen as just human work in general, which is using human effort.

This form shows that all products made by work are just different versions of human work. It proves that in the world of things made to be sold, what makes all work special is that it is human work.

2. The Relative and Equivalent Forms of Value Grow Together

How developed the relative form of value is matches how developed the equivalent form is. But the second one only happens because the first one grows.

At first, one product’s value is shown by comparing it to just one other product. Then, the value of one product is shown by comparing it to many other products, which makes those other products seem like different types of equivalents. Finally, one product becomes the universal equivalent, meaning all other products show their value by comparing to it.

The two forms, relative and equivalent, are opposites and develop at the same time.

The first example, like saying 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, already shows this opposite, but it’s not clear yet. If you read it one way, linen’s value is shown by the coat. If you read it the other way, the coat’s value is shown by the linen. So, it’s hard to clearly see the difference.

Form B shows that only one product at a time can fully show its relative value, and it can only do this because all other products act as equivalents to it. Here, you can’t just flip the equation like before without changing its meaning.

Form C gives the world of products a general social value form because one product, like linen, becomes the universal equivalent. This means it can be traded directly for any other product, while other products cannot. The product that is the universal equivalent doesn’t have a relative value form. If it did, it would have to be its own equivalent, like 20 yards of linen = 20 yards of linen, which doesn’t show real value.

To show the value of the universal equivalent, you have to flip the form C. This product’s value is shown by an endless number of other products.

So, the expanded relative value form, or form B, is the special way the equivalent product shows its relative value.
