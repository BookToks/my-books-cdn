On the other hand, the type of thing being sold means the buyer can only use so much of it. The worker keeps the right to sell their work and wants to make the workday a set, normal length. So, there is a conflict where both sides have a right, and both rights are fair according to the rules of trading. When rights are equal, power decides who wins. That’s why in the history of capitalism, deciding how long a workday should be has always been a fight between the group of bosses (capitalists) and the group of workers.

Section 2: The Greed for Extra Work. Making workers do extra work is not something new. Whenever a group controls the tools or resources needed to work, workers—whether free or not—have to work extra time beyond what they need to survive. This extra work helps the owners of those tools get richer. These owners could be rich people from different times and places, like ancient Athens, Rome, or modern landlords and capitalists.

In societies where people mostly make things for their own use, extra work is limited by what people actually need. So, there wasn’t a big endless demand for extra work just because of how things were made. In ancient times, working too much was terrible mostly when people worked to get money or gold. Sometimes, people were forced to work themselves to death. But these were exceptions in the past.

As soon as people who worked as slaves or serfs got involved in big international markets controlled by capitalism, the terrible overwork of slaves mixed with the harshness of modern work. For example, in the southern U.S., slaves lived a somewhat family-like life as long as they mostly worked for local needs. But when cotton became important for export, slaves were worked so hard they might only live seven years. The goal wasn’t just to get useful things from them anymore—it was to get as much extra work as possible. The same happened with forced work, like the corvée, in places like Romania.

Comparing the greed for extra work in Romania’s corvée system with English factories is interesting because the extra work in corvée is very clear and separated.

Imagine a workday has 6 hours of needed work and 6 hours of extra work.

That means a free worker gives their boss 6 hours of extra work every day. It’s like working three days a week for themselves and three days for free for the boss. But this isn’t obvious because needed work and extra work mix together. You could say the worker spends half of every minute working for themselves and half for the boss.

It’s different with corvée work. The Wallachian peasant’s needed work for themselves is clearly separated from the extra work they do for their boss, the Boyard.
