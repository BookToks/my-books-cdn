The manufacturers made things worse by cutting wages by 10%. They did this to “celebrate” the start of the new Free-trade era. Then, when the workday was shortened to 11 hours, they cut wages again by 8 1/3%. When the workday was finally shortened to 10 hours, wages were cut by twice that amount. So, wherever they could, wages were lowered by at least 25%.

Because of this, factory workers started protesting to get rid of the Act of 1847. The manufacturers used lies, bribes, and threats to stop them, but it didn’t work. Some workers who signed petitions against the Act said their signatures were forced. They felt treated unfairly, but not because of the Factory Act.

Since the workers wouldn’t say what the manufacturers wanted, the manufacturers loudly complained in newspapers and Parliament, pretending to speak for the workers. They called Factory Inspectors cruel people who didn’t care about the workers. But this plan also failed.

Factory Inspector Leonard Horner and his team interviewed many workers in Lancashire factories. About 70% said they wanted to work 10 hours, fewer wanted 11 hours, and almost none wanted to work 12 hours.

Another trick was making adult men work 12 to 15 hours and then saying this showed what the workers really wanted. But Inspector Horner found most workers said they would rather work 10 hours for less pay. They only worked longer because they had no choice. If they refused, others would take their jobs, so they had to accept longer hours or lose work.

The manufacturers’ plan failed, and the Ten Hours’ Act started on May 1, 1848. But the failure of the Chartist party, whose leaders were jailed and organization broken, made workers lose faith in their own power.

Soon after, the June uprising in Paris was crushed violently. In England and Europe, all kinds of rulers and groups—landowners, capitalists, traders, government and opposition, priests and others—joined together to protect Property, Religion, Family, and Society. The working class was blamed and treated like criminals.

Manufacturers no longer held back. They openly fought against the Ten Hours’ Act and all laws since 1833 that tried to limit how much workers could be forced to work. It was like a small pro-slavery rebellion, lasting over two years and full of harsh attacks. The rich factory owners risked nothing except their workers’ safety.

To understand what happened next, remember that the Factory Acts of 1833, 1844, and 1847 were all in effect unless one changed the other. None of these laws limited the workday for male workers over 18, and since 1833 the working day was 15 hours starting at 5 am.
