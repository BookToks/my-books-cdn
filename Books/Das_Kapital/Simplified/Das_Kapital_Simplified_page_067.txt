The main job of money is to show how much things are worth by using one common thing to compare their values. This lets us measure value in a way that makes sense for everyone. Gold became money because it works really well for this.

It's not money that makes things comparable. Instead, all things are made by human work, so their values can be compared. Because of this, one special thing (like gold) can be used to measure the value of all other things, and that’s what money is. Money is just the way we show the value that’s already inside things, based on how much work went into them. Saying something like “1 ton of iron = 2 ounces of gold” tells us the price of iron in terms of money. We don’t need to compare iron to other things anymore because gold is now the standard money. This makes it easier to understand prices.

On the other hand, the many different prices of things are now how we show the value of money itself. If we look at price lists backwards, we can see how much money is worth in terms of other goods. But money itself doesn’t have a price. To say money has a price, we would have to compare money to money, which doesn’t make sense.

The price of things is different from their physical form; it’s more like an idea we understand in our minds. Even though we can’t see the value of iron or cloth, it’s real because we compare them to gold in our heads. Owners have to say the price out loud or put a tag on their stuff to show how much it’s worth. Since using gold to show value is just an idea, we can also use imaginary money for this.

Traders know that just saying the price or using imaginary money doesn’t mean they actually have real money. You don’t need real gold to guess the price of millions of pounds worth of goods. So, when money is used to measure value, it’s usually just imaginary money. This has caused some confusion, but even if the money is only imaginary when measuring value, the actual price depends on real money. The value of something, like a ton of iron, is shown by the amount of money that has the same amount of human work as the iron. If the money is gold, silver, or copper, the price of iron will be different depending on which metal is used.
