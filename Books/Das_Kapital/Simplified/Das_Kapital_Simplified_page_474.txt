People who have talked about how crowded the countryside is haven’t just worried about health problems. Even when they focused only on health, they often had to mention other issues too. They showed how grown-up men and women, married or not, often have to sleep packed together in tiny rooms. Their reports made it clear that in these conditions, privacy is almost impossible, and people’s behavior and morals can easily be hurt.

For example, in my last yearly report, Dr. Ord wrote about a fever outbreak in Wing, Buckinghamshire. He said a young man with fever slept in a room with nine other people at the start of his illness. Within two weeks, several of those people got sick too, and in a few weeks, five out of the nine had fever, and one died.

Dr. Harvey, from St. George’s Hospital, also visited Wing during the fever outbreak for private work. He told me about a young woman with fever who slept in a room with her parents, her child born out of wedlock, two brothers, and two sisters who each had their own child out of wedlock—10 people in total. A few weeks earlier, 13 people had slept there.

Dr. Hunter looked at 5,375 cottages of farm workers all over England. Out of these, 2,195 had only one bedroom (which was often also the living room), 2,930 had two bedrooms, and 250 had more than two. Here are some examples from about twelve counties.

In Bedfordshire, Wrestlingworth, the bedrooms were about 12 feet long and 10 feet wide, but many were even smaller. The tiny, one-story cottages were sometimes split by walls into two bedrooms, and often a bed was in the kitchen, which was only 5 feet 6 inches high. Rent was £3 a year. The tenants had to build their own toilets, as the landlord only provided a hole. Once someone made a toilet, everyone in the area used it.

One house owned by a family named Richardson was very strange. Its plaster walls bulged like a lady’s dress when she curtsies. One end of the house stuck out, and the other end curved inward. The chimney on the curved end looked like an elephant’s trunk made of clay and wood, and was held up by a long stick to stop it from falling. The door and window were oddly shaped like diamonds. Out of 17 houses visited, only 4 had more than one bedroom, and even those were crowded. The one-bedroom cottages often sheltered 3 adults and 3 children, or a married couple with 6 children, and so on.

In Dunton, rents were high, between £4 and £5, while men earned about 10 shillings a week. Families hoped to pay rent by making straw plaits together. The higher the rent, the more people had to work together to afford it. One place had six adults and four children all sleeping in one room and paying £3 10s. rent.

The cheapest house in Dunton was 15 feet long and 10 feet wide on the outside and cost £3 to rent. Only one house they looked at had two bedrooms. Outside the village, a house was so dirty that the tenants put dung against the side of the house. The bottom 9 inches of the door had rotted away. The door was just an opening closed at night by some bricks pushed up after shutting and covered with a mat. Half a window with glass and frame was completely broken.
