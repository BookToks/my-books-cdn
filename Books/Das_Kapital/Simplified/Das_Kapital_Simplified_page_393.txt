Sometimes, workshops hire way more workers than they actually need. This happens because they expect more work to come, but that work might never happen. Since workers get paid based on how much they produce, no one loses money if they don’t work all the time; the time lost is just counted as unpaid.

Most factory workers, about four out of five, get paid by the amount of work they do, not by the hour. For example, the speed of a spinning machine can be measured, and workers' pay goes down a bit as the machine gets better. But this doesn’t reduce their work exactly the same way the machine’s productivity grows.

When machines get faster, workers might earn more money for the same number of hours. However, they also have to spend some of that money to train younger workers and may replace some adult workers. This situation doesn’t really help increase wages.

In one case, a company introduced new machines that could make a lot more carpet with the same amount of work. The owners wanted to pay workers less per yard of carpet, so the workers would earn the same as before even though the machines made more. The workers didn’t get any share of the profits from the new machines, and they weren’t warned properly about the pay cut.

Trade unions try to keep wages high and want to benefit from better machines too. But asking for more money because machines make work faster is like trying to tax new technology, which some people don’t like.
