What makes this different from just buying and selling stuff is that buying and selling happen in the opposite order. But how can just switching the order change what’s really going on?

It’s even weirder because two out of the three people involved don’t see this switch at all. As a capitalist, I buy things from A and sell them to B. But as a regular owner, I sell to B first and then buy from A. A and B don’t notice any difference—they’re just buyers or sellers. When I deal with them, I’m just someone with money or stuff to sell or buy. For both A and B, I’m either a buyer or a seller, but not a capitalist or someone who’s doing anything special with money or goods.

For me, buying from A and selling to B are connected, but A doesn’t care about what I do with B, and B doesn’t care about what I do with A. If I tried to explain to them how I’m switching the order of buying and selling, they’d probably say I got it wrong. From their view, the whole thing starts with a sale and ends with a purchase. Actually, my first act (buying) looks like a sale to A, and my second act (selling) looks like a purchase to B. A and B might even say this whole thing is pointless magic and suggest they just trade directly with each other instead. That way, it would be a simple sale for A and a simple purchase for B.

So, switching the order doesn’t change the fact that this is just normal buying and selling. We need to see if this normal buying and selling can somehow increase value or create extra profit.

Let’s look at a simple case where two people just trade goods directly. This happens when they buy from each other, and at the end they owe each other the same amount, so it cancels out. Here, money is just a way to show the value of goods by their prices; it’s not actual cash changing hands. Both people can benefit because they trade things they don’t need for things they can use.

There might be even more benefit. For example, A sells wine and buys corn. A might make more wine with the same effort than B, who makes corn. So A can get more corn for the same value, and B can get more wine. This means both get more than if they tried to make both goods themselves. So, when it comes to use, trading helps both sides. But when it comes to value, it’s different. For example, if someone has lots of wine but no corn, and trades with someone who has lots of corn but no wine, they exchange goods of equal value.
