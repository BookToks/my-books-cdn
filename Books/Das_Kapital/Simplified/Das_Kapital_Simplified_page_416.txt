The growth of capitalism doesn’t just make life better in some ways; it also opens up lots of chances for people to get rich quickly through things like speculation and credit. Once capitalism reaches a certain point, spending a lot of money to show off wealth becomes necessary for business. Luxury becomes a normal business cost.

Capitalists get rich not by saving and working hard themselves, but by making others work hard and giving them little to enjoy. Even though capitalists spend a lot, they are still very careful with their money and always calculating how to keep making more. Their spending grows as they get richer, but they also feel torn between wanting to save more and wanting to enjoy their wealth.

Dr. Aikin wrote in 1795 about the history of trade in Manchester. First, manufacturers had to work really hard just to survive. They made money mainly by exploiting apprentices, who were paid very little while their parents paid high fees. Profits were low, so saving every penny was necessary.

They lived very frugally and didn’t even spend the interest they earned.

In the second period, they started to make small fortunes but still worked hard and lived simply. In the third period, they began to enjoy some luxury and pushed their trade by sending riders to get orders from towns all over the country. Around 1690, traders got enough money to start building nicer brick houses instead of wooden ones. Early in the 18th century, even offering a pint of foreign wine to guests was unusual and judged by neighbors. Before machines, manufacturers spent very little on socializing, like just a few pence for a drink or tobacco. It wasn’t until 1758 that business people started to own their own carriages.

The fourth period, the last 30 years of the 18th century, saw big increases in luxury supported by trade throughout Europe. One wonders what Dr. Aikin would think if he saw Manchester today.

The main rule was: keep accumulating! Industry makes the stuff, and saving turns it into capital. So, save as much as possible and keep turning profits back into business! This idea, “accumulation for accumulation’s sake,” shows the main goal of the capitalist class and they never fooled themselves about the hard work needed to create wealth. But it’s no use complaining when history demands it.
