If 30 shillings’ worth of value is inside 20 pounds of yarn, then 8/10 of that value, or the 24 shillings that make up its fixed part, is inside 8/10 of the yarn, which is 16 pounds. Out of those 16 pounds, 13 1/3 pounds represent the value of the raw cotton used (worth 20 shillings), and 2 2/3 pounds represent the 4 shillings' worth of spindle and other tools worn out during the process.

So, all the cotton used to spin the 20 pounds of yarn is shown by 13 1/3 pounds of yarn. This weight of yarn actually has only 13 1/3 pounds of cotton, worth 13 1/3 shillings. But the extra 6 2/3 shillings in value are like payment for the cotton used to make the other 6 2/3 pounds of yarn. It’s as if those 6 2/3 pounds of yarn had no cotton at all, and all the cotton was packed into the 13 1/3 pounds. However, that 13 1/3 pounds doesn’t include any value from the tools or the new value made during spinning.

Similarly, the 2 2/3 pounds of yarn that contain the 4 shillings of fixed capital only represent the value of the tools and materials used up to make the 20 pounds of yarn.

So here’s what we find: even though 8/10 of the yarn, or 16 pounds, is just as much a product of the spinner’s work as the rest, it doesn’t actually contain or show any of the labor done during spinning. It’s like the cotton turned into yarn all by itself, like a trick. When the capitalist sells it for 24 shillings and replaces the tools, it’s clear that this 16 pounds of yarn is just disguised cotton and worn-out spindle parts.

On the other hand, the remaining 2/10 of the yarn, or 4 pounds, represent only the new value of 6 shillings created during the 12 hours of spinning. All the value from the raw cotton and tools was “used up” in the first 16 pounds. So it’s like the spinner made 4 pounds of yarn out of thin air, or used cotton and spindles that were free gifts of nature and added no value.

Out of these 4 pounds of yarn, which hold all the new value made during spinning, half is payment for the labor used (3 shillings variable capital), and the other half is the extra profit (3 shillings surplus value).

Since 12 work hours equal 6 shillings, yarn worth 30 shillings must have 60 work hours in it. These work hours really exist in the 20 pounds of yarn: 48 hours are in the 16 pounds (the labor spent before spinning on making tools and preparing cotton), and 12 hours are in the 4 pounds (the labor done during spinning).

Earlier, we saw that the yarn’s value equals the new value made during production plus the value already in the tools and cotton.

Now, it’s shown how different parts of the product’s value, which work differently, can be shown by matching parts of the product itself.

Breaking the product down this way—into parts that show only the labor spent before production (constant capital), only the necessary labor during production (variable capital), and only the extra labor making profit (surplus value)—is very important and useful, as will be clear when dealing with harder problems later.
