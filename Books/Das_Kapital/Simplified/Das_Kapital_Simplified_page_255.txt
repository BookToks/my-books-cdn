When someone practices a single skill over and over, they can get really good at it, but they might become less useful in other areas.

Division of labor means breaking down jobs between different people. It starts with separating big jobs, like farming, making things, and selling them. Then, each of these big jobs is split into smaller parts. Finally, in factories and workshops, the actual work is divided into many small tasks done by different workers.

In societies that have developed a bit, we see three types of labor division: first, the general split between farmers, makers, and sellers; second, the specific types of work within those groups; and third, the detailed tasks inside crafts and factories.

Early humans didn’t start with families that grew into tribes. Instead, tribes formed first based on blood relations, and from these tribes, different family types eventually developed.

Sir James Steuart was one of the best economists to study this topic. His book came out ten years before Adam Smith’s “Wealth of Nations,” but not many people know about it. Even Malthus, famous for his work on population, used a lot of Steuart’s ideas without giving him credit.

James Mill said that having enough people living close together helps society grow because people can work together better. Thomas Hodgskin added that as more workers join in, society becomes more productive, especially when jobs are divided up.

After 1861, because more people wanted cotton, some parts of India grew more cotton instead of rice. This caused food shortages because the poor transport system made it hard to bring rice from other places.

In the 1600s, making shuttles (parts used in weaving) became a special job in Holland.

In England, different places became known for making different types of woolen cloth: fine cloth in Somersetshire, rough cloth in Yorkshire, and so on.

In big factories, the division of labor is very detailed. Many workers do different parts of the job, but they can’t all work in the same place because there are too many of them.
