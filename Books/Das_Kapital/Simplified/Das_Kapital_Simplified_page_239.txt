Manufacturing helps workers get really good at small, detailed tasks by breaking down jobs into tiny parts. It takes the different types of work people already do in society and pushes them to the extreme in workshops. In the past, jobs often stayed in families and were passed down from parent to child. Sometimes these jobs became set in stone, like castes or guilds, which are groups that keep jobs and skills within certain people. Castes and guilds come from the same natural process that creates different species of plants and animals, but in society, they become fixed rules about who does what job.

The muslins from Dakka and the colorful fabrics from Coromandel are some of the best ever made. But they were made without fancy tools, machines, or a division of labor like in Europe. The weaver worked alone, using a very simple loom made of wood, sometimes just sticks put together. Because the loom couldn’t roll up the fabric, it was very big and had to be used outside, where the weather could mess things up. The skills passed down from father to son helped these weavers become really good, kind of like how spiders know how to build webs. Even though the work is complicated, it’s still different from how factory workers do their jobs.

A craftsman who does many different steps to finish a product has to keep changing places and tools. Switching between tasks breaks up his work and creates little breaks in his day. But if he sticks to one single task all day, those breaks disappear and he works more smoothly. This makes him more productive because he either works harder or wastes less energy. Changing from resting to working uses extra energy, but once he gets into a rhythm, he can work longer at a steady pace. However, doing the same thing all day can get boring and tiring because people like some variety to stay interested.

How much work a person can do depends not just on their skill but also on their tools. Tools like knives, drills, and hammers can be used in many ways. But when jobs are split into tiny parts, tools have to change to fit each specific task better. This means tools become more specialized and designed for one particular job. Manufacturing is known for making tools that are different from one another, each shaped perfectly for its special use, and these tools work best when used by a worker trained in that one task.
