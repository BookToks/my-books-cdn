Dr. Julian Hunter wrote an important report about the homes of farm workers. He said that the cost of keeping a farm worker, called a "hind," is set at the lowest amount that lets them just survive. 

The wages and housing they get are not based on how much profit they bring to the farm. To farmers, these workers don’t really matter in their calculations. The workers’ basic needs are always seen as a fixed amount. 

If their income goes down, the workers don’t worry because they only have just enough to live on. They have reached the lowest point farmers consider. No matter what happens, they don’t share in good times or bad times.

In 1863, there was an official investigation into the food and work conditions of criminals sent away as punishment. The results were written in big government reports. The reports said that prisoners in England actually ate better than poor people in workhouses or free laborers in the country. 

Also, prisoners did about half the work that regular day laborers did. Some witnesses said: John Smith, the warden of Edinburgh prison, said the food in English prisons was better than what ordinary workers in England got. He also said farm workers in Scotland hardly ever got any meat. 

When asked why prisoners were fed better than regular workers, the answer was “definitely not.” Someone asked if they should try giving prisoners food closer to what free workers get, and the answer was yes. 

The farm worker might say, “I work hard but don’t get enough to eat, but in prison I didn’t work harder and had plenty to eat, so it’s better for me to be in prison than out here.” 

From the first report, I made a simple summary comparing all this information.
