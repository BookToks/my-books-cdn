Ireland

Let’s take a quick look at what happened in Ireland. 

In 1841, Ireland’s population was about 8.2 million. By 1851, it dropped to 6.6 million. Then in 1861, it went down to 5.85 million, and by 1866, it was around 5.5 million—almost the same as in 1801. This drop started during the famine in 1846. So, in less than 20 years, Ireland lost more than 5/16ths of its people.

Between May 1851 and July 1865, about 1.6 million people left Ireland. More than half a million left just between 1861 and 1865. The number of homes where people lived fell by almost 53,000 from 1851 to 1861. 

During that same time, farms between 15 and 30 acres increased by 61,000, and farms over 30 acres went up by 109,000. But the total number of all farms dropped by 120,000. This means smaller farms under 15 acres were disappearing because they were being combined into bigger ones.

Looking at animals, between 1860 and 1865, the number of horses, cattle, sheep, and pigs changed too. For example, horses decreased by about 72,000, cattle dropped by nearly 113,000, but sheep and pigs actually increased by about 147,000 and 29,000.

The population drop meant less food was produced overall. 

If we focus on 1861 to 1865, over half a million people left, and the population went down by more than 300,000. During this time, the number of horses and cattle fell a lot, but sheep and pigs went up.

Now, let’s look at farming, which provides food for both people and animals. The main crops grown were cereals like wheat, oats, barley, rye, beans, and peas. There were also green crops like potatoes, turnips, marigolds, beet-root, cabbages, carrots, parsnips, and vetches. The data shows how these crops increased or decreased each year compared to the year before.
