Making clothes happens in different ways. Some are made in factories where work is divided into small tasks. Others are made by small skilled workers who don’t work for people directly anymore, but for factories and warehouses. In some places, whole towns or areas focus on certain jobs, like making shoes. Finally, a lot of work is done by people working at home, connected to these factories and workshops.

The raw materials come from machines and big industries. Many workers come from people who lost other jobs because of machines and better farming. These small factories started because bosses wanted a ready group of workers to handle more orders quickly. Even so, these small workshops and home workers still made up the base of the clothing business.

The big profits in this work come mainly from paying workers very little, just enough so they can barely survive, and making them work as long as they can handle. It’s by paying so little and pushing workers so hard that markets kept growing, especially in England’s colonies, where English styles were popular. But soon, the old way of just working people really hard wasn’t enough to keep up with bigger markets and tougher competition. That’s when machines became important. The big change was the sewing machine, which affected many kinds of clothing work like dressmaking, tailoring, shoemaking, and hat-making.

At first, machines hurt the workers. Kids too young to work got kicked out. The pay for machine operators went up compared to people working at home, who were often very poor. Skilled workers who did jobs now done by machines earned less. The new machine workers were mostly girls and young women.

With machines, women and girls took over jobs that used to be done by men because machines made the work easier. They also replaced old women and little kids in lighter jobs.

The tough competition crushed the weakest workers. In London, more people died from starvation in the last 10 years as machine sewing spread. The new women workers used their hands and feet to run the machines, sometimes sitting, sometimes standing, depending on the machine. The work was hard and unhealthy because of long hours, even if those hours were often shorter than before. When sewing machines were put in small, crowded rooms, it made the bad working conditions even worse.

One person, Mr. Lord, said that entering these rooms with 30 to 40 machine workers was almost unbearable. The heat from gas stoves used to warm the irons made the rooms really uncomfortable.
