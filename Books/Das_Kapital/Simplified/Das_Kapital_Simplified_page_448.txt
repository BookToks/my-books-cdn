Manufacture here means all industries that are not farming. There is always a group of extra people who don’t have steady jobs, and these people keep moving to the towns. But for this to happen, there must be extra people in the countryside who don’t have enough work. These farm workers get paid very little and are always close to being very poor.

The third group of extra workers, called the stagnant group, is part of the working population but has very irregular jobs. This group gives businesses a large pool of workers they can hire and fire easily. Their living conditions are worse than most workers. They work the longest hours but get paid the least.

We often see this group in “home industries,” where people work from their houses. They come mostly from dying industries where handwork is being replaced by machines. This group grows as businesses grow and make more money. They keep growing because families with lower wages tend to have more children. This idea would seem strange to people not used to capitalist society. It’s like animals that reproduce a lot but are weak and hunted down. The poorest part of this group ends up in extreme poverty.

Besides criminals and people living dangerous lives, the very poor group has three kinds of people. First, those who can work but don’t have jobs. During economic crises, the number of poor people rises, and it falls when the economy improves. Second, orphans and poor children, who often join the workforce when times are good. Third, people who can’t work well anymore—like old people, sick people, those hurt by dangerous jobs, widows, or those who can’t adjust to new types of work. Poverty is like a hospital for struggling workers and a burden for those waiting for work. This poverty is part of the extra population that capitalism creates and depends on. Capitalism often shifts the costs of this poverty onto workers and lower middle-class people.

The richer society gets, and the more capital it has, the bigger this group of extra workers becomes. The same things that help businesses grow also increase the number of workers without steady jobs. So, the bigger the group of unemployed or underemployed workers compared to those with jobs, the greater the overall population of poor people, whose suffering is worse when they have less work to do.
