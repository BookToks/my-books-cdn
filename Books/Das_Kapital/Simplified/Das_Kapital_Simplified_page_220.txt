Besides the time a worker needs to work to cover their own needs, they can keep working for 2, 3, 4, 6 hours, or more. How much extra work they do and how long their workday is depends on this extra time. The time needed to cover their own needs stays the same, but the total workday can change.

Imagine a workday that lasts 12 hours. Out of those 12 hours, 10 hours are for the worker’s own needs, and 2 hours are extra work that benefits the boss. How can the extra work be increased without making the workday longer?

Even though the workday is fixed at 12 hours, the extra work time can be increased by starting it earlier. For example, if the extra work increases from 2 hours to 3 hours by moving the starting point one hour earlier, the total workday stays the same. But this means the time the worker spends on their own needs goes down from 10 hours to 9 hours. So, the extra work grows only if the worker spends less time on their own needs. The total workday doesn’t change; only how it’s divided changes.

Also, the length of the extra work depends on how long the workday is and how much it costs to keep the worker able to work. If one hour of work is worth sixpence, and a day’s work costs five shillings, the worker has to work 10 hours to cover their daily needs. If the workday is 12 hours, then 2 hours are extra work for the boss. It’s hard to see how this extra work can be more than 2 hours under these rules. 

The boss could pay the worker less, like four shillings and sixpence instead of five shillings. Then the worker would only need to work 9 hours to cover their needs, leaving 3 hours as extra work. This would make the boss’s profit bigger, but only by paying the worker less than what their work is really worth.
