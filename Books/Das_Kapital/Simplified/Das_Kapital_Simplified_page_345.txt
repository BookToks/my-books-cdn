A student of Ricardo responds to J. B. Say’s boring ideas by saying: “When work is divided a lot, a worker only knows how to do one specific job; he’s almost like a machine. So, it doesn’t help at all to just keep saying that things will balance out on their own. If you look around, you’ll see that things don’t balance for a long time, and when they do, the balance is always worse than when things started.”

MacCulloch, among others, is really good at pretending to be smart but says things that don’t make much sense. He says, “If it’s good to improve the worker’s skill so they can make more stuff with the same or less work, then it must also be good for them to use machines that help them do this better.”

A. Thiers said, “The person who invented the spinning machine ruined India, but that doesn’t really affect us.” However, he mixed up the spinning machine with the power-loom, which is a different thing, but he didn’t care much about that mistake.

According to the 1861 census, there were 246,613 people working in coal mines in England and Wales. Of those, 73,545 were under 20 years old, and 173,067 were over 20. Among the younger workers, 835 were between 5 and 10 years old, 30,701 between 10 and 15, and 42,010 between 15 and 19. There were also 319,222 people working in iron, copper, lead, tin, and other types of mines.

In 1861, in England and Wales, 60,807 people worked making machines, including bosses, clerks, and business people, but not those making small machines like sewing machines or machine parts like spindles. There were also 3,329 civil engineers.

Since iron is important, it’s worth noting that in 1861 there were 125,771 iron workers in England and Wales. Most were men (123,430), with 2,341 women. Of the men, 30,810 were under 20, and 92,620 were over 20.

At the end of the 1700s and start of the 1800s, a family of four adults and two children working as winders earned about £4 a week for working ten hours a day. If work was busy, they could earn more, but before that, they always had too little yarn to work with.

F. Engels talked about how bad the conditions were for many people making these luxury items. There are also many examples in the reports about children working.

In 1861, there were 94,665 sailors working in the merchant service in England and Wales.

Of these workers, 177,596 were males over 13 years old.

There were also 30,501 females working.

Of these, 137,447 were males. None of these were part of the 1,208,648 people who did not work in private homes.

Between 1861 and 1870, the number of male servants almost doubled, reaching 267,671. In 1847, there were 2,694 gamekeepers for landlords’ hunting areas, and by 1869, there were 4,921.

Young female servants in London’s lower-middle-class homes were often called “slaveys,” which was a common nickname.

Ganilh, on the other hand, believed that the factory system would end up with fewer workers, while more “respectable” people lived better and improved themselves.
