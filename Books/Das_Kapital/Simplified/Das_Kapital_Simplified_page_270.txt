Using machines just to make products cheaper has limits. The machine must take less work to make than the work it replaces. For the business owner, the limit is even smaller. They don’t pay for all the work, only for the worker’s ability to work. So, the owner’s use of machines depends on the difference between the machine’s value and the value of the work it replaces.

This difference changes in different countries, at different times, and in different industries. Sometimes workers get paid less than their work is worth, sometimes more. So, the gap between the machine’s price and the worker’s pay can change a lot, even if the actual work needed to make the machine and the work replaced by it stay the same.

But it’s the price difference that matters most to the owner because it affects how much it costs to make things and what they do in competition. That’s why some machines made in England are only used in North America, just like in the past when machines made in one country were used in another.

In old countries, machines in some industries create extra workers who aren’t needed in other industries. This can make wages drop below what workers need to live on, which stops owners from using machines because their profits come from paying less for work, not from less work being done. For example, in some wool factories in England, fewer children are used now because laws made kids work shorter hours, but parents wouldn’t accept lower pay for kids working less. So, machines replaced the “half-time” kids.

Before women and children under 10 were banned from mines, owners hired women and girls to work with men because it was allowed by their morals and business sense. They only started using machines after the law changed. In the U.S., a machine to break stones was invented, but England doesn’t use it because the workers who break stones get paid so little that machines would cost more.

In England, women sometimes pull canal boats instead of horses because the cost of keeping animals or machines is known, but the cost of keeping poor women is ignored. This shows how England wastes human work power on terrible jobs, even though it’s the land of machines.

Section 3: The Near Effects of Machines on Workers

Modern industry began with changing tools, and this change is most advanced in factories with machines. Before we look at how workers fit into this system, let’s think about how these changes affect the workers themselves.
