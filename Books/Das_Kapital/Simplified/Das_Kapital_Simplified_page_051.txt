Different types of work like farming, taking care of animals, spinning, weaving, and making clothes all create different products. These jobs are important social tasks because they happen within families. Families, just like societies that make goods to sell, naturally divide up the work. How the work is shared depends on things like age, gender, and natural changes like seasons. Each person’s work is just part of the total work done by the family. So, the time each person spends working shows how their work fits into the family’s social effort.

Now, imagine a group of free people who share their tools and work together. They use everyone’s work as a combined effort for the whole community. This is like Robinson Crusoe’s work, but instead of working alone, it’s social. Everything he made was just for himself, but in this community, what they make belongs to everyone. Some of what they produce is used to make more things, and some is used to live on. They need a way to divide the part used for living between everyone. How they share depends on how the community is organized and how developed it is. Let’s say each person’s share is based on how much time they work. This means work time has two roles: it helps keep the right balance between different kinds of work and community needs, and it shows how much each person contributes and gets back. In this system, how people relate to their work and what they get is simple and clear, both in making things and sharing them.

Religion reflects the real world. In a society where people trade goods and see their work as something to sell, Christianity—with its focus on the idea of “man” and especially its forms like Protestantism and Deism—is the religion that fits best. In old societies like ancient Asia, turning products into things to sell and turning people into sellers wasn’t very important at first. Trading nations back then were rare and scattered, like invisible gods or small groups living inside bigger communities. These old societies were simple and easy to understand compared to modern capitalist society. They were based either on people still being closely connected in tribes or on clear control by rulers. They could only exist when work and how people live were still simple and not very developed.
