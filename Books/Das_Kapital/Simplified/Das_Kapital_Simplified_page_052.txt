This narrow way of thinking shows up in old beliefs about Nature and other popular religions. The religious idea of the real world can only disappear when everyday life gives people clear and reasonable ways to relate to each other and to Nature.

Society’s life, based on making things, only loses its magical mystery when people work together freely and control production with a clear plan. But this needs society to have certain conditions, which come from a long and difficult process of development.

Economics has studied value and how it works, but it has never asked why work is shown by the value of its product or why the time spent working matches that value. These ideas clearly belong to a society where production controls people instead of people controlling production. People in this society see these ideas as natural and necessary, just like working itself. Because of this, older ways of producing things are treated like old religions were by the Church. Some economists get confused by the way products seem to have powers of their own, shown by arguments about Nature’s role in setting exchange value. But exchange value really just shows how much work went into something, so Nature doesn’t set it.

The way of producing things just to sell them is the most common and earliest form of modern production. It started early in history but wasn’t as dominant as today. Because of this, it’s easier to see how it can be misleading. But when we look at more detailed examples, this simplicity disappears. For example, why do people believe in the money system’s magic? Gold and silver, used as money, didn’t really represent social relationships between producers but were seen as natural objects with strange social powers. Modern economics thinks it’s better than the money system but shows similar mistakes when it talks about capital. For example, it took a long time for economists to stop thinking that rents come from the soil itself and not from society.

To stay on topic, here’s another example about commodities. If commodities could talk, they would say: Our usefulness is what people care about. That’s not really part of us as objects. What really belongs to us is our value. When we interact with each other, we only see each other as exchange values. Now listen to how economists describe this.

“Value” (which means exchange value) “is a property of things, but riches” (which means usefulness) “belong to people. Value always means exchanges, but riches don’t.” Usefulness is something people have, value is something things have.
