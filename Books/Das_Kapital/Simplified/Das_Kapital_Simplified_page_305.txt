Chapter 15 C. Modern Manufacture

Now, I will give a few examples to explain the ideas I talked about before. Actually, you might already know some from the chapter about working hours.

In Birmingham and nearby, in the hardware factories, about 30,000 children and young people work, mostly doing very hard jobs. There are also 10,000 women working there. You can find them in unhealthy places like brass factories, button factories, and places where things are coated or painted.

In some London printing companies that make newspapers and books, the workers, both adults and kids, work so hard that these places have gotten a bad nickname: “slaughterhouses.” The same kind of tough work happens in book-binding, where mostly women, girls, and children suffer. Young people also do heavy jobs in places like rope factories, salt mines at night, candle factories, and chemical plants. When silk weaving isn’t done by machines, young people have to work very hard turning the looms. 

One of the worst and dirtiest jobs, which pays very little and often uses women and young girls, is sorting rags. Great Britain is known for having lots of rags, not just from its own country but from all over the world.

Rags come from places like Japan, faraway parts of South America, and the Canary Islands. But most come from Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Egypt, Turkey, Belgium, and Holland. Rags are used for things like fertilizer, stuffing beds, making shoddy (a type of fabric), and making paper. People who sort rags often catch diseases like smallpox and spread them, and they usually get sick first.

A clear example of hard, wrong, and harmful work is coal mining and miners’ jobs, but also tile and brick making. In England, machines are hardly used in tile and brick making. From May to September, workers start at 5 in the morning and work until 8 at night. If the drying is outside, they may work from 4 in the morning until 9 at night. Working from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. is called “reduced” or “moderate” work. Boys and girls as young as 4 and 6 years old work the same long hours as adults. The work is tough, and the hot summer weather makes it even more tiring.

For example, in a tile factory at Mosley, a 24-year-old woman made 2,000 tiles a day with help from two little girls. These girls carried 10 tons of clay every day up slippery slopes from 30 feet underground and then walked 210 feet.

“It’s impossible for a child to work in a tile factory without becoming morally damaged. The bad language they hear from a young age and the dirty, rude habits they live with make them wild and careless as they grow up. Later, they often break rules and live badly. The way they live is a big problem.

Each skilled worker, called a moulder, is the leader of a group and provides food and a place to stay in his small cottage for seven workers. Whether they are family or not, men, boys, and girls all sleep in the same cottage, which usually has only two or three rooms on the ground floor and is badly aired. After a hard day’s work, these people are so tired that they don’t care about being clean or decent. Many cottages are very dirty and messy.

The worst part about this system is that young girls who work here are stuck from childhood to a life with rough, bad company. They grow up like rough boys before they even learn that they are women.”
