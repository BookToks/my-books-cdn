Even though lots of people want to work in baking, there are always more applicants than jobs. Most of these workers come from Scotland, the farming areas of western England, and Germany.

Between 1858 and 1860, bakers in Ireland paid for big meetings to protest working at night and on Sundays. People, like those at a Dublin meeting in May 1860, supported them with great enthusiasm. Because of this, some places like Wexford, Kilkenny, Clonmel, and Waterford managed to have bakers work only during the day.

But in Limerick, where bakers had many problems, the bosses, especially miller bakers, stopped the protests. This caused things to get worse in Ennis and Tipperary. In Cork, even though many people showed they cared, the bosses fired workers to break the protest. In Dublin, the bosses strongly fought against the bakers’ movement. They tried to stop the bakers from joining the protests and managed to make them accept working nights and Sundays, even if the bakers didn’t want to.

The English Government’s Committee, which is very powerful in Ireland, spoke to the bosses in Dublin, Limerick, and Cork in a serious but calm way. They said that working too many hours goes against natural laws and causes problems. They warned that forcing workers to work on Sundays and nights, even against their beliefs and the law, causes bad feelings between bosses and workers. This also hurts religion, morals, and society.

The Committee said working more than 12 hours a day harms workers’ home lives and stops them from doing their family duties as sons, brothers, husbands, and fathers. Working too long also damages their health, making them age faster and die sooner. This is bad for their families, who lose the support they need.

So far, this was about Ireland. In Scotland, farm workers complain about working 13 to 14 hours a day in terrible weather, plus 4 more hours on Sundays. At the same time, three railway workers—a guard, an engine driver, and a signalman—stood in front of a jury in London after a huge train accident killed many passengers.

The accident happened because the workers were too tired. They said they used to work only 8 hours a day about ten years before. But recently, their work hours had increased to 14, 18, and even 20 hours. During busy times with many holiday travelers, they sometimes worked 40 or 50 hours straight without a break. They were normal men, not monsters. Eventually, they got so exhausted that their brains stopped working properly, and they couldn’t see or think clearly.

The British jury found them guilty of manslaughter and sent them to court again. But they also hoped that the rich railway owners would hire more workers and be less greedy in making their workers work too much.
