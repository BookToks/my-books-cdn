The number of power-looms went down by 20,663, but since they made more products during the same time, it means the new looms worked better than the old ones. Also, the number of spindles went up by 1,612,541, while the number of workers dropped by 50,505. The “temporary” suffering of the workers caused by the cotton crisis got worse and became permanent because machines kept improving quickly.

But machines don’t just compete with workers and try to replace them. They are also used against workers by the bosses. Capitalists openly use machines as a way to control and stop strikes, which are protests by workers against the power of the bosses. According to Gaskell, the steam engine was always against human workers. It helped bosses ignore the demands of workers who threatened the new factory system. Since 1830, many inventions were made just to give bosses tools to fight workers’ protests. The most important of these was the self-acting mule, which started a new era of automatic machines.

Nasmyth, who invented the steam hammer, said in 1851 that new machines meant that mechanical workers didn’t have to work hard themselves anymore. Even boys could watch over the machines instead of doing the actual work. This meant skilled workers were no longer needed. Nasmyth used to employ four boys for every skilled worker, but thanks to new machines, he cut the number of grown men from 1,500 to 750. This made his profits go up a lot. Ure said about a machine used in printing that bosses finally found a way to get free from what they saw as unfair contracts with workers. Science helped bosses take back their control and be the ones in charge again.
