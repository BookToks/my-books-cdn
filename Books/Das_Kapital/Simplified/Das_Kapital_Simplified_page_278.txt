When machines made work last longer, society pushed back because people’s health and lives were at risk. This led to laws that set normal working hours. After that, something important happened: work started to get more intense.

Before, we only talked about making workers work longer hours to get more value. Now, we look at making the work harder and faster instead of just longer.

It’s obvious that as machines spread and workers get used to them, work gets faster and more intense. For example, in England, over fifty years, working days got longer and factory work got harder. But if workers do the same work every day without breaks, there’s a limit. You can’t keep making the day longer and work harder at the same time. If you work longer, you have to slow down. If you work harder, the day has to be shorter.

When workers fought and forced the government to shorten work hours, the bosses had to find new ways to make more money. They improved machines even more. This change meant workers had to produce more in less time. The value of each product went down because more was made with the same amount of effort.

When work hours got shorter, workers had to work harder during those hours. They had to use more energy and work with less rest. This made each hour of work more packed with effort. For example, one hour in a ten-hour day could be as much work as more than an hour in a twelve-hour day. So, even though the day was shorter, workers produced the same or more value in less time.

So how do workers work harder?

When the working day is shorter, workers naturally work more efficiently because they don’t get as tired. They put more energy into their work during that time.

Also, bosses make sure workers do more by the way they pay them.
