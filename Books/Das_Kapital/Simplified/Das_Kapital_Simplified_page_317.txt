As soon as kids get too old for simple jobs, usually around 17, they are kicked out of printing places. Many of them end up turning to crime. Attempts to find them other jobs fail because they lack skills, behave badly, and are often worn down mentally and physically.

Just like how work is split up inside factories, society also divides work among people. When most production was done by hand or small workshops, people had to focus on one specific task. This helped each job get better over time. New tools and materials slowly changed how work was done, but often tools stayed the same for generations.

In the past, different trades were secrets called “mysteries,” and only trained people could learn them. Modern industry changed all that by breaking down work into simple steps anyone could understand. This created the science of technology. Technology found out that all work uses a few basic types of movements, even if the tools look very different.

Modern industry never thinks a way of doing things is perfect or final. It uses machines, chemicals, and new methods to keep changing how work is done. This changes not only the tools but also what workers do and how work is organized in society. It moves lots of money and workers from one job to another all the time.

But even though modern industry needs workers to be flexible and able to do many jobs, capitalism keeps the old strict division of labor. This causes problems for workers, making their jobs unstable and unsafe. Sometimes machines or changes make workers useless. This creates a group of unemployed people, called an industrial reserve army, who are kept poor just so companies can hire them when needed. This causes a lot of suffering, wastes workers’ energy, and turns economic progress into social problems.
