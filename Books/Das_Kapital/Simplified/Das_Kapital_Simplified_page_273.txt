These gangs sometimes travel many miles from their own villages. You can see them morning and evening on the roads, wearing short skirts, coats, boots, and sometimes pants. They look very strong and healthy, but they have bad habits and don’t care about the harmful effects their risky lifestyle has on their children waiting at home.

Everything we see in factory towns happens here too, including hidden baby-killing and giving children drugs to keep them quiet. Dr. Simon, a health official, says that knowing about these problems makes him worry a lot about having many grown women working in factories. Mr. Baker, a factory inspector, says it would be great if no married woman with a family had to work in textile factories at all.

The moral damage from the way women and children are used by business owners has been written about a lot by F. Engels and others, so I don’t need to explain more here. But the mental damage caused by turning young kids into machines for making money is different from normal not-knowing. This damage hurts their ability to learn and grow naturally. Because of this, even the English government had to make basic education a rule for children under 14 working in factories.

However, the law about education is silly. It doesn’t have any real way to make sure kids actually learn. The law just says kids must spend some hours a week inside a school building. The employer gets a certificate signed by a teacher to prove this. But often, the teachers couldn’t even write their own names and just put a cross on the paper.

Once, someone visited a school and was shocked that the teacher was so ignorant. When asked if he could read, the teacher said, “A little!” and added, “At least I can read better than my students.” When inspectors checked schools during the 1844 law, they saw how bad the schools were but only managed to make a rule that from 1845, the teacher had to write the certificate by hand and sign their full name.
