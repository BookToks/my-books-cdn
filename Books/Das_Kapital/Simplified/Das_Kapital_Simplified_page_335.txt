In 1861, an investigation showed that many babies died because their mothers were too busy with work to take proper care of them. Sometimes, mothers didnâ€™t even seem to care much when their babies died, and in some cases, they even did things that caused their babies to die.

Dr. Henry Julian Hunter reported that a lot of babies were dying in some rural areas of England. This problem was serious and needed attention.

Both farm workers and factory workers, men and women, were increasingly using opium. Some drug sellers wanted to sell as much of it as possible because it was very popular. Babies who were given opium looked sick and old before their time, like tiny, shriveled-up old men. This was a sad way that countries like India and China got back at England.

Reports from factory inspectors between 1855 and 1862 showed many problems in factories, including the health and treatment of workers.

In places where factory laws had been in place for a while, they managed to overcome some problems with education for working children. But in industries without these laws, some employers still thought education was bad because it made workers too independent.

One factory owner said he preferred to hire married women, especially those with families, because they worked hard and were obedient. He said that the good qualities of women, like being caring and responsible, were used to keep them working hard and suffering.

Since machines were introduced, people had to work much harder than before. Early on, factory owners got cheap workers by taking orphans and poor children from workhouses and forcing them to work long hours. This made it easier for factory owners to make others follow their example and keep those long working hours.
