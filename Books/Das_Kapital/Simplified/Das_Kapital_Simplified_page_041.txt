The value of something is shown by the fact that a certain amount of one thing (B) can be traded for a certain amount of another thing (A). This means that the value of an item becomes clear when it is expressed as an exchange value. At the start of this chapter, we said that a commodity is both useful and has exchange value, but actually, that's not quite right. A commodity is either useful or valuable. It shows both sides only when its value is shown by exchanging it for a different kind of commodity.

Once we understand this, it's okay to use the shorter way of talking about commodities as both useful and valuable.

Our study shows that the way value is shown comes from what value really is. Value and how much it is don’t come from how it’s shown in exchanges. This is a mistake made by mercantilists and some modern free-trade supporters like Bastiat. Mercantilists focus on how value is shown by things being equal, especially with money. Free-traders focus on the numbers in exchange, like prices. For them, value only exists in how things are traded day to day. Macleod mixes ideas from both groups in his thinking.

Looking closely at how the value of A is shown by B, in the exchange, A is seen just as useful, while B shows the value part. Inside each commodity, there’s a difference between usefulness and value. This difference becomes clear when two commodities are compared: the one being valued is seen as just useful, and the one showing the value is just the exchange value. So, the simplest way to show value is how this difference between usefulness and value shows up.

All things made by work are useful, no matter the society. But only at a certain time in history does a useful thing become a commodity — when the work put into it shows as part of its value. So, the simplest form of value is also the first way a product becomes a commodity in history. As products slowly become commodities, the form of value also develops.

At first, the simple form of value is not perfect; it’s just a start that needs to change and grow before it can become a full price.

Showing the value of A in terms of B just separates value from usefulness and links A only to B in exchange. It doesn’t show how A compares in value to all other commodities. So, the simple relative value form only relates one commodity to one other as an equivalent.
