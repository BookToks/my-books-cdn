Generally, when living things grow bigger than the average size for their kind, it shows they are doing well. For humans, if something stops them from growing properly—like their health or where they live—they don’t grow as tall as they should.

In many European countries with mandatory military service, since it started, the average height and fitness of adult men have gone down. For example, before the French Revolution in 1789, soldiers had to be at least 165 cm tall. By 1818, the minimum dropped to 157 cm, and by 1832 it was 156 cm. Even then, more than half of French men were rejected from service because they were either too short or too weak. In Saxony, the minimum height was 178 cm in 1780 but dropped to 155 cm later. In Prussia, it was 157 cm. A report from 1862 said that out of 1,000 men called to serve, 716 couldn’t join because they were either too short or had health problems. In Berlin in 1858, they didn’t have enough recruits and were short by 156 men.

The history of the Factory Act of 1850 is talked about later in this chapter.

Here, I only mention a little about the time from the start of modern industry in England up to 1845. If you want to know more, you can read a book called “The Condition of the Working Class in England” by Friedrich Engels from 1845. Engels really understood how capitalism works and described it better than official reports that came out many years later. These official reports focused on industries where factory laws hadn’t been applied yet. So, things hadn’t changed much from what Engels described. Most of my examples come from after 1848, during a time when free trade was popular. Some people who supported free trade told amazing but often wrong stories about how great things were. England is the main country I talk about because it’s the classic example of capitalist production and has detailed official statistics.

There are also reports and suggestions from factory inspectors between 1856 and 1863 about how factories were working and how the laws were being followed or broken.

One shocking story shows how badly factory owners treated workers. In 1836, in Yorkshire, owners of eight big mills broke factory laws. They made five boys, aged 12 to 15, work almost nonstop—from 6 a.m. on Friday until 4 p.m. Saturday—with breaks only for meals and one hour to sleep at midnight. These kids worked for 30 hours straight in a place called the “shoddyhole,” where wool rags were torn apart. The air was full of dust and pieces of wool, so bad that even adults covered their mouths with handkerchiefs to protect their lungs.
