Since this idea applies to every owner, there isn’t actually any one thing that works as a universal measure for all goods. So, the values of goods don’t have a common way to be compared or measured. Because of this, goods don’t face each other as things to be traded, but just as useful items.  

At first, the owners of these goods act like Faust said, “In the beginning was the deed.” They do things before they fully understand them. They follow the natural rules of goods without realizing it. They can only compare the value of their goods by using some other good as a universal standard. But a single good can’t become this universal standard by itself; it has to happen through a social agreement.  

This social agreement makes one particular good the universal equivalent, meaning it represents the value of all other goods. That good then becomes the socially accepted universal equivalent. This special role turns that good into money. Money forms naturally because it’s needed to make trading easier, turning different products into things that can be compared and exchanged.  

As trading grows, the difference between how useful a good is and its value becomes clearer. People need a way to show this difference when they trade. This leads to the creation of money as a separate form of value. At the same time as products become tradeable goods, one special good becomes money.  

When two people trade directly, it looks like "x amount of good A equals y amount of good B." But at this point, they are trading the usefulness of the goods, not their value. The goods become tradeable only because of the trade itself. The first step for something to have exchange value is when its owner has more of it than they need right now.  

Objects exist outside people, so people can give them away or trade them. For this to work both ways, people must agree to treat each other as private owners of those objects and as independent individuals.  

But this kind of independence doesn’t exist in early societies where people share everything, like in family groups, ancient Indian communities, or the Inca State. So, trading goods first starts where these communities meet others. Once goods become tradeable outside the community, they also start being traded inside it.  

At first, how much goods are worth compared to each other is mostly random. They get traded because the owners want to trade them. Over time, people start needing things from outside their own group. Trading becomes normal and repeated. Eventually, some goods have to be made especially for trading.
