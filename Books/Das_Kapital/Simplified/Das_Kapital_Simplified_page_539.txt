What does its history really come down to? It’s not just about turning slaves and serfs into workers who get paid wages—that’s just a change in form. It actually means taking away the things that producers own, like private property that’s based on someone’s own work. Private property is the opposite of social or shared property, and it only exists when the tools and conditions for work belong to private people. But depending on whether these private owners do the work themselves or not, private property looks different.

There are many kinds of private property that fit between these two extremes. When a worker owns their own tools and land, that’s the basis of small businesses, whether farming, making things, or both. Small businesses are important for growing social production and letting workers be free individuals. This kind of small production also exists under slavery, serfdom, and other forms of control. But it really grows and shows its full power only when the worker owns and controls their own tools, like a farmer owning the land they work or a craftsman owning their tools.

This way of producing things requires dividing up land and spreading out tools. Because it stops big groups from working together or sharing labor, it keeps production small and isolated. It also stops society from using natural resources efficiently or developing big social production powers. This system works only in a limited, basic kind of society. Keeping it going, as Pecqueur said, would mean “universal mediocrity.” At a certain point, this system creates the tools that will destroy it.

When that happens, new ideas and energy grow in society, but the old social system holds them back. The old system has to be destroyed—and it is. This means turning many small, scattered properties into big, concentrated ones owned by few people. Most people lose their land, their way to survive, and their tools. This painful and harsh process is the beginning of capitalism’s history.

This involved a lot of force and cruelty, driven by selfish and ugly motives. Private property, which used to be owned by individual workers linked to their work, is replaced by capitalist property. This kind of property is based on using the work of others who are paid wages but don’t own what they work with. Once this change has broken down the old society completely, when workers become proletarians and their tools become capital, capitalism stands on its own. Then, the social way of working grows more, and land and tools become shared in new ways. The people who get taken from now aren’t workers working for themselves, but the capitalists who use many workers. This new taking over happens naturally through capitalism’s own rules, by concentrating wealth and power in fewer hands.
