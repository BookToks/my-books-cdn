The Proletarian, by selling his work for a certain amount of basic things needed to live, gives up any right to a share of what is made. How the products are owned stays the same as before; the deal doesn't change it. The product belongs only to the capitalist, who provided the materials and the basic needs. This is a strict result of the rule of ownership, which originally said that every worker has the exclusive right to what they make.

When workers get paid wages for their work, the capitalist owns not just the tools and materials but also the work itself. If wages are considered part of capital, which they usually are, it doesn't make sense to talk about labor separately from capital. So, the word capital includes both labor and capital together.

In English, there are two different words for two sides of work: in making useful things, it’s called Work; in creating value, it’s called Labour, in an economic sense.

These numbers are just random examples.

This is the main idea behind the Physiocrats’ belief that only farming creates real value, which is accepted by traditional economists.

“This way of putting the value of many things onto one item” (like adding the weaver’s living costs to the flax), “stacking several values on top of one value, makes that value bigger. The word ‘addition’ perfectly shows how the price of handmade goods is formed; this price is just the total of many values used up, added together; but adding is not the same as multiplying.”

Between 1844 and 1847, he took some of his money out of productive work to waste it on risky railway investments; also, during the American Civil War, he closed his factory and fired his workers to gamble on the Liverpool cotton market.

“Praise yourself, dress up and decorate yourself... but anyone who takes more or better than they give is charging unfairly, which isn’t service but hurting others, like stealing. Not everything called service actually helps others. For example, an adulterer may give pleasure, a horseman helps a thief rob people, and the church sometimes ‘helps’ by not killing everyone but only driving some out or taking their stuff. Even the devil helps his followers... In short, the world is full of so-called services and benefits.”

It’s easy to see what kind of “service” the idea of “service” must provide to economists like J. B. Say and F. Bastiat.

This is one reason why slave labor is such an expensive way to produce things.
