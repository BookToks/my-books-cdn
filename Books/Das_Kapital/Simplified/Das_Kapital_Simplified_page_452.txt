Between 1853 and 1864, the money made from profits kept growing faster and faster. For example, from 1853 to 1857, profits grew by 1.73% each year; from 1857 to 1861, they grew by 2.74% yearly; and from 1861 to 1864, profits grew by 9.30% yearly.  

The total income in the UK that was taxed in 1856 was about £307 million. By 1865, this had increased to about £385 million. At the same time, money and wealth were being collected and controlled by fewer people.  

Even though there were no official farming statistics in England (there were some in Ireland), some counties shared their data. Between 1851 and 1861, the number of small farms under 100 acres dropped from 31,583 to 26,597, meaning many small farms combined into bigger ones.  

From 1815 to 1825, no estates worth over £1 million were taxed after someone died. But between 1825 and 1855, eight such estates were taxed, and from 1856 to mid-1859, four more were taxed in just four and a half years.  

Looking at income from profits (not including farms) in 1864 and 1865, these incomes had to pay tax on anything over £60. In 1864, incomes taxed in England, Wales, and Scotland totaled about £95.8 million from 308,416 people. In 1865, it rose to about £105.4 million from 332,431 people.  

In 1855, the UK produced about 61.5 million tons of coal, worth £16.1 million. By 1864, coal production rose to nearly 92.8 million tons, worth £23.2 million. Pig iron production also increased from 3.2 million tons in 1855 to 4.8 million tons in 1864.  

In 1854, the UK had 8,054 miles of railroads with £286 million invested. By 1864, the railroads stretched 12,789 miles, with £426 million invested.  

In 1854, the total value of UK exports and imports was about £268 million. By 1865, this had almost doubled to about £490 million.  

For example, exports grew like this: £58.8 million in 1846, £63.6 million in 1849, £115.8 million in 1856, £135.8 million in 1860, £165.9 million in 1865, and £188.9 million in 1866.  

After seeing these numbers, it’s clear why the Registrar-General of the British people was excited. Even though the population was growing fast, the growth of industry and wealth was even faster.
