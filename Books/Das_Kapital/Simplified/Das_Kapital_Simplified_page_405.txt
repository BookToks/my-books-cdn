The article in The Times was just a joke. The “big public opinion” was actually just Mr. Potter’s view, that factory workers are like parts of a factory that can be moved around. They were stopped from leaving. They were stuck in the cotton areas, which acted like a “moral workhouse,” and they still made up the main workforce for the cotton factories in Lancashire.

Capitalist production naturally keeps workers separate from the things they need to work with. This keeps the system where workers get exploited.

It constantly forces workers to sell their ability to work just to survive, and lets the capitalist buy that work to make money. It’s not an accident that capitalists and workers meet as buyer and seller in the market. The system keeps pushing workers to sell their work over and over again, turning what they produce into a way for someone else to buy their work. In reality, workers already belong to the capitalists even before selling their work. Their economic slavery is created and hidden by the fact that they sell themselves repeatedly, change bosses, and face changes in how much their labor is worth. Capitalist production, as a continuous process, creates not only goods and profits but also the relationship between capitalist and worker.

The rich, who use other people’s work, can only get what they want by trading for it. Even though they spend their saved-up wealth on new things, it might seem like they will run out of money since they don’t work and can’t work. You might think their wealth would shrink every day until they have nothing left to trade with the workers who work just for them. But in society, wealth has learned to grow by using other people’s work without needing the owners to do anything. Wealth, like work, produces extra value every year, and this extra value can be used up without the rich getting poorer. This extra value is the income that comes from capital.

Wages and profits are both parts of the finished product. The part that goes to the worker is called wages. When capital is used to pay workers in advance, it doesn’t add anything extra to the resources needed to support labor. Only less than one-fourth of the workers in the world have their wages advanced by capitalists.
