It quickly understood that changes in how much people want and how much is available affect the price of labor, just like with other things you buy and sell. These changes cause the price to go up and down around an average. When demand and supply are equal, the price stops moving, assuming nothing else changes. But then, demand and supply don’t really explain the price anymore. The price of labor at that balance point is its natural price, which doesn’t depend on demand and supply.

If you look at the price changes over a longer time, like a year, the ups and downs even out, leaving an average price that stays pretty steady. This average price must be decided by something else, not just the ups and downs. This price, which is always more important than the temporary market prices, is called the “natural price” of labor. Like other things, this price is actually the value of labor shown in money.

Economics tried to see past the changing prices of labor to find the real value of labor. Like other goods, this value was thought to come from how much it costs to produce. But what does it mean to produce labor? Or more exactly, what does it cost to produce the worker? This question replaced the original one and ended up going in circles. What economists call the value of labor is actually the value of the worker’s ability to work, which is very different from the actual work done, just like a machine is different from the work it does.

Economists focused on the difference between the market price of labor and its supposed value, and how this value relates to profits and the value of things made by labor. But they never realized that their analysis led them not just from market prices to value, but from value to the value of the ability to work. Classical economics never fully understood this result. It accepted ideas like “value of labor” and “natural price of labor” as final and correct, which caused a lot of confusion later on. Meanwhile, it gave simple-minded economists a solid base to work from, even though they only cared about what’s obvious on the surface.

Now, let’s look at how the value and price of the ability to work show up as wages.

We know the daily value of labor-power is based on how long a worker’s life and workday last. Say the normal workday is 12 hours, and the daily value of labor-power is 3 shillings (3s.), which represents 6 hours of work. If the worker gets 3s., that means they’re paid for the value of their ability to work for 12 hours. If this value is called the value of a day’s labor, then the formula is: 12 hours of labor is worth 3s.

The value of labor-power sets the value of labor, or in money terms, its necessary price. If the price of labor-power is different from its value, then the price of labor is also different from its value.

Since the value of labor really means the value of labor-power, it has to be less than the value the labor actually creates. That’s because the capitalist always makes the worker work longer than needed to cover the value of their labor-power.

In the example above, the value of labor-power that works for 12 hours is 3s., but only 6 hours of work are needed to make that value.
