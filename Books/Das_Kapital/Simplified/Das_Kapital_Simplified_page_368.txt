Section 2: Working day Constant. Productiveness of Labour Constant. Intensity of Labour Variable

When you work harder during the same amount of time, you use more effort in that time. So, if you work harder during a day, you make more stuff than if you worked less hard, even though the working hours are the same.

If workers get better at making things, they also make more stuff in the same time. But when that happens, each thing is worth less because it took less work to make it. If you just work harder without getting better, the value of each thing stays the same because it still takes the same effort to make each one.

So, working harder means more products without lowering their price, so the total value of everything made goes up. But getting better at work spreads the same value across more products, so each is worth less.

If you keep the working day the same length, working harder means you create more value, and if money’s value doesn’t change, you make more money.

How much value you create depends on how much harder you work compared to normal. A normal 12-hour day might create 6 shillings worth of value, but if you work harder, it could be 7 or 8 shillings.

If the value you create goes from 6 to 8 shillings, both the worker’s pay and the extra profit can go up at the same time, either by the same amount or different amounts.

For example, both could go from 3 shillings to 4 shillings. But this doesn’t always mean workers get paid more than their worth. Sometimes their pay goes up but the real value of their work goes down because they’re more worn out.

Usually, changes in how fast or well workers make things don’t change how much their work is worth unless the products they make are things workers need themselves.

But if the change is in how long or how hard they work, the value they create changes no matter what they are making.

If everyone in the whole economy started working harder at the same time, that harder work would become the new normal and wouldn’t be noticed as extra anymore.

But different countries work at different speeds and efforts, so the value of a day’s work can be different in each country. A harder working day in one country means more money than a less hard working day in another.

Length of the Working day Variable

The working day can change in length—it can be longer or shorter.

From what we know, the longer the working day, the more value is made. So, the value created depends on how long the working day is, not a fixed amount.
