When people work more than the normal hours, that extra time is called overtime, and they usually get paid more for it. But sometimes, the extra pay is very small. The regular working day is actually just a part of the total time people spend working, which is often longer all year round.

In some British industries, the low pay during regular hours forces workers to do overtime if they want to earn enough money. Laws that limit working hours stop this from happening. It’s well known that the longer people work in any job, the lower their wages usually are.

A factory inspector named A. Redgrave showed that between 1839 and 1859, wages went up in factories with a 10-hour workday but went down in factories where people worked 14 to 15 hours a day. This shows that if the pay per hour is low, workers have to work longer hours just to make a decent wage. Low pay makes employers want to make people work longer.

When workers have to work longer, their hourly pay often drops, which means their daily or weekly wages also go down.

The price of labor depends on how many hours people work in a day. If the workday gets longer without extra pay, the hourly pay goes down. Employers can make workers work longer and also lower their official pay. For example, if one person can do the work of one and a half or two people, it seems like there are more workers available, even if the total number of workers hasn’t changed. This competition between workers lets employers lower wages even more, and lower wages let employers make workers work even longer.

But when some employers get too much unpaid extra work from their workers, they start competing with each other. Part of the price of a product comes from the workers’ pay. The unpaid extra work doesn’t have to be included in the product’s price and can be passed on to the buyer. This is the first step in competition.

The second step is that employers try to sell products at even lower prices by not paying workers for some of their extra work. This causes prices to drop, which leads to low wages and very long working hours becoming normal. This idea is just introduced here because the full explanation of competition is beyond this part.

Still, employers sometimes admit that because of competition, they have to do things they don’t like as bosses, but they don’t make more money, and the public benefits instead. For example, in London, some bakers sold bread at full price while others sold it below the normal price, showing how competition works.
