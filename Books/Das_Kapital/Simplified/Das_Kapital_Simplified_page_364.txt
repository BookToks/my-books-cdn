‘Strange optical illusion to see everywhere a state of things which as yet exists only exceptionally on our earth. But let us finish’ ‒ should be deleted and the following sentence substituted: “Mr. Mill is good enough to believe that this state of things is not an absolute necessity, even in that economic system in which ‘labourers and capitalists are separate classes.’” The substance of this note has been taken from the Volksausgabe. The quotation from Mill is from his Principles of Political Economy, Book II, Chap XV, 5.
