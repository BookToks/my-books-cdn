This is true in most parts of Ireland, except for some areas in Ulster; in the south, like Cork, Limerick, and Kilkenny; in the east, like Wicklow and Wexford; in the middle of Ireland, like King’s and Queen’s County and Dublin; and in the west, like Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo, and Galway.

An inspector says, “The huts where farm workers live are a shame for this country and don’t match its Christian or modern values.” To make these tiny homes less attractive, the land that comes with them has been taken away over time.

Because landlords and their agents treat the workers like outcasts, the workers feel angry and unhappy. The first big change in farming was to get rid of the huts right on the fields where people worked. This happened everywhere, almost like someone ordered it.

So many farm workers had to move to villages and towns. There, they lived in tiny, dirty places like attic rooms, basements, and cramped corners in the worst neighborhoods. Thousands of Irish families, known even by English people for loving their homes and being happy and close-knit, suddenly found themselves living in places full of crime and bad influences. 

The men had to look for work with nearby farmers, but they were only hired by the day. This meant their jobs were very unstable. They often had to travel long distances, get wet in bad weather, and face lots of hard times, which sometimes led to sickness and poverty.

Every year, towns had to take in what was called “extra” farm workers. Still, people wonder why there are too many workers in towns and villages but not enough in some country areas. The truth is, workers are only really needed during busy times like harvest or spring planting. For the rest of the year, many have no work at all. From October, after the main potato harvest, until early spring, there’s almost no work. Even when jobs are available, the workdays are often short or interrupted.

These problems come from the farming changes—like turning fields into pastures, using machines, and cutting down on workers. Things got worse because some landlords, who live on their big estates in Ireland instead of spending money elsewhere, get their workers mostly from their small tenants. These tenants have to work for the landlords when asked, often for less pay than usual and even if it means they can’t take care of their own farms during important times like planting or harvesting.

The uncertainty and irregular hours, plus long times with no work, show that there are more workers than jobs available. These problems are often mentioned in reports about poor people’s conditions and are a big struggle for farm workers.
