The history of the cotton famine is really important, so it’s worth talking about for a bit. In 1860 and 1861, the cotton famine actually happened at just the right time for the manufacturers, and it even helped them in some ways. This was said by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, and also by important people in Parliament like Palmerston and Derby. Later events showed they were right.

In 1861, there were 2,887 cotton mills in the UK, and many of them were small. A report by Mr. A. Redgrave said that out of 2,109 mills in his area, 392 (or 19%) used less than ten horse-power each, 345 (16%) used between 10 and 20 horse-power, and 1,372 used more than 20 horse-power. Most of the small mills were weaving sheds built after 1858 when business was good. These were often set up by speculators—one person gave the yarn, another the machines, another the buildings—and were run by people who used to be overseers or who didn’t have much money. Most of these small manufacturers went out of business. They would have failed anyway during the economic crisis that the cotton famine helped delay.

Even though these small manufacturers made up one-third of all manufacturers, their mills used only a small part of the money invested in the cotton business. In October 1862, about 60.3% of the spindles and 58% of the looms were stopped across the cotton trade. This number would be different in different places. Very few mills worked full time (60 hours a week), and most worked only sometimes. Even when mills worked full time and paid by how much was made, workers earned less because good cotton was replaced by lower-quality cotton. For example, Sea Island cotton was replaced by Egyptian cotton, American and Egyptian cotton were replaced by Surat cotton, and sometimes waste was mixed in.

Surat cotton had shorter fibers and was dirtier, making the thread weaker. This, along with other changes, slowed down the machines and meant one weaver could manage fewer looms. It also caused more machine problems and lowered pay because less product was made. When Surat cotton was used, workers lost 20%, 30%, or more of their pay even if they worked full time. On top of that, most manufacturers cut pay rates by 5%, 7.5%, or 10%. So, workers who only worked 3 to 4 days a week or just 6 hours a day had a really tough time.

Even in 1863, when things got a bit better, spinners and weavers only earned 3 shillings 4 pence, 3 shillings 10 pence, 4 shillings 6 pence, or 5 shillings 1 pence a week. Despite how bad things were, factory owners kept finding ways to cut wages more. Sometimes they punished workers for problems caused by the bad cotton or the wrong machines. Also, if the factory owner owned the workers’ houses, they took rent money right out of the low wages.

Mr. Redgrave said that self-acting minders (workers who managed machines called self-acting mules) earned about 8 shillings 11 pence for two weeks of full work. But from that, rent was deducted. The factory owners gave back half the rent as a gift, so the minders took home 6 shillings 11 pence. In many places, self-acting minders earned between 5 shillings and 7 shillings.
