In Fingringhoe, a small area of 3,443 acres, there were 145 houses in 1851, but only 110 in 1861. Even though there were fewer houses, people didn’t want to leave. They actually managed to live in more crowded spaces. In 1851, 252 people lived in 61 houses, but by 1861, 262 people were packed into just 49 houses. In Basilden, 157 people lived in 35 houses on 1,827 acres in 1851. Ten years later, 180 people lived in only 27 houses. 

In the parishes of Fingringhoe, South Fambridge, Widford, Basilden, and Ramsden Crags, 1,392 people lived in 316 houses on 8,449 acres in 1851. By 1861, on the same land, 1,473 people lived in 249 houses.

Herefordshire, a small county, suffered a lot from people being forced out of their homes. In Nadby, cottages were crowded and usually had only 2 bedrooms. Most belonged to farmers who rented them cheaply for £3 or £4 a year. The workers there got paid about 9 shillings a week.

In Huntingdon, Hartford had 87 houses in 1851, but soon after, 19 cottages were destroyed in this small area of 1,720 acres. The population dropped from 452 in 1831, to 382 in 1852, and then 341 in 1861. Fourteen cottages, each with just one bedroom, were checked. In one, a married couple, their 3 grown-up sons, 1 grown-up daughter, and 4 kids lived—10 people in total. In another, 3 adults and 6 children lived together. One room where 8 people slept was about 13 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 7 feet high. This meant each person had only about 130 cubic feet of space. 

Most cottages didn’t have gardens, but many people farmed small plots of land far from their homes, paying 10 or 12 shillings per rood (a small area). The houses had no toilets, so families either had to use the allotments to get rid of waste or use a drawer-like closet that was emptied weekly. Life here was much less clean and decent than in places like Japan.

In Lincolnshire, in Langtoft, a man lived with his wife, her mother, and 5 children in a small house called Wright’s house. It had a front kitchen, a scullery, and one bedroom above the kitchen. The bedroom was tiny and shaped like a sugar-loaf roof with a small window. 

He didn’t live here because of the garden—it was very small. The rent was high, about 1 shilling and 3 pence per week. It wasn’t close to his job either; he had to walk 6 miles each way every day, a total of 12 miles. He lived there simply because it was the only place he could rent, no matter the price or condition.

Here are the details for 12 houses in Langtoft: each had 1 bedroom, and together they housed 38 adults and 36 children. The number of people per house ranged from 4 to 9.
