After two years, the bosses finally won a big court case in England. On February 8, 1850, the Court of Exchequer said that even though the bosses were clearly breaking the 1844 law, the way the law was written made it useless. This decision basically ended the Ten Hours’ Act.

Before this, many factory owners were scared to use a system called the relay system for young workers and women, but now they started using it fully. However, after this win for the bosses, the workers fought back. In places like Lancashire and Yorkshire, they held angry meetings to protest. They said the Ten Hours’ Act was fake and the government was cheating. Factory inspectors warned the government that the fight between bosses and workers was getting really intense.

Even some factory owners complained that the law was confusing and unfair. Different places had different rules, and some bosses could get around the law more easily than others. In big towns, bosses could avoid the rules, but in the countryside, it was hard to find enough workers to switch between factories.

The main goal for bosses was to make sure all of them could exploit workers equally.

Because of all this, the bosses and workers made a deal that became a new law on August 5, 1850. The workday for young people and women was set at 10½ hours from Monday to Friday, and 7½ hours on Saturday. Work had to happen between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., with at least 1½ hours for meal breaks all at the same time, following the 1844 rules. This deal ended the relay system for good. But the 1844 law still controlled child labor.

One group of bosses, the silk makers, got special treatment again. In 1833, they had threatened that if kids weren’t allowed to work 10 hours a day, their business would shut down. They said it was impossible to find enough kids over 13 to work. This excuse was later proven to be a lie. Still, for 10 years, they made kids work 10 hours a day spinning silk, sometimes sitting on stools to do their jobs.

The 1844 law stopped them from making kids under 11 work more than 6½ hours a day, but it let them make kids aged 11 to 13 work 10 hours a day. It also let these kids skip the schooling that other factory kids had to go to. The reason given was that the delicate silk fabric needed light, careful hands, which kids could learn only by starting work early.

Kids were treated badly for the sake of the silk, just like animals were used in some places only for their skin or fat. Finally, in 1850, this special right was limited only to certain silk jobs like twisting and winding silk.
