If we know how many times all the coins of one type are used, we can figure out how many times on average a single coin is used, or how fast money moves around. The amount of money put into use each day depends on the total prices of all the goods being sold. But once money starts moving, the coins affect each other. If some coins are used faster, others slow down or stop moving at all, because only a certain amount of money can be used to match the total prices of goods. So, if coins are used more often, fewer coins are needed. If coins are used less often, more coins are needed.

Since the amount of money needed depends on how fast money moves, if you want to take some coins out of use, you can just add the same amount in paper money. Bankers know this trick well.

Money moving around reflects how goods are bought and sold. How fast money moves shows how quickly goods change hands and how fast new goods replace old ones. When money moves quickly, buying and selling happen smoothly and together. When money slows down, buying and selling get separated and the exchange of goods slows down.

The way money moves doesn’t explain why things slow down; it just shows it’s happening. People often think money slows down because there isn’t enough money available. But the amount of money needed depends on the total prices of goods and how fast goods are bought and sold. How fast money moves shows how many prices one coin can cover. The total prices depend on how many goods there are and their prices. These three things—prices, number of goods, and speed of money—can all change.

So, the total prices and how much money is needed change based on how these three factors change together. We will only look at the most important changes in prices.

If prices stay the same, the amount of money in use can go up if there are more goods or if money moves slower, or both. But the amount of money can go down if there are fewer goods or if money moves faster.

If prices go up, the amount of money can stay the same if the number of goods goes down by the same amount, or if money moves faster at the same rate prices go up and the number of goods stays the same.
