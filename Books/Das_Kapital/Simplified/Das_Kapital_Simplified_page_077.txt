When one person sells and buys something, these are two very different actions. A product is useless if it can’t be sold and turned back into money. In other words, if the owner can’t sell it and someone with money can’t buy it, the product has no value. Selling and buying are connected, but they also create a break or pause in the life of the product. The first time a product is sold and bought, it’s a separate process. The buyer gets the product, and the seller gets money, which is like another product ready to be sold again. No one can sell unless someone else buys, but no one has to buy right after selling.

Circulation of goods breaks the limits that bartering has, like restrictions on time, place, and people. It does this by splitting the single action of trading directly into two opposite actions: selling and buying. Saying these two actions are really one means that their opposite nature is actually part of the same thing. If too much time passes between selling and buying, problems can happen, causing a crisis. The differences between how useful a product is and how much it’s worth, the conflicts between personal work and social work, and the way things and people are represented all come up during these opposite stages of a product’s life. These conflicts can lead to crises, but only if certain conditions, which don’t exist yet in simple trading, develop over time.

The way money works in buying and selling things is a cycle. A product starts the process and ends it as a product. The product moves in a circle. But money doesn’t move in a circle. Instead, it keeps moving farther and farther from where it started. If the seller holds onto their money after selling, the product’s process is only halfway done. When they buy something with that money, the money leaves their hands again. For example, if a weaver sells linen and buys a Bible, the money goes to the Bible seller. If the weaver sells more linen later, money comes back to them, but only because the whole trading process starts again with new products. So, money moves continuously from one owner to another. This movement of money is called its currency.
