Linen shows it has value because a coat can be traded for it without changing what the coat actually is. Saying the coat can be directly exchanged for linen means the linen has value too. So, when we say a commodity is in the equivalent form, it means it can be directly traded for other things.

When one thing, like a coat, is the equivalent of another, like linen, it means coats can be traded for linen. But this doesn’t tell us exactly how many coats equal how much linen. The amount depends on the value of the coat, which is based on how much work it took to make it. Whether the coat or the linen is the equivalent, the coat’s value depends on the labor time needed to produce it. But when the coat is the equivalent, its value doesn’t have a clear number—it just represents a certain amount of the other item.

For example, 40 yards of linen might be worth 2 coats. Since the coat is the equivalent here, it shows the value of the linen. Two coats can show how much the linen is worth, but they can’t show their own value. Some people, like Bailey, got confused and thought value was just about numbers, but when a commodity is the equivalent, its exact value isn’t shown.

The first interesting thing about the equivalent form is that the usefulness of an item shows its value. The physical form of the commodity becomes how its value is shown. But this only happens when one commodity relates to another in value. A commodity can’t be the equivalent of itself, so it has to pick another commodity to represent its value.

To explain this, think about weight. A sugar loaf has weight, but you can’t see or touch the weight directly. So, to measure it, we use pieces of iron that have a known weight. The iron doesn’t show weight by itself, just like the sugar loaf doesn’t. But by comparing the sugar loaf to the iron, the iron shows the sugar’s weight. This only works because both have weight. When they are balanced on scales, they have the same weight if the amounts match.

Just like iron shows weight when compared to sugar, in value terms, a coat shows value when compared to linen.
