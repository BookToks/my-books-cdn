When things are going badly, the cottages that are left show, by being broken down and in bad shape, that they are going to disappear completely.

You can see these cottages falling apart bit by bit. As long as the roof still stays up, the worker can rent it and is often happy to do so, even if the place isn’t nice. But no one fixes or improves the cottage, except for what the poor people living there can do themselves. When the cottage finally becomes too bad to live in—even by the lowest standards—it just becomes another destroyed home, and the costs for helping poor people go down a bit.

Big landowners avoid paying for poor people’s support by making workers leave their land. The workers then have to move to the nearest town or village—but “nearest” can mean three or four miles away from the farm where they work every day. This means they have to walk six to eight miles daily just to earn money. If their wife and kids work on the farm too, they face the same hard walk. But that’s not all. In the village, people who buy land build the cheapest, smallest, worst houses they can. These poor workers end up packed into these awful homes that are almost as bad as the worst city slums.

Even when workers live on the land they farm, their homes are usually very poor, no matter how rich the estate owner is. Some landlords think any nasty little shack is good enough for their workers and still charge them as much rent as possible. These homes might be just one broken room, with no proper fire place, no toilet, no open window, no clean water except from a ditch, and no garden. The worker has no way to fight this unfair treatment. Laws that are supposed to protect them don’t really work because they depend on the landlords who rent out these awful places.

To be fair, there are better examples sometimes, but most of the facts show how bad life really is for workers in England. It’s sad that even though many homes are in terrible shape, the biggest problem is that there aren’t enough homes at all. For years, people who care about health and good living conditions have been worried about how crowded these workers’ homes are. Reporters have said again and again that this crowding makes it almost impossible to stop the spread of diseases. They have also warned that living so close together helps not only contagious diseases but also other kinds of illnesses to start and spread.
