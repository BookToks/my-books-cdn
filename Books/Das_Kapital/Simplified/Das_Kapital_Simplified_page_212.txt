The Factory Acts gave workers control over their own time. This gave them the strength and motivation to eventually gain political power.

The Factory Inspectors, in a careful and slightly ironic way, suggest that the law also helps the boss. It stops him from being as harsh because he is just a symbol of money. The law even gives the boss some time to enjoy culture.

Before, the boss only cared about making money, and the worker only had time for hard work.
