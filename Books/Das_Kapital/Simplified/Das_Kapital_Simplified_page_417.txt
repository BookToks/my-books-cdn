In classical economics, workers are seen as machines that produce extra value, while capitalists are just machines that turn this extra value into more money. Political Economy takes the role of the capitalist very seriously. Around 1820, Malthus suggested dividing jobs so that capitalists focus on saving money, while landlords, politicians, and clergy focus on spending it. He said it’s important to separate the desire to spend from the desire to save.

Capitalists, who liked to enjoy life, were upset by this idea. One supporter of Ricardo said Malthus was encouraging high rents and heavy taxes to keep people working hard for the rich consumers. They wanted more and more production, but they thought forcing some people to work while others did nothing was unfair. Still, they believed workers’ wages should be kept low to keep them working hard. They openly admitted that making workers work without paying them enough was how extra value was made.

When workers ask for more pay, it just means they want to keep more of what they make and give less to their bosses. Some said this would cause overproduction because workers would buy less. But others said overproduction just means big profits for capitalists. The argument about how to split the money taken from workers stopped when the revolution of July happened. Soon after, workers in Lyon rang the alarm for revolution, and English farm workers started burning barns and crops.

In England, Owenism started to grow, while in France, St. Simonism and Fourierism became popular. This was the time of simple, everyday economics. A year before Nassau W. Senior said that profit comes from the last hour of work, he made another claim. He said he was replacing the idea of capital as a tool with the idea of “abstinence” – meaning not spending money now.

Senior gave an example: when a savage makes bows, he works hard but doesn’t practice abstinence. This shows that in early societies, tools were made without capitalists having to save money. He said that as society advances, more abstinence is needed – meaning more saving by those who take the fruits of other people’s work.
