“39 “Also,” our writer continues, “they usually drink water or cheap drinks, so they don’t spend much money....

These things are very hard to do, but not impossible, because they have been done in France and Holland.” Forty years later, an American trickster named Benjamin Thompson (also called Count Rumford) tried the same idea to help people, making both God and people happy.

His “Essays” are like a cookbook with recipes to replace the usual expensive food workers eat. One good recipe from this smart guy is: “5 pounds of barley meal for 7½ pence; 5 pounds of corn for 6¼ pence; 3 pence worth of red herring, 1 pence salt, 1 pence vinegar, 2 pence pepper and herbs, all costing 20¾ pence; make soup for 64 men. At normal prices for barley and corn, this soup costs only a quarter of a penny for a 20-ounce serving.” But as capitalism grew, food became mixed with cheap stuff, so Thompson’s idea wasn’t needed anymore.

At the end of the 1700s and early 1800s, English farmers and landowners forced workers to accept very low wages. They paid less than the minimum wage and gave the rest as help from the parish (local government). Here’s a funny example of how they set wages: “The Norfolk landowners had dinner when they decided wages; the Berks landowners thought workers shouldn’t eat when they set wages at Speenhamland in 1795. They decided a man should make 3 shillings a week when bread costs 1 shilling for a big loaf, and wages would go up or down as bread prices changed.” 

Before a government inquiry in 1814, a big farmer and judge named A. Bennett was asked if workers got part of their daily pay from poor relief. He said yes, every family’s weekly pay was made enough to buy a big loaf of bread plus 3 pence per person for clothes. If the parish gave clothes, the 3 pence was taken away. This system was common in Wiltshire and probably the whole country.

A writer back then said, “For years, farmers have treated workers badly by making them rely on workhouses. While farmers made more money, workers couldn’t save anything.” Today, we know that taking money away from workers’ basic needs helps build up capital and profits. More facts about this will come later.

Even though tools and machines (constant capital) must be enough for a certain number of workers based on the size of the business, they don’t always grow at the same rate as the number of workers.”
