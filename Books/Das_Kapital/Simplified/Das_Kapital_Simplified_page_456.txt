There is an important health issue to think about here. People really hate going without food, and usually, having very little food happens only after they’ve already gone without other things.

Long before not having enough food becomes a health problem, long before scientists start measuring exactly what people eat to avoid starvation, the household will already be missing basic comforts. There will be less clothing and fuel than food. People won’t have enough protection against bad weather. Homes will be crowded, which can cause or spread diseases. There will be very few household things like furniture or utensils. Even staying clean will be hard or expensive, and trying to keep clean will make people feel even hungrier. The home will be in the cheapest areas, where there is little or no sanitation, poor drainage, bad garbage removal, dirty water, and if in a city, little light and fresh air.

These are the health risks that poverty almost always brings when it means not having enough food. And while these problems are very serious, just not having enough food is also a big deal. These thoughts are especially sad because this kind of poverty isn’t because people are lazy. It happens to people who work hard. In fact, many workers spend very long hours just to earn the small amount of food they can get. But even then, their work only partly supports them. For many, this small support just delays falling into deep poverty.

There is a strong link between the hunger of the hardest-working people and the huge, wasteful spending of the rich, which is based on the way capitalism works. This connection becomes clear when you understand economics. When it comes to poor people’s housing, everyone can see that the more factories and businesses grow, the more workers have to live crowded together in small spaces. So, the faster capitalism grows, the worse the homes of workers become. When cities “improve” by tearing down bad neighborhoods to build fancy banks, warehouses, wider streets, and tramways, the poor are pushed into even worse, more crowded places. Also, the more expensive homes are, the worse they usually are. Landlords make big profits from these poor living conditions, even more than from gold mines.

The conflict between capitalism and poor people’s lives is so clear that even official reports in England criticize “property and its rights.” As industry grows, as cities get richer and “better,” the problems get worse. The fear of contagious diseases, which can affect even respectable people, led to 10 laws about sanitation between 1847 and 1864. Some cities like Liverpool and Glasgow took strong action to protect people.

Still, Dr. Simon said in his 1865 report: “In general, these problems are not controlled in England.”
