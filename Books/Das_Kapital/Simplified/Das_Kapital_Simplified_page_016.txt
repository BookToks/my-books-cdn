Afterword to the French Edition (1875)

Mr. J. Roy tried really hard to make a version that was as exact and word-for-word as possible, and he did a great job. But because he was so careful, I had to change some parts to make it easier for readers to understand. These changes were made little by little as the book came out in pieces, so the style doesn’t always feel smooth.

Since I started fixing the text, I also worked on the original German version. I made some arguments simpler, added more details, and included extra historical and statistical information, as well as some new ideas. So, even if this French edition isn’t perfect in how it’s written, it has its own important scientific value and is worth reading, even for people who know German.

Below, I include parts from the Afterword to the second German edition that talk about how Political Economy developed in Germany and the method used in this book.
