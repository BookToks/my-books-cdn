When people buy and use things, it helps them survive and keep living. At the same time, by using up what they need, they make sure workers come back to the job market again and again. In the past, Roman slaves were kept by chains, but today, workers are tied to their employers by invisible rules. Workers look like they are free because they can change jobs and sign contracts, but they are still controlled.

Long ago, businesses used laws to control workers when needed. For example, until 1815 in England, machine workers were not allowed to leave the country, and there were harsh punishments if they tried.

Workers pass down their skills from one generation to the next. Capitalists know this skilled group is important for making money. When a crisis happens, they show how much they depend on these workers. For example, during the American Civil War, many cotton workers in England lost their jobs. People asked the government or others to help these workers move to other countries like the United States. Then, a letter appeared in The Times from Edmund Potter, a big business leader. The letter made it clear how much owners felt they controlled the workers.

The letter said that there are too many cotton workers and that their number should be cut by a third so the rest can have jobs. It said the owners don’t want workers to leave because they need them, but if public money is used to help workers move away, owners should get a say. Potter explained how important the cotton industry is, how it brought many people from Ireland and farms to work, and how big it was for England’s exports. He believed the cotton trade would grow again soon, especially with new markets like India.

He asked if it’s worth keeping the cotton business and the workers who run the machines. He said workers aren’t owned by the masters, but they are the real strength because their skills take a long time to replace. The machines could be replaced or fixed quickly, but good workers cannot. If workers leave, the business would lose value, and owners would struggle with having only less skilled workers. Even if workers want to leave, Potter thought that was natural but still a problem for the owners.
