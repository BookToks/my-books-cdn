There are more workers than the amount of jobs that need extra labor, but this extra group is made up of people who don’t live long, grow up too fast, and are replaced quickly. Capitalism, which is a new system in history, has taken control of people’s energy and health very quickly. It’s clear that the working class is getting weaker, but this is slowed down because new, healthier people come from the countryside. Still, even those country workers, who get fresh air and are naturally stronger, are starting to die off.

Capitalists don’t care much about the suffering of the many workers around them. They act like the destruction of people’s health and even the possibility of the human race dying out doesn’t bother them, just like how people don’t worry about the earth crashing into the sun. Everyone in risky business knows a crash will happen eventually, but they hope it will hurt someone else after they’ve made money. The phrase “After me, the flood” sums up how capitalists think. Because of this, capitalists don’t care about how long workers live or how healthy they are unless society forces them to.

When people complain about workers getting sick, dying young, or being overworked, capitalists say: “Why should we care if it makes us more money?” But this isn’t just about individual capitalists being mean. The competition between businesses forces all of them to act this way. The rules about how long people should work didn’t come easily; they were fought for over hundreds of years.

For example, in England, old laws from the 14th to 18th centuries tried to make people work longer hours. But newer laws in the 19th century made the workday shorter. When capitalism first started, it forced people to work just enough extra hours to make a profit, using help from the government. But as capitalism grew, workers had to sell almost all their time and energy to survive, which took centuries.

So, it makes sense that a few hundred years ago, the government forced workers to work longer hours. But by the 19th century, the government started limiting work hours to stop children from being overworked and exploited. What is now the legal limit for kids working in places like Massachusetts was once the normal full workday for strong adult workers in England in the 1600s.

The first big law about workers (from 1349) happened after the plague killed many people. This made it hard for employers to find workers willing to work for low wages, which they needed to make a profit. But even though the law was created because of the plague, the struggle over workers’ rights and wages lasted for hundreds of years after.
