Price shows how much one thing (like a ton of iron) is worth by saying how much of something else (like an ounce of gold) it can be traded for. But it doesn’t mean that iron can always be traded straight for gold. For something to really work as money, it has to change from being just iron into actual gold, even though this change might be hard, like a lobster shedding its shell or a person changing old habits.

Even if we imagine iron as gold when thinking about price, iron can’t be both iron and gold at the same time. To set a price, imagining is enough, but to actually use it as money, iron must be swapped for real gold. If someone owning iron tries to prove it’s already money by showing its price, the other person would ask if they actually have gold in their pocket. So, a price means a thing can be traded for money and also must be traded for money. Gold only works as a perfect way to measure value because it has already become money through trading. Behind the idea of measuring value, real money is hiding.

Section 2: The Medium of Circulation

A. The Metamorphosis of Commodities

We learned before that trading things involves some problems that don’t easily fit together. Making some things into money doesn’t solve these problems but creates a way for them to exist side by side. This kind of balance is how real contradictions often get fixed. For example, it’s weird to say something is always falling toward something else and always flying away at the same time, but an ellipse is a shape that makes this possible.

Trading is a process where things that don’t have use value to one person become useful to another. It’s like a social flow of stuff. One kind of work’s product replaces another’s. When something finds a place where it’s useful, it stops being traded and starts being used. But right now, we only care about the trading part. So, we need to look at trading from a basic view, focusing on how things change form during trade.

Understanding this change isn’t easy. One reason is that every time things change form, it’s because two things are traded: a regular product and money (like gold). If we only think about the fact that something was traded for gold, we miss the important part — what actually happened to the form of the thing being traded.
