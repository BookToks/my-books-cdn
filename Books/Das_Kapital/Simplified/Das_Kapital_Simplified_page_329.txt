When people take elements from the soil to make food and clothes but don’t return them back to the soil, it messes up the soil’s ability to stay fertile forever. This harms both the health of workers in the city and the mind and life of workers in the countryside.

Even though this breaks the natural way things should flow, it also forces us to fix this system and find a way to keep it working for everyone as humans grow and develop. In farming and factories, when production is controlled by money and capital, it often means the workers suffer. Tools that should help workers end up controlling and exploiting them. The way work is organized can crush a worker’s freedom and independence. When rural workers are spread out over big areas, they can’t fight back as well, while city workers, who are more concentrated, have more power. In both modern farming and city industries, getting more work done often comes at the cost of workers’ health and strength.

Also, all progress in capitalist farming means not only stealing from workers but also stealing from the soil. When we make the soil more fertile for a short time, it often ruins it for the future. The faster a country grows with modern industry—like the United States—the faster this destruction happens. So, capitalist production improves technology and combines different processes, but it does this by harming the two main sources of wealth: the soil and the workers.

John Stuart Mill should have said, “any person not fed by other people’s work,” because machines have actually helped create many people who live comfortably without working.

For example, Hutton wrote about mathematics, and Wilhelm Schulz explained the difference between tools and machines. Tools like spades and hammers are powered by people, but machines like ploughs pulled by animals or windmills are different.

Before the 18th century, spinning machines already existed, probably first in Italy. A full history of technology would show how inventions grow from many people’s work, not just one person’s idea. Darwin studied how plants and animals’ body parts help them survive, which is like nature’s technology.

Shouldn’t we also study how human tools and machines, which form the basis of all social life, were made? This study might be easier because, as Vico said, humans made history, unlike natural history which happened on its own. Technology shows how people work with nature to live and reveals how they organize society and think. Any history of religion that ignores this is not fully thoughtful. It’s actually easier to study the real, material roots of religion than to try to guess how religious ideas came from real life. The only true scientific way is to start from real life and work up to ideas, not the other way around. The limits of materialism in natural science show up when scientists ignore history and social processes and only focus on their own field.
