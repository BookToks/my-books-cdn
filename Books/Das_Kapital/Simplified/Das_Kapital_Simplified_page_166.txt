For example, farmers have to weed a big piece of land, which takes twice as much time, especially in cornfields. The official workday for some farm jobs can be understood to last from May all the way to October. In Moldavia, the work is even tougher.

Someone once said that the 12 days of forced work in the law actually feel like working every day of the year. If the law in the Danubian provinces showed how greedy landowners were for extra work, the English Factory Acts showed the opposite. These laws tried to stop bosses from making workers work endlessly by limiting their work hours. This was done by the government, which was controlled by rich bosses and landowners.

Besides workers fighting for better conditions, the need to limit factory work was also because overworking was ruining both the land and the people. Just like using too much fertilizer hurt the soil, pushing people too hard at work damaged the country's strength. This is clear from sickness outbreaks and weaker armies in Germany and France.

The Factory Act of 1850, still used in 1867, set the workday to 10 hours on average. For the first five days, workers could work 12 hours from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., with half an hour for breakfast and one hour for lunch, which left 10 and a half hours of actual work. On Saturdays, they worked 8 hours from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., with half an hour for breakfast, so 7 and a half hours of work. This made a total of 60 working hours a week. Special officials called Factory Inspectors watched over these laws and reported every six months to Parliament, showing how bosses still tried to get extra work from employees.

Let’s hear from the Factory Inspectors for a moment. They said that some dishonest factory owners started work 15 minutes before 6 a.m. and finished 15 minutes after 6 p.m. They also cut time from breaks, taking 5 minutes at the start and end of breakfast and 10 minutes at the start and end of lunch. On Saturdays, they worked 15 minutes after 2 p.m.

This added up to extra work like this:

Before 6 a.m.: 15 minutes  
After 6 p.m.: 15 minutes  
Breakfast time: 10 minutes  
Lunch time: 20 minutes  
Total on weekdays: 60 minutes per day × 5 days = 300 minutes  
Saturday before 6 a.m.: 15 minutes  
Breakfast time: 10 minutes  
After 2 p.m.: 15 minutes  
Total on Saturday: 40 minutes

All together, that’s 340 extra minutes a week, or 5 hours and 40 minutes. Over 50 working weeks in a year (allowing for holidays), this means workers did the same work as 27 extra days.

Even just five extra minutes a day adds up to two and a half more days of work in a year.
