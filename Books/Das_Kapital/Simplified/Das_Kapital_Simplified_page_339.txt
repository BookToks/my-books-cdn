In Lancashire, the number of mills grew slowly at first. Between 1839 and 1850, it went up by only 4%. Then, from 1850 to 1856, it increased by 19%. Between 1856 and 1862, it rose by 33%. 

Even though more people worked in these mills over time, the number of workers compared to the size of the mills actually went down. 

Lancashire is mostly known for its cotton trade. This trade is huge there. Out of all the textile factories in the UK, 45.2% are in Lancashire. The area has 83.3% of all the spindles, 81.4% of the power-looms, and 72.6% of the mechanical horse-power. Also, 58.2% of all the workers in textile factories work in Lancashire. 

This shows just how important cotton is to the areaâ€™s industry.
