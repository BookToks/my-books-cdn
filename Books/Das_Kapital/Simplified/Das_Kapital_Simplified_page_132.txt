Let’s look at how making something creates value.

The value of a product depends on how much work goes into making it. This means the time and effort needed to make it, considering how things are usually done in society. This idea also works for what our business owner gets from the work done for them. Let’s say the product is 10 pounds of yarn. First, we need to figure out how much work is in that yarn.

To spin the yarn, you need raw materials. Here, that’s 10 pounds of cotton. We don’t need to check the cotton’s value right now because the business owner has already paid the fair price for it, which is ten shillings. This price already includes the average work needed to grow and prepare the cotton. Also, let’s say the spindle, a tool used for spinning, loses value worth 2 shillings because it gets worn out. If it takes 24 hours (or two working days) to earn twelve shillings, then the yarn already includes two days of work.

Don’t get confused just because the cotton changes form or because the spindle wears down. According to the general rule of value, if 40 pounds of yarn is worth the same as 40 pounds of cotton plus one whole spindle, it means the same amount of work went into making both. So, 10 pounds of yarn is equal in value to 10 pounds of cotton plus one-fourth of a spindle. In our case, the same amount of work is in the yarn as in the cotton and part of the spindle together.

So, it doesn’t matter if the value is in cotton, the spindle, or yarn—the amount of value stays the same. The spindle and cotton don’t just sit there separately; they come together, change shape, and become yarn. But this doesn’t change their value any more than if they were simply traded for the same amount of yarn.

The work needed to make the cotton, which is the yarn’s raw material, is part of the work needed to make the yarn. The same is true for the work put into the spindle, which is needed to spin the cotton.

When figuring out the yarn’s value or how much work it took, all the steps done at different times and places—first to make the cotton and the spindle, then to spin the yarn—can be seen as different parts of one big process. All the work in the yarn is past work. It doesn’t matter if these steps happened a long time ago or just recently. For example, if it takes 30 days to build a house, the total work in the house doesn’t change just because the last day of work happens after 29 days. So, the work in the raw materials and tools can be treated like work done earlier in the spinning process, before spinning actually started.

The value of the tools and raw materials, like the cotton and spindle, which is shown in the price of twelve shillings, is part of the total value of the yarn or the product.
