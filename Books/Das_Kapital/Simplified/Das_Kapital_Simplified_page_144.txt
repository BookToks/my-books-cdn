Whether the price of cotton goes up from one shilling to two shillings, or drops to sixpence, a worker always keeps only half as much value in one hour of work as in two hours. Similarly, if the worker’s productivity changes, he will spin more or less cotton in one hour than before, and the value he keeps in one hour’s work will change too. But either way, two hours of work will always have twice the value of one hour.

Value only exists in useful things, in objects. We don’t count the symbols or tokens that represent value. (People, as workers, are living things with power to work, and their work shows this power.) If something loses its usefulness, it also loses its value. Production tools don’t lose their value when they lose usefulness because they change their form of usefulness during the work process and become part of a new product. It doesn’t matter what exact object holds the value, as long as it has some use. During work, tools give their value to the product only when they lose both their usefulness and their value.

They only pass on to the product the value they lose as tools.

But not all parts of the work process act the same way.

Coal burned under a boiler disappears completely, as does the grease on wheel axles. Dyes and other helpers also disappear but become part of the product’s qualities. Raw materials make up the product itself but change their form. So, raw materials and helpers lose their original form during work. Tools, machines, workshops, and containers are different. They only work as long as they keep their shape and are ready to be used again each day. While they are working, they keep their shape separate from the product, and even after they stop working, they remain separate from the product.

If we look at a tool during its entire working life, from when it starts being used until it’s thrown away, we see that its usefulness is fully used up, and its value is fully passed on to the products it helped make. For example, a spinning machine that lasts 10 years gradually gives all its value to the products made in those 10 years. A tool’s life is like a person’s life. Every day a person gets closer to death, but we can’t tell exactly how many days are left just by looking. Still, life insurance companies use averages to make pretty good guesses.

It’s the same with tools. We know from experience how long a machine usually lasts. If a tool lasts six days, it loses one-sixth of its usefulness each day and gives one-sixth of its value to the daily product. The daily wear and tear of tools, and the value they pass on to products, are calculated this way.
