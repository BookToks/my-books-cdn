In 1867, a special group was set up to study how children, young people, and women worked in farming. They wrote some very important reports. People have tried to use factory laws, with some changes, to farming, but these attempts have failed so far. The main point here is that there is a strong push to apply these laws everywhere.

If factory rules are spread to all kinds of jobs to protect workers’ minds and bodies, this will also speed up the change from many small businesses to a few big ones. This means more money and power will be controlled by big factories. It will get rid of old and in-between types of work and make the control of money more obvious. This also means more people will directly fight against this control. In each small workshop, rules bring order and efficiency, but overall, they make the problems of capitalist work worse, like harder work and machines competing with workers. When small home businesses disappear, it removes the last backup for unemployed people and the only safety valve for society. By making production bigger and more social, it also creates the conflicts of capitalism and sets the stage for a new society to replace the old one.

Modern industry is changing farming and the lives of farm workers, which we will look at more later. For now, some results can be shared. Using machines in farming doesn’t hurt workers physically like factory work does, but machines replace workers faster and face less resistance. For example, in areas like Cambridge and Suffolk, the amount of farm land grew a lot in 20 years, but the number of farm workers went down, not just compared to the population but in total numbers. In the United States, machines help farmers work bigger areas but don’t yet push workers out completely. In 1861, over a thousand people made farm machines in England and Wales, and just a bit more workers used these machines and steam engines on farms.

In farming, modern industry changes things more deeply than in other areas because it gets rid of the small farmer, who was a strong part of old society, and replaces them with workers who get paid wages. This makes social conflicts and desires for change just as strong in the countryside as in the cities. Old, outdated farming ways are replaced by scientific methods. Big business breaks the old connection between farming and making things by hand. But it also creates the conditions for a better future where farming and industry work together in new ways after being separate for a while. Capitalist production brings more people into big cities, making cities more important in society. But it also harms the natural cycle between people and the land.
