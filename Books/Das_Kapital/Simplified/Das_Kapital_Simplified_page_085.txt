Chapter 3 A. Hoarding

When things are sold and bought over and over again, money keeps moving around like it never stops. But if the buying and selling stop, money stops moving too. It changes from being something you can use and spend into something that just sits there, like saved-up cash.

From the very beginning, people wanted to hold on to the money they got from selling stuff. They didn’t just sell things to buy other things but to keep the money itself. So money stopped being just a way to buy and sell and became something people wanted to keep. When money is saved like this, the person holding it becomes a hoarder.

At first, only extra things people didn’t really need were turned into money. Gold and silver became symbols of wealth. In some places, like parts of Asia, people kept their money hidden away instead of spending it. For example, in India, people buried huge amounts of silver for safekeeping. From 1602 to 1734, about 150 million pounds of silver were buried there, much of which originally came from America and Europe. Later, England sent a lot of silver to India and China, and most of the silver sent to China eventually went to India.

As more goods were made and sold, producers needed to keep buying things to meet their needs, even if they hadn’t yet sold their own stuff. To buy without selling first, they had to have sold before without buying. This sounds confusing, but precious metals like gold and silver helped make it possible. These metals were traded for goods directly, sometimes with sales happening without immediate purchases. Over time, this led to piles of gold and silver being saved up by different people.

Because people could save value as gold, the desire for gold grew stronger. As trade grew, money became more powerful because it was a social form of wealth that anyone could use. Columbus once said gold was amazing because whoever had it could get anything they wanted—even souls into Paradise! Since gold hides where it came from, anything could be turned into gold. Everything could be bought or sold. The whole system of buying and selling became like a huge machine that turns everything into gold. Even things considered very sacred couldn’t avoid being sold for gold. Just as money makes all products seem the same, it also removes all differences between people who have it.
