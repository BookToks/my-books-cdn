Back in 1349, England made a law called the Statute of Labourers. It was meant to control workers and keep their wages low. France made a similar law in 1350. Both countries wanted to stop workers from demanding higher pay. These laws said workers couldn’t be paid more than a set amount. If they were, both the workers and employers could be punished, but workers got punished more.

Later, in 1360, the punishments got worse. Employers could even punish workers physically if they didn’t work for the set wages. Workers weren’t allowed to join together to ask for better pay. This was illegal from the 14th century all the way until 1825 when laws against unions were finally removed. The government set a maximum wage but never a minimum wage.

By the 1500s, workers were worse off. Even though their wages went up a bit, prices for things they needed went up more, so they were really earning less. The old laws to keep wages low were still in place. Some harsh punishments, like cutting ears or branding people who couldn’t find work, were still used. In the time of Queen Elizabeth I, local officials could set wages depending on the season and prices. Later kings added more rules for other types of workers like weavers and spinners.

Even when factories became common and the economy changed, these old wage laws stayed around. For example, in the 1700s, there were still laws that set limits on how much tailors or silk-weavers could be paid. It took a long time for courts to decide if these rules applied to non-farm workers too. In 1799, some laws still controlled the wages of Scottish miners.

By 1796, things were starting to change. In the English government, where for centuries they had only made laws to keep wages low, someone named Whitbread suggested setting a legal minimum wage for farm workers. Another leader, Pitt, didn’t like this idea but admitted that poor people were living in very tough conditions.
