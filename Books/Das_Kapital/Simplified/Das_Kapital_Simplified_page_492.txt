Hatmaking jobs went down from 15,957 in 1851 to 13,814 in 1861. Straw-hat and bonnet-making also dropped, from 20,393 to 18,176 in the same years.

Malting stayed about the same, with 10,566 in 1851 and 10,677 in 1861. Chandlery jobs fell a bit, from 4,949 to 4,686, mostly because more people started using gas for lighting instead of candles. Comb-making dropped from 2,038 to 1,478. Sawyers, who work with wood, went up a little, from 30,552 to 31,647, thanks to more sawing machines. Nailmaking went down from 26,940 to 26,130 because machines took over some work. Tin and copper mining went up slightly, from 31,360 to 32,041.

On the other hand, cotton-spinning and weaving jobs increased a lot, from 371,777 to 456,646. Coal mining also grew, from 183,389 to 246,613. The biggest job increases happened in industries where machines hadn't really taken over yet.

Some economists, like John Barton, explained that the demand for workers depends more on money spent on materials and wages than on machines or buildings. As technology and civilization develop, there’s more investment in machines and tools, which means fewer workers are needed. For example, making British muslin uses way more machines than Indian muslin, so fewer workers are required here.

Even if a country gets richer, it doesn’t always mean more jobs for workers. Sometimes, more machines mean fewer jobs, and workers can end up worse off. This idea was also supported by other economists like Ricardo and Richard Jones, who said that as machines and capital grow, the need for labor doesn’t grow as fast and workers might suffer more.

Malthus, with help from Sismondi, talked about three big problems in capitalism: making too much stuff, having too many people, and people using too much. These problems can cause trouble for workers and society.

During the cotton famine in 1863, cotton workers in Blackburn complained about being forced to work 12 to 13 hours a day. Many other workers were out of work but wanted to work shorter hours so they could support their families and help tired workers avoid getting sick from working too hard. They questioned if working extra hours like this was good for the relationship between bosses and workers.
