The seller turns what they want to sell into money so they can get what they need. The person who keeps money just wants to hold onto it, and the person who owes money does it so they can pay their debt. If the debtor doesn’t pay, their stuff might be taken away by the sheriff. So, money becomes the main goal in selling things because of how buying and selling work in society.

The buyer changes money back into things before the seller even turns things into money. This means the buyer does the second step before the first. The seller’s item is sold and gets a price, but really, it’s just a promise to get money later. The item becomes useful before it actually becomes money. The first step of selling is finished later on. The debts people owe add up to the prices of the things they sold. How much gold is needed to pay all this depends on how fast money moves around. This depends on two things: first, people who owe money pay others who owe money to someone else, like a chain; second, it depends on when payments are due. This chain of payments is different from other buying and selling steps. The way money moves shows a social connection that started long before money moves.

When many sales happen at the same time, it stops money from being replaced just by how fast it moves. But this also helps save money. When many payments come together in one place, special systems are made to handle them. In the middle ages, for example, there were ways to handle debts between people so they could cancel out some of what they owed each other. This means only one final payment needs to be made. The more payments that come together, the smaller the final amount is, so less money needs to be used.

Money as a way to pay has a problem with no easy answer. When payments balance each other out, money only works as a way to count value, not as real money. But when actual payments happen, money isn’t just a tool to buy and sell — it becomes a symbol of work and value by itself. This problem shows up in money crises during bad economic times. A crisis happens when the chain of payments gets too long and complicated. If something goes wrong, money suddenly changes from just numbers on paper to real cash people need right away. Other things for sale stop being useful as money. Before a crisis, rich people might say money isn’t important, just things are. But when a crisis hits, everyone shouts: money is the most important thing! People want money more than anything else.
