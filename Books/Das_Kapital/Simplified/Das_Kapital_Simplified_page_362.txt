It is completely wrong to say that “profits will be 20%.” Profits are always less because they are based on the total amount of money invested. For example, if a capitalist puts in £500, with £400 spent on tools and materials and £100 on wages, and the extra value created is 20%, then the profit is 20 divided by 500, which is 4%, not 20%.

Next, there is a great example of how Mill explains different types of social production throughout history.

He assumes that usually, workers and capitalists are separate groups, and the capitalist pays all the costs, including the workers’ wages. This is not really true everywhere yet, but Mill says it doesn’t have to be this way. Workers could wait until the product is finished to get paid more than just enough to survive. If they have enough money to support themselves, they could even pay for some parts of production themselves. In that case, the worker becomes like a capitalist by helping fund the work.

Mill could have added that a worker who pays for both their living needs and production tools is basically their own boss but still works for wages. He might also have said that American farmers who own their land but work very hard are like peasants who work for themselves instead of a lord.

After showing that capitalist production would exist even if it didn’t, Mill also argues that it doesn’t really exist, even when it seems to.

He says that even when a worker gets all their living costs in advance from the capitalist, the worker can be seen as a capitalist too. This is because the worker provides their labor for less than its real value, which means they are “lending” part of their work to the employer and getting it back with interest. But in reality, the worker works for free for about a week and then gets paid the full amount at the end. Mill thinks this makes the worker a capitalist. But this is like mistaking small hills for big mountains. The shallow thinking of today’s ruling class shows how smart their top thinkers really are.
