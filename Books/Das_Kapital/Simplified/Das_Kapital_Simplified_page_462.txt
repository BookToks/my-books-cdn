The same problem happens with the houses where miners live. Dr. Simon, a medical officer, says in his official report: “People say that miners usually work on leases that last about 21 years. Because the lease isn’t very long, the person renting the mine doesn’t think it’s worth building good homes for the workers or the people who come to work there. Even if the renter wanted to build better houses, the landlord would charge them a lot of extra rent just for having a nice village on the land. This high cost stops the renter and others from building good homes. It’s not my job here to argue if this excuse is right or wrong. Also, it’s not necessary to figure out who should pay for better houses – the landlord, renter, worker, or public. But since the reports show such bad living conditions, something needs to be done. Landlords are using their power in a way that hurts the public.”

The landlord owns the mine and invites workers to come and work on his land, but at the same time, because he also owns the surface land, he makes it impossible for the workers to find decent places to live.

The renter, or capitalist, doesn’t have a reason to fight this unfair deal because if the costs get too high, they don’t have to pay. The workers, who don’t understand their rights or the importance of clean homes and water, suffer the most. They won’t protest or strike over bad housing or dirty water because they don’t realize how important these things are.

Now, before talking about farm workers, I want to show how economic crises hurt even the best-paid workers. In 1857, there was a big economic crisis that happens every so often. The next big one was expected in 1866. Before that, in some factory areas, a cotton shortage caused money to move from factories to banks and financial centers. The 1866 crisis started with a huge London bank failing, followed by many fake companies collapsing. One big affected industry was iron shipbuilding in London. The leaders in this business had made too many ships and signed huge contracts, hoping they could get enough credit to pay for everything. But when the crisis hit, a strong negative effect happened, and even by early 1867, the problems were still going on in London industries.
