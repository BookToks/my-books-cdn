Finally, in 1813, the laws controlling wages were removed. These laws were really strange because factory owners made their own rules, and they could use poor-rates to keep farm workers’ wages at the lowest level needed to survive. 

The rules about contracts between bosses and workers, like giving notice before quitting, still allowed workers to sue their bosses only in civil court, but bosses could take criminal action against workers who broke contracts. These unfair rules were still in place in 1873. 

The harsh laws against workers’ unions started to fall apart in 1825 because workers pushed back. But these laws didn’t disappear completely until some parts were finally removed in 1859. Then, on June 29, 1871, a law was passed that pretended to officially recognize workers’ unions. However, another law passed on the same day made it illegal for workers to use certain strike or protest tactics. This law gave bosses, acting as judges, the power to punish workers during strikes.

Two years before that, the same government and Mr. Gladstone had tried to pass a law to get rid of all special punishments against workers. But the law never passed beyond the early stages. The big Liberal party, with the help of the Tories, ended up turning against the workers who had helped them gain power. Not only that, but they let judges bring back old laws against “conspiracy” to punish groups of workers. 

So, the English Parliament only got rid of the anti-strike and anti-union laws because the workers forced them to. Before that, Parliament acted like a permanent union for the bosses, always against the workers.

During the first big changes of the revolution, the French middle class took away the workers’ new right to join together. On June 14, 1791, they said any group of workers acting together was “an attack on liberty and the rights of man,” punishable by a big fine and losing voting rights for a year. This law kept the fight between bosses and workers under control so it favored the bosses. It lasted through many changes, even the Reign of Terror, and was only removed from the law books recently.

The reason for this law is very clear. Chapelier, who supported it, said that even though workers should get better wages to avoid being totally dependent like slaves, they should never be allowed to work together to improve their situation. If they did, it would hurt the freedom of their “former masters,” the bosses. And he claimed that workers joining forces was like bringing back the old guilds, which the French constitution had already gotten rid of.
