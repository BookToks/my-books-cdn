A really smart thinker, who even his enemies now respect, died on March 14, 1883.

For me, who lost the best and most honest friend I had for forty years in Marx, someone I owe more than words can say, it became my job to help publish this third edition and the second volume that Marx left unfinished. Now, I have to explain to readers how I handled the first part of this job.

Marx originally planned to rewrite a big part of Volume I, to explain some ideas better, add new points, and update historical and statistical information. But because he was sick and needed to finish Volume II, he gave up on that plan. Only the most important changes were made, mostly the ones already in the French edition of the book.

Among Marx’s books, there was a German copy he had corrected and marked with notes for the French edition, plus a French copy showing exactly what parts to use. These changes and additions mostly affect the last part of the book called “The Accumulation of Capital.” Here, the text stuck closer to the original draft, unlike the earlier sections which were edited more carefully. So, this part reads more lively and consistent but also a bit careless, with some English words and unclear parts. Some important details were only mentioned briefly.

About the style, Marx had revised several smaller sections himself and told me how much I could remove English words and phrases. Marx would have gone over the new parts and replaced the smoother French with his own sharp German. I did my best to make the new parts fit well with the original text.

So, I didn’t change a single word in this edition unless I was sure Marx would have done it himself. I never thought about adding the usual confusing language that German economists use – like calling someone who hires workers a “labour-giver” and the worker a “labour-taker.” In French, too, the word for work is used in everyday life to mean “job,” but no French economist would call a capitalist a “labour-giver” or a worker a “labour-taker.”

Also, I didn’t change the English money, weights, and measures in the text to German ones. When the first edition came out, Germany had many different kinds of measurements and money. There were two kinds of marks, two kinds of gulden, and at least three kinds of talers. Science used the metric system, but the world market used English measures. So, using English units made sense because most examples in the book come from British industry.
