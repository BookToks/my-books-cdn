Hunter’s report shows the truth. Over many years, the living conditions for workers have been getting worse. It’s now much harder for them to find a place to live, and when they do, the homes are often not good for their needs like they used to be for a long time. 

Especially in the last 20 or 30 years, this problem has grown really fast. The homes of workers are now very bad. Unless the people who get rich from their work feel sorry for them and help a little, the workers have almost no power to change this. 

Whether a worker can find a home on the land they help farm, whether that home is decent or terrible, or whether they get a small garden to help with their poverty, doesn’t depend on how much they can pay. Instead, it depends on what the landowners want to do with their property. There is no law that says farms must have homes for workers, or even decent homes. Workers have almost no rights to the land they work on, even though their work is as important as sunlight or rain.

Another problem makes things worse: the Poor Law and its rules about where poor people must live and who has to support them. Because of this law, each parish (local area) wants to have as few workers living there as possible. This is because farming work doesn’t guarantee a steady, safe life for the workers and their families. Instead, many end up poor and needing help from the local government when they are sick or out of work. Having more workers living in a parish means more poor people to support, which costs money. 

Big landowners can decide not to have any workers’ homes on their land, which means they don’t have to pay as much to support poor people. Whether it was meant to be part of English law that landowners can treat the people who farm their land like outsiders and kick them out is a question the writer does not answer. But this power to evict workers is not just an idea — it happens a lot and controls how many workers can live on farms.

To show how bad things are, Dr. Hunter’s evidence from the last census says that in ten years, many houses were destroyed in 821 places in England, even though more people needed homes. Between 1851 and 1861, these places had 5.3% more people but 4.5% less house space. 

When this process of people moving away finishes, Dr. Hunter says, the villages become like showpieces with only a few cottages left. Only workers needed as shepherds, gardeners, or game-keepers live there, and they are treated better than regular laborers. The land still needs to be farmed, but the workers are not tenants of the owner anymore. Instead, they come from nearby villages, maybe three miles away, where other small landowners gave them homes after their cottages were destroyed in the “closed” villages.
