When a lot of workers work together at the same time in one place (or in the same type of job), making the same kind of product under one boss, this is the basic way capitalist production started.

At first, making things in a factory wasn’t very different from traditional handcraft work, except that more workers were working at once for one owner. It’s like the workshop of an old-time craftsman just got bigger.

So, the main difference was just how many people were working. We’ve shown that the extra value made by a capitalist depends on how much extra value each worker creates, multiplied by how many workers there are. Just having more workers doesn’t change how much each worker is exploited or how much extra value they produce. For example, if one worker works 12 hours and earns six shillings, then 1,200 workers working 12 hours each would earn 1,200 times six shillings. Whether 1,200 workers work alone or together under one boss doesn’t change the total value produced.

Still, some changes happen when many workers are employed together. The value created is based on the average quality of work, which means the average effort of workers. But every worker is different and works at a different speed. These differences balance out when enough workers are working together. There’s a story from a farmer named Edmund Burke who said that in a small group of five farm workers, their individual differences disappear, and any five grown workers will do the same amount of work in the same time.

Even if that’s true or not, when many workers work together, their total working hours divided by the number of workers gives the average work done by one worker. For example, if each worker works 12 hours, then 12 workers working together have done 144 hours total. Even if each person works faster or slower than average, when you split the total time by 12, you get the average work per person.

For the boss who hires these 12 workers, the working day is the total time of all 12 workers combined. Each worker’s time is just a part of that total, whether they help each other or just all work for the same boss. But if those 12 workers were split into six pairs, each working for a different small boss, it would be random whether each boss made the same amount of value or the usual profit.
