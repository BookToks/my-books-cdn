Part 7: The Accumulation of Capital

The first step in using money as capital is turning it into things needed for production and paying workers. This happens in the market, where buying and selling takes place. The next step is production, which is finished when these things are made into products that are worth more than the original materials and labor. These products have the original money spent plus extra value. Then, these products must be sold to turn their value back into money, which is then used as capital again. This cycle keeps repeating and is called the circulation of capital.

For capital to grow, the capitalist has to manage to sell most of the products and turn the money earned back into capital. In the following parts, we will assume this process works normally. More details about this will be explained in Book II.

The capitalist who creates extra value by making workers work without paying them for all their labor is the first to take this extra value. But they are not the final owner of it. They have to share it with other capitalists, landowners, and others involved in production. This extra value splits into parts like profit, interest, rent, and so on. We will look at these different forms in Book III.

We assume that the capitalist sells the products at their true value without worrying about the new forms capital takes in the market or the hidden conditions behind them. We also treat the capitalist as if they own all the extra value or represent everyone who shares it. So, we first look at accumulation in a simple way—as just a step in production.

For accumulation to happen, the capitalist must sell the products and turn the money back into capital. Even when the extra value is divided, it doesn’t change its nature or how it helps accumulation. No matter how much the capitalist keeps or gives away, they are the first to take it. We only assume what really happens. But the real process of accumulation is made confusing by selling and dividing the extra value. To understand it clearly, we need to ignore these confusing parts for now and focus on how it works inside.
