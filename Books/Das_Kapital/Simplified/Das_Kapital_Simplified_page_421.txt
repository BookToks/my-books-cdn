Imagine a factory where 100 workers each work 8 hours a day, adding up to 800 hours of work. If the boss wants to increase this by half, they could hire 50 more workers. But that would mean spending more money not just on wages but also on tools and machines. Another option is to have the same 100 workers work 12 hours instead of 8. The tools they already have would be enough, but they would wear out faster. This extra work, caused by workers working harder or longer, can create more products and value without needing more tools or machines.

In places like mines, the raw materials, like coal or metals, don’t count as capital because they come from nature for free. The tools used there are the main capital costs. These tools can handle more work, like having workers on day and night shifts. So, the amount and value of what’s produced go up directly with the amount of work done. Just like at the start, people and nature work together to make things. Because workers can do more, the business can grow without needing to spend more on tools.

On farms, you can’t just grow more land without buying more seeds and fertilizer. But once you have those, working the land more with the same number of workers can really boost how much you produce. This extra work makes the soil more fertile without needing new tools. Again, people working directly with nature can create more wealth without spending more money on equipment.

In manufacturing, every extra bit of work needs more raw materials, but not always more tools. Since farms and mines supply these raw materials and some tools, the extra products they make without extra spending help factories too.

Overall, by combining labor and natural resources, businesses can grow bigger and make more wealth than you might think based on just the tools and machines they already have.

Another important part of growing capital is how productive workers are. When workers get better at making things, the total amount of products grows, which means more value and profit. Even if the profit rate stays the same or drops a little, as long as productivity grows faster, the total profit increases. This means the boss can spend more on themselves without reducing how much they invest back into the business. Sometimes, the part saved for investment grows even faster than what they spend on themselves. Also, as products get cheaper because of better productivity, bosses can enjoy more things for the same amount of money.

But there's a downside for workers: as productivity rises, workers’ wages don’t increase as much. This means the value of labor goes down compared to how much work they do. So, with the same amount of wage money, bosses can get more work done.
