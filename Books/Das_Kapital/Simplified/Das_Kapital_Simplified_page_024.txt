In conclusion, Marx said he didn’t want to keep arguing with the anonymous person. That person seemed fed up too, because Marx never got any more issues of Concordia.

After that, the whole thing seemed finished. A few times, people connected to Cambridge University told us strange rumors about a terrible literary crime Marx was said to have done in “Capital.” But no one could find any clear proof. Then, on November 29, 1883, eight months after Marx died, a letter showed up in The Times newspaper. It was from Trinity College, Cambridge, signed by Sedley Taylor. This little man, who worked with some simple cooperative groups, finally explained the rumors from Cambridge and the anonymous writer in Concordia.

Taylor said the weird part was that Professor Brentano from Breslau University (now in Strassburg) was the one who exposed the dishonest way a quote from Mr. Gladstone’s speech was used. Marx tried to defend the quote but, after Brentano’s strong attack, Marx claimed that Gladstone had changed the report in The Times before it appeared in the official record called Hansard. Marx said this was done to hide a part that was embarrassing for Gladstone. But Brentano showed by comparing texts that the reports from The Times and Hansard actually agreed and didn’t support the meaning Marx gave to the quote. Marx then stopped arguing, saying he didn’t have time. So, that was the real reason behind all this! Brentano’s fight in Concordia was well known in Cambridge, where he was praised for his “masterful attack” while Marx quickly lost the battle.

However, this dramatic story hides Brentano’s tricks.

Now, instead of calling it a “lie” or “falsification,” they said it was just a “craftily isolated quotation.” The whole argument had changed, and Brentano and his Cambridge supporter knew why.

Eleanor Marx replied in the magazine To-day in February 1884 because The Times wouldn’t print her letter. She focused on the main question: did Marx really “lyingly insert” that sentence or not? Sedley Taylor answered that it didn’t matter much if the sentence was actually in Gladstone’s speech. What mattered more was if the quote was meant to change or twist Gladstone’s real meaning. He admitted that the report in The Times had a “verbal contradiction,” but if you looked at the context the right way, it showed what Gladstone really meant (To-day, March 1884). The funny thing was that Taylor now wanted to quote the speech from The Times, not from Hansard, even though Brentano had called The Times’ report “necessarily bungling.” Of course, because the tricky sentence wasn’t in Hansard.

Eleanor Marx easily destroyed this argument in the same issue of To-day. She said either Taylor had read the 1872 debate, which meant he was now making not only “lying insertions” but also “lying” deletions, or he hadn’t read it and should just keep quiet.
