Still, when people who make coats and boots compare their stuff to linen—or, which is the same, to gold or silver as universal money—they show the connection between their own work and society’s work in a really confusing way.

The ideas behind how money and economy work are like this. They are ways of thinking that make sense only for a certain kind of society, one where things are made to be sold. The whole mystery and magic around products only happens when things are treated like stuff to buy and sell. This mystery disappears when we look at other ways of making things.

Since Robinson Crusoe’s story is popular with economists, let’s think about him on his island. Even though he lives simply, he has some needs to meet. So, he does many useful jobs like making tools and furniture, taming goats, fishing, and hunting. We don’t count his prayers because they make him happy and are like fun breaks. Even with all these different jobs, he knows that all his work is just different kinds of human labor done by him alone.

He has to carefully divide his time between these jobs because he has no choice.

Which job takes more time depends on how hard it is to get what he wants. Robinson learns this quickly. After saving a watch, ledger, pen, and ink from the shipwreck, he starts keeping records like a true Brit. His book lists the useful things he owns, the steps needed to make them, and how much time each takes on average. The connection between Robinson and his things is so simple and clear that even a smart person like Mr. Sedley Taylor can understand it easily. And these connections show what really decides the value of things.

Now, let’s move from bright Robinson’s island to the dark European Middle Ages. Here, instead of free people, everyone depends on someone else—serfs on lords, vassals on suzerains, ordinary people on clergy. Personal dependence shapes all parts of life, including work. Because everyone depends on others, there’s no need for work and its products to seem mysterious or strange. Instead, people trade services and payments in kind (like goods, not money). Here, people’s actual work and not some abstract idea of labor is the real way work is organized.

Forced labor is measured by time just like work that makes things to sell. Every serf knows that the time spent working for the lord is a real part of their own personal effort. The church’s tax (tithe) is more real than the priest’s blessing. So, no matter what we think about the roles of different social groups, the relationships between people doing work show up clearly as personal connections, not hidden as strange relations between products.

For an example of working together, we don’t need to go far back in history. We can look at a peasant family working together, making food, animals, yarn, linen, and clothes for themselves. These things are the family’s products, but they don’t treat them as things to sell to each other.
