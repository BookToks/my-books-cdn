A worker can’t just wait to do a job whenever they feel like it; the work needs to be done at the right time. If the worker tries to do the job in spare moments, the work won’t turn out well.

So, it’s better when each person focuses on one job they’re good at and does it at the right time. This way, more work gets done, and it’s done better and more easily.

Thucydides said that jobs like sailing can’t be done as a side task because they need full attention. If you try to do other things at the same time, the work gets messed up.

Plato also said that if the work has to wait for the worker, the important moment can be missed and the work gets ruined. This idea is similar to what English factory workers said when they didn’t want fixed lunch breaks because stopping their work at the wrong time could damage the goods.

Xenophon pointed out that food made for the Persian king tastes better because it’s prepared by specialists. In small towns, one person might do many jobs like making beds, doors, and ploughs, but they can’t do all of them well.

In big cities, people focus on just one trade because there are many customers. Sometimes, the work is divided even more, like one person making shoes for men and another for women, or one cutting out clothes and another sewing them.

Because of this, people who do simple jobs only focus on that job and do it better than anyone else. The same goes for cooking.

Busiris organized people into special groups where each person always did the same job. He knew that if people kept changing jobs, they wouldn’t get good at any of them. But if they stuck to one job, they would become experts.

Because of this, some societies became much better at arts and crafts than others. Their systems were so good that famous thinkers praised their governments as the best.

In some countries like England, this focus on special skills is stronger than in others like France or Holland.
