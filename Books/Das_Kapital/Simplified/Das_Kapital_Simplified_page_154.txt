The total cost of the extra materials is £10 each week. So, the steady part of the value of the week’s product is £378. Wages are £52 a week. The price of the yarn is 12¼d. per pound, which means for 10,000 pounds, the total is £510. 

The extra value made is £510 - £430 = £80. We ignore the steady part of the product’s value because it doesn’t help make new value. That leaves £132 as the new value made each week, which equals £52 wages plus £80 extra value. The rate of extra value is 80 divided by 52, which is about 154%. 

In a 10-hour workday, the worker spends about 3.94 hours on necessary work and 6.06 hours on extra work.

Here’s another example from Jacob’s calculation for 1815. Even though some numbers were adjusted, it works for our purpose. He assumes wheat costs 8 shillings a quarter, and the average harvest per acre is 22 bushels.

Value made per acre:  
Seed costs £1 9s. 0d.  
Tithes, rates, and taxes £1 1s. 0d.  
Manure £2 10s. 0d.  
Rent £1 8s. 0d.  
Wages £3 10s. 0d.  
Farmer’s profit £1 2s. 0d.  
Interest totals £7 9s. 0d.  
Total surplus value is £3 11s. 0d.  

We don’t look at the details, just add them up to get £3 11s. 0d. That £3 19s. 0d. paid for seed and manure is constant capital, which we set to zero. The remaining £3 10s. 0d. is the variable capital, or wages. So, new value made is £3 10s. 0d. plus £3 11s. 0d. This means the rate of extra value is more than 100%. The worker spends more than half the day making extra value that others divide among themselves.

Now, let’s go back to how a capitalist turns money into capital.

In a 12-hour workday, 20 pounds of yarn are made, worth 30 shillings. Most of this value, 24 shillings (or 8/10ths), comes from the value of the materials used (20 pounds of cotton worth 20 shillings and a worn spindle worth 4 shillings). This is constant capital. The other 6 shillings (2/10ths) is new value made during spinning. Half of this replaces the worker’s wages (variable capital), and the other half is extra value of 3 shillings.

So, the total value of the 20 pounds of yarn is 30 shillings, made up of 24 shillings constant capital, 3 shillings wages, and 3 shillings extra value.

Since all this value is in the 20 pounds of yarn, each part of the value is found in its matching part of the product.
