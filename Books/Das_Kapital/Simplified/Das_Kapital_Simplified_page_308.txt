If you ask these kids a question, they don’t even look up from their work because they’re afraid of losing any time. The bosses use a “long stick” to push them harder, especially as the working hours get longer.

The children get tired and restless, like birds trapped in a cage, after being stuck at boring and hard work that strains their eyes and bodies. Their work feels like slavery. When women and kids work at home, which usually means a small rented room or an attic, things are even worse. This kind of work happens within about 80 miles of Nottingham. After leaving the factories at night, kids often have to take bundles of lace home to finish. The boss’s helper says it’s “for mother,” but everyone knows the poor kids have to stay up late to help.

Making pillow lace happens mostly in two farming areas in England: one along the south coast of Devonshire and parts of North Devon, and the other covering large parts of Buckingham, Bedford, Northampton, and nearby counties.

The work usually takes place in the cottages of farm workers.

Many factories hire over 3,000 lace-makers, mostly girls and young women. The situation is similar to lace finishing, but instead of working in bosses’ houses, they work in “lace-schools” run by poor women in their cottages. From as young as five years old, sometimes even younger, until they’re 12 to 15, kids work in these schools. In their first year, the youngest work 4 to 8 hours a day. Later, their day can start at 6 a.m. and end at 8 or 10 p.m.

These rooms are often just regular living rooms in small cottages. To keep out drafts, the chimney is blocked, so the only heat comes from the people inside, even in winter. Sometimes, these “schools” are tiny rooms without fireplaces. They’re overcrowded, and the air is bad. On top of that, there’s the smell and filth from drains, toilets, and garbage near the cottages. 

For space, one lace-school had 18 girls and a teacher with only 35 cubic feet per person; another had 18 people with 24.5 cubic feet each and a terrible smell. In this work, there are even children as young as 2 or 2 and a half years old.

Where lace-making ends in Buckingham and Bedford, straw-plaiting starts and spreads over parts of Hertfordshire and Essex. In 1861, over 40,000 people worked in straw-plaiting and making straw hats. Of these, 3,815 were men, and the rest were women, including about 7,000 kids under 20. Instead of lace-schools, there are “straw-plait schools” here. Kids start learning straw-plaiting around age 3 or 4. They don’t get any real education. The kids call regular schools “natural schools” to show the difference from these awful places where they’re forced to work just to finish the daily task, usually 30 yards, set by their poor, hungry mothers.
