To sum up: Every product has a use value, which means it comes from a specific kind of useful work done with a clear goal. Products can only be compared as commodities if the useful work in each is different in quality. In a community where people make products to sell, this difference in types of work done by different producers turns into a complex system called the social division of labor.

For example, whether the tailor wears the coat or sells it to someone else, the coat still serves its purpose as a useful product. The connection between the coat and the work that made it doesn’t change just because tailoring becomes a special job. Humans made clothes for thousands of years before anyone became a professional tailor. But coats, linen, and other material goods that don’t grow naturally always come from specific work done with a clear purpose, using natural materials to meet human needs. So, useful work that creates products is a basic need for humans, no matter the type of society. It’s a natural rule, and without it, we can’t exchange things with nature or survive.

Products like coats and linen are made of two parts: matter and labor. If you remove the useful work done on them, you’re left with natural materials given by nature without human help. People can only work by changing the form of these materials, and nature helps in this process. So, labor isn’t the only source of material wealth; nature also plays a big role. As William Petty said, labor is the father and the earth the mother of wealth.

Now, let’s move from looking at products as useful things to looking at their value.

We assume the coat is worth twice as much as the linen. This is just a number difference and isn’t important right now. But if one coat is worth as much as 20 yards of linen, then 20 yards of linen must equal the coat in value.

As values, the coat and linen are similar because they both show human labor. But tailoring and weaving are different kinds of work. In some societies, one person might do both tailoring and weaving at different times, so these are just different types of work by the same person, not fixed jobs for different people. For example, a tailor might make a coat one day and trousers another day, which shows only different tasks by the same person. In capitalist societies, human labor can shift between tailoring and weaving depending on demand. This change might cause problems, but it has to happen.

If we ignore the specific kind of work, productive activity is just using human labor power. Tailoring and weaving, while different kinds of work, both use human brains, nerves, and muscles. They are just two ways people use their labor power. Of course, this labor power has to be developed enough to be used in many different ways.
