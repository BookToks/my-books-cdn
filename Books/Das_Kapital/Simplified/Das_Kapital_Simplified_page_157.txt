Workers can be made to work more than 11½ hours a day. For example, they might work 12 hours a day for 5 days a week, and 9 hours on Saturday.

Now, here’s a breakdown of what happens in a factory working like this. Imagine a factory owner puts in £100,000: £80,000 on the building and machines, and £20,000 on materials and wages. If the factory makes a 15% profit each year, the total value of goods made would be £115,000.

This £115,000 is made in 23 half-hour work periods. Each half-hour produces one twenty-third of the total. Out of this, £100,000 just covers the original investment, and £5,000 covers wear and tear on machines. The last two half-hours produce the real profit of 10%.

So, if the factory worked 13 hours instead of 11½, and the owner invested another £2,600 in materials and wages, the profit would more than double. But if the work hours were cut by one hour a day, the profit would disappear. If cut by one and a half hours, even the basic 10% profit would be lost.

The professor calls this an “analysis.” If he believed the factory owners when they said workers spend most of their day just replacing the value of buildings, machines, and materials, then this analysis wasn’t needed. He could have just said: “If you work 10 hours instead of 11½, you’ll use less cotton, machines, and so on, so you don’t really gain anything. Your workers will spend less time replacing your investment.”

But if he didn’t believe the owners without checking, and wanted to analyze the situation carefully, he should have separated the money spent on buildings, machines, and materials from the money spent on wages.

If the professor found that workers reproduced their wages in 2 half-hours, he should have continued like this: According to the owners, the worker produces their wages in the second-to-last hour, and the profit in the last hour. Since the worker works 11½ hours, and produces value only while working, it means half the time makes their wages, and half makes the profit.

So, the worker produces their wages in 5¾ hours and the profit in the other 5¾ hours. The value of the goods made in 2 hours equals the value of wages plus profit. This means the value made in the last two hours comes from 11½ working hours, split evenly between wages and profit.
