Some people say that the basic rules of how the economy works are always the same, whether we look at the past or the present. Marx disagrees with this. He says these general rules don’t really exist. Instead, every time in history has its own special rules.

When society moves from one stage to another, it starts to follow different rules. Economic life changes like living things do in biology. The old economists made a mistake by thinking economic laws are like the laws of physics or chemistry. But social groups are very different from each other, just like plants and animals are different. Even the same event can follow different rules because societies have different structures and conditions.

For example, Marx says the law about population isn’t the same everywhere or at every time. Each stage of development has its own population rules. As productive power changes, so do social conditions and the laws that control them. Marx’s goal is to explain the economic system based on capital from this point of view. He is doing what any serious study of the economy should do.

The value of this kind of study is in finding the special laws that explain how a society starts, grows, dies, and is replaced by a new and better one. That’s the real value of Marx’s book. When someone describes Marx’s method this way, they are really describing the dialectic method.

The way you explain something has to be different from how you study it. When studying, you have to look closely at all the details, understand how things develop, and see how they connect. Only after that can you properly describe what’s happening.

If this is done well, and the subject’s life is shown clearly like a reflection in a mirror, it might seem like you just made it up without any real proof.

My dialectic method is very different from Hegel’s; in fact, it’s the opposite. Hegel believed that the human mind and its thinking process, which he called “the Idea,” created the real world. He thought the real world was just a copy of this Idea. But I think the mind is just reflecting the real, material world and turning it into thoughts.

I criticized Hegel’s confusing dialectic almost 30 years ago, when it was still popular. But while I was working on the first volume of “Das Kapital,” some people in Germany treated Hegel like an old, useless thinker. So I openly said I was his student, and even sometimes used his style, especially in the part about value theory. Even though Hegel made dialectic confusing, he was still the first to use it in a complete and thoughtful way.
