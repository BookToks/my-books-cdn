Kids who start working before noon can’t work again after 1 p.m. So, the afternoon shift has to be made up of different kids than those who worked in the morning. Out of the hour and a half set aside for meal breaks, at least one hour must be given before 3 p.m. Also, no kid or young person can work more than five hours before 1 p.m. without a break of at least 30 minutes. Plus, no kid, young person, or woman is allowed to stay in a room where any manufacturing work is going on during meal times.

These detailed rules about work times and breaks didn’t just come from Parliament for no reason. They came from real-life situations and the way factories worked. The government only made these rules official after a long fight between different groups. One big result was that adult men’s work hours in factories also got limited because kids, young people, and women had to be part of the process. So, between 1844 and 1847, working 12 hours a day became the normal rule for all industries under the Factory Act.

But factory owners didn’t like this “progress” without getting something back. They pushed the government to lower the minimum working age from 9 to 8 years old, so they could have more kids working in factories. The years 1846-47 were very important in England’s economic history. The government ended taxes on corn and cotton and made free trade the main rule. This was seen as a big change, like a new era. At the same time, the Chartist movement and the fight for a 10-hour workday were at their strongest, with support from some political groups wanting revenge. Even though many free-trade supporters were against it, the Ten Hours’ Bill finally passed in Parliament after a long fight.

The new Factory Act of June 8, 1847, said that starting July 1, 1847, work hours for “young persons” (ages 13 to 18) and all women should be cut to 11 hours. Then, by May 1, 1848, the workday would be limited to 10 hours. Besides this, the Act just updated the earlier Acts from 1833 and 1844.

After this, factory owners started trying to stop the Act from fully starting in May 1848. Surprisingly, workers themselves helped this happen because of their past experiences. The timing was smart. 

It should be remembered that for over two years, many factory workers had suffered a lot because of a big crisis in 1846-47. Many factories worked shorter hours or closed completely. A lot of workers were barely getting by and many were in debt. So, it was expected that they would want to work longer hours now to make up for lost money, pay debts, get back things they had to sell or pawn, or buy new clothes for themselves and their families.
