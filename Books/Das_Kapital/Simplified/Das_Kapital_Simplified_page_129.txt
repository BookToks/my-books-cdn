If we look at the whole process by focusing on what it produces, it’s clear that both the tools and the materials used are parts of production, and the work done is productive. Even though a useful thing, like a product, comes out of working, other useful things made before also go into the process as materials. So, the same useful thing can be both the result of earlier work and a part of new work. Products are not just results but also important parts of making new products.

Except for jobs like mining, hunting, fishing, and farming on new land, most industries work with raw materials that have already been worked on before. For example, seeds in farming come from plants that were grown before. Animals and plants, which we usually think come from nature, are actually the results of many years of people’s work and care. Even tools we use show signs of work done by people long ago.

Raw materials might be the main part of a product or just a small part. Sometimes these small parts get used up by tools, like coal burning under a boiler or oil running a machine. Other times they get mixed with raw materials to change them, like adding chlorine to linen or dye to wool. Some materials help keep the work going, like fuel for heating and lighting workshops. In chemical industries, the difference between main materials and small parts disappears because the raw materials change completely. Every object has different qualities and can be used in different ways.

One product can be used as raw material in many different ways. For example, corn can be raw material for millers, starch makers, distillers, and farmers feeding animals. Corn can also be used as seed to grow more corn. Coal is both a product of mining and something used to help mine more coal.

Sometimes one product is used as both a tool and raw material in the same process. For example, when fattening cattle, the animal is raw material but also helps make manure, which is useful for farming.

A product that can be eaten or used right away can also be raw material for making something else, like grapes used to make wine. Sometimes work gives us products that we can only use as raw materials, like cotton or yarn. These raw materials go through many steps, each time changing form, until the final product is ready to use or to help make other things.

So, whether something is raw material, a tool, or a finished product depends only on its role in the work process. This role can change, and so does what the thing is.

Whenever a product is used in a new work process, it stops being a product and just becomes a part of the process. For example, a spinner uses spindles only as tools and flax only as material to spin. Of course, you can’t spin without these things, so at the start, they must exist as products from earlier work. But during the spinning, it doesn’t matter that they were made before, just like when we eat bread, it doesn’t matter that farmers, millers, and bakers made it.
