The name of something is different from what that thing is like. Just knowing a man’s name is Jacob doesn’t tell me anything about him. It’s the same with money—words like pound, dollar, franc, or ducat don’t show the real value behind them. The confusion happens because these money names show both how much stuff is worth and parts of the metal weight that money is based on.

But value needs to have a physical form to be different from the many shapes things come in. This form doesn’t mean anything by itself but is important because it’s a social thing. Price is the money-name for the work put into making something. So saying the price of something equals the money it costs is just saying the same thing twice. When we say how much something is worth compared to money, it doesn’t always mean the price shows the true value.

Imagine two things that need the same amount of work: one quarter of wheat and £2 (which is about half an ounce of gold). The £2 is the money expression of the wheat’s value, or its price. If the price changes to £3 or £1 because of different reasons, those are still prices even if they don’t perfectly show the wheat’s true value. The work needed to make the wheat stays the same no matter what the price is, and this doesn’t depend on the wheat maker or other sellers.

The size of value shows how much social work is needed to make something. When value changes into price, it becomes a kind of exchange rate between that thing and money. But this exchange rate can either show the true value or a different amount of gold, depending on the situation. Because of this, price and value don’t always match up perfectly, and this is actually useful because it fits a system where things seem random but balance out in the end.

Price doesn’t just sometimes not match value in amount; it can also hide a bigger problem where price doesn’t really show value at all. Money is just a way to show the value of things, but some things like conscience or honor aren’t really things you can sell like a product. Even so, people can put a price on them and sell them, so these things can have a price without real value. These prices are imaginary, like made-up numbers in math. But sometimes, these fake prices can hide real value connections, like the price of land that hasn’t been worked on and has no value because no human labor has gone into it.
