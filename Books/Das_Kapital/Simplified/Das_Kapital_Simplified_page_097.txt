The value of this explanation can cover everything about the real worth of something, and it can even replace the need for a fixed standard, as long as the amount of money in use is carefully controlled. Since the stuff used as money can be swapped out for simple symbols that show value, its role as a way to measure worth and set prices is seen as unnecessary!

Because gold and silver coins are just tokens when used only for trading, Nicholas Barbon says governments have the power to "raise money." This means they can call a certain weight of silver a bigger amount, like calling a shilling a crown, and pay debts with shillings instead of crowns. He explains that money loses weight over time from being handled so much. People care more about the name and value assigned to the money, not the actual amount of silver. It's the government’s power over the metal that makes it real money.

“Money in silver is just wealth in products changed into money.” This means that money is just stuff you can buy, but in a different form. Its value hasn’t really changed—it's just switched from products to money. People keep prices low because of this way of using money. Money is like a promise.

When you buy something, it means that gold and silver are already something turned from products or what someone has sold.

King Henry III of France took valuable religious items from churches and turned them into money. In history, taking treasures from temples has played a big role. Temples were like sacred banks where gods of goods lived.

With the Phoenicians, who were expert traders, money was the changed form of everything. So, it made sense that during the feast of the Goddess of Love, the girls who gave themselves to strangers also gave the goddess the money they got.

“Gold, shiny and precious gold! Just a little of this can turn black into white, wrong into right, ugly into beautiful, and a coward into a hero. 

What is this, gods? It can pull priests and servants away from you, take comfort from brave men, change religions, bless the cursed, make people worship ugly things, give thieves power and respect, and get widows to marry again. This is what makes the world go round.” (Shakespeare: Timon of Athens.) 

Money!
