Some people love sports, while others, who are more practical, hunt deer just to make money.

It’s true that a mountain covered in forest can make more money for its owner than if it’s used for sheep grazing. Hunters who want a deer forest only think about how much money they can spend. 

The people in the Highlands have suffered a lot, almost as much as during the rule of the Norman kings. Deer got more land to roam, but people were pushed into smaller and smaller areas. One by one, the freedoms of the people were taken away. These unfair actions keep happening more and more every day. 

Landowners clear out people from their homes as if it’s a normal farming practice, like clearing trees and bushes in America or Australia. This happens quietly and like a business deal.

The church’s land was taken, state lands were stolen, common lands were robbed, and feudal clan lands were turned into private property through violent means. This was all part of early ways to build up wealth. They took over farming land for capitalist use, making the land part of business capital. This also created a group of poor workers without rights, needed for city industries.

Back then, small landowners who farmed their own land were a much bigger part of the country than today. According to the best stats from that time, around 160,000 small owners and their families made up more than one-seventh of the population. These small landlords earned about £60 to £70 a year. More people farmed their own land than farmed land owned by others.

Even in the late 1600s, most English people—four out of five—worked in agriculture. I mention this because some historians try to hide these facts.

We should also remember that even serfs (peasants bound to the land) owned some land, paying tribute for it, and also shared common land. For example, in Silesia under Frederick II, peasants were serfs but still had common land. In some areas, common lands were divided successfully among villagers.

Japan’s old feudal system and small farms give a better idea of Europe’s Middle Ages than many history books, which are often biased. It’s easy for people to criticize the Middle Ages unfairly.

Thomas More, in his book “Utopia,” said that sheep in England used to be gentle and eat little, but now they have become so wild that they swallow up the people themselves.

Bacon explained that having a free and fairly wealthy peasant class was important for good soldiers. Farms that could support a strong person helped keep the country strong. This system created a middle class of farmers between the rich landowners and poor peasants.
