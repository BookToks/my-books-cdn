In Homer’s time, the value of something could be shown by comparing it to different things. For example, the worth of linen could be told by how many coats, or how much corn, it was worth.

Because of this, we can talk about the “coat value” of linen if its worth is measured in coats, or the “corn value” if it’s measured in corn. Each way of measuring just shows the same value in different things. So, we can say a thing has many kinds of value, depending on what it’s compared to, and all these values are real in their own way.

A writer named S. Bailey pointed out that since value can be shown in so many ways, it’s hard to pin down exactly what value means. Even though his ideas were limited, he did show some problems with Ricardo’s theory, which made Ricardo’s supporters angry.

It’s not obvious that something’s ability to be directly traded for anything else is like having two opposite sides connected, like the poles of a magnet. It might seem like all things could be directly exchanged for all others at the same time, just like imagining all Catholics being popes at once.

People who own small businesses really want to fix the problem that not all things can be directly swapped. Proudhon’s idea of socialism tried to do this, but it wasn’t very original and others had tried better ideas before him. Still, some groups today keep pushing these ideas and call them “science,” even though they mostly just use fancy words to cover up missing ideas.

In a note added to the German edition, it says that after the failed revolutions of 1848-49, spiritualism like table-turning became popular with rich Europeans. At the same time, China was going through a big peasant rebellion called the Taiping Revolt.

Among ancient Germans, land was measured by how much a person could farm in one day, called Tagwerk or Mannsmaad.

The thinker Galiani said value is a relationship between people, but he should have added that this relationship is shown by how things relate to each other.

Engels once said, “What can we think of a law that only works through revolutions? It’s just a natural law caused by people not understanding what they’re doing.”

Even Ricardo told stories that sounded like Robinson Crusoe’s adventures.
