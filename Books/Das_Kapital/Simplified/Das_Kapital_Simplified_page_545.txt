For many years, the English Government used a method called “primitive accumulation,” which Mr. Wakefield suggested for colonies. This plan failed completely, just like Sir Robert Peel’s Bank Act. Instead of people moving to English colonies, they went to the United States.

At the same time, capitalism was growing in Europe, and the government was pushing harder. This made Wakefield’s plan unnecessary. Lots of people kept moving to America every year, but many stayed in the eastern U.S. because more people arrived from Europe than moved west.

The American Civil War caused a huge national debt and higher taxes. It also led to a powerful financial elite and the government giving away large amounts of public land to companies for railways and mines. This caused money to be controlled by fewer people very quickly.

Because of this, the U.S. stopped being a great place for working immigrants. Capitalism grew fast there, even though wages were still lower and workers had fewer rights compared to Europe. The government also gave away land in colonies like Australia to rich people and companies, which caused problems for small workers and created a big extra group of unemployed or underemployed people. Many letters even reported a “glut” or too many workers in Australia, and things like prostitution became common, similar to London’s worst areas.

But here, we are not focusing on the colonies. What matters is the big secret found in the New World and shouted out by old-world economic thinkers: capitalism depends on destroying workers’ own property and taking it away from them.

This is the end of Book I.
