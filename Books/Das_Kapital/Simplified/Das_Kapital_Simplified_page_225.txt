The value of a worker’s daily pay depends on what they need to live, work, and have a family. If a worker’s wages don’t cover the cost of supporting their family, then they are not being paid fairly. A simple worker who only has their own effort to sell usually earns just enough to survive.

The cost of living basically sets the price of labor because workers need enough money to buy the things they need to keep working.

When crafts or skills improve, it means finding new ways to make things faster or with fewer people. This saves time and effort in making products.

If a manufacturer doubles their output by using better machines, they can pay their workers with less of the total product and still make more profit. But this doesn’t change much else.

A person’s profit comes from how much labor they can control. If they sell their goods for more while paying workers the same wages, they benefit because less of what they produce is used to pay workers, leaving more for themselves.

If someone nearby can make things cheaply with less work, others have to do the same to compete. This pushes people to use better tools or invent new ways to work faster and cheaper, so no one gets left behind.

When the cost of living for a worker goes down, their wages usually go down too, if there are no limits on work. Trade needs food and supplies to be cheap because expensive living costs make labor more expensive. When things get cheaper to make, wages tend to fall too. Machines make life cheaper but also make workers cheaper.

Everyone agrees that the more you can save money or effort in making things, the cheaper those things become, which is good for everyone.
