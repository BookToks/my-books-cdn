“Look at this,” she said almost angrily, showing a bank book with all the records of money put in and taken out. We could see how the small savings started with just five shillings and slowly grew to twenty pounds. Then, the money slowly disappeared until there was almost nothing left, and the last entry made the book as useless as a blank page. This family got help from the workhouse, which gave them only one small meal a day.

Our next visit was to a woman whose husband worked as an iron laborer. We found her sick because she hadn’t eaten enough, lying on a mattress in her clothes and barely covered with a strip of carpet since all the bedding had been pawned. Two poor children were looking after her, but they looked like they needed care too. They had been forced to stop working for nineteen weeks, and the mother told us their sad story while crying, as if she had lost all hope for a better future.

As we left, a young man ran after us and asked if we could help him. He had a young wife, two nice children, some pawn tickets, and an empty room to live in. After the crisis of 1866, a Tory newspaper wrote about what was happening. It’s important to remember that the East-End of London, where this story took place, was not only a place for iron shipbuilding but also for a “home-industry” where people were badly paid.

“A terrible sight was seen yesterday in one part of the city. Even though the thousands of unemployed people in the East-End didn’t march with black flags, the crowd was still huge. We must remember what these people are going through. They are starving. That’s the simple and awful truth. There are 40,000 of them. In one part of this amazing city, right next to the richest place in the world, 40,000 helpless, hungry people live very close together.

These thousands are now moving into other areas; always half-starving, they cry out about their pain, they cry to Heaven, and tell us from their poor homes that it’s impossible to find work and begging doesn’t help. Even the local taxpayers are almost becoming poor because of the extra charges.” – (Standard, 5th April, 1867.)

Some English businessmen like to talk about Belgium as a worker’s paradise because there is “freedom of labor” or “freedom of capital” there, meaning no strong trade unions or factory laws. Let’s look at how happy Belgian workers really were. No one knew this better than M. Ducpétiaux, the head inspector of Belgian prisons and charities, and a member of the Belgian statistics commission. He wrote a book called “Budgets économiques des classes ouvrières de la Belgique” in 1855.

In it, he studied a typical Belgian worker’s family, with exact details about their yearly income and spending. He also compared how well they ate to soldiers, sailors, and prisoners. The family had a father, mother, and four kids. Out of the six people, four could work all year. It was assumed no one was sick or unable to work, and there were no costs for religion, education, savings, or luxuries.
