Buying and selling stuff is usually just a way to get what you want or need. You sell something to get money, then use that money to buy something else you need.

But when money is used as capital, it’s different. The goal isn’t just to buy or sell, but to make more money. This process keeps going and never really stops. The person with the money, called the capitalist, starts with money and aims to end up with even more money.

For the capitalist, making more and more money is the main goal. They don’t care about the actual things they buy or sell, just the profit they can make. It’s not about a single deal, but about always finding ways to earn more money.

This endless hunt for wealth is like greed. Both capitalists and misers want to keep or get more money, but while a miser just hoards money and doesn’t spend it, a capitalist keeps using money to make even more money by buying and selling.

In simple buying and selling, money is just a tool to exchange things and then disappears after the deal. But in capitalism, money and goods are just different forms of value that change back and forth. The value keeps moving and growing automatically, like it has a life of its own.

So, capital is sometimes money and sometimes goods. But it’s really value that’s active, changing between money and goods, and growing bigger by creating surplus value—extra worth beyond the original.

This process is automatic. Value can add more value to itself, like it’s producing something new or laying golden eggs.

Because value changes forms, it needs a way to show its identity, and that’s money. Value starts as money and ends as money, growing each time. For example, you start with £100 and end with £110.

But just having money isn’t enough to be capital. It has to turn into goods too. Unlike hoarding, where money just sits, capitalists know that every item, no matter how cheap or smelly, is really just money in disguise—a tool to make more money.

In normal buying and selling (C—M—C), the value of things just becomes money temporarily. But in capitalism (M—C—M), value acts like its own thing that moves and changes form, with money and goods just being its different shapes.
