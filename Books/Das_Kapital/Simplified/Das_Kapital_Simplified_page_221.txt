With the four shillings and sixpence he earns in nine hours, he can now buy about one-tenth less of the things he needs to live than before. Because of this, his ability to keep working properly is weakened. The extra work he does would only happen if he works longer than normal, cutting into the time he needs to do the necessary work.

Even though this idea is important in real life, we aren’t going to talk about it here because we are assuming that all goods, including work itself, are bought and sold at their full value. If that’s true, the time needed to produce the worker’s ability to work can’t be shortened by paying less than the value of that work; it can only go down if the value itself goes down.

When the working day is a certain length, making the extra work longer has to come from making the necessary work shorter. The shorter necessary work time can’t cause the longer extra work time.

In the example we used, the value of the worker’s ability to work would have to drop by one-tenth for the necessary work time to go down by one-tenth—from ten hours to nine—and for the extra work to go up from two hours to three.

But for the value of work ability to drop, it means the same amount of necessary things that used to be made in ten hours now have to be made in nine hours. This can’t happen unless work becomes more productive. For example, if a shoemaker with certain tools makes one pair of boots in a 12-hour day, he would have to make two pairs in the same time to double productivity. This can only happen if his tools or way of working change. So, how things are made and the work process itself must change a lot.

By making work more productive, we mean changing the work process so that less time is needed to make something, and the same amount of work can produce more useful things. Before, when we talked about making extra value by simply making the workday longer, we assumed the way things were made didn’t change. But to get extra value by turning necessary work into extra work, it’s not enough to just make workers work longer. The work process and conditions have to be completely changed first to make work more productive. Only this way can the value of work ability go down, and the necessary work time be shortened.

The extra value made by making the workday longer is called absolute surplus-value. The extra value made by shortening necessary work time and changing the balance between necessary and extra work is called relative surplus-value.

To lower the value of work ability, the increase in work productivity must happen in industries that make the things workers need to live. These things either are the usual things workers need or things that can replace them. But the value of something doesn’t just depend on the work put into making it directly. It also depends on the work put into the tools and materials used to make it. For example, a pair of boots’ value depends on the cobbler’s work and also on the value of leather, wax, thread, and so on.

So, lowering the value of work ability also happens when productivity goes up in the industries that make the tools and raw materials needed to produce workers’ necessities, making those things cheaper.
