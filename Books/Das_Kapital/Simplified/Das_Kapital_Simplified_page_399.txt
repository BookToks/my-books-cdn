No matter how a society makes things, it has to keep doing it without stopping. A society can’t stop making stuff any more than it can stop using stuff. So, making things is actually a continuous cycle of making and remaking.

The things needed to make products are also needed to keep this cycle going. A society can’t keep making things unless it takes some of what it produces and uses it to create new tools or materials for future production. To keep its wealth steady, a society has to replace the tools, raw materials, and other things used up during the year with the same amount of new ones. This part of the yearly products is meant only to be used for making more products, not for personal use.

If the way products are made is capitalist, then the way things are reproduced follows the same style. In capitalism, work is just a way to grow money. When money is used as capital, the goal is to keep growing it. For example, if £100 was used as capital this year and made an extra £20, it needs to keep doing that every year. The extra money, called surplus-value, becomes income from the capital. If the capitalist spends all this income just on personal things, and not on growing the business, then simple reproduction happens. This means the production process repeats at the same level, but because it happens continuously, it changes how it looks compared to one-time production.

Buying workers’ time for a set period starts the production process, and this keeps happening again and again, like every week or month. But workers don’t get paid until after they’ve worked and produced not just what they’re worth but extra value too. They create the money that pays their wages as well as the extra profit for the capitalist. A worker keeps their job only as long as they keep creating this pay.

This explains why wages are seen as a share of what is produced. The money workers get is actually part of the product they helped make. The capitalist pays them in money, but that money is just a changed form of what they created. While workers are making new products, some of their earlier work is being turned into money that pays for their current work. It’s like the work they did last week or last year is what pays for their work now.
