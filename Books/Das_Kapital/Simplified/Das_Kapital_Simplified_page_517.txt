They used slaves for farming and taking care of animals because free men were busy fighting in the army. Having slaves made rich people even richer since slaves didn’t have to fight and could have many children. This made the rich powerful and the land full of slaves. Meanwhile, the Italian free people were getting fewer because of poverty, taxes, and army service. Even when there was peace, they couldn’t work the land because the rich owned it and used slaves instead of free workers.

According to some old writers, workers were forced out of their homes and had to move to towns to find jobs, which helped create more wealth and grow capital.

In 1860, some people were forced off their land and sent to Canada by trickery. Some escaped to mountains and islands, but the police chased them, fought with them, and they got away.

In the Scottish Highlands, old land ownership was changing fast. Landlords no longer cared about families who had lived there for generations. Instead, they rented land to whoever would pay the most and farm it in new ways to get the most profit with the least work. This meant fewer people lived on the land because many workers were let go. Those who lost their homes moved to towns to survive.

One writer said rich Scottish landowners treated villages and people badly, like enemies in a jungle. People were treated worse than animals, pushed off their land just to make money. Some landowners acted even worse than invaders who wanted to wipe out local people and turn the land into pasture.
