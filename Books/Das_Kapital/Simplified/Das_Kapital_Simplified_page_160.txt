The information above comes from a spinner in Manchester and can be trusted. In England, people used to figure out an engine’s power by the size of its cylinder. Now, they use a tool called an indicator to measure the real power.

The calculations in the book are just examples. We assumed that prices are the same as values. But later, in Book III, we’ll see that this isn’t actually true, even for average prices.

Senior, an expert, talked about some ideas that don’t really matter here. For example, he said that manufacturers count the money needed to fix machines as part of their profit. We won’t worry about whether his numbers are correct. Leonard Horner, who worked as a factory inspector for many years, showed that Senior’s numbers weren’t very reliable. Horner helped workers a lot and fought against factory owners and the government, who cared more about votes than about how hard the workers were treated.

Senior tried to explain how manufacturers think about the workday. The worker works 11½ hours a day, or 23 half-hours. The yearly work is made up of those same hours multiplied by the number of workdays. If 23 half-hours make £115,000 a year, then one half-hour is worth 1/23 of that. Twenty half-hours cover the money spent on the business. That leaves 3 half-hours for profit. One half-hour covers machine wear and tear, and the last hour (two half-hours) is the net profit. Senior showed how this profit fits into the working day.

Senior said that the English cotton industry’s success depends on this last working hour. But Dr. Andrew Ure argued that if kids under 18 leave the factory an hour earlier, instead of working 12 hours in a good environment, they’d spend that time doing nothing or getting into trouble. Since 1848, factory inspectors have criticized factory owners for this “last hour.” For example, Mr. Hovell said in 1855 that if Senior’s math was right, factories would have been losing money since 1850.

In 1848, after a law was passed to limit work to 10 hours, some flax mill owners asked workers to fight against the bill. They said more free time would make kids bad because “idleness is the parent of vice.” But factory reports showed that the work was very hard and the air was full of dust, making it painful to stay even 10 minutes in the spinning rooms. Workers had to be careful and quick all the time. So it was unfair for parents to call their kids lazy when they worked so hard for 10 hours in such tough conditions.
