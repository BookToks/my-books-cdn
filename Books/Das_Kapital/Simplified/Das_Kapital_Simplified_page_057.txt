He explains that early hunters and fishers, as owners of what they caught, traded fish and game based on how much work went into getting them. But he makes a mistake by imagining they used complicated tools like the 1817 London Exchange’s annuity tables to figure this out. The only societies he knew about were Mr. Owen’s parallelograms and the middle-class way of living.

Some people wrongly think that sharing property in its earliest form was only a Slavic or Russian thing. But we can prove that this kind of sharing existed among Romans, Teutons, and Celts, and even today, there are examples in India. Studying Asian, especially Indian, common property would show how different early sharing ways led to different ways of breaking up property later on. For example, the original types of private property in Rome and Teutonic lands came from different kinds of shared property in India.

Ricardo’s way of figuring out value, though the best so far, isn’t enough. The classical economists never clearly separate labor as it shows up in the value of a product from labor as it appears in what the product can be used for. They do notice labor in different ways—sometimes by amount, sometimes by quality—but they don’t realize that treating different kinds of labor as just amounts means they’re treating all labor as the same kind of human work. Ricardo agrees with Destutt de Tracy, who said that our abilities are our real wealth, and all riches come from work using those abilities. Things only have value because of the labor behind them, whether that value is how useful they are or how much they can be traded for. But Ricardo misunderstands Destutt. Destutt said that things get their two kinds of value (use value and exchange value) from the value of labor, but Ricardo thought labor itself was part of both values. Still, Ricardo doesn’t pay much attention to these two sides of labor and spends a lot of time arguing about small points with J.B. Say. In the end, he’s surprised that Destutt agrees with him that labor is the source of value, but also agrees with Say about what value means.

One big problem with classical economics is that it never figured out how value turns into exchange value when talking about products. Even Adam Smith and Ricardo, the best thinkers of their time, thought the form of value didn’t really matter or connect to what products actually are. This is partly because they focused so much on measuring value. But the real reason goes deeper: the form value takes is the most abstract and universal way a product shows itself in capitalist production, marking it as a special kind of social production and giving it its unique place in history.
