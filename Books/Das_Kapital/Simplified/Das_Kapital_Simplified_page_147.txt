Chapter 8

On the other hand, the part of capital that comes from workers’ effort, called labour-power, changes in value during production. It not only keeps its own value but also creates extra value, called surplus-value, which can change depending on the situation. This part of capital keeps changing and is called variable capital because it can go up or down. The same parts of capital that are seen as tools and workers from the production side are called constant and variable capital when looking at how extra value is made.

The idea of constant capital doesn’t mean its value can’t change. For example, if cotton costs sixpence one day and then a shilling the next because of a bad harvest, cotton bought before the price rise transfers its new, higher value to the product. Even cotton that hasn’t been spun yet will be worth more after the price goes up. This change in value has nothing to do with the spinning process that adds extra value. If the cotton hadn’t been spun, it could still be sold for the higher price. The less work done on the cotton, the easier it is to make a profit from price changes. That’s why investors prefer to trade materials like cotton or yarn rather than finished cloth when prices change quickly. The change in value comes from how the cotton is produced, not how it’s used in making new products.

The value of something depends on how much work goes into making it, but this depends on social factors. If it takes longer to grow cotton because of a bad harvest, all cotton already made becomes more valuable because it reflects the current amount of work needed.

Just like raw materials, the tools and machines used in production can also change in value. If new inventions let machines be made faster or cheaper, old machines lose value and add less value to the products made with them. But again, this change in value happens outside the actual production process. Once a machine is being used, it can’t add more value than it already has.

Changes in the value of tools or raw materials don’t change their role as constant capital. Also, changes in how much money is spent on tools compared to workers don’t change their roles either. Sometimes, technology changes a lot. For example, where ten people used ten simple tools to work on a small amount of material, now one person with one expensive machine can do the work of a hundred people. This means the value of tools (constant capital) goes way up while the value spent on workers (variable capital) goes down a lot.
