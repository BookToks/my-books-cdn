Even though machines have replaced a lot of workers, more factory workers can still be hired when new factories are built or old ones get bigger in a certain industry.

For example, imagine a business that spends £500 a week, with £200 on machines and materials, and £300 on paying workers. When machines are used, the money spent on machines goes up to four-fifths, and only one-fifth goes to workers, which means fewer workers are needed. If the business grows and spends £1,500, it can hire as many workers as before machines were used. If it grows to £2,000, it can hire even more workers than before. So, even if fewer workers are needed compared to the money spent, the actual number of workers can still go up.

We also know that as machines improve, more money is spent on machines and less on workers. The factory system changes a lot because of this, but sometimes there are breaks when factories only get bigger without changing the way they work. During these times, more workers are hired.

For example, in 1835, there were about 354,684 factory workers in certain UK industries. By 1861, there were 230,654 power-loom weavers alone. This growth seems small compared to the 800,000 hand-loom weavers and their families in 1838, plus many more workers who lost jobs in Asia and Europe.

Now, let's talk about things we see in real life that our theory hasn’t explained yet.

When factories grow and replace old handcrafts, it’s like an army with guns fighting one with bows and arrows. At first, machines make huge profits, which helps businesses grow fast and attract more investment money.

This first fast-growing time helps every industry that uses machines. But once factories are well established, and machines are made by other machines, and industries like coal mining, metalworking, and transportation are improved, the whole system gets flexible. It can grow very quickly, only limited by how much raw material is available and how much product can be sold.
