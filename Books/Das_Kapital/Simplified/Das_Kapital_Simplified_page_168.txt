The worker is just a person who represents the time spent working. All the differences between people disappear, and they are only seen as either “full-timers” or “half-timers.”

So far, we have talked about how work hours kept getting longer. This hunger for extra work was so bad that it forced the government to make laws to protect workers. Now, let's look at some types of jobs where workers are still treated very badly, or were until recently.

Mr. Broughton Charlton, a local judge, said at a meeting in Nottingham on January 14, 1860, that people working in the lace industry suffer more than anyone else in the country, or even in the civilized world. Kids as young as nine or ten are dragged out of their dirty beds at two, three, or four in the morning and forced to work until ten, eleven, or twelve at night. Their bodies get weaker, their faces pale, and they become like lifeless stones. It’s really horrible to see. No wonder some factory owners don’t want anyone to talk about it. The system is like total slavery—physically, socially, and mentally.

Imagine a town where people have to ask the government to limit work to only eighteen hours a day! We criticize slave owners in America, but is their cruelty worse than this slow destruction of human lives just so capitalists can make veils and collars?

The pottery factories in Staffordshire have been investigated by the government three times in the last 22 years. Reports from 1841, 1860, and 1863 show how badly children are treated. The children’s stories help us understand how hard the work is for adults, especially women and girls. Working in pottery is so tough that cotton spinning seems easy in comparison.

William Wood, who is 9 years old, started working when he was just 7 years and 10 months old. He carried molded pottery into the drying room and back every day, starting at 6 a.m. and finishing around 9 p.m. That’s 15 hours of work every day for a little kid! J. Murray, who is 12, said he sometimes started work at 4 a.m. and worked all night until 6 a.m. the next morning.
