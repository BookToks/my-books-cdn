When we figure out how much something is worth by comparing it to a set amount of another thing, like gold, we just assume that making that amount of gold takes a certain amount of work at that time. Prices usually change based on simple rules about how things are valued, which we talked about before.

If prices for lots of things go up, it can only be because either their actual value went up while money’s value stayed the same, or money’s value went down while things’ values stayed the same. If prices go down, it’s the opposite: either things lose value while money’s value stays the same, or money’s value goes up while things’ values stay the same. But just because money’s value changes doesn’t mean prices will change in the same way. Prices only change in that way if the things’ values stay the same. For stuff whose value changes at the same time as money’s value, prices might not change much at all. If their value changes slower or faster than money’s value, then prices go up or down depending on the difference between those changes.

Now, let’s talk about how prices are shown using money.

Over time, the amount of precious metal (like gold or silver) that money names stand for can stop matching the actual weight of metal those names used to mean. This happens for a few reasons: (1) Sometimes, foreign money is brought into a place where the money system isn’t fully developed yet — like in early Rome, where gold and silver coins from other places were used as money but had different names and weights than local coins. (2) As people get richer, more valuable metals replace less valuable ones as money. For example, copper was replaced by silver, and silver by gold. The name “pound” used to mean a pound weight of silver, but when gold took over, the same name was used for a much smaller weight of gold based on how their values compared. So, “pound” as a money name became different from “pound” as a weight name. (3) Kings and rulers often lowered the amount of precious metal in coins over many years, so the coins had less actual metal but still kept the same names. Because of these reasons, people got used to money names not matching exact weights anymore.

Since money standards have to be agreed on by everyone and controlled by rules, governments eventually set official standards. For example, a specific weight of gold, like one ounce, gets officially divided into parts with legal names like pound or dollar.

These parts, which we use as money units, are then split into smaller parts like shillings or pennies. But whether before or after these divisions, the real basis of money is still a certain weight of metal. The only difference is how it’s split and what it’s called.

So, when we say how much something costs, we now use the names of coins or parts of the gold standard instead of actual weights. Instead of saying “a quarter of wheat is worth an ounce of gold,” we say “it costs £3 17s. 10½d.” This way, prices show how much things are worth, and money is used as a way to keep track of those values.
