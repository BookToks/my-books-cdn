Even though the capitalist uses some of the money earned to pay workers fair wages to get more work done, it’s like a trick. It’s similar to a conqueror buying things from people they have already stolen from.

If the extra money helps pay the person who made it, that worker has to keep making the original money grow. But they also have to work more than before just to get back what they made earlier. When you look at it as a deal between the rich business owners and the workers, it doesn’t matter that new workers are paid with the unpaid work of old workers. The capitalist can even use some of that money to buy machines that replace workers with kids. Every year, workers create more value that helps pay for even more workers next year. This is called making money out of money.

The first extra money of £2,000 comes from the capitalist’s original £10,000, which he earned by working hard at the start. The second extra amount of £400 only comes from the £2,000 already earned before. From then on, owning the unpaid work of others is the only thing needed to keep getting more unpaid work. The more money the capitalist has, the easier it is to keep making more money.

The extra money comes from buying workers’ time with part of the original money, a fair deal based on the usual rules of buying and selling. Legally, workers choose to sell their work, and owners can use their money however they want. Because the new money comes from the first extra money, and every deal follows these rules, it seems like a fair trade. But actually, things have flipped. This fair trade is just an illusion.

First, the money paid for work is actually part of the product made by workers but taken without paying them fairly. Second, the capitalist doesn’t just get back that money but gets even more on top of it. The buying and selling of workers’ time looks like a simple business deal but hides what’s really happening. What really happens is the capitalist keeps taking the unpaid work of others and exchanging it for even more work.

At first, it seemed like people owned what they worked for. That made sense because people with things traded with each other fairly, and the only way to get what others had was by giving up your own things. But now, owning stuff means the rich have the right to take the unpaid work of others. Meanwhile, workers can’t even own what they make. This split between owning things and doing the work started from a law that was supposed to connect them.
