Let’s talk about the people who actually make the wealth—the working class.

Gladstone, a government leader, said it’s really sad that while regular people had less money and faced more struggles, the rich kept getting richer. This happened even though the poor were working harder. He said this in 1843.

Twenty years later, in 1863, Gladstone said the country’s taxable income had gone up a lot, especially for the wealthy. He believed this should help the working class by making everyday things cheaper. He thought that even though the rich got richer, the poor got a little better off too. But this doesn’t really make sense.

If poor people only got “less poor” while the rich got way richer, then they’re still pretty poor compared to before. If the very poor haven’t gotten better, they might have actually gotten worse because the rich got richer.

Also, things that people need to live, like food and fuel, actually got more expensive between 1860 and 1865. 

In 1864, Gladstone talked about how many workers were barely getting by, some not even earning more money than before. He said life for most workers was just a constant struggle to survive.

Another expert, Professor Fawcett, said that even though wages went up a bit, the cost of basic things also rose, so workers didn’t really feel richer. He said the rich got richer fast, but workers didn’t get much more comfortable. Many workers ended up owing money to shopkeepers and becoming almost like slaves to debt.

Earlier chapters explain how the British working class worked hard under tough conditions to create a lot of wealth for the rich.
