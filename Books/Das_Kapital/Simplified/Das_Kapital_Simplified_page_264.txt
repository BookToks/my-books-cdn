There is an important difference between making things by hand and making them with machines.

When people make things by hand, workers use tools to do each step, either alone or in groups. The workers get used to the process, but the process is also designed to fit the workers. This idea doesnâ€™t work with machines. With machines, the whole process is studied carefully without thinking about how humans will do it. Each step is broken down, and machines or chemicals are used to do every part.

Of course, making machines work well takes a lot of practice and experience. Each machine gives its work to the next machine, and since they all work at the same time, the product is always moving through different stages. Just like in hand-made work, the number and speed of machines have to be balanced so they all work smoothly together. The better the machines work as one continuous system, the less the product stops moving from start to finish. In hand-made work, each step is separate, but in a factory with machines, the steps need to flow without stopping.

A system of machines, whether they are all the same kind like in weaving, or different kinds like in spinning, works like a big robot when powered by an engine. But even if the whole factory is powered by steam, some machines still need workers to help them move or do certain parts. For example, some old machines needed hands-on help before newer automatic versions were invented. When a machine can do all its work by itself and only needs a worker to watch it, it is called automatic. These machines keep getting better with new inventions, like ones that stop automatically if something breaks or runs out.

A good example of continuous, automatic production is a modern paper mill. Looking at paper-making helps us see the differences between making things by hand, making them in a workshop, and making them automatically in a factory. Old German paper-making shows hand-made work, paper-making in Holland and France in past centuries shows workshop production, and modern England shows automatic factory production. India and China still have old traditional ways of making paper.

The most advanced way to make things with machines is when they are all connected and powered by one main machine, working together as a system.
