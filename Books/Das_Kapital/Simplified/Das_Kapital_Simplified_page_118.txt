Benjamin Franklin wrote about national wealth and how it should be looked at carefully.

Aristotle also talked about similar ideas long ago.

Profit usually doesn’t come from just trading things back and forth. If there was no profit before a trade, there won’t be any after it either.

From what we’ve studied, this means capital (money or resources used to make more money) can be created even if the price and value of something are the same. Capital can't be explained by prices being different from values. If prices do change, we first have to ignore those changes to understand the true process. Prices go up and down all the time, but over time they balance out to an average price. This average price helps business people make decisions because they know things won’t always be sold for more or less than this average over a long time. So, the real question is: How can capital be created if prices are controlled by this average price, which is close to the actual value of things? It’s important to know that average prices don’t always exactly match the true value, as some famous economists thought.

There’s a Latin saying, “Hic Rhodus, hic saltus!” which means “Here is Rhodes, here is where you jump!” It comes from a story about an athlete who bragged about a great jump he made in Rhodes. Someone challenged him to jump right then and there to prove it. The lesson is that people should be judged by what they actually do, not just what they say.

Hegel used this saying to explain that laws and rights should be about real life in society, not just ideas or dreams. He even made a pun with the Latin and Greek words to show that the tools to understand and improve society come from society itself, not from some far-off theory.

Now, about money becoming capital: money itself can’t change its value just by being money. Its job is to pay for things or be used to buy stuff. Money is like frozen value—it doesn’t change on its own.
