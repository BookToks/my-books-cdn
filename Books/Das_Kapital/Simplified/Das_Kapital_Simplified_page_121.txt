To live, a worker needs a certain amount of things like food, clothes, and shelter. The time it takes to make these things is the same as the time needed to create the worker’s ability to work. So, the value of a worker’s ability to work equals the value of the stuff they need to live.

But a worker only uses their ability by actually working. Working uses up their energy, muscles, and brain, which need to be restored. This means the worker needs enough resources to stay healthy and strong every day to keep working.

What a worker needs depends on where they live and the climate. Also, what people consider “necessary” changes over time and depends on how developed or civilized a country is. So, the value of a worker’s ability to work includes these historical and moral factors. Still, in any country at any time, we can roughly figure out how much a worker needs to live.

Workers don’t live forever. To keep workers available in the market, they have to have children to replace those who stop working or die. So, the cost of supporting workers also includes raising their children to become workers too.

If a worker needs special skills, they need training or education, which costs money too. This cost is usually small for regular workers but still adds to the total value of their ability to work.

The value of a worker’s ability to work depends on how much it costs to produce the things they need to live.

Some things, like food and fuel, are used every day and must be replaced daily. Others, like clothes and furniture, last longer and only need to be replaced sometimes. The worker’s income must cover all these costs averaged over the year.

If the daily cost of food is A, weekly cost of clothes is B, and quarterly cost of furniture is C, then the average daily cost is calculated by adding 365 times A, 52 times B, 4 times C, and so on, then dividing by 365.

If these daily goods include 6 hours of social labor, then half a day’s work is needed every day just to produce the worker’s ability to work.
