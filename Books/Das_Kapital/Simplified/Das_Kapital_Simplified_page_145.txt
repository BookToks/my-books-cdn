Chapter 8

It’s clear that tools and machines only add as much value to a product as they lose themselves while being used. If something isn’t made by human work, like land or wind, it doesn’t add value but still helps make something useful. These natural things don’t add to the product’s price, just its usefulness.

Here’s something interesting. Imagine a machine worth £1,000 that lasts 1,000 days. Every day, it loses a tiny part of its value, which goes into the product made that day. Even though the machine gets a bit less useful over time, it keeps working as a whole. So, the machine is fully involved in making the product but only adds value little by little.

On the other hand, some materials might be fully counted in value but only partly used in the work. For example, when spinning cotton, some cotton (about 15 lbs out of every 115 lbs) turns into waste called “devil’s dust.” This waste doesn’t become yarn but still adds value because losing this cotton is necessary to make the yarn. The same idea applies to all kinds of waste that can’t be reused. Sometimes, waste like iron shavings is collected and melted back into new iron for machines, which is a way of reusing value.

We’ve seen that things used to make products only add value when they lose their own value during the process. The most value they can add is the value they had before being used, based on how much work it took to make them. So, a raw material or machine costing £150 or 500 days of work can’t add more than that amount to the product. Their value comes from the work that originally made them, not from the current process. During production, their value moves from the old product to the new one, but this happens without the worker noticing.

The worker can add new value only by keeping old values because the work must be useful. To do useful work, the worker needs to use things already made, which transfer their value to the new product.
