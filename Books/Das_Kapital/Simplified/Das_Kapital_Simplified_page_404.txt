If you cut down the cotton trade by taking away jobs and lowering wages by about one-fifth, or five million, what would happen to the small shopkeepers? What about the rent for cottages? 

Think about how this would affect small farmers, better-off homeowners, and landowners. Can you think of a worse idea for the whole country than weakening a nation by sending away its best workers and ruining some of its most valuable businesses and wealth?

I suggest giving a loan of five or six million pounds, spread over two or three years. This loan should be managed by special officials added to local boards in cotton areas, with rules making sure people work or do something useful to keep their spirits up.

Can anything be worse for landowners or bosses than losing their best workers and making the rest feel hopeless by letting so many people leave, which would waste the money and value of a whole region?

Potter, who speaks for the manufacturers, talks about two kinds of “machinery” that belong to the factory owners. One is the machines in the factory, and the other is the workers who live in cottages outside the factory at night and on Sundays. One is lifeless, the other is alive.

The lifeless machines wear out and lose value every day, and because technology changes fast, they often need to be replaced with new machines after just a few months. But the living machines—the workers—actually get better the longer they work because their skills improve over time and get passed down from one generation to the next.

The Times newspaper replied to Potter by saying: “Mr. Edmund Potter thinks cotton factory owners are so important that to protect them, he wants to keep half a million workers trapped in a huge workhouse against their will. He asks, ‘Is the trade worth saving?’

“‘Of course it is,’ we say. Then he asks, ‘Is it worth keeping the machinery in good shape?’ Here we’re not so sure. By ‘machinery,’ Potter means the workers, but he says he doesn’t want to treat them like property.

“We don’t think it’s worth it, or even possible, to keep workers ‘in shape’ by locking them up and maintaining them like machines. People don’t work well if they’re stuck doing nothing, no matter how much you try to keep them ready. 

“Also, workers will get restless and upset in big cities if they have nothing to do. It might take a while to train new workers, but if we have smart workers and money, we can always find hardworking men to become new factory owners.

“Potter talks about the trade coming back in one to three years, and he says we shouldn’t let workers leave the country. He thinks it’s natural for workers to want to leave, but that the country should keep half a million workers and their 700,000 family members locked in the cotton areas. That means the country would have to control their unhappiness by force and support them with charity, hoping the factory owners might need them again someday.

“Now is the time for everyone in the country to step in and protect these workers from being treated like iron, coal, or cotton.”
