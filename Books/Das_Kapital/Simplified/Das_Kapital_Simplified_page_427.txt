But Hercules will hear the cries of the oxen and his prisoners, and he will look for Cacus even in the cliffs and among the rocks. He will free the oxen from the villain. 

Cacus is the bad guy who is a greedy moneylender. He steals, robs, and eats everything. He wonâ€™t admit he did anything wrong and thinks no one will catch him. This is because the oxen were dragged backward into his cave, making it look like they were let out by someone else. 

So, this moneylender tries to trick the world into thinking he is helpful and gives oxen to people, but really, he tears them apart and eats them all alone. Since we punish highway robbers, murderers, and thieves by breaking their wheel or beheading them, we should punish moneylenders even more harshly. We should hunt them down, curse them, and behead all usurers.

Martin Luther said this, and it shows how serious people were about punishing greedy moneylenders.
