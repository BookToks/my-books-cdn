116.) 26 G. Ortes wrote a book called “Delia Economia Nazionale libri sei” in 1777. He said, “Instead of creating useless plans to make people happy, I will focus on finding out why they are unhappy.”

27 There’s a book called “A Dissertation on the Poor Laws” by a guy named Rev. J. Townsend from 1786. Malthus, a famous thinker, often copied from Townsend’s work and also from Sir James Steuart, but changed some ideas. For example, Steuart said that slavery forced people to work because they were slaves. Now, people work because they have no choice, like they are slaves to their needs. But unlike some others, Steuart didn’t think workers should always be poor. Instead, he wanted people’s needs to grow so they would work harder.

28 Storch, another writer, made some points on page 223 of his book.

29 Sismondi also talked about these ideas on pages 79, 80, and 85.

30 Destutt de Tracy said, “Poor nations are those where people live comfortably, and rich nations are those where people are usually poor.”

31 The “Tenth Report of the Commissioners of H. M. Inland Revenue” from London in 1866 talks about money and taxes.

32 The same report continues with more information.

33 The numbers in the report are good for comparing, but the exact amounts are not fully true. Maybe £100,000,000 of income is not reported each year. The tax officials often complain about cheating, especially by businesspeople. For example, one company reported £6,000 profit but was found to have £88,000, and another reported £190,000 but admitted it should be £250,000.

34 The “Census” report says that John Bright claimed 150 landlords own half of England, and 12 landlords own half of Scotland. No one has proven this wrong.

35 The “Fourth Report of Inland Revenue” from 1860 also talks about income and taxes.

36 These incomes are the amounts left after some legal deductions.

37 In March 1867, the markets in India and China had too many British cotton products. In 1866, cotton workers had their wages cut by 5%. In 1867, after another wage cut, 20,000 workers in Preston went on strike. This was just before a big economic crisis started.

38 The “Census” report also mentions other facts on page 11.

39 Gladstone, speaking in the House of Commons on February 13, 1843, said it’s sad that while people are getting poorer and struggling more, the rich keep getting richer and enjoying more luxury.
