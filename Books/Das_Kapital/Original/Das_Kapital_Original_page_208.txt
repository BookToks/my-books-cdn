The same “high” Court of Justice discovered, during the American Civil War, a verbal ambiguity which exactly reversed the meaning of the law against the arming of pirate ships.

All medical testimony agrees on this point, and personal observation at different times has convinced me of it. Nevertheless, and exclusive of the terrible death-rate of children in the first years of their life, the official reports of Dr. Greenhow show the unfavourable health condition of the manufacturing districts as compared with “agricultural districts of normal health.” As evidence, take the following table from his 1861 report: — Pecentage of Adult Males 14.9 42.6 37.3 41.9 31.0 14.9 36.6 30.4 — Engaged in Manufactures Death-rate from 598 708 547 611 691 588 721 726 305 Pulmonary Affections per 100,000 Males Name of District Wigan Black Halifax Brad Maccle Leek Stoke- Woolst 8 healthy burn ford sfield upon- anton agricultural Trent districts Death-rate from 644 734 564 603 804 705 665 727 340 Pulmonary Affections per 100,000 Females Pecentage of Adult 18.0 34.9 20.4 30.0 26.0 17.2 19.3 13.9 — Females Engaged in Manufactures Kind of Female Cotton Do.

Instead of the protection against French importation, the absence of protection to English factory children now serves their turn.
 
 142 During 1859 and 1860, the zenith years of the English cotton industry, some manufacturers tried, by the decoy bait of higher wages for over-time, to reconcile the adult male operatives to an extension 209 Chapter 10 of the working day.
