“Spare the hand that grinds the corn, Oh, miller girls, and softly sleep. Let Chanticleer announce the morn in vain! Deo has commanded the work of the girls to be done by the Nymphs, and now they skip lightly over the wheels, so that the shaken axles revolve with their spokes and pull round the load of the revolving stones. Let us live the life of our fathers, and let us rest from work and enjoy the gifts that the Goddess sends us.” “Schonet der mahlenden Hand, o Müllerinnen, und schlafet Sanft! es verkünde der Hahn euch den Morgen umsonst!
 
 Däo hat die Arbeit der Midchen den Nymphen befohlen, Und itzt hüpfen sic leicht über die Räder dahin, Daß die erschütterten Achsen mit ihren Speichen sich wälzen, Und im Kreise die Last drehen des wälzenden Steins.
 
 Laßt uns leben das Leben der Väter, und laBt uns der Gaben Arbeitslos uns freun, welche die Göttin uns schenkt.” (Gedichte aus dem Griechischen übersetzt von Christian Graf zu Stolberg, Hamburg, 1782.) 75 There are, of course, always differences, in the intensities of the labour in various industries. But these differences are, as Adam Smith has shown, compensated to a partial extent by minor circumstances, peculiar to each sort of labour. Labour-time, as a measure of value, is not, however, affected in this case, except in so far as the duration of labour, and the degree of its intensity, are two antithetical and mutually exclusive expressions for one and the same quantity of labour.
 
 76 Especially by piece-work, a form we shall investigate in Part VI. of this book.

 81 The moral element played an important part in the above experiments. The workpeople told the factory inspector: “We work with more spirit, we have the reward ever before us of getting away sooner at night, and one active and cheerful spirit pervades the whole mill, from the youngest piecer to the oldest hand, and we can greatly help each other.” (l.c., p. 21.) 82 John Fielden, l.c., p. 32.

 87 This was altered in the “Parliamentary Return” of 1862. In it the actual horse-power of the modern steam engines and water wheels appears in place of the nominal. The doubling spindles, too, are no longer included in the spinning spindles (as was the case in the “Returns” of 1839, 1850, and 1856); further, in the case of woollen mills, the number of “gigs” is added, a distinction made between jute and hemp mills on the one hand and flax mills on the other, and finally stocking-weaving is for the first time inserted in the report.
