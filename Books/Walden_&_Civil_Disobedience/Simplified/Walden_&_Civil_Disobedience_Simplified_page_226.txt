Walden was frozen and dead, but now it’s alive again. This spring, it melted more slowly, like I said before.

The change from stormy, cold winter to calm, warm weather is something everyone can feel. It happens so fast it feels like a sudden moment. Suddenly, light filled my house, even though it was almost evening, the winter clouds were still there, and sleety rain was dripping from the roof. I looked out the window, and where there was ice yesterday, now there was a clear, calm pond that looked hopeful like a summer evening, reflecting a summer sky even though the sky above was hidden, as if it knew about a faraway place. I heard a robin singing far away—the first one I had heard in what felt like forever—and I knew I’d remember its beautiful song for a long time. Oh, the evening robin at the end of a New England summer day! I wish I could find the exact twig it was sitting on! The pine trees and small oak trees around my house, which had looked sad and droopy, suddenly looked bright, green, and alive again, like the rain had cleaned them up. I knew it wouldn’t rain anymore. You can tell winter is over by looking at any tree twig, even in your own wood pile. As it got darker, I was surprised to hear geese honking low over the woods, like tired travelers coming home late from southern lakes, complaining and comforting each other. Standing at my door, I heard their wings rushing close by; when they saw my light, they quieted down, turned around, and landed on the pond. So, I went inside, closed the door, and spent my first spring night in the woods.

The next morning, I watched the geese from my door through the mist. They were in the middle of the pond, about fifty rods away, so many and so loud it made Walden seem like a fake pond made just for them. But when I got closer to the shore, they all flew up with a big flap of wings when their leader gave a signal. There were twenty-nine of them flying in a line, circling over my head, then flying straight to Canada, with their leader honking regularly, hoping to find food in muddy pools. At the same time, a group of ducks flew up and followed their noisy cousins north.
