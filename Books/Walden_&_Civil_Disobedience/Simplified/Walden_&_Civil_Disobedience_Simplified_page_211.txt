Even when something is split or bored through, we don’t fully understand it.

What I’ve noticed about the pond is also true for morals and behavior. It’s like the law of averages. The idea of two main lines helps us find the sun in the solar system and the heart in a person. These lines also show the mix of a person’s daily actions and life experiences. Where these lines cross shows how strong or weak their character is. Maybe we just need to know the direction of their “shores” and their surroundings to guess how deep or complicated they are inside. If someone’s life is full of big challenges, like tall mountains around a shore, it suggests they have a deep, strong character. But if their life seems calm and smooth, it shows they might be shallow in that area. For example, a bold forehead in a person shows deep thinking. 

Everyone has a “bar” or barrier at the entrance to their special interests or habits, like a little harbor where they stay for a while. These habits aren’t random; their shape and size depend on the “land” around them, or their past and personality.

Sometimes this barrier grows bigger because of problems or changes, and it reaches the surface. What started as just a small habit can turn into a whole “lake,” separated from the bigger world. This lake might change and become sweet, dead, or swampy. When someone is born, it’s like this barrier appears somewhere in their life. Most of the time, we don’t navigate our thoughts well. Our ideas just float near safe places like poetry or science, where they only get fixed up for the world but don’t really become unique.

About Walden Pond, I haven’t found any water coming in or going out except rain, snow, and evaporation. Maybe if I had tools like a thermometer and measuring line, I could find some spots where water flows. Where water enters the pond, it should be coldest in summer and warmest in winter. When ice cutters worked there in 1846-47, they noticed some ice was thinner in one spot, which made them think there was an inlet there.
