He was strong and happy, like a pine tree or a rock. One time, I asked him if he ever felt tired at night after working all day. He looked me seriously and said, “No way, I’ve never been tired in my life.” But the smart and spiritual part of him was asleep, like a baby.

He only learned in a simple way, like how Catholic priests teach native people—not helping them really understand, but just to trust and respect. This kept him like a child, not a grown-up in his mind.

Nature gave him a strong body and made him happy with what he had. He was supported by respect and trust so he could live his whole life like a child. He was so real and simple that you couldn’t just introduce him to someone, like you can’t introduce a wild animal. You had to get to know him yourself. He never pretended to be anything else.

People paid him for work, which helped him live, but he never shared his thoughts with them. He was naturally humble—not because he tried to be humble, but because he never wanted more. To him, smarter men were like gods. If someone important was coming, he acted like they would take all the responsibility and forget about him completely.

He never heard praise. He especially respected writers and preachers because their work seemed like magic to him. When I told him I wrote a lot, he thought I only meant my handwriting, since he could write neatly too. Sometimes, I found the name of his hometown written nicely in the snow by the road, with the right French accent, and I knew he was nearby.

I asked if he ever wanted to write down his thoughts. He said he helped others write letters but never tried to write his own ideas. He said it would be too hard to decide what to write first, and spelling would make it worse.

Once, a smart reformer asked if he wanted to change the world. He laughed, surprised, and said in his Canadian accent, “No, I like it fine as it is.” A philosopher would have learned a lot from him. To strangers, he seemed like he didn’t know much, but sometimes I saw something different in him. I didn’t know if he was as wise as Shakespeare or as simple as a child, or if he was secretly a poet or just plain silly.
