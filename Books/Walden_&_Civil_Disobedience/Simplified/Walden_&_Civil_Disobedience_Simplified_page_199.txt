At twilight and during the night, rabbits came often and ate a big meal. All day, red squirrels came and went, giving me a lot of fun to watch with their moves.

One squirrel would come carefully through the bushes, running over the snow in quick bursts like a leaf blown by the wind. Sometimes it would run fast for a few steps, then suddenly stop with a funny look and even do a little flip, like it knew everyone was watching. It seemed like the squirrel acted like a performer, even though it was all alone in the forest.

Then, really fast, the squirrel would climb to the top of a young pine tree, like it was winding up a clock and talking to invisible spectators for no clear reason. Finally, it would reach some corn and pick a good ear. It would jump around in the same weird way to the top of my wood pile by the window, stare right at me, and sit there for hours.

At first, the squirrel would eat a lot and throw empty corn cobs around. Later, it got pickier, just tasting the inside of the kernels and playing with the corn. Sometimes the ear of corn would slip from its paw and fall, and the squirrel would look at it like it wasnâ€™t sure if it should grab it again, get a new one, or leave. It kept thinking about corn but also listened carefully to the sounds around.

The little bold squirrel wasted many ears of corn in one morning. Then, it would grab a bigger ear, much bigger than itself, balance it carefully, and start heading to the woods. It moved in a zig-zag way with many stops, dragging the corn like it was heavy and often dropping it. But it was determined to get it home.

This squirrel was a funny and strange little guy. I would later find corn cobs scattered all over the woods where it lived, sometimes far away in pine trees.
