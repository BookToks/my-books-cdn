But it happened just like I said.

All I could say about farming on a big scale was that I had my seeds ready. I’ve always grown a garden. Some people think seeds get better with age. I believe time helps separate the good seeds from the bad ones. When I finally plant, I won’t be as disappointed. But I want to tell my friends, live free and don’t tie yourself down if you can help it. It doesn’t really matter if you’re stuck on a farm or in jail.

Old Cato, who wrote “De Re Rusticâ,” is like my farming guide. The only translation I’ve seen doesn’t make sense, but he says, “When you think about buying a farm, don’t rush or be greedy. Look at it carefully and more than once.”

The more you visit, the more you’ll like it if it’s good. I won’t buy quickly, but I’ll keep checking it out as long as I live, and I want to be buried there so it will mean even more to me.

My next experience was similar, and I’ll explain it more later. For now, I want to say I’m not writing a sad story. I want to brag loud and proud, like a rooster crowing in the morning, just to wake my neighbors up.

When I first started living in the woods, meaning I stayed there both day and night, it was by chance on July 4th, 1845. My house wasn’t finished for winter. It only kept out the rain, with no plaster or chimney. The walls were made of rough boards with big gaps, so it was cool at night. The straight white wooden frames around the door and windows looked clean and fresh, especially in the morning when they were wet with dew. I imagined that by noon some sweet gum might ooze from the wood. To me, the house always felt special, reminding me of a cabin on a mountain I had visited the year before. It was an open, simple cabin, perfect for a traveling god to visit, and where a goddess might trail her dress.
