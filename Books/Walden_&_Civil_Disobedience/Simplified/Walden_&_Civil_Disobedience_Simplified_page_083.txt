When we only stick to books, even the best and most classic ones, and read just certain written languages, which are really just versions or local types, we risk forgetting the language that everything and every event naturally speaks without any fancy words. This language is the richest and most real one. A lot of things get published, but very little is truly remembered. The light that shines through a window when it’s partly covered won’t be remembered once the cover is fully taken away. No study method or routine can replace the need to always stay awake and aware. What good is history, philosophy, poetry, no matter how carefully chosen, or even the best friends or daily habits, compared to the skill of always paying attention to what’s really happening? Will you just be a reader or student, or will you be someone who truly sees? Read your future, notice what’s right in front of you, and keep moving forward.

I didn’t read books the first summer; I worked hoeing beans. Sometimes, I even did better than that. There were moments when I couldn’t bring myself to give up enjoying the present moment for any work, whether it needed thinking or doing. I like having plenty of free time in my life. Sometimes, on a summer morning, after my usual bath, I’d sit in my sunny doorway from sunrise until noon, lost in daydreams, surrounded by pine, hickory, and sumac trees, in complete peace and quiet. Birds would sing or quietly fly through the house. I stayed like this until the sun moved to my west window or the sound of a traveler’s wagon on a far highway reminded me time had passed. I grew during those times like corn growing overnight, and those moments were better than any physical work I could have done. They didn’t take time away from my life but added to it. I understood what people from the East mean by deep thinking and giving up constant doing. Most of the time, I didn’t care how the hours passed.

The day went on as if it were meant to help me finish some task; it was morning, and now it was evening, and nothing important was done. Instead of singing like the birds, I quietly smiled at my endless good luck. Just like the sparrow sang on the hickory tree in front of my door, I had my own quiet laugh or soft song that he might hear from my home.
