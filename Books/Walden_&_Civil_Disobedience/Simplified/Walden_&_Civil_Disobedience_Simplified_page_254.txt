I haven’t paid a poll tax for six years. One time, I was put in jail for one night because of that. While I stood there looking at the thick stone walls, the heavy wooden and iron door, and the iron bars blocking the light, I thought how silly it was that they treated me like just a body to lock up. I wondered why they never tried to use me in a better way instead of locking me up.  

I realized that even though there was a stone wall between me and the other people in my town, there was an even bigger wall they had to get past before they could be as free as I was. I didn’t feel trapped at all, and the walls seemed like a waste of stone and bricks. I felt like I was the only one who had paid my tax.   

The people in charge didn’t know how to treat me and acted like they were rude or uneducated. They messed up in every threat and even in every nice thing they said because they thought I wanted to be locked behind those walls. I couldn’t help but smile when they locked the door on my thoughts because my thoughts just went right past them, and those thoughts were the real danger. Since they couldn’t reach me, they decided to punish my body instead. It was like when kids can’t get back at a person they don’t like, so they hurt that person’s dog. I saw that the State was dumb and scared, like a woman afraid to lose her silver spoons, and it didn’t know who were its friends or its enemies. I stopped respecting it and felt sorry for it.  

The government never tries to challenge a person’s mind or morals directly, only their body and senses. It doesn’t have better smarts or honesty, just more physical power. I wasn’t born to be forced. I want to live how I want. Let’s see who’s stronger. What power does a crowd have? Only those who follow a higher law than me can make me obey. They want me to be like them. I don’t hear about people being forced to live a certain way by lots of others. What kind of life would that be?  

When a government says, “Your money or your life,” why should I rush to give them my money? Maybe they’re in trouble and don’t know what to do. That’s not my problem. They need to figure it out themselves, just like I do. It’s not worth whining about. I’m not responsible for making society work well. I’m not the son of the engineer. I see that when an acorn and a chestnut fall next to each other, neither stops growing to make room for the other. They both grow the best they can until one maybe covers and stops the other.
