What news! It’s even more important to know about something that never gets old! “Kieou-he-yu, a great leader from the state of Wei, sent a man to Khoung-tseu to ask about his news. Khoung-tseu had the messenger sit next to him and asked, ‘What is your master doing?’ The messenger said respectfully, ‘My master wants to fix his mistakes, but he can’t get rid of all of them.’

After the messenger left, the philosopher said, ‘What a great messenger! What a great messenger!’ Instead of boring tired farmers with long sermons on their day off—since Sunday should be the end of a bad week, not the start of a new one—with just one more boring talk, the preacher should shout loudly, ‘Stop! Wait! Why do things seem fast but actually move so slowly?’

People believe lies and fake stuff more than real truth. If everyone focused only on what’s real and didn’t get tricked, life would feel like a magical story, like the Arabian Nights. If we only respected what really matters and what must be, then music and poetry would fill the streets.

When we are calm and smart, we see that only big and important things last forever—small fears and little joys are just shadows compared to real life. This is always exciting and inspiring. When people close their eyes, sleep, and accept illusions, they build their daily lives on fake things. Kids, who just play at life, understand its real rules better than adults, who don’t live well but think they are wiser because of their mistakes.

I read in a book from India about a king’s son who was kicked out of his city as a baby and raised by a forest man. Growing up, he thought he was part of the wild tribe around him. One of the king’s helpers found him and told him who he really was. Then the prince understood his true identity. The Hindu philosopher says that souls make the same mistake because of where they live, until a holy teacher shows them the truth, and then they know they are divine.

I think people in New England live boring lives because they don’t look deep enough below the surface of things.
