When I opened my door in the evening, they would quickly run away with a squeak and a bounce. When they were close, I just felt sorry for them. One evening, a small one sat by my door just a few steps from me. At first, it shook with fear but didn’t want to move. It was a tiny, thin creature with ragged ears, a sharp nose, a short tail, and thin paws. It looked like nature was running out of stronger animals. Its big eyes looked young but sick, almost swollen.

I took a step, and suddenly it jumped away over the snow, stretching its legs and body out smooth and long. Soon it disappeared into the forest, looking wild and free, showing how strong and proud nature is. Its thin body made sense because that’s just how it was.

People call it Lepus, levipes, or light-foot. What kind of country would it be without rabbits and partridges? They are some of the simplest and oldest animals around, known since ancient times and still here today. Their colors and bodies match the leaves and the ground closely, and they’re either birds or animals with legs. When a rabbit or partridge suddenly runs away, it doesn’t feel like seeing a wild animal, just something as natural as leaves rustling.

Partridges and rabbits always survive, like true natives of the land, no matter what changes happen. If the forest is cut down, new plants and bushes grow, giving them hiding places, and their numbers grow even more. A place without hares must be a very poor land. Our forests are full of both, and near every swamp, you can see partridges or rabbits. They’re caught sometimes in twig fences and horsehair snares, which a cowboy watches over.
