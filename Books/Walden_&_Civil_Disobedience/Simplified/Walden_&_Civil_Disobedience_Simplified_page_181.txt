A man’s dinner after going out in the snow to hunt, or even steal, the wood to cook it with is much more interesting. His bread and meat taste better. There is plenty of dead wood and branches in the forests near most towns to make many fires, but right now they are not being used. Some people think this wood actually stops new trees from growing. There was also driftwood from the pond.

One summer, I found a bunch of pine logs tied together by Irish workers who built the railroad. I pulled some of these logs up onto the shore. After soaking in water for two years and then sitting out of the water for six months, the logs were still good, even though they were very wet and hard to dry. One winter day, I had fun sliding pieces of the logs across the pond. I skated behind carrying one end of a long log on my shoulder while the other end slid on the ice. Sometimes, I tied several logs together with a birch branch and dragged them using another long branch with a hook.

Even though the logs were soaking wet and very heavy, they burned for a long time and made a very hot fire. I even thought the soaking helped them burn better because the pitch inside them burned slowly, like a lamp.

Gilpin wrote about the people living near English forests. He said that when people built houses or fences on the edge of forests without permission, it was a big problem. The old forest laws punished this because it scared away animals and hurt the forest. But I cared more about protecting the deer and plants than hunters or woodcutters did. I felt like I was the forest’s protector. If any part of the forest burned, even if I accidentally caused it, I felt very sad—much more than the owners did. I was also upset when the owners cut down trees.

I wish farmers today would feel some of the respect the ancient Romans had when they cut down trees in special groves. The Romans believed these groves were sacred to gods. Before cutting trees, they made offerings and said prayers asking the gods to protect them and their families.
