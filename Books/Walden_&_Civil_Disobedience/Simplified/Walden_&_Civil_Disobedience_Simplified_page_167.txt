If you sit quietly in a nice spot in the woods, you’ll see all the animals and insects around you one after another.

But I saw something less peaceful. One day, when I went to my wood pile, or really just a pile of stumps, I saw two big ants fighting. One was red, and the other was black and much bigger, almost half an inch long. They were locked together, struggling and rolling around on the wood chips without letting go.

Looking closer, I saw that the chips were full of ants fighting. It wasn’t just one fight—it was a full-on war between the red ants and the black ants. Sometimes two red ants would fight one black ant. These ant armies covered the whole area, and there were lots of dead and dying ants everywhere.

It was the only battle I ever saw while it was happening. The red ants were like republicans, and the black ants were like imperialists. They fought hard, but I couldn’t hear any noise. The ants were even more determined than human soldiers.

I watched two ants locked in battle in a sunny spot. They looked like they would fight all day or until one died. The smaller red ant had bitten the black ant’s front and kept biting a feeler. The black ant was bigger and shook the red ant around, and I noticed it had already ripped off some of the red ant’s legs.

They fought like bulldogs, never wanting to back down. It was clear their motto was “Win or die.” Then, a single red ant came running over the hill, looking excited. He either had already fought and won or hadn’t joined the battle yet. He looked healthy, with all his legs still there. Maybe his mom told him to come back with his shield or dead. Or maybe he was like a hero who had been waiting to fight and now wanted to help his friend.

He saw the fight between the big black ant and the small red ant. He quickly got close and then jumped on the black ant’s leg. Now there were three ants stuck together, fighting so hard it was like they were glued together forever.
