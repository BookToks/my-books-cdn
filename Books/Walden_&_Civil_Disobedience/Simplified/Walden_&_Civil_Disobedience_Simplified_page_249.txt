Doing the right thing because you believe it is right can change how things are. It’s a big deal and can shake up everything that was normal before. It doesn’t just split countries or churches—it can even split families, and it can split a person inside, separating the bad from the good in them.

Unfair laws exist: should we just obey them, try to change them and obey until they change, or break them right away? Most people think they should wait until most people agree to change the laws. They believe that if they fight back too soon, things will get worse. But the problem is the government itself makes the fix worse than the problem. Why doesn’t it try to fix things before they get bad? Why doesn’t it listen to smart people who want to help? Why does it fight and get scared before something really hurts? Why doesn’t it want its citizens to spot problems and do better?

Why does it always punish the good people who try to change things, like Jesus, Copernicus, Luther, or call heroes like Washington and Franklin rebels?

You’d think that openly saying you don’t accept the government’s power would be the one thing it really punishes clearly. But no, if a person refuses to pay a small tax once, they can be locked up forever. Yet if someone steals a lot of money from the government, they might be free again soon.

If unfairness is just a normal part of how the government runs, maybe let it be for now; maybe things will get better— or the system will break down eventually. But if the unfairness is built into the system itself, and it forces you to hurt others, then I say break the law. Make your life a force that stops the system. What I have to do is make sure I don’t help the wrong I hate.

As for using the methods the government offers to fix problems, I don’t know of any. They take too long, and a person’s life could be over by the time things change.
