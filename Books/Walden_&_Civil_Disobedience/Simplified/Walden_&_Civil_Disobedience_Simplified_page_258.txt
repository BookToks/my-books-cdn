Sometimes I wonder why people are mean, even though they don’t mean to be. They just don’t know better, and they would act nicer if they understood. So why make your neighbors treat you badly when they don’t really want to? But then I think, that’s no reason for me to treat others badly or let them suffer more pain in a different way.

Sometimes I tell myself, when millions of people ask you for just a little money, without being angry or having bad feelings, and they can’t change their minds, and you can’t ask anyone else for help, why fight so hard? You don’t fight cold, hunger, wind, or waves like this. You just accept them quietly. You wouldn’t put your head in a fire on purpose. But because I see these millions of people as real humans, not just things, I know I can appeal to them and even to the one who made them. But if I put my head in the fire, there’s no one to help me, and I have only myself to blame.

If I believed I should be okay with people as they are, and treat them like that, I might just accept everything as the will of God, like some religions teach. But the difference here is that I can actually do something to change how people act, unlike trying to change nature, like Orpheus tried with rocks and animals.

I don’t want to argue with anyone or start fights. I don’t want to be picky or think I’m better than others. I’m actually looking for a reason to follow the laws. I usually just go along with them. Every year when the tax man comes, I think about the government and the people to find a good reason to obey.

“We should treat our country like our parents. And if we ever stop wanting to honor it because of work or money, we should remember our conscience and beliefs, not just want power or gain.”
