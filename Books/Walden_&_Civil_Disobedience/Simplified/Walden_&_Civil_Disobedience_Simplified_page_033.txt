The ice on the pond hadn’t melted yet, but there were some open spots. The ice looked dark and wet. There were a few little snow flurries on the days I worked there. But most of the time, when I walked out onto the railroad on my way home, I saw the yellow sand pile shining in the hazy air. The rails sparkled in the spring sunshine. I heard birds like the lark and pewee, who had come back to start a new year with us.

The spring days were nice. It felt like the cold, unhappy winter was melting away, just like the earth. Life that had been asleep was starting to wake up and stretch. One day, my axe handle broke, so I cut a green hickory tree to make a new wedge. I hammered it in with a stone and soaked it in a pond hole to make the wood swell. While I was there, I saw a striped snake swim into the water and lie at the bottom. It didn’t seem bothered by me staying for over fifteen minutes. Maybe it was still waking up from being frozen.

I thought that maybe people are like the snake. They stay in a low, simple state because they haven’t been “woken up” yet. But if something like spring’s power woke them up, they would rise to a better, more exciting life. I had seen snakes on cold mornings, stiff and frozen in parts, waiting for the sun to warm them. On April 1st, it rained and melted the ice. Early that foggy day, I heard a lost goose flying over the pond, making strange noises like a spirit in the fog.

I kept cutting and shaping wood for days, making studs and rafters with my small axe. I didn’t have many deep thoughts, so I sang to myself:  
Men say they know many things;  
But look! They have taken wings,—  
The arts and sciences,  
And a thousand tools;  
The wind that blows  
Is all that anybody knows.

I made the main timbers six inches square. I only shaped two sides of most studs and one side of the rafters and floor timbers, leaving the bark on the rest. This way, they stayed straight and were even stronger than sawed wood.
