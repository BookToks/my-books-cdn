I think that once we learn our letters, we should read the best books in literature, not just keep repeating easy words and simple reading forever in the lower grades.

Most people are okay if they read or listen to one good book, like the Bible, and then spend the rest of their lives reading only easy stuff. There’s a set of books in our library called Little Reading, which I thought was about a town I hadn’t been to.

Some people, like cormorants and ostriches, can eat all kinds of this easy reading, even after a big meal, because they don’t want to waste anything. If others make this kind of reading, they are the ones who read it. They read the nine thousandth story about Zebulon and Sephronia and how they loved each other like no one ever did before. Their love story doesn’t go smoothly—there are ups and downs, and they keep going!

Some unlucky person climbs up a church steeple, who really shouldn’t have gone that high. Then the writer rings the bell to gather everyone to hear about how he got down again! I think these made-up heroes should be turned into weathercocks, like they used to put heroes among the stars, and let them spin there until they get rusty, so they don’t bother real people with their nonsense. Next time the writer rings the bell, I won’t move even if the church burns down.

They read things like “The Skip of the Tip-Toe-Hop, a Romance of the Middle Ages,” by the famous author of “Tittle-Tol-Tan,” coming out in parts every month; a big deal, but don’t all come at once. They read with wide eyes and old-fashioned curiosity, with stomachs ready to digest it all, just like a four-year-old reading a cheap copy of Cinderella—without getting any better at pronunciation, expression, or understanding the lesson.

The result is a dull mind, slow thinking, and a general drop in all mental abilities. This kind of sweet, easy reading is made every day more carefully than real, healthy bread, and it sells better too.
