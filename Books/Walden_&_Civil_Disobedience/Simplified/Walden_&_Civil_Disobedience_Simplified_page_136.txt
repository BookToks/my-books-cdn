I notice the paver. If the name didn’t come from some English place—like Saffron Walden—you might think it was called Walled-in Pond at first.

The pond was actually my well, already dug. For four months every year, its water is as cold as it is always clean; I think it’s as good as, if not better than, any water in town. In winter, water that’s out in the open air is colder than water from springs or wells that are covered.  

On March 6, 1846, the pond water I kept in the room where I sat from 5 p.m. until noon the next day was 42°—that’s even one degree colder than the coldest well water in the village. The Boiling Spring water that day was 45°, the warmest of all, even though it’s the coldest spring in summer when it’s not mixed with shallow, still water.  

Also, in summer, Walden never gets as warm as most water left in the sun because it’s deep. During the hottest days, I would put a bucket of pond water in my cellar overnight to keep it cool all day. Sometimes I used a nearby spring too. The water stayed just as good a week later and didn’t taste like water from a pump.  

If someone camps by a pond for a week in summer, they only need to bury a bucket of water a few feet deep in the shade to keep it cool without needing ice.

People have caught pickerel in Walden, including one that weighed seven pounds, and another that pulled a fishing reel so fast the fisherman guessed it weighed eight pounds because he didn’t see it. There are also perch and pouts over two pounds, shiners, chivins or roach fish, a few breams, and a couple of eels, one weighing four pounds—I mention this because fish weight is often what makes them famous, and these are the only eels I know of here.  

I also vaguely remember a little five-inch fish with shiny sides and a greenish back, kind of like a dace. I mention it mainly to connect my facts to stories.
