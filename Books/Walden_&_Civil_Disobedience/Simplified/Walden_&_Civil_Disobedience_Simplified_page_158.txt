It is hard to make and eat food that is simple and clean without boring the mind; but I think this is what real eating should be—feeding both the body and the imagination together. Maybe it can be done.

Eating fruits in moderation won’t make us feel bad about wanting food, and it won’t stop us from doing important things. But if you add too much extra stuff to your food, it can harm you. Living by fancy, rich food isn’t worth it.

Most people would feel embarrassed if they had to cook the exact kind of meal that others prepare for them every day, whether it’s meat or vegetables. Until this changes, we aren’t truly civilized, and if we call ourselves gentlemen or ladies, we aren’t acting like real men and women. This shows what needs to change. It might be pointless to ask why people don’t accept eating meat and fat. I’m sure they don’t. Isn’t it shameful that humans eat animals? Yes, people can live by hunting other animals, but it’s a sad way to live—anyone who has caught rabbits or slaughtered lambs knows this—and the person who teaches us to eat a kinder and healthier diet will help all of humanity.

No matter what I do myself, I believe that as humans grow and improve, they will stop eating animals, just like savage tribes stopped eating each other when they met more civilized people.

If you pay attention to the small but steady voice inside you, which is always right, you might not know where it will take you—even to crazy places—but that is the path you have to follow as you get stronger and more faithful.

Any small, clear feeling one healthy person has will eventually be stronger than the old rules and traditions of the world. No one has ever followed their true inner voice and been completely wrong. Even if it makes you physically weaker, no one can say it was a bad choice because living this way is following higher values. If you greet each day and night happily, and life feels fresh and full of beauty like flowers and sweet herbs, more alive and everlasting—that is real success. Nature itself congratulates you, and you have every reason to feel grateful. The greatest things in life are the hardest to see and believe. We often doubt they exist and forget them. But they are the most real things. Maybe the most amazing and true experiences are never fully shared between people. The true reward of my daily life is as hard to describe as the colors of morning or evening.
