Even though Project Gutenberg™ tries hard, their electronic books and the devices or files they use might have problems. These problems can include missing or wrong parts, mistakes from typing, copyright issues, broken disks, computer viruses, or codes that don’t work with your device.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, NO PROMISES ABOUT DAMAGES – Besides the “Right of Replacement or Refund” in paragraph 1.F.3, Project Gutenberg™, the trademark owner, and anyone sharing these books aren’t responsible for any damage, costs, or legal fees you might have. YOU AGREE THAT YOU CAN’T HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR NEGLIGENCE, BROKEN PROMISES, OR CONTRACT ISSUES EXCEPT AS SAID IN 1.F.3. THEY WON’T PAY FOR ANY KIND OF DAMAGE, EVEN IF YOU WARN THEM IT COULD HAPPEN.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT TO REPLACE OR REFUND – If you find a problem with the electronic book within 90 days of getting it, you can ask for your money back by writing to whoever gave you the book. If you got it on a physical disk or drive, you have to send that back too. The person who gave you the book can choose to give you a new copy instead of a refund.

If you got the book online, they might let you download it again instead of giving a refund. If the second copy is also bad, then you can ask for a refund without any more chances to fix it.

1.F.4. Except for the replacement or refund right in 1.F.3, the book is given to you ‘AS-IS’, meaning there are no other promises about how good it is or if it will work for what you want.
