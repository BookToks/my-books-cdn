Government is a tool people use to try to leave each other alone. When it works best, it lets people live their lives without too much interference. Business and trade are really good at getting past the problems that lawmakers keep creating. If we only judged lawmakers by what they do, not what they say, they might seem like troublemakers who block trains just for fun.

But speaking realistically and as someone who cares, I don’t want no government right now, like some people say. I want a better government right away. Everyone should say what kind of government they would respect, and that’s the first step to making it happen.

The real reason why the majority gets to rule is not because they are always right or fair to the minority, but because they are stronger. 

A government where the majority always decides what’s right isn’t truly fair. Can’t there be a government where people’s consciences decide what’s right and wrong, and the majority only handle practical stuff? Should anyone ever give up their conscience to the government? Why do we all have a conscience then? I think we should be people first, and subjects second. It’s better to respect what is right rather than just obey the law. I only have to do what I think is right. It’s true that a company or group has no conscience, but a group of people who care does. Laws don’t make people more fair; sometimes, even good people become part of unfairness just by following laws.

One common problem with respecting laws too much is that you might see soldiers, from the leaders to the youngest helpers, marching perfectly to war even if they don’t want to, even if it goes against their sense of right and wrong. That makes it really hard for them and can make their hearts heavy.
