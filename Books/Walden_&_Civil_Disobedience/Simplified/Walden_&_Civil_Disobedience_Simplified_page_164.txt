Angle-worms are hard to find around here because the soil hasn’t been made rich with manure, so they’re almost gone. Digging for bait is almost as fun as catching fish, especially if you’re not too hungry; today, you can have all the fun yourself. I suggest you start digging with the spade down by the ground-nuts, where you see the johnswort plants waving. I’m pretty sure you’ll find one worm for every three patches of dirt you turn over if you look carefully among the grass roots, like you’re pulling weeds. If you want to go farther, that’s a good idea because I’ve noticed that the amount of good bait grows a lot the farther you go.

Hermit alone. Let me think; where was I? I feel like I was almost in the right mindset; the world was spread out at some angle. Should I go to heaven or go fishing? If I stop thinking about this now, will I get another chance like this? I was really close to understanding everything like never before. I’m afraid my thoughts are drifting away. If it would help, I’d whistle to call them back. When we get an offer, is it smart to say, “We’ll think about it?” My thoughts have left no clues, and I can’t find the way back. What was I thinking of? It was a foggy day. I’ll try reading these three sentences from Confucius; maybe they’ll bring that feeling back. I don’t know if I was feeling sad or starting to feel joy. Note to self: There’s only one chance like this.

Poet. Hey, Hermit, is it too early? I’ve caught exactly thirteen big worms, plus some small or broken ones; the small ones are good for little fish because they don’t cover the hook too much. Those village worms are too big; a small fish can eat one without getting caught.

Hermit. Alright, let’s go. Should we go to the Concord? There’s good fishing there if the water isn’t too high.

Why do these exact things around us make up the world? Why do people have just these kinds of animals nearby, like only a mouse could fit in that little space? I think Pilpay and others made animals useful for us because they are all like helpers, carrying some part of our thoughts.
