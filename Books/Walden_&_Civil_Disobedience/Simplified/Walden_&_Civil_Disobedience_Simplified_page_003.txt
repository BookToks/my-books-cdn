Walden and On the Duty of Civil Disobedience by Henry David Thoreau

Thoreau lived simply in the woods at a place called Walden Pond to learn about life and nature. He wanted to show that it’s important to live honestly and focus on what really matters, not just money or stuff.

He believed people should think for themselves and not just follow the rules blindly. If a law is unfair, it’s okay to disobey it peacefully to make things better.

Thoreau thought that by standing up for what is right, even if it means breaking the law, you can help bring change. He wanted people to be brave and do what they believe is right, even if it’s hard.
