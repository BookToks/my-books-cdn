One summer day, when I was working in the field, a man carrying pottery stopped his horse near me and asked about Wyman the younger. He had bought a potter’s wheel from Wyman a long time ago and wanted to know what happened to him. I had read about potters and their wheels in the Bible, but I never thought the pots we use today came from that old time or grew on trees like gourds. I was happy to learn that pottery was still made nearby.

Before I lived here, an Irishman named Hugh Quoil lived in Wyman’s old house. People called him Colonel Quoil. They said he had been a soldier at the Battle of Waterloo. If he were alive, I would have liked to hear his stories. He worked digging ditches. While Napoleon was sent to St. Helena, Quoil came to live in Walden Woods. His story was sad. He acted like someone who had traveled a lot and spoke very politely. He wore a big coat even in summer because he had bad shaking fits, and his face was bright red. He died on the road near Brister’s Hill soon after I moved here, so I didn’t really know him as a neighbor.

Before his house was torn down, people stayed away from it and called it “an unlucky castle.” I went inside once. His old clothes were folded on his bed like they were part of him. His broken pipe lay on the floor, not a broken bowl by the spring, which he said he never visited even though he’d heard of it. There were dirty playing cards scattered on the floor. A black chicken that no one could catch, as quiet as night, still lived in the next room. Behind the house was a garden that had been planted but never weeded because of his shaking fits. It was harvest time, but the garden was full of weeds that stuck to my clothes instead of giving fruit.

A woodchuck’s skin was stretched out on the back of the house, a trophy from his last battle, but he wouldn’t need warm clothes like a cap or mittens anymore.
