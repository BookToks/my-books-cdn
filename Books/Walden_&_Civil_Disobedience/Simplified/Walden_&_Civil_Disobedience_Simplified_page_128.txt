The Pope’s Homers would soon be shared properly. — “There were no wars, Faginus stood by while a cup was placed before the feast.” “People didn’t fight when they only wanted simple wooden bowls.” 

“You who lead the people, why do you need to punish them? Love goodness, and people will be good too. The qualities of a great person are like the wind; the qualities of an ordinary person are like the grass. When the wind blows, the grass bends.”

Sometimes, when I got tired of being around people and all their gossip, and when I had no friends left in my village, I walked even farther west than usual, into parts of town where hardly anyone went. I went “to fresh woods and new fields,” or, while the sun was setting, I ate huckleberries and blueberries on Fair Haven Hill and saved some to eat for the next few days.
