I don’t think too highly of myself, but maybe other people do. I have only felt lonely once since I moved to the woods. It was a few weeks after I arrived, and for about an hour, I wondered if being close to other people was really important for a happy and healthy life. Being alone felt kind of bad.

At the same time, I knew this feeling was a little crazy, and I thought I would feel better soon. While it was raining gently, I suddenly felt a nice kind of company from nature. The sound of the raindrops and everything around my house felt friendly and comforting, like it was holding me up. This made me forget about wanting to be near people.

Every little pine needle seemed to be sharing kindness with me. I clearly felt that something in nature was connected to me, even in places people usually think are wild and lonely. I realized that the closest and most human thing to me wasn’t a person or a neighbor. From then on, I thought no place could ever feel strange to me again.

Some of my best times were during long rainstorms in spring or fall. When the rain kept me inside all afternoon and morning, I felt calm listening to the constant sound of rain hitting the roof. Early twilight would come, leading to a long evening where I had time to think deeply.

During strong northeast rains that made the village houses struggle, when the maids stood ready with mops and buckets to stop water from coming inside, I sat behind my door in my little house, which was all entryway, and I really enjoyed feeling safe inside.

One time, a heavy thunderstorm struck a big pine tree across the pond. The lightning made a perfect spiral groove all down the tree, like someone carved it to use as a walking stick. I saw that mark again recently, and it made me feel amazed and a little scared. That powerful lightning bolt came from the calm sky eight years ago.

People often tell me, “I think you’d feel lonely down there and want to be closer to others, especially on rainy or snowy days and nights.”
