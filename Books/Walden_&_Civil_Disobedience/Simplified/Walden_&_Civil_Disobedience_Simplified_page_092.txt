In the evening, I heard a cow mooing far away past the woods. At first, I thought it was some singers I knew who sometimes came by, wandering over hills and fields. But then I wasn’t upset when I realized it was just the cow making its natural sound. I don’t mean to be rude, but I want to say I liked those young singers because their voices were a bit like the cow’s music, and they were part of nature.

Every summer, at exactly 7:30 after the evening train passed, whippoorwills would sing for about half an hour. They sat on a tree stump near my door or on the roof’s highest point. They started singing almost like clockwork, within five minutes of the sun going down, every night. This gave me a great chance to learn about how they lived.

Sometimes I heard four or five whippoorwills singing at the same time in different parts of the woods. One would sing just a little after another, like a song with several parts. They were so close I could hear little clicks after each note and even a buzzing sound, like a fly caught in a spider’s web but louder. Sometimes one would fly around me in circles in the woods, probably because I was near its eggs. They sang on and off all night and then again just before dawn, still sounding beautiful.

When other birds were quiet, screech owls started their sad songs, like women mourning. Their loud screams were really creepy. It wasn’t the simple owl sounds poets write about, but a serious, spooky song, like two lovers who hurt themselves singing about their love in a dark forest. I liked hearing their cries, their sad back-and-forth calls by the woods. It reminded me of music and singing birds but darker, full of sadness and regret. These owls felt like spirits of lost souls who once walked the earth doing bad things and now pay for their sins by singing sad songs in the places where they went wrong. They showed me how wild and strange nature can be. One owl would cry, “Oh, I wish I had never been born!” and then fly restlessly to a new tree branch. Then it would cry again, “I wish I had never been born!”
