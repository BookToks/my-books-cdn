There are lots of little tracks in the sand where some creature has walked back and forth. Around wrecks, the sand is covered with tiny cases made by caddis worms from small grains of white quartz. Maybe these worms made the tracks since you can find some of their cases in the furrows, even though the tracks look too big for them to make.

But the ice is what’s most interesting, and you should try to study it as soon as it freezes. If you look closely the morning after it freezes, you’ll see that most of the bubbles, which first looked like they were inside the ice, are actually right under it. More bubbles keep rising from the water below, while the ice is still solid and dark—you can see the water through it.

The bubbles are very clear and pretty, about as big as a small grain of sand, and you can even see your reflection in them through the ice. There might be 30 or 40 bubbles in just one square inch. Inside the ice, there are also narrow, long bubbles standing straight up, some shaped like cones, or sometimes tiny round bubbles stacked like beads on a string. But these bubbles inside the ice are fewer and not as easy to see as the ones under it. 

Sometimes, I threw stones on the ice to test how strong it was. When the ice broke, air went with it, making big white bubbles under the ice. One day, I came back 48 hours later, and those big bubbles were still there, even though the ice had grown an inch thicker. But because it had been warm like an Indian summer, the ice wasn’t clear anymore. Instead of showing the green water and the bottom, it looked white or gray and cloudy. Even though it was thicker, the ice wasn’t much stronger because the air bubbles had gotten bigger and merged together. They weren’t lined up anymore but piled up like shiny coins or thin flakes.

The ice had lost its beauty, and it was too late to look at the bottom. Curious about where the big bubbles were, I broke off a piece of ice with one bubble in it and flipped it over. The new ice had formed around and under the bubble, trapping it between two layers of ice.
