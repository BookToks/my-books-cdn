It's amazing how valuable wood still is today, even in this new country, and it's worth more than gold in some ways.

Even with all our discoveries and inventions, no one ignores a pile of wood. Wood is just as important to us as it was to our ancestors long ago. They made bows out of it, and we make gun-stocks from it. More than thirty years ago, a man named Michaux said that wood for fuel in New York and Philadelphia costs almost as much, or even more, than the best wood in Paris. This is true even though these cities need over three hundred thousand cords of wood every year and have farms all around them. Here, the price of wood keeps going up, and people wonder how much more expensive it will get this year. Tradesmen and workers often visit the forest just to watch the wood auction and sometimes pay a lot to pick up leftover wood after the woodchopper is done. For many years, people from all over—farmers, city folks, rich and poor, smart and wild—have needed wood to keep warm and cook their food.

I couldn't live without wood either.

Everyone seems to like their woodpile in a special way. I like having mine right outside my window, and the more wood chips there are, the better—they remind me of the fun I had working. I had an old axe that no one wanted, and on sunny winter days, I would play around cutting wood stumps I found in my bean field. Like my driver said when I was plowing, the wood warmed me twice—once while I was chopping it and again when it was burning. No other fuel gives off more heat. People told me to take my axe to the blacksmith to fix it, but I fixed it myself by putting a strong hickory handle on it. It might have been dull, but it worked well.

A few pieces of fat pine wood were very special. It's cool to think about how much good firewood is still hidden underground. In past years, I often searched on hills where pine trees used to grow and dug up the fat pine roots. These roots last a really long time. Even stumps that are thirty or forty years old can still be solid inside, even though the outer wood has turned into dirt, shown by the thick bark rings a few inches from the center.
