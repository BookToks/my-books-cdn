In the end, I believe this: “The best government is no government at all.” And when people are ready for that, that’s the kind of government they will have.

Government is just a tool to get things done, but most governments aren’t very good, and sometimes they’re really bad. People have many good reasons to not like standing armies, and those reasons can also be used to argue against standing governments. The army is just one part of the government.

The government is the way people have chosen to make decisions, but it can be misused and twisted before the people can really control it. For example, the Mexican war happened because a few people used the government to do what they wanted, even though most people didn’t agree with it at first.

This American government is like a tradition, even though it’s pretty new, trying to keep itself going without breaking, but it’s losing strength all the time. It isn’t as strong as one determined person; one person can control it easily. It’s like a fake gun made of wood for the people; if they ever use it seriously against each other, it will break. But we still need it because people want some kind of complicated system that makes noise to feel like there is a government.

Governments show how people can trick themselves for their own benefit. Government is useful, sure, but it never really helped anything by itself except by getting out of the way quickly. It doesn’t keep the country free, it doesn’t help settle new lands, and it doesn’t educate people. The real work has been done by the American people themselves, and they could have done even more if the government hadn’t gotten in the way sometimes.
