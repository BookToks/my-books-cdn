In spring, when people cut big holes in the ice, ponds usually start to melt earlier because the wind moves the water and wears down the ice. But that didn’t happen to Walden Pond that year because it quickly grew a new, thick layer of ice to replace the old one.

Walden Pond melts later than other ponds nearby because it is deeper and doesn’t have a stream flowing through it to help melt the ice. I’ve never seen it melt during winter, even in the very cold winter of 1852-3.

It usually starts to melt around the first of April, about a week or ten days after Flint’s Pond and Fair-Haven. The ice begins to melt on the north side and in the shallow parts where it froze first. Walden Pond shows the real progress of spring better than any other water nearby because it isn’t affected much by short cold spells. A few cold days in March can slow down the melting of other ponds, but Walden’s temperature keeps rising almost all the time.

On March 6, 1847, the temperature in the middle of Walden Pond was 32°F, the freezing point. Near the shore, it was 33°F. On the same day, in the middle of Flint’s Pond, the temperature was 32.5°F, but in shallow water under thick ice, it was 36°F. This difference of 3.5 degrees between deep and shallow water in Flint’s Pond explains why it melts sooner than Walden.

The ice in the shallow parts was several inches thinner than in the middle. During winter, the middle was warmer and had thinner ice. Anyone who has walked in the shallow water near the shore in summer knows the water there is warmer than farther out in the deep parts. In spring, the sun not only warms the air and land but also shines through thick ice. The sunlight reflects off the bottom in shallow water, warming the water and melting the ice from below while also melting it from above. This makes the ice uneven and full of air bubbles until it becomes like a honeycomb and finally melts away quickly during a spring rain.
