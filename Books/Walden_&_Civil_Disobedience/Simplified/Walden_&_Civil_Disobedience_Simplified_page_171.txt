One calm October afternoon, I was paddling along the north shore. On days like these, the lake feels very still, like soft milkweed floating on the water. I looked all over the pond for a loon but didn’t see one. Suddenly, one loon came out from the shore and sailed toward the middle of the pond, a little bit in front of me. It started its wild laugh, giving away where it was.

I chased it with my paddle, and it dived underwater. When it came up again, I was closer than before. It dived again, but I guessed the wrong way it would go. This time, we were far apart when it surfaced. It laughed long and loud, this time with even more reason. The loon was really smart and tricky. I couldn’t get closer than about six boat lengths.

Every time it surfaced, it looked around carefully at the water and land. It chose the spot to come up where there was the most open water and farthest from my boat. It was amazing how fast it decided where to go and then acted on it. The loon led me to the widest part of the pond and didn’t want to leave.

While it thought one thing, I tried to guess what it was thinking. It was a fun game on the smooth pond, me against the loon. Suddenly, the loon would disappear under the water, and I had to guess where it would show up next. Sometimes, it popped up on the other side of me, as if it swam right under my boat.

The loon could swim for a long time without getting tired. When it swam far out, it would dive again right away. No one could tell where it was under the water because it could swim fast and deep, like a fish. People say loons have been caught in New York lakes 80 feet under the surface with fishing hooks, and Walden Pond is even deeper.

The fish must be surprised to see this strange bird swimming through their schools! But the loon seemed to know exactly where it was underwater, moving much faster than on the surface. Sometimes, I saw a ripple where it came close to the surface, just sticking its head out to check, then diving right away.

I learned it was better to rest and wait than to try guessing where it would come up next. Many times, when I was looking one way, I’d suddenly hear its weird laugh coming from behind me.
