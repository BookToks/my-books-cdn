I don’t want to say these things, but it’s not because of the topic—I don’t care how rude my words are—I just can’t talk about them without showing my own flaws. We talk openly about some kinds of desire, but stay quiet about others. We’ve become so embarrassed that we can’t even talk simply about natural human needs. Long ago, in some places, every part of life was respected and controlled by law. Nothing was too small for the Hindu lawmaker, even if it sounds strange to us now. He taught how to eat, drink, have sex, go to the bathroom, and more, treating these things as important, not just little things.

Everyone builds a temple called their body for the god they believe in, in their own special way, and they can’t just replace it with something else. We’re all artists, and our material is our own flesh, blood, and bones. Being noble makes a person’s looks better, while being selfish or overly focused on pleasure makes them worse.

John Farmer sat at his door one September evening after a hard day’s work, still thinking about his job. After washing up, he sat down to relax his mind. It was a cool night, and some neighbors worried about frost. He hadn’t thought long before he heard someone playing a flute, and the music matched his mood. He still thought about work, but he realized these thoughts didn’t matter much. They were like dead skin constantly falling off.

But the flute’s notes came from a different place than his work, waking up parts of him that were asleep. The music made him forget about the street, the village, and his life there. A voice inside asked, “Why do you live this boring, hard life when you could have an amazing one? The same stars shine over other places.” But how could he leave and start that new life? The only idea he had was to practice new self-control, to connect his mind and body, respect himself more, and improve bit by bit.
