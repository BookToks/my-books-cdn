When the water is really stirred up on a clear day, it can look darker blue than the sky from a distance. Sometimes, when you’re on the water and look carefully, you can see an amazing light blue color that changes like shiny silk or a sword blade. This blue is even brighter than the sky and mixes with dark green on the waves, which then looks muddy by comparison. The color is kind of glassy greenish-blue, like the winter sky you see through clouds before sunset. But if you take just a glass of this water and hold it up to the light, it looks completely clear, like air. People say big glass sheets look green because of their thickness, but small pieces are clear.

I’ve never tested how much Walden water you’d need to see a green tint like that. The river water near us looks black or very dark brown if you look straight down, and it usually gives your skin a yellowish color when you swim. But this water is so clear that a person swimming looks almost white, like marble, which is kind of weird. Because your body looks bigger and twisted underwater, it can look really strange—like something from a Michael Angelo painting.

The water is so clear that you can see the bottom even when it’s 25 or 30 feet deep. If you paddle over it, you can spot tiny fish swimming far below, only about an inch long. You can tell the perch apart by their stripes, and you might think these fish live simple lives in the water. One winter, many years ago, I was cutting holes in the ice to catch fish called pickerel. When I stepped onto the ice, I threw my axe back onto it, but somehow it slid right into one of the deep holes, where the water was 25 feet deep.

Curious, I lay down to look through the hole and saw the axe standing upside down on its head, with the handle sticking up and slowly moving with the water’s pulse. It could have stayed there forever, swaying until the handle rotted away—if I hadn’t bothered it. I made another hole over it with my ice chisel, cut a long birch branch nearby, tied a slip-noose to the end, and carefully lowered it over the axe handle. Then I pulled the axe out by pulling the birch branch with the rope.
