I built the chimney after I finished hoeing in the fall, before I needed a fire to stay warm. While waiting, I cooked outside on the ground early in the morning. I still think this way is sometimes easier and nicer than the usual way. When it rained before my bread was baked, I put some boards over the fire and sat under them to watch my bread. I had some nice, calm time doing that. Back then, my hands were busy a lot, so I didn’t read much. Even little scraps of paper on the ground, my holder, or tablecloth were fun to look at and felt just as good as reading the Iliad.

It might be better to build more carefully than I did. For example, think about how a door, window, cellar, or attic fit with human needs. Maybe we shouldn’t build anything extra until we have a good reason besides just what we need right now. There’s something natural about a person building their own house, like a bird building its own nest. Who knows, if people made their homes with their own hands and got food simply and honestly, maybe everyone would become creative and poetic, like birds who always sing when building nests. But sadly, we act like cowbirds and cuckoos, which lay eggs in nests made by other birds and don’t sing nicely for travelers. Will we always leave building to the carpenter? What does architecture really mean to most people? In all my walks, I never saw someone building their own simple, natural house. We all belong to the community. It’s not just the tailor who depends on others; it’s also the preacher, the merchant, and the farmer. Where will this division of work end? What is its real purpose? Sure, others can think for me sometimes, but that doesn’t mean they should stop me from thinking for myself.
