We can never get enough of Nature. We need to feel refreshed by seeing its endless energy, huge and amazing places, the seashore with old shipwrecks, the wild forests with both living and dying trees, thunder clouds, and rain that lasts for weeks and floods the land. We need to see things going beyond our limits, and life living freely where we don’t usually go.  

We feel better when we watch a vulture eating dead animals, even if it grosses us out, because it shows how Nature stays strong and healthy. There was a dead horse near the path to my house, and sometimes I had to walk around it, especially at night when the air was heavy. But knowing that Nature’s appetite was still strong made me feel better. I like seeing that Nature has so much life that many creatures can be eaten by others without causing problems. Small animals like tadpoles get eaten by herons, turtles and toads sometimes get run over on the road, and sometimes it even seems like flesh and blood have rained down! Accidents happen, but they don’t mean much in the big picture. A smart person sees Nature as innocent. Poison isn’t really poisonous, and wounds aren’t always deadly.  

Feeling sorry for things is hard to keep up. Compassion has to be quick and real, and it doesn’t work well if it becomes routine.  

In early May, trees like oaks, hickories, and maples started growing new leaves around the pine woods by the pond, making the place look bright like sunshine, even on cloudy days, like the sun was peeking through the fog and shining on the hills. Around May 3rd or 4th, I saw a loon on the pond. During the first week of May, I heard birds like the whippoorwill, brown-thrasher, veery, wood-pewee, and chewink. I had already heard the wood-thrush earlier. The phoebe bird came by again and looked in my door and window to check if my house was good enough for her, hovering with quick wings and holding on with her claws while she looked around.  

The yellow pollen from the pitch-pine soon covered the pond, stones, and rotten wood along the shore, so much you could fill a big barrel with it. This is what people call “sulphur showers.” Even in the old story Sacontala by Calidas, they talk about streams dyed yellow with golden lotus dust.
