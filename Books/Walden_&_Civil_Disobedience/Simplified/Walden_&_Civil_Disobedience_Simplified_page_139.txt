It’s like melted glass that has cooled but not completely hardened, and the tiny spots in it are pure and beautiful, like the little flaws in glass. Sometimes you can see a smoother, darker part of the water, separated from the rest like by an invisible web, where water spirits seem to rest.

From a hilltop, you can see a fish jump almost anywhere; whenever a pickerel or shiner snaps up an insect on the smooth surface, it clearly shakes up the whole lake. It’s amazing how clearly this simple fact shows itself — the fish’s attack can’t be hidden — and from far away, I can see the ripples spreading out in circles when they are several feet wide.

You can even spot a water-bug (Gyrinus) moving nonstop over the smooth water from a quarter of a mile away because they make small ripples that look like two lines spreading apart. But the water striders glide over without making noticeable ripples. When the water is rough, there are no skaters or water-bugs on it, but on calm days, they come out from the shore and slowly cover the surface by making short jumps.

It’s relaxing on a nice fall day, when the sun feels warm, to sit on a tree stump up high, look over the pond, and watch the tiny circles that keep appearing on its otherwise smooth surface, surrounded by the reflection of the sky and trees. Across the big pond, nothing disturbs the water, but when a ripple appears, it quickly fades away, like when you shake a vase of water and the waves move toward the edges until everything is calm again.

Not a fish can jump or an insect fall on the pond without making those soft circles, like the pond is gently breathing, full of life. The feelings of joy and pain are mixed up in these waves. The lake feels so peaceful! Once more, nature shines brightly like it does in spring. Every leaf, twig, stone, and spiderweb sparkles in the afternoon sun like it does with morning dew. Every move of an oar or insect makes a flash of light, and if an oar drops, the echo sounds sweet.

On a day like this, in September or October, Walden is like a perfect mirror made by the forest, surrounded by stones that seem as precious to me as if they were rare treasures. Nothing so beautiful, pure, and big as a lake, maybe, exists on Earth. It’s like sky water. It doesn’t need a fence. Nations come and go without spoiling it.
