The mice that lived in my house weren’t the usual kind that people say were brought here from other places. They were a wild native type that you don’t find in the village. I sent one to a famous scientist, and he found it very interesting. When I was building my house, one of these mice had its nest under it. Before I finished the second floor and cleaned up, it would come out every day at lunchtime to pick up crumbs near my feet.

It probably had never seen a person before. It soon got used to me and would run over my shoes and climb up my clothes. It could climb the walls of the room in short jumps, like a squirrel, which it moved like. One day, I was leaning on a bench, and it ran up my clothes, along my sleeve, and around the paper holding my lunch. I kept the lunch close and played a little game with it. When I finally held still a piece of cheese between my fingers, it came and nibbled it right from my hand. After that, it cleaned its face and paws like a fly would and then walked away.

A small bird called a phoebe built a nest in my shed, and a robin built one in a pine tree growing next to the house to stay safe. In June, a very shy bird called a partridge walked her babies past my windows. She moved them from the woods behind my house to the front, making clucking sounds like a mother hen. She acted just like a mother hen of the forest. When you got close, the babies suddenly scattered like a whirlwind, and they looked so much like dry leaves and sticks that many travelers didn’t even notice them. Some travelers almost stepped on the babies without realizing it, and they heard the mother bird flying away and making worried sounds. Sometimes, the mother bird would roll and spin in front of you in such a funny way that you couldn’t tell what kind of bird she was. The babies would stay very still, often hiding their heads under leaves, only paying attention to their mother’s calls. They wouldn’t run away again, so you might stand near them or even step on them without seeing them. I have even held some babies in my hand, and they just stayed there, calm and still, because they trusted their mom and their instincts. Their natural behavior is so strong that once, after I put them back on the leaves, one accidentally fell on its side and stayed in the same position for ten minutes with the others. These babies are not helpless like most young birds; they are more developed and grow faster than even baby chickens.
