I planted about two and a half acres of land that was a little higher up. The land had only been cleared about fifteen years ago, and since I had already pulled out some tree stumps myself, I didn’t add any fertilizer. But during the summer, when I was hoeing, I found old arrowheads in the soil. This showed that a long time ago, a group of people had lived here and grown corn and beans before white settlers came. This meant the soil had already been used for growing these crops.

Before any animals like woodchucks or squirrels ran across the road, and before the sun was high above the small oak trees, I started working in my bean field while the dew was still on the plants. Even though farmers told me not to, I think it’s best to do your work while the dew is still there. I worked barefoot in the cool morning, feeling the soft, wet sand under my feet like an artist shaping clay. But later, when the sun got hot, my feet got blistered. I walked slowly back and forth between the long green rows of beans, on the yellow, rocky land. One end of the field had a small oak tree area where I could rest in the shade, and the other end had a blackberry patch where the berries got darker while I finished another row. My job was to pull out weeds, cover the bean plants with fresh soil, and help the beans grow instead of weeds like wormwood and grass. This was my daily work. Without horses, cattle, hired workers, or fancy tools, I worked slowly but got to know my bean plants very well.

Even though working hard with your hands can feel like tough, boring work, it’s better than doing nothing. It always teaches you something important, and for someone who likes to study, it gives good results. I worked hard while travelers passed by on their way west through Lincoln and Wayland, riding comfortably in their carriages with relaxed arms and loose reins. I was the local farmer working hard at home. Soon, my farm was far out of their view and mind. It was the only open field near the road, so they talked about it a lot. Sometimes I even heard things they didn’t mean for me to hear, like “Beans so late!”
