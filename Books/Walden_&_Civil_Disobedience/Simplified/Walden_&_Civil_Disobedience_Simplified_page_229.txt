This scene made me think about falconry and how noble and beautiful that sport is. I thought the bird might be called a Merlin, but I don’t really care about its name. It was the most graceful flight I had ever seen. It didn’t just flap like a butterfly or glide like big hawks. Instead, it played confidently in the air, rising again and again with a strange chuckle. It fell freely and beautifully, spinning like a kite, then recovered from its high flips as if it had never touched the ground.

It seemed to have no friends in the world—just playing alone with the morning and the sky. It wasn’t lonely, but it made everything below feel empty. Where was its parent, family, or creator? It lived in the air but was connected to the earth only by an egg laid somewhere in a rocky crack. Or maybe its nest was up in a cloud, made from rainbow colors and sunset light, lined with soft summer mist. Its home was now some rocky cloud in the sky.

Nearby, I caught a rare mix of golden, silver, and shiny copper-colored fish that looked like a string of jewels. I have explored those meadows many times on early spring mornings, jumping from little hills to willow roots, when the river valley and woods were filled with such pure, bright light it could wake the dead if they were sleeping in their graves, as some believe. This shows that life never really ends. Everything must live in such light. Death, where is your power? Grave, where is your victory?

Our village life would get boring if it weren’t for the wild forests and meadows around us. We need the feeling of wildness sometimes—to walk through marshes where birds like bitterns and meadow-hens hide, and hear the booming sound of snipes. We need to smell the soft grass where only wild, quiet birds build nests, and see mink crawling close to the ground. While we are eager to explore and learn everything, we also want some things to stay mysterious and unknown. We want the land and sea to stay wild and full of secrets because some things just can’t be fully understood.
