They would split up as soon as something interesting happened in their adventures. Most importantly, like I said before, a person who travels alone can leave right away; but if you travel with someone else, you have to wait until they’re ready, and that could take a long time.

Some people in my town say this is selfish. I admit, I haven’t done much to help others so far.

I have given up some things because I felt I should, including this kind of fun. Some people have tried to convince me to support a poor family in town. If I had nothing better to do—I guess the devil keeps busy people busy—I might try that. But when I thought about helping like that and even offered it, the poor people all said they preferred to stay poor.

While many in my town work hard to help others, I hope at least one person can focus on different, less caring interests. You need a special talent for charity, just like for anything else. Also, there are already lots of people trying to do good.

I’ve tried helping fairly, and strangely enough, I found it doesn’t suit me. I probably wouldn’t give up what I do for the good society wants, even to save the whole world. I think many others being strong in their own work is what keeps the world going.

But I wouldn’t stop anyone from following their own special gift. To those who put their whole heart into helping others—the work I refuse—I say, keep going, even if people call it bad, which they probably will.

I don’t think my situation is unusual; many readers might say the same. When it comes to doing something—though I can’t promise my neighbors would say it’s good—I believe I’d be great to hire. But what that “something” is, my boss would have to figure out. Any good I do, in the usual sense, is separate from my main work and mostly accidental.
