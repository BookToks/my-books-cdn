One man suggested having a book where visitors could write their names, like at the White Mountains, but luckily, I remember everyone well enough, so that’s not needed.

I noticed some interesting things about the people who came to visit me. Girls, boys, and young women seemed happy to be in the woods. They looked at the pond and flowers and enjoyed their time. But men who worked in business or farming only cared about being alone and working, and how far away I lived from everything. Even though they said they sometimes liked walking in the woods, it was clear they didn’t really enjoy it.

There were busy men who spent all their time working to make or keep money; ministers who talked about God like it was only their topic and didn’t like other opinions; doctors, lawyers, and worried housekeepers who even looked into my cupboards and bed when I wasn’t home—how did Mrs. —— know my sheets weren’t as clean as hers? Also, young men who stopped acting young and chose safe, normal jobs—all these people said I couldn’t do much good living the way I did. That was the tricky part.

Old and sick people, or those who were scared, no matter their age or gender, thought a lot about getting sick, having accidents, or dying suddenly. To them, life seemed really dangerous— but what danger is there if you don’t think about it? They believed a smart person should live somewhere safe, where a doctor like Dr. B. could help quickly.

To these people, the village was like a team that protected each other, and you’d guess they wouldn’t go picking berries without bringing a medicine kit. The truth is, if someone is alive, there’s always a chance they might die, though that chance is smaller if they’re already not very healthy. Everyone faces risks in life.

Finally, there were the self-called reformers, the most annoying of all. They thought I was always bragging, singing, “This is the house that I built; this is the man who lives in the house that I built.” But they didn’t realize the next line is, “These are the people who bother the man who lives in the house that I built.”
