Gilian Baker’s. When I called to see her in June, 1842, she was out hunting in the woods, as she usually did. (I’m not sure if she was a male or female, so I’m using “she” because it’s more common.) Her owner told me that she came to the neighborhood a little over a year before, in April, and was finally taken into their house. She was dark brownish-gray, with a white spot on her throat and white feet. She had a big bushy tail like a fox. In winter, her fur grew thick and flat along her sides, making stripes about ten or twelve inches long and two and a half inches wide. Under her chin, the fur was like a muff—loose on top and matted like felt underneath. In spring, these patches of fur fell off.

They gave me a pair of her “wings,” which I still keep. There was no sign of any skin between them. Some people thought she might be part flying squirrel or another wild animal, which isn’t impossible. Scientists say that the marten and domestic cat can sometimes have babies together. This would have been the perfect kind of cat for me to have if I kept any—because why shouldn’t a poet’s cat have wings, just like his horse?

In the fall, the loon (Colymbus glacialis) came as usual to moult and swim in the pond. He made the woods ring with his wild laughter before I even got up. When word got out that he had arrived, all the Mill-dam hunters got ready, going out in small groups with special rifles, bullets, and spy-glasses. They moved through the woods like falling leaves, at least ten men for every loon. Some took one side of the pond, others the opposite side, because the poor bird couldn’t be in two places at once. If he dived on one side, he had to come up on the other.

But then a kind October wind would blow, rustling the leaves and making waves on the water. This made it impossible to see or hear the loon, even though the hunters scanned the pond with their spy-glasses and fired their guns. The waves seemed to help the birds, and the hunters had to give up and go back to town and their work. Still, the hunters were often successful. When I went to get water early in the morning, I often saw this proud bird swimming out of my cove just a few yards away. If I tried to catch up to him in a boat to watch how he moved, he would dive and disappear completely. Sometimes I didn’t see him again until late in the day. But on the water’s surface, I was better than him. He usually left when it started to rain.
