If you stand right in front of the truth and face it head-on, you will see the sun shining on both sides like a shiny sword. You will feel its sharp edge cutting through you deeply, and then you will be ready to end your life happily. Whether it is life or death, we only want what is real. If we are really dying, let us hear the cough in our throat and feel cold in our fingers and toes; if we are alive, let us keep doing what we need to do.

Time is like a stream where I go fishing. I drink from it, but while I drink, I see the sandy bottom and realize it is shallow. Its thin flow moves away, but forever time stays. I want to drink deeper; I want to fish in the sky, where the bottom is covered with stars. I can’t count a single one. I don’t even know the first letter of the alphabet. I always regret that I’m not as smart as I was when I was born.

The mind is like a sharp tool; it cuts and finds the secrets of things. I don’t want to use my hands more than I have to. My head is like my hands and feet. I feel all my best abilities are in it. My gut tells me my head is made for digging, like how some animals use their nose and paws. With it, I want to dig and find a way through these hills. I believe there is something valuable here; using special tools and signs, I think so, and this is where I will start digging.
