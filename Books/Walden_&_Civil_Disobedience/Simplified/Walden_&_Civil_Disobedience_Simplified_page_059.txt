I never thought I would do anything worse than what I have done. I don’t know, and never will know, a worse person than myself.

I think what really makes reformers sad isn’t just feeling bad for others who are struggling, but their own personal problems, even if they are the best people. If they fix their own issues and feel better, they might leave their kind friends without feeling sorry. I don’t talk against tobacco because I never used it; that’s something people who quit have to deal with. But I have done other things I could warn against. If you ever try to help others, don’t brag about it, because it doesn’t matter. Help someone who’s drowning, tie your own shoelaces, take your time, and do some good work for free.

Our behavior has gotten worse because of how we interact with very good people. Our hymn books have a strange mix of praising and blaming God, and it feels like even prophets cared more about calming fears than giving hope. Nowhere can you find simple, honest joy in life or real praise of God. I feel happy when others succeed or are healthy, even if they seem far away; I feel sad and hurt when people fail or are sick, even if I understand their pain. So, if we want to help humanity in a real way, using natural or spiritual methods, we should first be simple and healthy ourselves, clear our minds, and take in life fully. Don’t just watch over the poor, try to be one of the great people in the world.

I read a story in the Gulistan, or Flower Garden, by Sheik Sadi of Shiraz. They asked a wise man why, out of many famous trees made by God, only the cypress is called “free,” even though it doesn’t bear fruit. He said every tree has its own fruit and season when it’s fresh and blooming. The cypress is different because it’s always green and strong. That’s how free people are—always steady. Don’t focus on things that don’t last; the Tigris River will keep flowing through Baghdad even after the rulers are gone. If you have a lot, be generous like a date tree. But if you don’t have much to give, be free like the cypress.
