I was never lost or scared, even in bad weather, though I faced some tough storms. It’s darker in the woods at night than most people think. I often had to look up through the trees to find my way. When there was no clear path, I used my feet to feel the faint trail I had made, or I used my hands to find certain trees, like passing between two pine trees that were only eighteen inches apart, even on the darkest nights.

Sometimes, after coming home late on a dark, muggy night, I would feel the path with my feet while my eyes couldn’t see anything. I would be daydreaming the whole way until I woke up when I had to lift the gate latch. Sometimes I couldn’t remember a single step of my walk. I thought maybe my body could find its way home on its own, like how your hand knows how to reach your mouth without thinking.

A few times, when a visitor stayed late and it got dark, I had to lead them to the path behind the house and then tell them which way to go. They had to follow the path more by feeling with their feet than by seeing. One very dark night, I showed two young men who had been fishing the way home. They lived about a mile away through the woods and knew the route well. But a day or two later, one of them said they got lost most of the night near their own home and didn’t get back until morning. It had rained a lot, and the wet leaves soaked them completely.

I’ve heard of many people getting lost even in village streets when it’s so dark you can “cut it with a knife.” Some people living outside town who came shopping had to stay overnight because they couldn’t find their way home. Even well-dressed visitors have gone half a mile off their path, feeling the sidewalk with their feet but not knowing when they turned the wrong way.

Being lost in the woods is a strange but important experience. Even in a snowstorm during the day, you might find a familiar road but can’t tell which way leads to the village. Even if you’ve traveled it many times, it feels completely new and confusing, like a road in a faraway place. At night, it’s even harder.

When we walk, we usually follow certain landmarks without thinking, like pilots using beacons to guide them. If we go beyond where we usually go, we still keep in mind the direction of some nearby landmark. But once we are truly lost or turned around—because just being turned around once with closed eyes can make you lost—we realize how huge and strange nature really is.
