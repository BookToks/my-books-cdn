Each stick was carefully shaped to fit together because by then I had borrowed more tools. I didn’t spend long days in the woods, but I usually brought my lunch of bread and butter. At noon, I would sit among the green pine branches I had cut and eat, while reading the newspaper that wrapped my food. My hands were covered in sticky pine sap, so the smell got on my bread too. By the time I finished, I felt more like a friend than an enemy of the pine trees, even though I had cut some down and learned more about them.

Sometimes, people walking in the woods heard my axe and stopped to talk with me while I worked. We had friendly chats over the wood chips I made.

By mid-April, I wasn’t rushing my work but enjoying it, and my house frame was ready to be put up. I had already bought the small cabin of James Collins, an Irishman who worked on the Fitchburg Railroad, to use its boards. His cabin was known to be pretty good. When I went to see it, he wasn’t home. I looked around outside without being noticed because the window was deep and high. The cabin was small with a peaked roof, and the ground around it was piled up like a compost heap. The roof was the strongest part but was warped and brittle from the sun. There was no door sill, just a space hens used to get under the door.

Mrs. Collins came to the door and invited me inside. The hens ran in when I approached. Inside, it was dark with mostly a dirt floor that was damp and cold, except for a few boards that couldn’t be removed. She lit a lamp to show me the roof, walls, and that the wooden floor went under the bed. She warned me not to step into the cellar, which was a dusty hole two feet deep. In her words, there were “good boards overhead, good boards all around, and a good window,” though the window had originally had two panes, but a cat had recently gone through one. The cabin had a stove, a bed, a place to sit, a baby born there, a fancy silk parasol, a gold-framed mirror, and a new coffee grinder nailed to a small oak tree. We quickly made the deal because James had come back. I agreed to pay four dollars and twenty-five cents that night, and he promised to leave by five the next morning, not selling it to anyone else. I could move in at six. He said it was good to come early to avoid any vague but unfair arguments about rent or fuel costs. He assured me that was the only problem.
