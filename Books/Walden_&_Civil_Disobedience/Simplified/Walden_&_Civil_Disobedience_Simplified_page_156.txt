We should feel sorry for a boy who has never fired a gun; it doesn’t mean he is kinder, but that his education is missing something important. This was my answer about boys who are focused on hunting, hoping they will grow out of it soon. No kind person, once they are past being a careless kid, would kill any living thing just for fun. A scared hare cries like a child. I warn you, moms, that I don’t always feel sympathy the way most people do.

Often, young men start going to the forest as hunters and fishers. But if they are meant for something better, like being a poet or nature lover, they eventually leave the gun and fishing pole behind. Most people, though, stay stuck in that young stage forever. In some places, it’s normal to see a hunting preacher. That kind might work well as a sheepdog but is not a good shepherd. I’ve noticed that, at Walden Pond, almost no one stays fishing for half a day, except for one person. Usually, they don’t feel happy or think it’s worth their time unless they catch a lot of fish, even though they can see the beautiful pond the whole time. They might visit the pond a thousand times before they truly understand fishing and enjoy it for what it is. The leaders and important people remember the pond from when they were kids fishing there, but now they are too old and serious to fish, so they never really know it anymore.

Still, even those people expect to go to heaven someday. The government mostly cares about how many fishing hooks people can use there, but they don’t understand the most important “hook” to really connect with the pond itself. So, even in modern communities, a person goes through the hunter stage as they grow up.

Lately, I’ve found that I don’t feel good about myself when I fish. I’ve tried it many times. I’m good at it, and sometimes I even get the feeling for it again, but every time I finish, I think it would have been better if I hadn’t gone fishing at all.
