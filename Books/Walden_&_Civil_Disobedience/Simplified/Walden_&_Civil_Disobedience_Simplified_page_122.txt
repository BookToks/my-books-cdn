There is something very special and hard to explain, like truth or fairness, that can be found even in small amounts along the way. Our representatives should be told to bring back these good things, and Congress should help spread them across the country. We should always be honest and sincere. We shouldn’t hurt or ignore each other by being mean if we have kindness and value inside us.

Most people I meet seem too busy to stop and talk because they are focused on their own work. We wouldn’t treat someone who works hard like a farmer does, leaning on their tool and slowly doing their job, like a bird resting on the ground but ready to fly. Talking to someone like that feels special, almost like talking to an angel.

Food may not always fill us up completely, but it always helps us feel better. It can even make us feel more flexible and cheerful when we don’t know why we felt stiff or tired. Recognizing kindness in people or in nature, and sharing pure joy, is important.

Long ago, farming was seen as a sacred and respected skill. But now, we rush through it carelessly, only wanting bigger farms and bigger crops. We don’t have special celebrations to honor farming or remind us it’s important. Even our events like Cattle-shows and Thanksgivings don’t really show respect for farming. Farmers today care more about money than about the land. Because of selfishness and greed, we treat soil like just property to own, and this ruins the land and farming itself. Farmers live hard, unhappy lives because they don’t respect nature.

The old Romans believed farming was a good and respectful job. They called the earth both Mother and Ceres, the goddess of farming, and thought that farmers lived a pious and useful life. They believed farmers were special people. We often forget that the sun shines equally on all the land, whether it’s farmed or wild.
