To be honest, I only had ten cents in the whole world. I couldn’t even figure out if I was the guy with ten cents, or the one with a farm, or ten dollars, or all of it together. But I let the other guy keep the ten dollars and the farm anyway, because I’d done enough. Actually, to be nice, I sold him the farm for the same price I paid, gave him ten dollars because he wasn’t rich, and still kept my ten cents, seeds, and stuff to build a wheelbarrow. So, I found out I was rich without losing my little bit of money. Plus, I kept the land and every year I took what it gave me without even using a wheelbarrow.

About land — “I’m the king of everything I can see, and no one can argue with me.” I’ve seen poets leave a farm feeling like they got the best part, while the farmer thought they only got some wild apples. The owner doesn’t realize for years that the poet turned the farm into a poem — like an invisible fence — and got all the best parts, leaving the farmer with just the leftovers.

What I liked most about the Hollowell farm was how private it was. It was about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the road by a big field. The farm touched the river, and the owner said the river’s fog helped keep frost away in spring, but I didn’t care about that. The house and barn were old and falling apart, and the fences were broken, which made me feel far from whoever lived there before. The apple trees were hollow, covered in lichen, and had rabbit marks, showing what kind of neighbors I’d have. But mostly, I loved remembering the farm from when I was a kid, going up the river. Back then, the house was hidden behind thick red maple trees, and I could hear the dog barking.

I wanted to buy it fast before the owner finished clearing rocks, cutting the apple trees, and pulling up young birch trees that had grown in the pasture — basically before he made any more changes. I was ready to take care of it, like Atlas holding up the world — though I never heard if he got paid for that — and do all the work just so I could own it peacefully. I knew the farm would grow the best crops I wanted if I could just leave it alone.
