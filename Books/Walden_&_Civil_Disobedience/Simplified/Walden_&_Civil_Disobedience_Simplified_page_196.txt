There was another person I spent good times with at his house in the village, and he visited me sometimes; but I didnâ€™t have much more social life there.

Like everywhere else, I sometimes waited for a Visitor who never showed up. The Vishnu Purana says that a house-owner should stay in their yard at night for as long as it takes to milk a cow, or even longer, to wait for a guest.

I often tried to do this, waiting long enough to milk a whole herd of cows, but I never saw anyone coming from the town.
