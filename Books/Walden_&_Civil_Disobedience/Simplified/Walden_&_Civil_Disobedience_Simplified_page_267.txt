You can charge a fair fee for making copies of or sharing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow these rules:

First, you have to pay 20% of the money you make from using Project Gutenberg™ works as a royalty fee. This fee goes to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has agreed to give this money to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. You need to pay these royalties within 60 days after you do your regular tax reports. Make sure to label the payments clearly and send them to the Foundation’s address listed in Section 4.

You must give a full refund if someone tells you in writing or by email within 30 days that they don’t agree with the Project Gutenberg™ License terms. That person must also return or destroy any copies they have and stop using all other Project Gutenberg™ works.

You also have to give a full refund or a replacement if there’s a problem with the electronic work that is reported to you within 90 days of receiving it.

You have to follow all the other rules for free distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

If you want to charge a fee or share Project Gutenberg™ works in a way that’s different from these rules, you need to get written permission from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. You can contact them as explained in Section 3.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and workers spend a lot of time and effort finding, checking copyrights, typing, and proofreading works that are not protected by U.S. copyright to create the Project Gutenberg™ collection.
