One afternoon, I entertained myself by watching a barred owl sitting on a low dead branch of a white pine tree, close to the trunk, during the daytime. I was standing very close to him. He could hear me moving and crunching the snow with my feet, but he couldn’t see me clearly. When I made more noise, he would stretch his neck, raise the feathers on his neck, and open his eyes wide. But soon, his eyelids would fall again, and he started to nod off.  

After watching him for about half an hour, I also felt sleepy, as he sat there with his eyes half closed, like a cat, his winged relative. There was only a small gap between his eyelids, so he could still kind of see me. He looked like he was half asleep, trying to understand what I was, a blurry shape that disturbed his dreams.  

Finally, when I made a louder sound or moved closer, he got restless and slowly turned around on his branch, seeming annoyed that I disturbed his sleep. Then, he flew off quietly through the pine trees, spreading his wings wide, but without making any sound. He seemed to find his way through the trees by feeling them with his soft feathers rather than by sight. He found a new branch where he could wait peacefully for the morning.  

As I walked along the long railroad path through the meadows, I faced many strong and cold winds because the wind blew freely there. When the frost hit one cheek, even though I wasn’t very religious, I turned my face so it could hit the other cheek too. It wasn’t much better along the road from Brister’s Hill.  

I came to town like a friendly Native American, while the open fields were covered in snow between the walls of the Walden road. After just half an hour, the tracks of the last traveler were gone. When I came back, new snowdrifts had formed, and I had to struggle through them. The busy northwest wind had piled the powdery snow around a sharp turn in the road, and there were no signs of animals—not even tiny tracks from a mouse.  

Still, even in the middle of winter, I usually found some warm, spring-like swamp where the grass and skunk cabbage stayed green all year. Sometimes, a tough bird was there, waiting for spring to come back.
