If we don’t work hard to make sleepers and rails, and spend lots of time on building railroads, who will do it? And if railroads aren’t built, how will we get to heaven on time? But if we just stay home and mind our own business, who will want railroads? We don’t control the railroad; it controls us. Have you ever thought about what the sleepers under the railroad are? Each sleeper is a person, maybe an Irish man or a Yankee man. The rails lie on them, they’re covered with sand, and the train cars run smoothly over them. These people are sound sleepers, I promise you. Every few years, new sleepers are put down and trains run over them again; so, while some people get to ride the train, others get used as the sleepers beneath it. And when a man who’s walking in his sleep ends up under the train, they stop everything and make a big deal about it, like it’s something unusual. I’m glad it takes a team of men to keep the sleepers in place every five miles, because that means they might get up again someday.

Why do we live in such a rush and waste our lives? We want to be hungry before we’re even hungry. People say “a stitch in time saves nine,” so they do a thousand stitches today to save nine tomorrow. But when it comes to real work, we don’t have much. We’re like we have Saint Vitus’ dance and can’t keep still. If I just pulled the church bell rope a few times, like for a fire, almost everyone on the farms around Concord would drop everything and run to the sound—not mainly to save their stuff, but mostly just to watch it burn, since it has to burn, and to see it put out, hoping to help if they can. Even if it was the church itself! Hardly anyone takes a nap after lunch without waking up and immediately asking, “What’s the news?” like someone was standing guard for them. Some even ask to be woken up every half hour, probably just to have something to tell about their dreams. After a night’s sleep, getting the news is as important as breakfast.
