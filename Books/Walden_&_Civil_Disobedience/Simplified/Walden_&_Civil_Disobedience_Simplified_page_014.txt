Fuel, except for cooking food, isn’t really needed; the sun acts like his fire, and many fruits get cooked just by the sun’s heat. Food is usually more varied and easier to find, and clothes and shelter are partly or totally unnecessary.

Today, where I live, I’ve noticed that a few simple tools like a knife, an axe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, plus things for people who like to study, like a lamp, paper, and some books, are almost as important as basic needs. All these things don’t cost much. But some people, not very smart, travel far away to tough and unhealthy places to work for ten or twenty years just so they can live comfortably and warm, and then end up dying back home in New England. Rich people don’t just stay warm; they live in extreme luxury, like they’re “cooked” in style.

Most luxuries and many so-called comforts aren’t needed at all and actually stop people from becoming better.

When it comes to luxuries and comforts, the smartest people have always lived simpler and poorer lives than the poor. Ancient thinkers from China, India, Persia, and Greece were very poor in money but very rich inside. We don’t know much about them, but it’s amazing we know as much as we do. The same goes for more recent people who tried to help others. The only way to truly understand life is by choosing a life of simple poverty. Living in luxury only leads to more luxury in farming, business, art, or writing. Today, there are teachers of philosophy, but not real philosophers. It’s great to teach philosophy because it was once great to live it. Being a philosopher means more than having smart ideas or starting a school—it means loving wisdom so much that you live simply, independently, generously, and with trust. It means solving life’s problems not just by thinking but by living them. Most famous thinkers succeed by fitting in with society, not by being strong or real leaders.

They just manage to live by copying their parents and don’t create a better future generation. But why do people get worse over time? Why do families disappear? What is it about luxury that weakens and ruins nations? Are we sure there’s none of that luxury in our own lives? A real philosopher lives ahead of their time even in how they look and live. They don’t eat, dress, or live like other people around them.
