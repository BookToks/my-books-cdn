I thought Walden Pond would be a good place for business, not just because of the railroad and ice trade. It has some benefits that might be better kept secret. It’s a good spot and a solid place to build. There are no swampy areas like the Neva to fill in, though you have to build on piles you drive into the ground. People say a flood with a west wind and ice on the Neva could wipe out St. Petersburg.

Since this business would start without the usual money, it’s hard to guess where the necessary funds would come from. About clothing, to get practical, maybe we often buy new clothes because we like change and care what others think, not because we really need them. If you have work to do, remember clothes are mainly to keep you warm and cover your body, so you might get a lot done without buying more clothes.

Kings and queens who only wear a suit once, even if made just for them, don’t know how comfortable a well-fitting suit can be. Their clothes are like wooden horses just for hanging clean clothes. Every day, our clothes become part of us, showing who we are, so we hesitate to take them off without some kind of special care. I don’t think less of anyone for having patched clothes, but many worry more about having stylish or clean clothes than about having a good conscience. Even if a rip isn’t fixed, the worst problem is not planning ahead. I sometimes test my friends by asking who could wear pants with a patch or extra seams over the knee. Most act like wearing patched clothes would ruin their whole future. It seems easier to walk with a broken leg than with torn pants.

If a gentleman’s legs get hurt, he can fix them, but if his pants get torn, there’s no saving them. He cares not about what’s really respectable, but what others respect.
