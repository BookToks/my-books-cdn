Sometimes I wonder how we can care so much about the clear but distant problem of slavery, when there are many tricky and smart forces controlling people in both the north and south. It’s hard to be controlled by a southern boss; it’s even worse with a northern one; but the worst is when you control yourself and become your own boss.

People talk about something special inside everyone. Look at the driver on the road, going to the market day or night; does he feel special inside? His main job is just to feed and water his horses! What does his future matter compared to big business? Isn’t he really working for someone else’s plan? How powerful or important is he? See how scared and nervous he is all day, not because he is special, but because he is trapped by what he thinks of himself, a reputation he earned by his own actions.

What others think of us is not as strong as what we think of ourselves.

What a person thinks about themselves is what really shapes their future. Freeing yourself, even in your own mind, is hard—who will help you do that?

Also, think about women working hard, making things for the future, trying not to show too much worry about what will happen! It’s like trying to waste time without hurting forever.

Most people live quietly unhappy lives. What looks like giving up is really deep sadness. From the sad city to the sad countryside, people try to feel better by watching animals. Even fun and games are just a cover for this sadness. They aren’t true fun, because real fun comes only after work is done.
