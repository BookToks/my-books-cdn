Some people went down from the village with a “fifty-six” and a wagon full of thick rope, but they still couldn’t find the bottom. While the “fifty-six” was resting, they were letting out the rope, trying to measure how deep it was, but the pond seemed too deep to measure. 

But I can tell you that Walden does have a bottom that is pretty solid, at a deep but not crazy depth. I measured it easily using a fishing line and a stone that weighed about one and a half pounds. I knew when the stone left the bottom because I had to pull much harder before the water helped lift it. The deepest part was exactly 102 feet, plus the five feet the water has risen since then, making it 107 feet deep. That’s really deep for such a small pond, but it’s not made up. 

What if all ponds were shallow? Wouldn’t that change how people think? I’m glad this pond is deep and clear because it can be a symbol. As long as people believe in the infinite, some ponds will seem bottomless.

A factory owner, after hearing how deep I said it was, didn’t believe me. He thought the sand couldn’t stay at such a steep angle. But the deepest ponds aren’t as deep compared to their size as most people think. If they were emptied, they wouldn’t leave huge valleys. They aren’t like cups between hills. This pond, even though it’s really deep for its size, looks as deep as a shallow plate if you cut it straight through the middle. Most ponds, when empty, would just leave a flat meadow. 

William Gilpin, who knows a lot about landscapes, stood at the start of Loch Fyne in Scotland. He said it’s a bay of salt water, 60 or 70 fathoms deep, about 4 miles wide and 50 miles long, surrounded by mountains. He thought, “If we could have seen it right after the big flood or whatever natural event made it, before the water came in, what a scary hole it must have looked like!”

So high the hills had pushed up, so low the bottom sank down, a wide and deep bed for water to fill.
