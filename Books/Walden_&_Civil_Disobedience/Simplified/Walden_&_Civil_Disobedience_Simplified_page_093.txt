Sounds echo from far away with a shaky honesty, and a soft, drawn-out “bor-r-r-r-n” comes faintly from deep in the Lincoln woods.

I also heard an owl hooting nearby. Up close, it sounds like the saddest noise in nature, like it’s trying to copy the last cries of a dying person—someone weak who’s lost hope and howls like an animal but with human sadness. It’s like entering a dark, scary place, made even creepier by a certain gurgling, musical sound—I start with "gl" when I try to copy it—that shows a mind that’s gone rotten and lost all healthy, brave thoughts. It made me think of ghosts, crazy people, and wild howls. But then another owl answers from far away, and the sound becomes really nice because it’s so far—“Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer hoo.” Mostly, it just made me think of good things, whether heard in day or night, summer or winter.

I’m glad owls exist. Let them make the crazy hooting sounds instead of people. Their hoots fit perfectly with swamps and twilight woods, places that don’t look right in daylight, showing a huge, wild nature that people don’t understand. Owls stand for the dark time before night and the restless thoughts everyone has. All day, the sun shines on a wild swamp where a single spruce tree hangs with moss, little hawks fly above, chickadees chirp in the evergreens, and partridges and rabbits hide below. But now, a darker, more fitting time begins, and different animals wake up to show what nature means there.

Late in the evening, I heard wagons rumbling over bridges—a sound that travels far at night—dogs barking, and sometimes the sad mooing of a cow in a far barnyard. Meanwhile, the whole shore echoed with bullfrogs’ calls, strong and lively like old party animals who don’t regret their wild times. They try to sing together in their dark lake—if the Walden water spirits don’t mind the comparison—because even though there are almost no weeds, there are frogs there. They want to keep their fun traditions alive, even though their voices have gotten rough and serious, mocking happiness. The wine they once drank has lost its taste and is now just liquid that fills their bellies, but it doesn’t bring the sweet drunkenness that would make them forget the past—just fullness and heaviness.
