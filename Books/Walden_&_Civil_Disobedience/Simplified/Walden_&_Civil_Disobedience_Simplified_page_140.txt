It’s like a mirror that can’t be broken by any stone, whose shiny surface never fades, and Nature keeps fixing it all the time. No storms or dust can make it dull; it always stays fresh. This mirror shows everything clearly, and the sun’s light acts like a dust cloth that cleans it constantly. It doesn’t hold onto any breath or fog but sends its own air up like clouds, which it then reflects perfectly.

A pond or lake shows the spirit of the air above it. It’s always changing because it gets new life and movement from the sky. It’s kind of in between land and sky. On land, only grass and trees move, but water itself ripples with the wind. You can see where the breeze touches the water by the streaks of light it makes. It’s amazing that we can look down at the water’s surface. Maybe someday we’ll be able to look down at the air itself and see a gentler spirit moving over it.

By late October, the skaters and water-bugs disappear when the frost gets hard. In November, on calm days, the water is so still it doesn’t ripple at all. One November afternoon, after a long rainstorm, the sky was cloudy and misty, and the pond was so smooth it was hard to tell where the surface was. It didn’t reflect the bright colors of October anymore but the duller November colors of the hills around it. When I gently moved my boat over it, small waves appeared that made the reflections look ribbed. While I was watching, I saw faint glimmers far away, maybe where some skater bugs had survived or where a spring was coming up from the bottom.

I paddled over to one of these spots and was surprised to find lots of small bronze-colored perch, about five inches long, swimming in the green water. They kept rising to the surface, making little dimples and sometimes bubbles. The water was so clear and deep-looking, reflecting the clouds, that it felt like I was floating in the air in a balloon. The fish moved like a flock of birds flying just below me, their fins spread out like sails. There were many groups of these fish in the pond, enjoying the last warm days before winter would freeze everything. Sometimes their movement made the water look like a soft breeze or a few raindrops had fallen on it.
