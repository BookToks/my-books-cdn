When the countries of Europe started to have their own simple written languages, enough for them to create their own stories and books, learning began again. Scholars could then look back and discover the old treasures from ancient times. Things that many Romans and Greeks never got to hear, after many years, only a few scholars read—and even now, only a few still read them.

Even though we might like how speakers sometimes get really passionate, the best written words are usually way better or more lasting than spoken words. It’s like the stars in the sky compared to clouds. The stars are always there, and people who know how can read them. Astronomers study and talk about them all the time. Words spoken in speeches are like quick, passing breath, but written words last much longer.

Speakers talk to the crowd in front of them, inspired by the moment, but writers speak to the minds and well-being of all people, in any time, who can understand their words.

It’s no surprise that Alexander the Great always took the Iliad, a famous ancient story, with him on his trips in a special box. Written words are some of the most valuable things we have. They are more personal and more universal than any other kind of art. They are closest to real life. They can be translated into any language and spoken by people everywhere. Written thoughts from ancient times become the words we say today. Even after two thousand years, Greek writings, like their statues, still have a special, beautiful quality that protects them from being forgotten.

Books are the world’s greatest treasure and the perfect inheritance for generations and countries. The oldest and best books belong on the shelves of every home. They don’t ask for attention but, because they teach and support readers, people naturally accept them. Their authors form a special group of respected people in every society, and they influence the world even more than kings or emperors.
