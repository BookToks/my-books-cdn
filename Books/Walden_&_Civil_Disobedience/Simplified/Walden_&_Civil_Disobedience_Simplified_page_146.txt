This is my lake country. These lakes, along with the Concord River, are my special places with water. Day and night, all year long, they keep working just like I expect them to.

Since the woodcutters, the railroad, and even I have disturbed Walden, maybe the most interesting, if not the most beautiful, lake around is White Pond. The name is kind of boring because it’s so common, whether it comes from how clear the water is or the color of the sand. But in many ways, it’s like a smaller version of Walden. They are so similar you’d think they are connected underground. White Pond has the same rocky shore and the water looks the same.

Like Walden, on hot summer days, when you look down through the trees at some parts of the pond that aren’t too deep, the water has a misty blue-green color. Many years ago, I used to go there to collect sand by the cartload to make sandpaper. I have kept visiting ever since. Someone who visits often wants to call it Virid Lake. Maybe it could be called Yellow-Pine Lake because, about fifteen years ago, you could see the top of a pitch-pine tree, called yellow-pine here, sticking out above the water far from the shore. Some people thought the pond had sunk and this tree was part of the old forest that used to be there.

I found out that even back in 1792, in a description of Concord by a local, it says: “In the middle of White Pond, when the water is very low, you can see a tree that looks like it’s growing there, even though its roots are fifty feet underwater. The top of the tree is broken off and at that spot it’s fourteen inches wide.” In the spring of 1849, I talked to the man who lives closest to the pond in Sudbury. He told me he was the one who got that tree out ten or fifteen years before. He remembered it was about twelve to fifteen rods from the shore, where the water was thirty or forty feet deep. It was winter, and after cutting ice in the morning, he decided to take out the old yellow-pine with help from his neighbors in the afternoon.
