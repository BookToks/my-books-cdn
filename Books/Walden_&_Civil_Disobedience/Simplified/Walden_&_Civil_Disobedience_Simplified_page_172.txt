But why, after being so clever, did he always give himself away with that loud laugh when he came up? Didn’t his white chest already show who he was? I thought he was a silly loon. I could usually hear the splash when he surfaced, so I could find him. But after an hour, he still seemed fresh, diving and swimming even farther than before. It was amazing to see how calmly he floated up with a smooth chest, doing all the swimming with his webbed feet underneath.

His usual sound was this wild laugh, a bit like a water bird; but sometimes, when he tricked me and came up far away, he made a long, strange howl, more like a wolf than a bird. It was like a wild animal putting its nose to the ground and howling. This was his “looning” — maybe the wildest sound you can hear here, echoing through the woods. I thought he laughed to mock me, sure of himself. Even though the sky was cloudy, the pond was so calm I could see where he broke the surface when I couldn’t hear him. His white chest, the quiet air, and smooth water all gave him away.

Finally, after surfacing far away, he let out a long howl, like calling to the loon god for help. Right then, a wind came from the east, rippling the water and filling the air with misty rain. It felt like the loon’s prayer was answered and his god was mad at me. So I left him, disappearing far away on the rough water.

For hours on fall days, I watched ducks cleverly change direction and stay in the middle of the pond, far from hunters. They use tricks they won’t need in Louisiana swamps. When they had to fly up, they would circle high over the pond, looking like tiny black dots in the sky, able to see other ponds and the river. When I thought they had left, they would come back, flying down at an angle to a quiet spot far away. I don’t know why they liked being in the middle of Walden, except maybe they loved the water as much as I did.
