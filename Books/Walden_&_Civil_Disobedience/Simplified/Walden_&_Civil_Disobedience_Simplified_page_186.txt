For many weeks, I didn’t meet anyone while walking, except for a few people who came sometimes to cut wood and carry it to the village. The weather helped me make a path through the deep snow in the woods. After I walked through, the wind blew oak leaves into my tracks. These leaves soaked up sunlight and melted the snow, making a dry path for my feet. At night, the dark line of leaves helped me find my way.

Because I didn’t see anyone, I had to imagine the people who used to live in these woods. Many people in my town still remember when the road near my house was full of laughter and talking. The woods nearby had small gardens and homes, even though there were more trees then than now. I remember when pine trees almost touched both sides of the road. Women and children who had to walk this way to Lincoln were scared and often ran part of the way. Even though it was just a simple road to nearby villages or for woodcutters, it was more interesting and fun to travel than it is now.

Where there are now open fields from the village to the woods, the road used to go through a swamp with maple trees. It was built on logs, and parts of those logs might still be under the dusty road today. This road went from the Stratton Farm, now called the Alms House Farm, to Brister’s Hill.

East of my bean field, across the road, lived Cato Ingraham, a slave owned by Duncan Ingraham, a well-known man from Concord village. Duncan built a house for Cato and let him live in Walden Woods. Cato was from Concord, not Africa. Some people say he was from Guinea.

A few people still remember the small walnut patch he had, which he let grow until he got old and could use the nuts. But a younger, richer man eventually took it from him.
