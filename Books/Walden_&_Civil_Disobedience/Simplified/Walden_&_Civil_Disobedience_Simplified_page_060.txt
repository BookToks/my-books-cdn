COMPLEMENTAL VERSES The Pretensions of Poverty

You’re acting way too confident, poor and needy person,  
Just because your small home or little tub  
Grows some lazy or showy goodness  
In the cheap sunlight or shady springs,  
With roots and herbs; where your right hand,  
Tearing away kind feelings from the mind,  
Hurts nature and numbs your senses,  
And, like a scary monster, turns active people to stone.

We don’t want the boring company  
Of your forced self-control,  
Or that fake dullness  
That feels no joy or sadness; nor your fake  
Too-high patience over real action.  
This low, weak group,  
Stuck in the middle,  
Becomes your weak minds; but we want  
Only virtues that allow going beyond limits,  
Brave, generous acts, royal greatness,  
Clear wisdom, huge courage,  
That kind of heroic strength  
From ancient times that has no name,  
Only examples, like Hercules, Achilles, Theseus.  
Go back to your hated small home;  
And when you see the new bright world,  
Try to learn only what those great people were.

Where I Lived, and What I Lived For  
At some point in life, we start thinking every place could be a good spot for a house.
