I feel sad when I hear a neat, small man, who seems free and ready, talk about his “furniture,” like it’s something important to insure. But what good is my furniture? It feels like my happy, free spirit is caught in a spider’s web.

Even people who seem not to have much actually have some stuff stored away somewhere. I think of England today like an old man traveling with a lot of junk he’s collected over the years but is too afraid to get rid of—big boxes, small boxes, bags, and bundles.

At least throw away the first three. It would be hard for a healthy person to carry all that, and I’d tell a sick person to leave their bed behind and run instead. When I see someone moving with a huge bundle that holds everything they own—looking like a big bump on their neck—I feel sorry for them, not because they only have that, but because it’s so heavy to carry. If I have to bring my stuff, I’ll make sure it’s light and doesn’t hurt me. But maybe it’s best not to get caught up in it at all.

By the way, I don’t spend money on curtains because the only things looking in are the sun and moon, and I’m okay with that. The moon won’t spoil my milk or meat, and the sun won’t ruin my furniture or carpet. If the sun gets too hot, I just hide behind some natural shade instead of buying more things for the house. A lady once gave me a mat, but I didn’t have space or time to clean it, so I said no and just wiped my feet on the grass outside. It’s better to avoid small problems before they start.

Not long ago, I went to an auction where a deacon’s things were being sold because he had died. Most of it was old junk that started collecting during his father’s time. Among the stuff was a dried tapeworm. After sitting in his attic for fifty years, these things weren’t burned or destroyed—they were sold at auction, making the pile grow. Neighbors came to see, bought everything, and took it home to store it again until their own things are sold someday, and the cycle will repeat.
