I don’t go there to see him or hear about him. He never saw it, never swam in it, never loved it, never took care of it, never said anything good about it, and never thanked God for making it. Instead, let it be named after the fish that swim in it, the wild birds or animals that live nearby, the wild flowers growing on its shores, or a wild person or child whose story is connected to it. Not after someone who only owns it because a neighbor or government gave it to him—a person who only cared about its money value.

This person might have made the shore worse, used up the land around it, and wanted to use up the water too. He only wished it was something valuable like English hay or cranberry fields. To him, there was nothing good about it. He would have drained it and sold the mud at the bottom. It didn’t help run his mill, and he didn’t enjoy seeing it. I don’t respect his work or his farm, where everything has a price. He would sell the landscape or even his God if he could make money from them. On his farm, nothing grows freely, no crops, no flowers, no fruit—only dollars matter. He doesn’t love the beauty of his fruits; they’re only good when turned into money. I prefer poverty that enjoys real wealth.

Farmers are interesting and respectable to me when they are poor—poor farmers. A “model farm” is like a house growing out of a messy swamp, with rooms for people and animals all together, clean or dirty! Full of animals! A big greasy mess smelling of manure and buttermilk! It’s “well cared for” by using the hard work and brains of people, like growing potatoes in a graveyard! That’s what a “model farm” is like.

No, no; if the prettiest parts of the land are named after people, let it be only the best and most worthy ones. Let our lakes have real names like the Icarian Sea, where a brave effort is remembered. Goose Pond, a small lake, is on my way to Flint’s; Fair-Haven, a bigger part of Concord River with about seventy acres, is a mile southwest; and White Pond, about forty acres, is a mile and a half past Fair-Haven.
