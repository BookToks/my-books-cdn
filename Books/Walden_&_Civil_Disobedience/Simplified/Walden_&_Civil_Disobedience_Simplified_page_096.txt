Solitude

This evening feels amazing, like my whole body is one big sense, enjoying everything around me. I walk freely in Nature, feeling like I’m part of it. Even though it’s cool, cloudy, and windy, and nothing special catches my eye, everything feels just right.

The bullfrogs make sounds to welcome the night, and I hear the whippoorwill’s call carried by the windy air over the water. I almost catch my breath watching the leaves flutter on the alder and poplar trees, but like the calm lake, I feel peaceful even with the small waves caused by the wind. These tiny waves aren’t close to a storm, just gentle ripples. It’s dark now, but the wind still blows and roars through the woods, the waves keep crashing, and some animals sing to calm the others. The quiet never lasts completely. Wild animals don’t rest yet—they’re out hunting. Foxes, skunks, and rabbits roam the fields and woods without fear. They are like Nature’s guards, connecting all living things.

When I get back home, I see visitors have been there and left little signs, like flowers, a wreath of evergreen, or a name written on a leaf or a small piece of wood. People who don’t come to the woods often take a tiny part of it with them, either on purpose or by accident. Someone peeled a willow branch, made it into a ring, and left it on my table. I can always tell if someone visited while I was away by bent twigs or grass, shoe prints, or small clues like a dropped flower or a bunch of grass tossed aside, even far away near the railroad, half a mile off. Sometimes, I even know a traveler passed by on the highway because I smell their pipe smoke from a long way away.
