A comfortable house for a tough and rough group of people, who mostly lived outside, was once made here almost completely from things Nature gave them. Gookin, who was in charge of the Indians under the Massachusetts Colony, wrote in 1674, “The best of their houses are covered very neatly, tight and warm, with tree bark, peeled off at the right time, and made into big sheets by pressing heavy wood on them while fresh.... The poorer ones are covered with mats made from a kind of bulrush, and these are also fairly warm and tight, but not as good as the bark ones.... Some I have seen were sixty or a hundred feet long and thirty feet wide.... I have often stayed in their wigwams, and found them as warm as the best English houses.” He also said they usually had carpets and walls lined with nicely made mats, and were filled with different tools. The Indians even knew how to control the wind by hanging a mat over the hole in the roof and moving it with a string. Such a lodge could be built in a day or two, taken down and put up again in a few hours; every family had one or part of one.

In a simple, wild life, every family owns a shelter as good as the best and enough for their basic needs. But I think it’s fair to say that, while birds have nests, foxes have holes, and savages have wigwams, in today’s modern society less than half the families actually own a home. In big towns and cities, where modern life is strongest, only a tiny number of people own their homes. The rest pay rent every year for this basic need that everyone must have, summer and winter. This rent could buy a whole village of Indian wigwams, but instead it keeps people poor for their whole lives. I don’t want to argue here about how renting is worse than owning, but it’s clear that savages own their homes because they cost very little, while modern people rent because they can’t afford to buy; and in the long run, they can’t really afford to rent either. But someone might say, by paying rent, the poor modern person lives in a home that is like a palace compared to a savage’s. Paying $25 to $100 a year in the country gets them all the improvements made over centuries—big rooms, clean paint and wallpaper, fancy fireplaces, plastered walls, blinds, pumps, good locks, a cellar, and many other things.
