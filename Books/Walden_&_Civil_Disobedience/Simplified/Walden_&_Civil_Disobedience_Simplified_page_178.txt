It’s as if only wild people living close to nature really understand it and can use it to explain things. How can a smart person living far away in a quiet place know what’s normal in a busy kitchen?

Only one or two of my friends were brave enough to stay and eat a quick pudding with me. But when things got tense, they ran away fast, like the house was going to fall down. Still, the house stood strong through lots of quick puddings.

I didn’t put on plaster until the weather was freezing. I brought some clean, white sand from across the pond in a small boat, which made me want to go even farther if I had to. My house was covered with shingles all around. When I hammered nails, I was happy to hit each one in just one try. I wanted to put the plaster on the walls neatly and quickly.

I remembered a story about a proud guy in fancy clothes who liked to give advice to workers. One day, he tried to plaster himself. He loaded his trowel, looked up at the lath, and made a big move—but ended up getting plaster all over his shirt. I realized again how useful plastering is because it keeps out the cold and makes the walls look nice. I also learned how many things can go wrong when plastering.

I was surprised how thirsty the bricks were, soaking up all the water from the plaster before I could smooth it out. It took a lot of water to prepare the new hearth. The winter before, I made a little lime by burning shells from our river, just to try it out. That way, I knew where my materials came from. I could have found good limestone nearby and made lime myself if I wanted.

Meanwhile, the pond’s shallow and shady parts froze over first, sometimes days or weeks before the rest. The first ice is really cool—it’s hard, dark, and clear. It’s the best time to look at the bottom where the water is shallow because you can lie flat on the thin ice, like an insect skating on water, and see everything just a few inches below, like looking through glass. The water stays smooth then too.
