Every person has to figure out where they stand again and again, whether they just wake up from sleep or get distracted. We don’t really start to understand ourselves or see how we’re connected to everything until we feel lost or like we’ve lost the world around us.

One afternoon, near the end of my first summer, I went to the village to get my shoe fixed by the cobbler. But I was grabbed and thrown in jail because, like I said before, I didn’t pay a tax or accept the power of the government that treats people like animals. I originally went to the woods for something else. But no matter where you go, people with their rules and laws will try to control you and make you follow their strange group. I could have fought back or gone crazy against society, but I decided to let society go crazy against me since they were the stronger side.

I was let go the next day, got my fixed shoe, and went back to the woods in time to eat some huckleberries on FairHaven Hill. No one bothered me except the people working for the government. I didn’t have locks on my doors or windows, not even a nail to hold a latch. I never locked my door, even when I was gone for days, like the two weeks I spent in the woods of Maine that fall. Still, my house was respected more than if soldiers had been guarding it. Anyone tired could rest by my fire, people could enjoy the few books I had, or the curious could look in my closet to see what food I had left. Even though lots of people from all kinds of backgrounds came by the pond, nothing bad really happened, except I lost one small book, a copy of Homer, maybe because it had a fancy cover. I hope a soldier found it by now. I truly believe that if everyone lived as simply as I did then, stealing and robbery wouldn’t exist. These problems only happen when some people have way more than they need while others don’t have enough.
