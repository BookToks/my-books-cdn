There is usually enough space around us. Our view stretches far and isn’t right next to us. The thick forest isn’t just at our doorstep, and the pond isn’t right nearby either. Instead, there’s always some open area that we know well, have marked off, and taken back from nature.

Why do I have such a big area, some square miles of quiet forest, all to myself? It’s left to me by other people. My closest neighbor lives a mile away, and I can’t see any houses except from the tops of hills within half a mile of my place. My view is surrounded by woods that belong only to me; far away I see the railroad where it meets the pond on one side, and a fence along the forest road on the other. But mostly, where I live, it’s as lonely as the wide-open prairies. It feels more like Asia or Africa than New England. It’s like I have my own sun, moon, and stars, and a little world all to myself. At night, no one ever passes by my house or knocks on my door, almost like I’m the first or last person alive. Sometimes in spring, a few people from the village come to fish, but they fish more in the quiet of their own minds and use darkness as their bait. They don’t stay long, usually leaving with light baskets, and then “the world is left to darkness and me,” with the night staying peaceful and free from any neighbors. I think people are still a bit scared of the dark, even though witches are gone, and we have Christianity and candles now.

Still, I’ve found that the sweetest and kindest company can come from anything in nature, even for someone who doesn’t like people and feels sad. No one can feel very deep sadness if they live surrounded by nature and keep their senses open. Every storm sounds like music to a healthy, innocent ear. Nothing should make a simple and brave person feel really sad. As long as I enjoy the changing seasons, I believe life won’t feel like a burden. The soft rain watering my beans and keeping me inside today isn’t gloomy or sad; it’s actually good for me. Even though I can’t work in the garden, the rain is worth more than my hoeing. If it rains so much that seeds rot and potatoes in low areas get ruined, it’s still good for the grass on higher ground, and since the grass is good, that’s good for me too. Sometimes, when I think about other people, it feels like I’m luckier than they are, even though I don’t think I deserve it. It’s like the gods have given me special protection and guidance that others don’t have.
