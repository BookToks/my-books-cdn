What if people cared as much about the style of writing as they do about the style of buildings? Imagine if the people who write our books spent as much time on how their words look and sound as the people who design churches do on how their buildings look.

People care a lot about small details, like how some sticks are placed or what colors are used on a box. It would matter if they really meant it, but if the person inside has lost their spirit, it’s like building their own coffin—their final resting place. One guy says, when you feel hopeless or don’t care about life, just take some dirt from the ground and paint your house that color. But is he thinking about the small, final house we all live in? Why not flip a coin for it, too? He must have a lot of free time! Why pick up dirt at all? It’s better to paint your house your own skin color—let it look pale or blush for you. Trying to improve the style of small houses is a big job! When you make my decorations, I’ll wear them.

Before winter, I built a chimney and put shingles on the sides of my house. The walls already kept out rain, but I used rough, sappy shingles from the first slice of a log, and I had to smooth the edges with a tool.

Now I have a tight, shingled, and plastered house that’s ten feet wide, fifteen feet long, and eight feet high. It has an attic and a closet, a big window on each side, two trap doors, one door at the end, and a brick fireplace across from the door. 

Here’s exactly how much my house cost if you pay normal prices for the materials but don’t count the work I did myself. I share this because not many people know the real cost of their houses or the cost of each material:

Boards: $8.03 (mostly cheap boards)  
Old shingles for the roof: $4.00  
Thin strips of wood (laths): $1.25  
Two old windows with glass: $2.43  
One thousand old bricks: $4.00  
Two barrels of lime: $2.40 (this was expensive)  
Hair (for plaster): $0.31 (more than I needed)  
Iron for the fireplace frame: $0.15  
Nails: $3.90  
Hinges and screws: $0.14  
Latch: $0.10  
Chalk: $0.01  
Transportation: $1.40 (I carried a lot on my back)
