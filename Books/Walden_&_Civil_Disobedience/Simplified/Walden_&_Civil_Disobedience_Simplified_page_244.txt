They are sure that what they’re involved in is a terrible thing, and they all want peace. So, who are they really? Are they real people, or just like small moving forts and weapon stores controlled by some dishonest leader?

Go to the Navy Yard and see a marine, a person the American government has made, or changed with its dark tricks. He’s like a shadow of a human, alive but already buried under weapons, with a sad kind of funeral music playing. The big group of people serve the State not really as humans, but like machines, just their bodies.

They are the standing army, the militia, jailers, police, and helpers. Most of the time, they don’t use their own judgment or morals; they act like wood, dirt, or stones. Maybe wooden figures could do the same job. These people don’t get more respect than straw men or lumps of dirt. They are only worth as much as horses or dogs. But even these people are often seen as good citizens.

Others, like lawmakers, politicians, lawyers, priests, and government workers, serve the state mainly with their minds. Since they rarely think about right and wrong, they might end up helping evil without meaning to, just as easily as they help good.

Very few, like heroes, patriots, martyrs, real reformers, and true humans, serve the State with their consciences too. Because of this, they often have to fight the State and are usually treated like enemies.

A smart person will only be useful by being truly human and won’t agree to be just “clay” or a “plug to stop holes” for the government. They leave that low role to their dust. They say, “I’m too important to be owned, to be a low servant or tool for any government in the world.”

Someone who gives themselves fully to others might seem useless and selfish. But someone who helps others a little is called a kind and generous person.
