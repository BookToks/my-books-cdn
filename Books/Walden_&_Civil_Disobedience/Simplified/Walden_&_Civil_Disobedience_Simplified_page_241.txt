Who knows what kind of seventeen-year locust will come out of the ground next?

The government where I live wasn’t created by fancy talks over wine like in Britain.

The life inside us is like water in a river. This year, it might rise higher than ever and flood the dry land. Maybe this will be the big year that washes away all our problems. It wasn’t always dry where we live now. I can see far away the old riverbanks where water once flowed before science started keeping track of floods.

Everyone has heard the story from New England about a strong and beautiful bug that came out of the dry leaf of an old apple tree table. That table had been in a farmer’s kitchen for sixty years, first in Connecticut, then in Massachusetts. The bug’s egg was laid in the living tree many years before, shown by counting the tree rings. The bug was heard chewing its way out for weeks, maybe because of the heat from an urn. Doesn’t this story make you believe more in coming back to life and living forever? Who knows what amazing life, whose egg has been hidden for ages inside the wood of old furniture, might be trying to break free now while people are sitting around eating? It might finally get to live its perfect summer life!

I’m not saying John or Jonathan will understand all this, but this is the kind of future that just won’t come no matter how much time passes.

The light that blinds us is actually darkness to us. Only the day we are awake to really happens. There is more day to come. The sun is just the morning star.

THE END ON THE DUTY OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE I really like the saying, “The best government is the one that governs least,” and I wish we could follow it more quickly and fully.
