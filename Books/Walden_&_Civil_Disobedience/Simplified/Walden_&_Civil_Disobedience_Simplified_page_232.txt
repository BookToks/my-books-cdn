Conclusion: When people are sick, doctors often suggest they go somewhere with fresh air and new views.

Luckily, the whole world isn’t just one place. For example, buck-eye trees don’t grow in New England, and you almost never hear mocking-birds there. Wild geese travel a lot; they eat breakfast in Canada, lunch in Ohio, and spend the night in a southern swamp.

Even bison move with the seasons, grazing in Colorado until better grass grows near Yellowstone. But sometimes we think that once we settle in one place and make rules, our lives are stuck there. If you become town clerk, you might think you can’t travel far, but you can still go to exciting places. The world is bigger than what we see.

We should often look around us like curious travelers, not like sailors who only do boring tasks. The other side of the world is just where a letter comes from. Traveling far isn’t that special, and doctors only suggest it for simple problems. Some people go to Southern Africa to see giraffes, but that’s probably not the real reason they travel. How long would someone enjoy hunting giraffes anyway? There’s also fun in hunting small birds, but the real challenge is learning about yourself.

“Look inside yourself, and you’ll find many parts of your mind you haven’t explored yet. Travel there and become an expert in your own world.” What does Africa or the West really mean? Isn’t our own mind still a mystery? Even if it seems dark or unknown, like uncharted lands, it’s worth exploring. Are we really searching for rivers, passages, or lost explorers? Are those the things that matter most? Is Franklin the only person lost that his wife must find him?
