By now, I shouldn’t have been surprised to see their own musical bands set up on some high spot, playing their national songs to encourage the slow and tired fighters. I felt a bit excited too, almost like they were real soldiers. The more you think about it, the less difference there is. And honestly, no fight in Concord’s history, or even America’s history, can compare to this one when it comes to how many were involved or the bravery shown. In numbers and bloodshed, it was like a huge battle such as Austerlitz or Dresden. The Concord fight had only two patriots killed and one wounded, but here every ant was a hero shouting, “Fire! for God’s sake fire!” and thousands ended up like Davis and Hosmer.

None of them were hired fighters. I’m sure they fought for a cause, just like our ancestors, not just to avoid a small tax on their tea. And the results of this battle will be just as important and remembered by those who care as the battle of Bunker Hill.

I picked up the chip where the three ants I told you about were fighting, took it into my house, and put it under a glass on my window sill to watch what would happen. Looking through a microscope at the red ant, I saw he was biting the front leg of his enemy and had already cut off the other ant’s feeler. But his own chest was badly damaged, showing his insides to the black ant’s jaws. The black ant’s thick armor seemed to protect him well, and his dark eyes shone fiercely, like a warrior ready to fight. They struggled for half an hour under the glass, and when I checked again, the black ant had cut off the heads of his enemies, which were hanging on either side of him like scary trophies. He was trying hard to get rid of them even though he had lost his feelers and most of a leg, and had many other wounds. After another half hour, he finally managed to shake them off. I lifted the glass, and he crawled away over the window sill in that broken state. I don’t know if he survived or spent the rest of his life injured, but I figured he probably wouldn’t be very good at working anymore.
