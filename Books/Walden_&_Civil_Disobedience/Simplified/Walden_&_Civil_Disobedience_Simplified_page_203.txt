In an old trader’s “Wast Book” from this town, who was also a captain, town-clerk, and representative, I found a note. On Jan. 18th, 1742–3, it says, “John Melven Cr. by 1 Grey Fox 0—2—3;” but grey foxes aren’t found here anymore. In his ledger on Feb. 7th, 1743, Hezekiah Stratton got credit “by ½ a Catt skin 0—1—4½;” it was probably a wild cat because Stratton was a sergeant in the old French war and wouldn’t get credit for hunting smaller animals. People also got credit for deer skins, which were sold every day. One man still has the horns of the last deer killed nearby, and another told me about the hunt his uncle was part of. Back then, hunters were a big, happy group. I remember one skinny hunter who could pick up a leaf by the road and play music on it, sounding even better than a hunting horn.

At midnight, when the moon was out, I sometimes met hunting dogs on the path in the woods. They would sneak away quietly, like they were scared, and hide in the bushes until I passed.

Squirrels and wild mice fought over my nuts. Around my house, there were many small pine trees, from one to four inches wide, that mice had chewed on the winter before. It was a hard winter, with lots of snow, so the mice had to eat pine bark along with other food. The trees looked healthy in summer, and some even grew a foot tall, even though the mice had eaten all around them. But after another winter, all those trees died. It’s strange that one mouse could eat a whole tree by chewing around it instead of up and down. Maybe this helps thin out the trees, which usually grow very close together.

The hares (Lepus Americanus) were very friendly. One stayed under my house all winter, just separated from me by the floor. Every morning, she would scare me by running away quickly when I started moving—thump, thump, thump—as she hit her head on the floorboards. They used to come near my door at dusk to eat potato scraps I threw outside. They were almost the same color as the ground, so it was hard to see them when they stayed still. Sometimes in the fading light, I would lose and then see again a hare sitting quietly under my window.
