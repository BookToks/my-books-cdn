Far behind came an old dog and her three puppies chasing on their own, hunting by themselves, and they disappeared again into the woods. Late in the afternoon, while he was resting in the thick woods south of Walden, he heard the dogs barking far away near Fair Haven, still chasing the fox. The sound of their barking, which made all the woods echo, got closer and closer, sometimes coming from Well-Meadow, sometimes from Baker Farm.

He stood still for a long time, listening to their calls, which sounded so nice to a hunter’s ears. Suddenly, the fox appeared, moving easily through the quiet woods. The rustling leaves covered the sound of his steps as he ran fast and quietly, leaving the dogs far behind. He jumped onto a rock in the woods and sat up straight, listening, with his back to the hunter.

For a moment, the hunter felt sorry and didn’t want to shoot. But that feeling didn’t last long. Quickly, he aimed his gun, and bang! The fox rolled off the rock and lay dead on the ground. The hunter stayed where he was and listened to the dogs. They kept coming closer, and their wild cries filled the nearby woods.

Finally, the old dog appeared, nose to the ground, snapping the air like she was crazy. She ran straight to the rock but stopped suddenly when she saw the dead fox. She looked shocked and walked quietly around it. One by one, her puppies showed up, and like their mother, they were silent and confused by what they saw.

Then the hunter stepped forward and stood with the dogs, and the mystery was clear. They waited quietly while he skinned the fox. After a while, the dogs followed the fox’s trail but then turned off into the woods again.

That evening, a man from Weston came to the hunter’s cottage in Concord to ask about his dogs. He said they had been running on their own for a week, hunting in Weston woods. The hunter told him what had happened and offered the skin, but the man said no and left. He didn’t find his dogs that night, but the next day learned they had crossed the river and stayed at a farm for the night. After being fed well, they left early the next morning.

The hunter who told me this remembered a man named Sam Nutting. Nutting used to hunt bears on Fair Haven Ledges and trade their skins for rum in Concord village. He even said he had seen a moose there.

Nutting had a famous fox-hound named Burgoyne—he said it like "Bugine"—which my friend used to borrow.
