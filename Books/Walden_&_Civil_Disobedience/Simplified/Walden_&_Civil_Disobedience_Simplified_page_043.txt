I got twelve bushels of beans and eighteen bushels of potatoes, plus some peas and sweet corn. The yellow corn and turnips were too late to grow well. My total money from the farm was $23.44. After paying expenses of $14.72½, I had $8.71½ left. I also had some produce I used or still had, worth $4.50, which was more than enough to cover a little grass I didn’t grow. All in all, thinking about how important a person’s soul and life today are, and even though my experiment was short, I believe I did better than any farmer in Concord that year.

The next year I did even better because I dug up all the land I needed, about a third of an acre. I learned from both years that if you live simply and only eat what you grow, without trading it for expensive or fancy things, you only need to farm a small amount of land. It’s cheaper to dig the soil with a spade than to use oxen to plow it. It’s better to choose new land to farm than to add fertilizer to old land. You can do all the farming work easily in your spare time during summer. This way, you don’t need to have oxen, horses, cows, or pigs like most farmers do now. I want to be fair about this and say I’m not trying to prove if current farming or social systems are good or bad. I was more independent than any farmer in Concord because I wasn’t tied down to a house or farm and could follow my own ideas, which change a lot. Also, if my house burned down or my crops failed, I would still be almost as well off as before.

I often think that animals don’t belong to people as much as people belong to animals. Animals are much freer. People and oxen work together, but if you look at only the necessary work, oxen have a big advantage because they work on a much bigger farm. People do some of their share during six weeks of haying, which is hard work, not easy at all.
