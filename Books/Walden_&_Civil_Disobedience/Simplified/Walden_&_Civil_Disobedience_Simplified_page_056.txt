People say, basically, start where you are and who you are, without trying too hard to become more important, and kindly go out and do good things. If I were to give advice like that, I would say instead, start by being good. It’s like if the sun stopped shining brightly after only being as bright as the moon or a small star, and then just wandered around causing trouble instead of growing hotter and kinder until it’s so bright no one can look at it. The sun keeps moving in its path, helping the world, or better yet, the world moves around the sun and gets better because of it. When Phaeton wanted to prove he was special by driving the sun’s chariot for one day but went off course, he burned down parts of heaven, scorched the earth, dried up springs, and made the Sahara desert. In the end, Jupiter threw him down with a thunderbolt, and the sun was so sad it didn’t shine for a whole year.

There is no smell worse than the one that comes from goodness that’s spoiled. It’s both human and divine, like rotten meat. If I knew for sure someone was coming to my house trying to “help” me on purpose, I would run away fast, like from a hot desert wind that fills your mouth, nose, ears, and eyes with dust until you can’t breathe, because I’d be afraid their “help” would poison me somehow. No, I’d rather deal with problems the natural way. A person isn’t truly good just because they’d feed you if you were starving, warm you if you were freezing, or pull you from a ditch if you fell in. Even a dog can do that. Helping others isn’t just about doing kind acts. Howard was probably a very kind and good man, and he got his rewards, but what good are a hundred people like him if their help doesn’t reach us when we deserve it most? I never heard of any meeting where someone seriously planned to help me or people like me in a real way.

The Jesuits were surprised by some Indians who, even while being burned alive, suggested new ways to torture them. These people were stronger than physical pain and sometimes didn’t even want the comfort the missionaries tried to give. The idea of “treat others how you want to be treated” didn’t make much sense to those who didn’t care how others treated them, who loved their enemies in a different way, and almost completely forgave everything they were done.
