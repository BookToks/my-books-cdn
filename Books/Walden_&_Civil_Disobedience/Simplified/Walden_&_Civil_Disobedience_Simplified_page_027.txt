Sometimes, the debts on a farm are so big that the farm itself feels like a heavy burden. Still, someone ends up inheriting it because they know the land well. When I asked the people who check property values, I was surprised to find out that in the whole town, fewer than twelve people own their farms without any debt. If you want to learn the story behind these farms, just ask the bank where the owners owe money. The farmer who actually paid for his farm by working hard on it is so rare that everyone nearby can point to him. I don’t think there are even three such farmers in Concord.

It’s the same for merchants as well. Almost all of them, maybe ninety-seven out of a hundred, end up failing.

One merchant mentioned that many of these failures aren’t because of money problems but because people don’t keep their promises—it’s a problem of character. But this actually makes things worse. It suggests that even the few who don’t fail financially might still be failing in a deeper way. Our society often recovers from money troubles, but a person without integrity is in bigger trouble. Still, every year, the Middlesex Cattle Show happens with great success, acting like everything in farming is working smoothly.

Farmers try to make a living with methods more complicated than the problem itself. To make money for small things like shoelaces, they take big risks by buying and selling herds of cattle. They set traps to catch comfort and independence but often end up trapping themselves instead. This is why many farmers stay poor. In the same way, we all lack some basic comforts even though we have many luxuries around us. As the poet Chapman says, “The false society of men—for earthly greatness, all heavenly comforts turn into air.” Sometimes, when a farmer finally owns a house, it doesn’t make him richer—in fact, it might make him poorer because the house controls him. Long ago, Momus criticized the house that Minerva made, saying it wasn’t movable, so people couldn’t escape bad neighborhoods. This is still true today—our houses are so big and heavy that they trap us instead of sheltering us. And the worst neighborhood to avoid is often our own bad habits and thoughts.
