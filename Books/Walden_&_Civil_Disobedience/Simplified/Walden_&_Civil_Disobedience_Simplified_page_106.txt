I don’t think I’ll ever go back to those places. I’d be proud to have a motto for my cabin from a quote one visitor wrote on a leaf: “Once you arrive, the little house is full. Don’t expect much entertainment; rest is their feast, and the best minds are the most content.”

When Winslow, who later became governor of Plymouth Colony, went with a friend to visit Massasoit by walking through the woods, they were tired and hungry when they got there. The king welcomed them, but didn’t offer food that day. At night, they all slept on a simple bed made of planks and a thin mat. Two other important men had to squeeze in too, so their sleeping was even less comfortable than their journey.

The next day at one o’clock, Massasoit brought two big fish he had caught. When they cooked the fish, about forty people came hoping for some. Most of the fish was eaten by others. That was the only meal they had in two nights and a day. If they hadn’t bought a partridge, they would have traveled hungry. They worried they might get weak and light-headed from no food and not sleep because of the loud singing of the natives, who sang themselves to sleep. So, they decided to leave while they still had the strength.

Their sleeping arrangements were poor, but what they saw as uncomfortable was probably meant as a sign of respect. When it came to food, I don’t think the Indians could have done better.

They didn’t have much food themselves and knew sorry words couldn’t replace real food for their guests. So, they tightened their belts and didn’t mention it. Another time when Winslow visited, they had plenty to eat.

As for visitors, people usually don’t fail to show up. I had more visitors in the woods than at any other time in my life, though not many. I met some under better conditions than anywhere else. But fewer came for small reasons because I was far from town.
