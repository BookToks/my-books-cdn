This is what I learned from growing beans. Plant the regular small white bush beans around the first of June in rows that are three feet by eighteen inches apart. Make sure you use fresh, round seeds that aren’t mixed with others. First, watch out for worms and replant where seeds don’t grow. Then watch out for woodchucks if the area is open because they will eat the earliest leaves almost completely. When the young bean tendrils start to grow, woodchucks will nibble on them too, cutting off buds and pods while sitting up like squirrels. But most importantly, harvest your beans as early as you can to avoid frost and get a good, sellable crop. This will save you a lot of loss.

I also learned something else. I told myself I wouldn’t work so hard planting beans and corn next summer. Instead, I thought about planting seeds like honesty, truth, simplicity, faith, and innocence to see if they would grow in this soil with less effort and still support me. I believed the soil wasn’t worn out from those crops. But sadly, summer after summer went by, and the seeds I planted—if they really were those good qualities—were eaten by worms or lost their power, so they didn’t grow.

Usually, people are brave or scared just like their parents were. This generation will plant corn and beans every year just like Native Americans did centuries ago, because they think it’s fate. I saw an old man the other day making holes with a hoe for the seventieth time or more—not even to lie down in! But why shouldn’t people in New England try new things instead of caring so much about their grain, potatoes, grass, and orchards? Why focus so much on saving bean seeds but not care about raising a new generation of people?

We would really feel happy and hopeful if, when we met someone, we could see that some of those good qualities I mentioned—qualities we all value more than crops but that usually float around without taking root—had actually started growing in that person.
