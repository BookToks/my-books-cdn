But they struggle a lot—living, sadly, without knowing much about math, and failing because of it.

“Do you ever go fishing?” I asked. “Oh yes, I catch some fish now and then when I’m resting; good perch, too.” “What do you use for bait?” “I catch small fish called shiners with worms, and then use those to bait the perch.” “You better go now, John,” said his wife, hopeful and shining, but John hesitated.

The rain had stopped, and a rainbow over the woods in the east promised a nice evening, so I decided to leave. Outside, I asked for a drink, hoping to see the bottom of the well to finish checking the place; but, sadly, there were shallow parts, quicksand, a broken rope, and a lost bucket. Still, the right pot was chosen, water seemed to be made carefully, and after talking and waiting a long time, they gave the thirsty person some water—not yet cooled or settled. I thought, this thin drink keeps them alive here; so, closing my eyes and carefully avoiding the little floating bits, I drank as much as I could to show real thanks. I’m not picky about manners in these moments.

As I left the Irishman’s house after the rain, walking back to the pond, my rush to catch pickerel by wading through quiet meadows, muddy bogs, and wild places suddenly seemed a little silly for someone who had gone to school and college. But as I ran down the hill toward the glowing sunset, with the rainbow behind me and soft, faint sounds coming from somewhere in the fresh air, my good spirit seemed to say—Go fish and explore far and wide every day—go farther and farther—and rest by many streams and fires without worry. Remember your Creator while you’re young. Wake up early and look for adventures. Let the noon find you by different lakes, and let the night catch you at home anywhere. There are no bigger places or better games than these. Grow wild like these plants that will never become English hay. Let the thunder roll; if it threatens farmers’ crops, that’s not your problem. Take shelter under the clouds while others run to carts and sheds. Don’t work just to make a living; make your life a game. Enjoy the land, but don’t own it.
