On warm evenings, I often sat in the boat playing the flute. I saw perch fish, which seemed attracted by my music, swimming around me. The moonlight moved over the rippled bottom, covered with fallen trees from the forest.

In the past, I would come to this pond on dark summer nights with a friend. We made a fire near the water, hoping it would bring the fish closer. We caught fish called pouts using a bunch of worms on a thread. After we finished, late at night, we threw burning sticks high into the air like fireworks. When they fell into the pond, they hissed as the water put them out, and suddenly it was completely dark. We whistled a tune as we found our way back to where people lived. But now, I lived by the shore.

Sometimes, after staying in a village room until everyone went to bed, I returned to the woods. I spent midnight fishing from a boat by moonlight, surrounded by the sounds of owls and foxes. Sometimes, I heard the creaky call of a strange bird nearby. These moments were special and important to meâ€”anchored in forty feet of water, twenty or thirty rods from shore, surrounded by thousands of small fish making ripples in the moonlight.

I used a long, light line to catch mysterious night fish living deep below. Sometimes, I let out sixty feet of line, drifting in the soft night breeze. Every now and then, I felt a small twitch, showing that some fish was near the end of the line, moving slowly and unsure. Finally, I would slowly pull up a horned pout fish, squeaking and wriggling in the air. It felt strange, especially on dark nights when my thoughts drifted to big ideas about the universe, to feel this small jerk bringing me back to nature. It felt like I could cast my fishing line into the air as easily as into the water, since the air felt almost as light.
