I used to start the hunts in open fields too, where the animals came out of the woods at sunset to eat the buds on wild apple trees. They would come every evening to certain trees, where a clever hunter would wait for them. The orchards near the woods got damaged a lot because of this. Still, I’m happy the partridges get something to eat. They are wild birds that live on buds and plant juices.

On dark winter mornings or short winter afternoons, I sometimes heard a pack of hounds running through the woods, barking and yelping because they couldn’t resist chasing. I also heard the hunting horn sometimes, which meant people were chasing behind. The woods would be loud, but no fox would suddenly run out onto the clear pond area, and no dogs would catch it there. In the evening, I might see the hunters coming back with just one fox tail on their sleigh as a trophy, heading to their inn.

People say that if the fox stayed hidden in the frozen ground, it would be safe. Or if it ran straight away, the dogs couldn’t catch it. But the fox often stops to rest and listen after running far ahead, and then it runs in circles near its old hiding spots where hunters wait. Sometimes, the fox runs along a wall for a long distance, then jumps off to the side, knowing water doesn’t hold its scent. A hunter once told me he saw a fox run across the ice on Walden Pond, where shallow puddles covered the ice, then come back to shore. The dogs lost its scent there. Sometimes, a pack of dogs would come by my house, running in circles and barking without paying attention to me, like they were crazy and couldn’t stop hunting. They keep circling until they find the fresh trail of a fox, because smart dogs ignore everything else to follow it. One day, a man came to my cabin from Lexington asking about his dog that had been hunting alone for a week. But I don’t think he learned much from me because he kept interrupting me, asking, “What do you do here?” He lost his dog but found a man instead.

An old hunter with a dry mouth, who used to swim in Walden Pond once a year when the water was warm, told me that many years ago he took his gun and went for a walk in Walden Woods one afternoon. As he walked along Wayland road, he heard hounds barking nearby. Soon a fox jumped over the wall into the road, and then quickly jumped over the other wall out of the road. The hunter fired his gun, but the fox was too fast and wasn’t hit.
