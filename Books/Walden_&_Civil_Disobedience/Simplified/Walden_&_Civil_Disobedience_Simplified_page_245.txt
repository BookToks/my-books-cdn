How should a person act toward the American government today? I say that anyone who supports it is acting shamefully. I can’t accept a government that also supports slavery as my government.

Everyone agrees that people have the right to rebel. This means they can refuse to obey and fight against a government when it is very unfair or not working well. But most people say that’s not true now. They think it was only true back in the Revolution of 1775. If someone told me this government was bad just because it taxed some imported goods, I probably wouldn’t complain much, since I don’t really need those things. Every system has its problems, and maybe the good parts balance out the bad. But when the problems become the whole system, and when unfairness and theft are organized by the government, I say we should get rid of that system.

For example, when one-sixth of a country’s people are slaves, and when another country is taken over by a foreign army and forced to live under military rule, I think honest people should start a rebellion. What makes this even more urgent is that the country being taken over isn’t someone else’s—it’s us who are the invading army.

Paley, a well-known thinker about morals, says that people should obey the government as long as it’s best for society. He explains that if changing or resisting the government would cause too many problems, then it’s better to obey. He says each person should decide for themselves if it’s worth resisting based on how bad the problem is and how likely it is to fix it. But Paley doesn’t seem to think about times when people have to do what’s right no matter the cost. For example, if I took a plank from someone drowning, I have to give it back even if it means I might drown.

Paley would say that’s inconvenient. But the person who tries to save their own life by doing wrong will actually lose it.
