When my hoe hit the stones, the sound bounced off the woods and sky, making music that went along with my work, which gave me a quick and huge reward. I wasn’t just hoeing beans anymore, and I felt both sorry for and proud of my friends who had gone to the city to listen to concerts. Sometimes I worked all day, and the night-hawk flew above me in the sunny afternoons, like a tiny speck in the sky. It swooped down sometimes with a loud sound, as if the sky was tearing apart, but the sky stayed whole. Tiny creatures filled the air and laid eggs on bare sand or rocks on hilltops, places hardly anyone finds. They were graceful and thin like ripples from a pond or leaves floating in the air; this is the way Nature connects everything.

The hawk is like a brother to the waves he flies over, with wings that match the young wings of the sea. Sometimes I watched two hen-hawks circling high in the sky, going up and down, coming close and moving away from each other, like they showed how my own thoughts moved.

I was also drawn to the wild pigeons flying from one wood to another, making a soft fluttering sound and flying fast. Or, when my hoe turned over a rotten stump, I found a slow-moving, strange spotted salamander, which seemed like a piece of Egypt and the Nile but lived with us now. When I stopped to rest on my hoe, I saw and heard these things all along the row, part of the endless fun the countryside gives.

On special days, the town fires big guns that sound like small popguns to the woods. Sometimes, bits of marching music reached me there. From my bean field far from town, the big guns sounded like a burst puffball. When there was a military event I didn’t know about, I’d feel all day like something weird was happening on the horizon, like a sickness or rash might break out soon. Then a quick breeze rushing over the fields and up Wayland road would bring news of the “trainers.” The distant humming sounded like bees swarming, and the neighbors, following Virgil’s advice, tried to call them back to their hive by ringing their loudest pots and pans.
