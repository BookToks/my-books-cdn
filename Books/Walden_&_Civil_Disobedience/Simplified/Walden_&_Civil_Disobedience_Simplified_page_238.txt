Maybe they’re just good enough to accept help without feeling bad. Most people think they’re too proud to get support from the town; but often, they’re not too proud to support themselves in dishonest ways, which is worse. Treat poverty like a useful plant, like sage. Don’t worry too much about getting new things, like clothes or friends. Use the old ones; go back to them. Things don’t really change; we change. Sell your clothes but keep your thoughts. God will make sure you don’t miss having friends or society. If I were stuck in a tiny attic all my life, like a spider, the world would still feel big to me as long as I had my thoughts with me. A wise person said: “You can take away the leader from a big army and mess it up; but you can’t take away a person’s thoughts, even from the lowest and most ordinary person.” Don’t stress about always changing or trying to be influenced by everything; it just wastes your energy. Humility, like darkness, shows the stars in the sky. When we’re poor or feel small, suddenly the world seems bigger and more amazing. People often say that even if we had tons of money, our goals and ways would still be mostly the same. Also, if you’re poor and can’t buy books or newspapers, you focus on the most important and meaningful things in life. You live close to the real heart of life, where it’s sweetest. Poverty protects you from wasting time on unimportant stuff. Nobody ever loses by being kind and generous, even if they have little. Extra wealth can only buy extra, unnecessary things. You don’t need money to get what your soul really needs.

I live in a small, dull corner, made a little special with some bell metal mixed in. Often, in the quiet of midday, I hear a mixed-up ringing noise from outside. It’s the sound of people my age. My neighbors tell me stories about meeting famous men and women, and who they saw at fancy dinners; but I don’t care about those things any more than I care about the news in the newspaper. Their talks are mostly about clothes and manners; but a goose is still a goose, no matter what it wears. They tell me about places like California, Texas, England, and the Indies, and about important men from different states—all just temporary and passing things—until I feel like jumping out of their boring world. I love to find my own place—not to march around showing off, but to walk quietly with the Creator of the universe, if I can—not to live in this busy, noisy, shallow 19th Century, but to stand or sit calmly while it all happens around me.
