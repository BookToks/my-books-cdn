Some people think that everything about human life has already been figured out by those who came before us—the ups and downs, and every little detail. Evelyn said that even wise Solomon made rules about how far apart trees should be planted, and Roman judges decided how often you can go onto your neighbor’s land to pick up acorns without causing trouble, and how much belongs to the neighbor. Even Hippocrates gave advice on how to cut our nails—just even with the fingertips, not shorter or longer.

Boredom and feeling like life has nothing new to offer have been around since the very beginning. But people’s abilities have never been fully tested, and we shouldn’t judge what we can do just because of what’s been done before, since so little has really been tried. No matter how many times you’ve failed, don’t be upset, because no one can say exactly what you haven’t done yet. We can test our lives in many simple ways; for example, the same sun that helps my beans grow shines on many Earth-like planets. If I had remembered this, I might have avoided some mistakes.

When I worked in the garden, I didn’t think about it like that. The stars are the points of amazing shapes, and faraway beings in different parts of the universe are looking at the same stars at the same time! Nature and human life are as different as each person is.

Who can say what life looks like to someone else? Wouldn’t it be the biggest miracle if we could see through each other’s eyes for a moment? We would experience all the times in history in just an hour, even all the worlds and ages. History, poetry, and stories—nothing is as surprising and eye-opening as this would be.

Most of the things my neighbors call “good,” I honestly think are bad. If I regret anything, it’s probably acting too “good.”

What made me act so well? You can say the smartest things, old man—you who have lived seventy years and earned some respect—I hear a strong voice pulling me away from all that. One generation leaves behind what another started, like abandoned ships.
