Does Mr. Grinnell really know where he is? Be like Mungo Park, Lewis and Clarke, or Frobisher—explore your own rivers and oceans. Explore your own inner world, and bring enough food to keep you going if you need it. Save the empty cans as proof. Were preserved meats made just to keep food fresh? No, be like Columbus discovering whole new continents and worlds inside yourself, opening new paths—not for trading goods, but for new ideas.

Every person controls a kingdom inside them that’s bigger than any empire on Earth. But some people can love their country without respecting themselves. They care about the land they will be buried in but don’t connect with the spirit inside them. For them, patriotism is just a silly idea in their heads. What was the point of that expensive South-Sea Exploring Expedition, with all its show and cost, but to admit that there are lands and seas inside each person that no one has explored yet? It’s easier to travel thousands of miles through storms and dangers with a big crew than to explore your own inner world alone.

Let others travel and study strange places far away. I have more of God inside me; they have more of the road to travel. It’s not worth going all around the world just to count cats in Zanzibar. Still, do this traveling until you can do better, and maybe you’ll find a secret way inside yourself at last. England, France, Spain, Portugal—all these places touch this private sea inside us, but no ship from them has sailed far from shore. That sea is the shortest way to India.

If you want to speak every language and fit in everywhere, if you want to travel farther than any traveler, and be accepted in every place, follow the advice of the old philosopher: Explore yourself. This takes courage and sharp eyes. Only losers and quitters join wars—they run away and then sign up. Start now on the hardest journey west, a journey that doesn’t stop at the Mississippi or the Pacific, or go to old places like China or Japan, but goes straight to your deepest self—through all seasons, day and night, until even the earth itself fades away.
