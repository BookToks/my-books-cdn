When it comes to being clever, I learned that there isn’t much difference between being a little smart and very smart. One day, a kind, simple poor man who I had often seen used as a helper in the fields came to visit me. He said he wanted to live like me. He honestly told me that he wasn’t very smart. He said the Lord made him that way, but he believed the Lord cared about him just as much as anyone else.  

He said, “I have always been like this since I was a kid; I never had much mind. I wasn’t like other kids. I’m weak in the head. It was the Lord’s will, I guess.” He really showed that what he said was true. I found him very interesting because he was so honest and simple. The more humble he seemed, the more respected he became. At first, I thought maybe he was being clever on purpose. But because he was so truthful and open, I thought our friendship could be better than with smart people.

I had some visitors who weren’t usually thought of as poor, but they were poor in the world’s eyes. These guests didn’t just ask for help nicely; they begged, saying they never planned to help themselves. I expect visitors not to be starving, even if they have a big appetite no matter how they got it. People who only want charity are not really my guests.

Some men didn’t know when to leave, even when I went back to work and answered them from far away. Men with all kinds of cleverness came to see me during moving season. Some were smarter than they knew. Runaway slaves with manners from plantations would listen nervously, like a fox hearing hunting dogs, looking at me as if to say, “Please, will you send me back?” I helped one real runaway slave move toward freedom in the North.  

There were men who focused on one idea like a hen with one chick that was actually a duckling. Others had a thousand ideas and messy hair, like hens trying to watch over a hundred chicks all chasing one bug, losing many every morning and ending up tired and messy. Some had so many ideas, it was like they had legs all over, making you feel like you had to crawl everywhere with them.
