It’s not about how much or how good the food is, but about being too focused on tasty things. When we eat just to enjoy food, not to keep our bodies healthy or to help our spirit grow, then the food becomes like a feast for the worms inside us. If a hunter likes eating mud-turtles and muskrats, and a fancy lady likes jelly made from a calf’s foot or sardines from far away, they’re kind of the same. He goes to the pond, she goes to her fancy food jar. It’s strange how we can live this slimy, animal-like life, just eating and drinking.

Our whole life is really about right and wrong. There’s never a break between doing good and doing bad. Being good is the only thing that always pays off.

Like the sound of a harp that plays all over the world, it’s the message about this that moves us. The harp is like the Universe’s messenger, sharing its rules, and our little bit of goodness is the price we pay. Even if young people stop caring, the rules of the universe don’t stop caring—they always support those who are sensitive. Listen closely to every soft breeze because it might be telling you something important, and it’s bad luck if you don’t hear it. Every time we touch a string or play a note, the beautiful message grabs us. Even annoying sounds from far away can sound like music, making fun of how small and mean our lives can be.

We know there’s an animal part inside us that wakes up more when our higher self is sleeping. It’s like a reptile and is all about physical things, and maybe we can’t get rid of it completely—like worms that live in our bodies even when we’re healthy. Maybe we can step away from it, but never change what it really is. I even think it might have its own kind of health; we can be healthy but not pure. I once found a pig’s lower jaw with strong white teeth and tusks, which showed that there’s a kind of animal strength that’s different from spiritual strength. This animal part succeeds in ways that don’t involve self-control or purity. Mencius said, “What makes people different from animals is a small thing; most people lose it quickly, but better people keep it safe.” Who knows what life would be like if we were truly pure? If I knew someone wise who could teach me purity, I’d go find them right away. The Ved says controlling our desires, our senses, and doing good things is necessary to get close to God. Still, the spirit can spread through and control every part of the body and can turn even the grossest physical urges into purity and love.
