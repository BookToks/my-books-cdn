We often imagine special and amazing places far away in space, beyond the stars, quiet and peaceful. I found out that my home was actually in a quiet, fresh, and untouched part of the universe. If it’s worth living near famous stars like the Pleiades or Aldebaran, then I was just as far away from the busy life I left behind, shining like a tiny light only seen on dark nights by my closest neighbor. That’s where I had settled—“There was a shepherd that did live, And held his thoughts as high As were the mounts whereon his flocks Did hourly feed him by.” What would you think of a shepherd whose sheep always went to better places than his own thoughts?

Every morning was a happy chance to live a simple and pure life, just like Nature. I worshipped the sunrise as much as the ancient Greeks did. I woke up early and swam in the pond; this felt like a sacred ritual and one of the best things I did. They say King Tching-thang had words on his bath that said: “Renew yourself completely each day; do it again, and again, and forever again.” I get that. Morning brings back the heroic times. Even the tiny buzz of a mosquito flying around my room at dawn, with doors and windows open, moved me as much as any famous trumpet sound. It was like a tiny story of anger and travel in the air. It felt magical, a sign that the world is always alive and full of energy.

Morning is the most special time of the day because it’s when we truly wake up. At that moment, we feel less sleepy, and a part of us wakes up that stays asleep during the rest of the day and night. The day won’t be good if we don’t wake up by our own energy and dreams, but only by some annoying noise or alarm. We should wake up with music in the air and fresh smells, ready for a better life than before. This way, the dark night brings good things, just like the light does.
