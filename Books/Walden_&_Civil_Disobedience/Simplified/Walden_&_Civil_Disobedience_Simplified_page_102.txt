God is alone, but the devil is never alone; he has lots of company. I am not more lonely than a single flower or a bug in a field. I’m no lonelier than a small stream, a weather vane, the North Star, the south wind, a spring rain, a winter thaw, or a spider in a new house.

Sometimes in the long winter evenings, when snow falls fast and the wind howls, I get visits from an old settler who is said to have dug Walden Pond and surrounded it with pine trees. He tells me stories about the past and about forever. Together, we enjoy a happy evening with jokes and good thoughts, even without apples or cider. He’s a very smart and funny friend who stays more hidden than anyone else. People think he’s dead, but no one knows where he is buried.

There’s also an old lady nearby who most people can’t see. I like to walk in her fragrant herb garden, picking plants and listening to her stories. She has an amazing imagination and remembers things older than myths. She tells me the real stories behind every fable, because she saw them when she was young.

She’s a strong and lively old lady who loves every kind of weather and season, and she will probably live longer than all her children.

Nature is pure and kind—sun, wind, rain, summer, and winter—they give us health and happiness forever! Nature understands us so well that if a person ever truly grieved, everything would feel it. The sun would lose its brightness, the winds would sigh sadly, clouds would cry, and the trees would lose their leaves and mourn in the middle of summer.

Won’t I connect with the earth? After all, I’m partly made of leaves and soil.

What keeps us healthy and happy? Not some old medicine from our great-grandfathers, but Nature’s own natural remedies—plants and herbs—that have kept her young forever. Instead of fake medicine from those strange wagons that carry bottles, I’d rather breathe fresh morning air straight from nature.
