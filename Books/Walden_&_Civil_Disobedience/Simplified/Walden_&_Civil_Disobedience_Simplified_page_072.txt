We usually think that what we see is what’s real. If someone walked through this town and saw only what’s truly real, where do you think the “Mill-dam” would fit in? If that person told us what they really saw, we wouldn’t recognize the place from their description. Look at a church, a courthouse, a jail, a shop, or a house, and try to say what they really are if you looked at them with true understanding. You’d see that they don’t hold together the way you thought.

People often think the truth is far away, like it’s out past the stars or a long time ago or far in the future. It’s true that in forever there is something grand and real. But all these times and places are actually happening right now. God is most real at this moment and won’t be more real in all the time that comes after. We can only understand what is great and noble by constantly paying attention to the real things around us. The world always matches what we think, whether we move fast or slow, the path is ready for us. So let’s spend our lives imagining and creating. Every artist or poet has had a great idea, and some people later on can make it real.

Let’s spend a day as carefully as nature does, and not get distracted by little things like a nutshell or a tiny bug falling on our path. Let’s get up early and eat breakfast calmly, whether people come to visit or leave, even if bells ring or kids cry—let’s decide to make it a good day. Why should we just give up and go with the crowd? Let’s not get upset by the busy, noisy lunch time, which is like a wild river. If you can get through that, the rest of the day is easier. Stay strong and calm in the morning and pass by those distractions like Ulysses tied to the mast of his ship. If the train whistles, let it whistle until it’s tired. If the bell rings, why rush? Let’s think about what kind of sound it is.

Let’s settle down and work hard, pushing through the muddy mess of opinions, old ideas, traditions, mistakes, and appearances that cover the world—from big cities to churches, governments, poems, philosophies, and religions—until we find solid ground. When we find real, unshakable truth, we can say, “This is real, no mistake.” Then we can start building on it, like laying a strong wall or setting up a lamp post safely. Maybe we can even measure how deep the floods of fake ideas and appearances have been over time, so future generations will know the truth better than we do.
