I had gone so deep into my own world of loneliness, where all the busy rivers of society flow into, that mostly only the smallest bits of what I needed were left around me. Also, I heard about unknown and wild places far away.

This morning, someone came to my cabin—a real tough guy from far away. He had a cool, poetic name I wish I could share. He was a Canadian who chopped wood and made fence posts. He could put in fifty posts a day and had just eaten a woodchuck that his dog caught. He knew about Homer, the old poet, and said if it weren’t for books, he wouldn’t know what to do on rainy days. But he probably hadn’t read a whole book in a long time. A priest who could speak Greek taught him to read some verses from the Bible back in his hometown. Now, I had to translate for him a line where Achilles scolds Patroclus for looking sad—“Why are you crying like a young girl? Did you hear news from Phthia?”

The verse said Menœtius and Peleus still live among the Myrmidons, and if either died, they would be very sad. He said, “That’s good.” He carried a big bundle of white-oak bark to help a sick person, picked that Sunday morning. “I guess it’s okay to go get this today,” he said. To him, Homer was a great writer, though he wasn’t sure what the stories were really about. He was a simple, natural man. Bad things like crime and sickness didn’t seem to bother him much.

He was about twenty-eight and had left Canada and his family when he was sixteen to work in the States. He wanted to save money to buy a farm back home someday. He was built rough—strong but slow, with a thick sunburned neck, dark messy hair, and dull blue eyes that sometimes showed some feeling. He wore a flat gray cap, a dirty wool coat, and cowhide boots. He ate a lot of meat and usually carried his lunch a few miles past my house where he worked all summer chopping wood. His lunch was cold meat—often woodchuck—and coffee in a stone bottle hanging from his belt. Sometimes he shared a drink with me.
