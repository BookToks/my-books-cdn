When a person who can’t read and might look down on others works hard and earns enough money to enjoy free time and independence, they eventually join rich and fashionable groups. Then, they start to want to be part of even smarter and more creative groups, but those feel out of reach. They realize their education isn’t perfect and that money alone isn’t enough. Because of this, they wisely try hard to give their kids a better education, which is how they start a lasting family legacy.

People who haven’t learned to read the old classic books in their original languages don’t really understand human history well. It’s interesting that these classics haven’t been fully translated into modern languages, unless you count our whole civilization as a kind of translation. Famous old writers like Homer, Æschylus, and Virgil haven’t been printed in English as complete works yet. Their work is as beautiful and well-made as a bright morning. Even though newer writers are talented, they rarely match the careful skill and effort the ancients put into their writing. People only say to forget the classics if they never really knew them. We should wait to forget them until we are smart enough to understand and appreciate them. The future will be amazing when all these classics and even older sacred writings from different cultures fill libraries. When the world’s greatest books from all times come together, we might finally reach something like heaven.

Great poets’ works haven’t truly been understood by most people because only great poets can really read them. Most people look at them like star watchers who guess the future but don’t understand the stars themselves. Most people learn to read just for simple reasons, like not getting cheated in business. But real reading is a high-level mental activity. It’s not a relaxing luxury that makes us sleepy; it’s something that makes us stand on our toes and use our sharpest, most awake minds.
