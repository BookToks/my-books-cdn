What’s the point of measuring me if she only looks at my shoulder width, like I’m just a hanger for a coat? We don’t admire beauty or fate, but Fashion. Fashion decides everything. The top boss in Paris wears a traveler’s hat, and then all the people in America copy it. Sometimes I feel like it’s impossible to get anything simple and honest done with people’s help. They’d have to be crushed hard to get rid of their old ideas, but even then, someone might have a weird thought stuck in their head that won’t go away, no matter what. So, your effort would be wasted. Still, we should remember that some old Egyptian wheat seeds came to us from a mummy.

Overall, I don’t think dressing has become a real art anywhere. Right now, people just wear whatever they can find. Like sailors who’ve been shipwrecked, they put on whatever’s lying on the shore, and from far away or later on, they laugh at each other’s strange outfits. Every generation makes fun of old styles but follows new ones carefully. We find the clothes from Henry VIII or Queen Elizabeth funny, like they belong to some weird island tribe. All clothes on a person look silly or strange. It’s only the serious look in someone’s eyes and the honest life they live inside that makes their clothes seem important.

If Harlequin suddenly got a stomach ache, his fancy clothes would have to fit that mood too. When a soldier is hit by a cannonball, rags look as good as royal purple.

People’s childish and wild love for new styles makes them look through kaleidoscopes, squinting to find the pattern this generation wants today. The makers know this taste is just a whim. Two patterns that differ by just a few threads might sell very differently—one sells fast, the other sits on the shelf. But sometimes, after a season, the one that didn’t sell becomes the most popular. Compared to this, tattooing isn’t as ugly as people say.
