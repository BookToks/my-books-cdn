While England is trying to fix the potato disease, why isn’t anyone trying to fix the "brain disease" that affects way more people and is even more dangerous?

I don’t think my writing is hard to understand, but I’d be happy if the only problem people found was like the one with Walden’s ice. People in the South didn’t like its blue color, which actually shows it’s pure, because it looked muddy to them. They preferred the white ice from Cambridge, even though it tasted like weeds. People who want purity are like the fog covering the earth, not like the clear blue sky above.

Some people keep telling us that Americans and modern people aren’t as smart as people from the past, like the ancient times or the Elizabethan era. But what does that really matter? A living dog is better than a dead lion.

Should someone give up just because they come from a group that isn’t the biggest or best? No! Everyone should focus on their own life and try to be the best version of themselves.

Why are we always in such a rush to succeed and do huge things? If someone doesn’t keep up with others, maybe it’s because they hear a different beat. They should follow their own rhythm, no matter how slow or far away it sounds. It doesn’t matter if they don’t grow up as fast as a tree. Should they try to change their natural pace? If the world they were meant for isn’t here yet, what fake world can replace it? We shouldn’t get stuck in a fake life. Should we build a fake, blue glass “heaven” around ourselves, only to always look up at the real sky above, like the fake one isn’t there?

There was an artist in a city called Kouroo who wanted to make something perfect. One day, he decided to make a staff. He thought that imperfect work takes time, but perfect work doesn’t. So he said to himself, “It will be perfect in every way, even if that’s all I ever do.” He went to the forest to find the right wood, rejecting stick after stick. His friends left him because they grew old and died while he didn’t age at all. His strong focus and devotion gave him a kind of endless youth without him even realizing it. Because he didn’t give in to time, time stayed away and could only watch sadly from a distance since it couldn’t beat him.
