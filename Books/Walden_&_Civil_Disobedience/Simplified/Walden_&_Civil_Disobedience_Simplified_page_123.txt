Everything reflects and absorbs the sun’s rays in the same way, and the reflected light is just a small part of the amazing view the sun sees every day. To the sun, the earth looks like one big garden, all equally cared for. So, we should appreciate and trust the sun’s light and warmth with a big heart.

Even though I care about the beans I plant and harvest in the fall, this big field I’ve been looking at isn’t just for me. It depends on other helpful things like water that make it grow green. These beans aren’t just for me to harvest.

Don’t the beans partly grow for animals like woodchucks? The ear of wheat (called spica in Latin, which means hope) isn’t the only thing a farmer should hope for. Its grain is not all it gives. So, how can our harvest fail?

Shouldn’t I also be happy about the weeds whose seeds feed the birds? It doesn’t matter much if the fields fill the farmer’s barns. A true farmer won’t worry, just like squirrels don’t worry if the woods have chestnuts this year or not. He finishes his work every day, giving up any claim to what his fields produce, and in his mind, he offers not only his first fruits but also his last.
