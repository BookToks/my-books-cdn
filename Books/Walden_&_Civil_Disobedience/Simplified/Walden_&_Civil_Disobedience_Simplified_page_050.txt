If people can’t understand that, they won’t get much of what I’m trying to say. I’m happy to hear about experiments like this; for example, a young guy tried living for two weeks eating only hard, raw corn on the cob, using just his teeth to chew it.

Squirrels have tried the same thing and did okay. People are interested in these experiments, though some old ladies who can’t do them or who own mills might worry.

My furniture, some of which I made myself and the rest I got for free, included a bed, a table, a desk, three chairs, a small mirror, a pair of tongs, andirons, a kettle, a skillet, a frying pan, a dipper, a washbowl, two knives and forks, three plates, one cup, one spoon, a jug for oil, a jug for molasses, and a fancy lamp. No one is so poor that they have to sit on a pumpkin. That’s just being lazy. There are plenty of chairs like the ones I like in village attics that you can take for free. Furniture! Thank God, I can sit and stand without needing a furniture store.

What kind of person, except maybe a deep thinker, would be okay with seeing all their furniture packed in a cart and taken away, showing empty boxes to everyone? That’s Spaulding’s furniture. I could never tell if the person owning such a load was rich or poor; they always looked poor. Actually, the more stuff like that you have, the poorer you are. Each load looks like it’s from a dozen tiny houses, and if one house is poor, this is twelve times worse. Why do we keep moving except to get rid of our furniture and old stuff? In the end, we go from this life to another, leaving all this behind to be burned. It’s like having all this stuff tied to you, so you can’t move easily through the rough parts of life—you’re dragging your baggage.

A lucky fox might leave his tail stuck in a trap to escape. A muskrat will even chew off its own leg just to be free. No wonder people have lost their energy and freedom. Many times, a person is stuck and can’t move forward. If you’re really wise, when you meet someone, you can see all the stuff they own, even the things they try to hide, like their kitchen furniture and junk they won’t throw away. They look tied down to this stuff, doing their best to move forward. I think a person is really free only when they get through a small opening where their big load of furniture can’t follow.
