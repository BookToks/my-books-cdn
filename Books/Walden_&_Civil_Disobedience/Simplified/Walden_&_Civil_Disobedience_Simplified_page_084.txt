My days didn’t follow a regular schedule like Monday or Tuesday, and I didn’t worry about hours or clocks. I lived like the Puri Indians, who have only one word for yesterday, today, and tomorrow. They show which day they mean by pointing backward for yesterday, forward for tomorrow, and up for the passing day. People in my town thought I was just being lazy, but if birds and flowers judged me, I would have passed. You have to find your own reasons to enjoy life. The natural day is quiet and doesn’t mind if you take it easy.

I had one big advantage over people who needed entertainment from friends or the theatre: my life itself was fun and always changing. It was like a play with many scenes that never ended. If we always worked and lived by the best rules we knew, we wouldn’t get bored. If you follow what you love, it will always show you something new. Doing housework was enjoyable for me. When my floor got dirty, I woke up early, took all my furniture outside onto the grass, and cleaned the floor by washing it and sprinkling white sand on it. Then I scrubbed it until it was clean and white. By the time the villagers finished breakfast, the sun had dried my floor enough for me to go back inside and think quietly.

It was nice to see my whole house stuff outside on the grass, piled up like a gypsy’s pack, with my little three-legged table still holding my books and pen. The furniture seemed happy to be outside and didn’t want to come back in. Sometimes I wanted to put up a shade and sit with them. It was great to see the sun shine on my things and feel the wind blow. Things look much more interesting outside than inside. A bird sat on a nearby branch, life-everlasting flowers grew under the table, and blackberry vines wrapped around its legs. Pine cones, chestnut husks, and strawberry leaves were scattered around. It looked like this is how nature’s shapes got copied onto our furniture—because they once stood right there among them.
