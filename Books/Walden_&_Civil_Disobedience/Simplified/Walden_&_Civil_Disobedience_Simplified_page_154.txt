As I was walking home through the woods with my string of fish and my fishing pole, it was already pretty dark. I saw a woodchuck sneaking across my path and felt a strange, wild excitement. I wanted to catch it and eat it raw—not because I was hungry, but because it felt wild and exciting.

When I lived by the pond, I sometimes wandered the woods like a hungry dog, looking for some kind of meat to eat. I didn’t care how wild or raw it was. The wild places felt familiar to me. Inside, I felt two different urges: one toward a higher, spiritual life, and another toward a wild, savage life. I respect both of these feelings. I love the wild just as much as the good.

Fishing still feels exciting and adventurous to me. Sometimes I like to live like animals do and spend my day outside. Maybe because I hunted and fished when I was young, I got to know Nature better than most. These activities take us to places we wouldn’t know at that age.

People who spend their lives outdoors—like fishermen, hunters, and woodcutters—are kind of part of Nature themselves. They often notice things about Nature better than philosophers or poets who study her with big ideas. Nature isn’t afraid to show herself to these people. For example, travelers on the prairie naturally become hunters, those near the Missouri and Columbia rivers become trappers, and at the Falls of St. Mary, they become fishermen.

Someone who is just a traveler learns things only a little bit and from other people’s stories, so they don’t know much for sure. We’re most interested when science confirms what these outdoor people already understand through experience, because that is the real story of how humans live.
