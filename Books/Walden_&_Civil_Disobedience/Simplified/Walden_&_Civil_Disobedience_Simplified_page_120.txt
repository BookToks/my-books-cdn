Many strong guys who stood a whole foot taller than their friends fell to my weapon and lay in the dirt.

While some people my age spent summer in Boston or Rome learning art, or in India thinking deeply, or in London or New York doing business, I spent my time farming with other New England farmers. I didn’t really want beans to eat because I don’t like them—whether in porridge or as food, I prefer rice. But some people have to work in fields, maybe just to have stories to tell later. Farming was a fun way to spend time, though if I did it too much, it might have become boring. Even though I didn’t use manure or hoe all the plants, I took good care of the ones I did, and it paid off. As one writer, Evelyn, said, nothing beats the feeling of working the soil with a spade. He also said fresh earth has a kind of magic that helps plants grow, and all the hard work we do is to keep that magic alive. This field was old and resting, so it might have even caught some life energy from the air. In the end, I harvested twelve bushels of beans.

To be clear, since some say Mr. Coleman only talks about expensive farming, here’s what I spent:  
For a hoe, $0.54  
Ploughing, harrowing, and furrowing, $7.50 (a bit too much)  
Beans for seed, $3.12½  
Potatoes for seed, $1.33  
Peas for seed, $0.40  
Turnip seed, $0.06  
White line for crow fence, $0.02  
Horse cultivator and boy for three hours, $1.00  
Horse and cart to get the crop, $0.75  
Total: $14.72½

I earned money by selling nine bushels and twelve quarts of beans.
