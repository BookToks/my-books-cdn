It felt like going to a completely different place, one I never thought I’d see, just by staying there for one night. It seemed like I had never heard the town clock before, or the sounds of the village at night; we slept with the windows open, which had bars on them. It was like seeing my hometown in the Middle Ages, and our Concord turned into a river from a fairy tale, with knights and castles appearing in my mind.

I heard the voices of old townspeople in the streets. I couldn’t help but listen to what was happening in the kitchen of the nearby village inn—it was a totally new and rare thing for me. I got a closer look at my hometown. I was actually inside it. I had never seen how its systems worked before. This is one of its special things because it’s a county town. I started to understand what the people there were really about.

In the morning, our breakfasts were handed to us through a hole in the door, in small tin pans shaped to fit, each holding a pint of hot chocolate, some brown bread, and an iron spoon. When they came back to get the pans, I was naive enough to give back the bread I hadn’t eaten; but my friend grabbed it and said I should save it for lunch or dinner. Soon after, he was allowed to go work in a nearby field cutting hay, where he went every day and wouldn’t be back until noon. So he said goodbye, wondering if he would see me again.

When I got out of jail—because someone stepped in and paid the fine—I didn’t notice big changes in the town like someone who goes in young and comes out old. But I did see changes in the town, state, and country that were much bigger than just time passing. I understood more about the place I lived. I saw how much I could trust the people around me as neighbors and friends; that their friendship only lasted in good times; that they didn’t really want to do what was right; that they were very different from me because of their beliefs and fears, like people from faraway places. They didn’t risk much to help others, not even their stuff. And after all, they weren’t that noble—they treated thieves the same way the thieves treated them, hoping that by following some rules, saying a few prayers, and walking a certain way sometimes, they could save their souls. Maybe I’m being too hard on my neighbors, because I think most of them don’t even know their village has a jail.
