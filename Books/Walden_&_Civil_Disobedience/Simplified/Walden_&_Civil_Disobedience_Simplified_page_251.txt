It doesn’t matter how small the start is: if something is done well once, it’s done forever. But we like to talk about it more; that’s what we say is our goal. Many newspapers support reform, but not one person fully does. If my respected neighbor, the State’s representative, who spends his time working on human rights in the government meetings, instead of being threatened with Carolina’s prisons, were to sit down as a prisoner in Massachusetts, the State that wants to blame slavery on its neighbor — even though right now the issue seems to be just a small argument — the government wouldn’t ignore the problem next winter.

In a government that locks up people unfairly, a good person belongs in prison too. Today, the only place Massachusetts offers for its freer and braver people is prison, where they are locked out of the State by their own beliefs. That’s where escaped slaves, Mexican prisoners on parole, and Native Americans fighting for their people’s rights should be found — in that separate but more honest place where the State puts those who don’t agree with it. That’s the only place in a slave-state where a free person can stay with honor. If anyone thinks their influence would be lost there, or their voices wouldn’t bother the State, or that they wouldn’t be like enemies inside the walls, they don’t understand how much stronger truth is than lies, or how powerful someone is when they have suffered injustice themselves.

Use all your power, not just a small part of it. A minority is weak if it follows the majority; it’s not even a minority then. But it is unstoppable when it uses all its strength. If the choice is to keep all good people in prison or to end war and slavery, the State will choose the second. If a thousand people don’t pay their taxes this year, that wouldn’t be violent and bloody like paying them would be — because paying helps the State do violence and kill innocent people. This is what a peaceful revolution really is, if that can happen. If a tax collector or any official asks me, “What should I do?” I say, “If you really want to help, quit your job.” When people refuse to obey and the officials quit, then the revolution is done.
