I think that soon the government will take over all the work I do like this, and then I won’t be any more loyal to my country than anyone else.

From a simple view, the Constitution has some problems but it’s pretty good; the laws and courts are respectable; even this government is, in many ways, impressive and something to be thankful for, as many people have said. But if you look at it from a much deeper view, who can really say what it is or if it’s even worth thinking about?

Still, the government doesn’t bother me much, and I try not to think about it too much. I don’t spend many moments living under a government, even in this world. If a person is free in their thoughts and imagination, bad rulers or reformers can’t truly stop them.

I know most people think differently than I do; but even those who spend their lives studying these topics don’t satisfy me. Politicians and lawmakers, because they are part of the system, never fully see it clearly.

They talk about changing society, but they can’t imagine life outside of it. They might be smart and experienced, and probably have created useful ideas, which we appreciate; but all their intelligence works only within certain small limits.

They often forget that the world is not run by politics and convenience. Webster never looks beyond government, so he can’t really speak about it with real authority. His words help politicians who don’t want big changes; but for deep thinkers and those who make laws for the future, he never really addresses the true issues. I know some people who think deeply about this and would soon show how limited his mind is. Still, compared to most reformers and politicians who mostly talk nonsense, his words are almost the only smart and useful ones, and we should be thankful for him.

Compared to others, he is always strong, original, and practical. But he is not truly wise, just careful. A lawyer’s truth isn’t the real Truth, just a consistent and practical kind of truth.
