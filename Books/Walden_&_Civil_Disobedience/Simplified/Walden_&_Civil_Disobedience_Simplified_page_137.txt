This pond doesn’t have a lot of fish. Its pickerel, though not many, are what it’s most proud of. I have seen three different kinds of pickerel lying on the ice at once: a long, thin one with steel-colored scales like those in the river; a bright golden one with greenish shine that’s the most common here; and another golden one, shaped like the last but with small dark brown or black spots and a few faint red ones, looking a lot like a trout. The name reticulatus doesn’t really fit this last kind; it should be called guttatus instead. These fish are all strong and weigh more than they look. The shiners, pouts, perch, and all other fish in this pond are cleaner, prettier, and have firmer flesh than those in the river or other ponds because the water is purer, so you can easily tell them apart.

Many fish experts might even say some of these fish are new types.

There are also clean frogs and turtles living here, and a few mussels. Muskrats and minks leave signs around the pond, and sometimes a traveling mud-turtle visits. Sometimes, when I push off my boat in the morning, I scare a big mud-turtle that hid under the boat overnight. Ducks and geese come here in spring and fall. White-bellied swallows fly over the water, and peetweets run along the rocky shore all summer. I have sometimes scared a fishhawk sitting on a white pine tree by the water, but I don’t think gulls ever come here like they do at Fair Haven. At most, there might be one loon each year. These are the main animals you’ll see here now.

If you look from a boat on a calm day near the sandy east shore, where the water is 8 to 10 feet deep, and in some other parts of the pond, you’ll see round piles of small stones, about six feet wide and one foot high, with bare sand all around. At first, you might wonder if Native Americans made them on the ice and they sank when it melted, but they are too neat and some look too fresh for that. They are like those found in rivers, but since there are no suckers or lampreys here, I don’t know which fish made them. Maybe they are nests built by chivin fish. These piles add a nice mystery to the pond’s bottom.
