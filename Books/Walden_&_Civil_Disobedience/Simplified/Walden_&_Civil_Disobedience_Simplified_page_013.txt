In this climate, people need four main things to live: Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel. Until we have these, we can’t really think about life’s bigger problems or have a chance to succeed. Humans didn’t just make houses; they also made clothes and learned to cook food. Maybe when they discovered fire was warm, sitting by it went from a luxury to a must-have. Even cats and dogs have gotten used to it.

With good Shelter and Clothing, we keep our body heat inside. But if there’s too much heat from outside, like from fire or extra clothes, that’s when cooking really starts. Darwin, a scientist, said that in cold places like Tierra del Fuego, his well-clothed group by the fire wasn’t too hot, but the naked natives farther away were sweating a lot because they were so warm. We also hear that some people in Australia go naked and are fine, while Europeans feel cold even in clothes. So, is it possible to be tough like those people but also smart like civilized ones?

According to Liebig, a scientist, our body is like a stove, and food is the fuel that keeps the fire going inside our lungs. When it’s cold, we eat more; when it’s warm, we eat less. Our body heat comes from a slow burning process. If this burning is too fast or stops because there’s no fuel or something wrong, we get sick or die. This heat isn’t really fire, but it’s a good way to think about it. So, "animal life" is almost the same as "animal heat." Food is the fuel for the fire inside us, fuel (like wood or coal) helps make food or adds heat from outside, and Shelter and Clothing keep that heat inside.

The most important thing for our bodies is to stay warm and keep that vital heat inside. That’s why we work hard on getting good food, clothes, and shelter. We even pay attention to our beds, which keep us warm at night, just like birds use feathers to make nests or moles make beds of grass underground. Poor people often say the world is cold, and many of our problems come from this cold, both in body and in society. In some places, summer makes life feel like paradise.
