But how is it that the guy who is supposed to enjoy these things is often a poor city man, while the savage, who doesn’t have them, is rich in his own way? If people say civilization really makes life better—and I think it does, though only smart people use its benefits—it has to prove that it gives us better homes without making them more expensive. The cost of something is how much life you have to trade for it, either now or later.  

An average house around here costs about eight hundred dollars. For a worker who earns about one dollar a day, it would take ten to fifteen years to save that much, even if he doesn’t have a family to support. So, he usually spends more than half his life just to pay for his house.  

If he rents instead, it might not be any better. Would the savage be smart to trade his simple home for a fancy palace if it meant working that long?  

You might think all this extra property is mainly saved for funeral costs. But maybe a person doesn’t have to bury himself. Still, this shows a big difference between the civilized man and the savage. For sure, civilization has plans to help us by making society where individual life is partly used up to keep the whole race going and getting better. But I want to show how much it costs us now to get this advantage and suggest that maybe we can live differently to keep the good parts without the bad parts. What do you mean when you say the poor will always be here, or that kids suffer because of their parents’ mistakes?  

“As I live,” says the Lord God, “you won’t have to say this anymore in Israel.” “All souls belong to me; the soul of the father and the soul of the son are mine: whoever sins will die.” When I look at my neighbors, the farmers in Concord, who are at least as well off as others, I see they have worked for twenty, thirty, or forty years to really own their farms. These farms are often inherited with debts or bought with borrowed money—and about one-third of their hard work pays for their houses—but most haven’t finished paying for them yet.
