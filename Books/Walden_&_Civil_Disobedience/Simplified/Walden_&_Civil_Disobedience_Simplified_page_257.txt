In our village, it used to be a tradition that when a poor person who owed money got out of jail, their friends would greet them by crossing their fingers to look like jail bars and say, “How do you do?” My neighbors didn’t do that to me. Instead, they looked at me and then at each other, as if I had just come back from a long trip. I was put in jail while I was on my way to the shoemaker to pick up a fixed shoe. When I got out the next morning, I went back to finish my errand. After putting on my fixed shoe, I joined a group going to pick huckleberries. They were excited to have me lead them. In half an hour, we were in the middle of a huckleberry field on a high hill, two miles away, where the State was nowhere to be seen.

This is the whole story of “My Prisons.” I have never refused to pay the highway tax because I want to be a good neighbor, not a bad citizen. Also, I help support schools now by doing my part to educate others. I don’t refuse to pay the tax because of any specific part of it. I just want to refuse loyalty to the State and step away from it completely. I don’t care where my money goes exactly, even if it buys a weapon, because the money itself isn’t the problem. What matters to me is what happens because of my loyalty. Actually, I quietly oppose the State in my own way, but I still use and enjoy the benefits the State offers, like most people do.

If others pay the tax because they feel connected to the State, that’s their choice, but they may be supporting more injustice than the State actually asks for. If they pay the tax to help someone avoid losing their property or going to jail, it’s because they didn’t think carefully about how personal feelings might hurt the public good.

So, this is where I stand now. But you have to be careful in situations like this, so you don’t act stubborn or worry too much about what others think. You should make sure you only do what is right for yourself and for the moment.
