I spent $8.74 on food. This included things like 0.65 apples, 0.25 dried apples, 0.22 sweet potatoes, 0.10 of a pumpkin, 0.06 of a watermelon, 0.02 salt, and 0.03 other small items. I’m not afraid to admit this because I know most people spend about the same, and their spending wouldn’t look any better if written down.

The next year, I sometimes caught fish for dinner. Once, I even killed a woodchuck that was eating my beans and tried eating it just to see what it was like. It tasted a bit weird, so I realized I probably wouldn’t want to make a habit of it, even if it was convenient to have the meat ready.

I also spent $8.40 on clothes and other small things during this time, but that doesn’t tell us much. I spent $2.00 on oil and some household tools. Altogether, my money went to these things:

House: $28.12  
Farm for one year: $14.72  
Food for eight months: $8.74  
Clothing and other stuff for eight months: $8.40  
Oil and other supplies for eight months: $2.00  

That adds up to $61.99.

Now, I want to talk to those who need to make a living. I earned $23.44 from selling things I grew on the farm and $13.34 from working day jobs. That’s a total of $36.78. 

When you take that away from what I spent, I still have about $25.21 left. That’s close to what I started with, and it shows how much money I needed to live. Besides money, I also gained free time, independence, good health, and a nice house to live in as long as I want.
