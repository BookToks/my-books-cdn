There is not only a feeling of kindness about him, but also a sense of something holy trying to show itself, maybe clumsily and without much success, like a new feeling just starting. For a short time, the hillside is free of rude jokes. You can see some fresh, innocent new growth trying to break out from his rough bark, ready to live another year, soft and new like a young plant. Even he feels the happiness of his Lord. 

Why does the jailer not open the prison doors? Why does the judge not drop the case? Why does the preacher not end his sermon? It’s because they don’t listen to the signs God gives them, or accept the forgiveness He freely offers to everyone.

Each day, the calm and kind morning helps us return to goodness. This makes us a little more like the original, natural human, who loves good things and hates bad ones, like new shoots growing in a forest that was cut down. But when we do bad things during the day, it stops these good feelings from growing and destroys them.

If this happens many times, then even the kindness of the evening can’t keep the good feelings alive. When the evening can no longer protect them, a person’s nature becomes not much different from an animal’s. People see this and think that person never really had the ability to think or be reasonable. Are these really the true feelings of humans?

Long ago, there was a perfect time called the Golden Age. Back then, people were faithful and honest without anyone forcing them. There was no punishment or fear, no scary judges, and people felt safe without anyone watching over them.

The tall pine trees had not yet fallen into the rivers, and people only knew their own homes. 

There was always spring, and gentle warm breezes that calmed the flowers growing without seeds.

On April 29th, while I was fishing by the river near the Nine-Acre-Corner bridge, standing on shaky grass and willow roots where muskrats hide, I heard a strange rattling sound, like the sticks boys play with. When I looked up, I saw a slim and graceful hawk, like a night hawk, flying up and down and rolling over a few times, showing the shiny underside of its wings that glowed like satin or the inside of a pearl shell in the sun.
