The gods must be proud, I thought, sending such bright lightning to scare a poor unarmed fisherman. So I quickly ran to the nearest hut for shelter. It was half a mile from any road, but closer to the pond, and hadn’t been lived in for a long time.

“And here a poet built,  
In the completed years,  
For behold a simple cabin  
That is falling apart.”  
That’s what the Muse says. But when I got there, I found John Field, an Irishman, living inside with his wife and several kids. The oldest boy helped his dad with work and ran beside him from the bog to escape the rain. The youngest baby sat on his father’s knee like a little king, looking at me with wide eyes, not knowing if he was the last of a great family or just a poor hungry child.

We all sat together under the leakiest part of the roof while it poured and thundered outside. I had been there many times before, long ago, before John built the small boat that took his family to America. John was a hardworking but careless man, and his wife was brave, cooking many meals on their old stove. She had a round, greasy face and bare chest, always hoping things would get better. She held a mop in one hand, but the place was still clean. The chickens, also hiding from the rain, walked around the room like part of the family. They looked at me or pecked my shoe like they understood.

While waiting out the storm, John told me his story. He worked hard “bogging” for a nearby farmer, digging up a meadow with a spade or hoe. He earned ten dollars an acre and could use the land with manure for one year. His little son happily worked with him, not knowing his dad had made a bad deal. I tried to help John with what I knew. I told him he was one of my closest neighbors, and that even though I came fishing and looked lazy, I earned my living like he did. I lived in a small, clean house that cost less than his old cabin’s rent. If he wanted, he could build a nice home in a month or two.

I told him I didn’t use tea, coffee, butter, milk, or fresh meat, so I didn’t have to work hard to pay for those things. Because I didn’t work hard, I didn’t have to eat hard either, and my food cost me very little. But John started his day with tea, coffee, butter, milk, and beef, so he had to work hard to buy them. After working hard, he had to eat hard to get his strength back. It was a never-ending cycle, and he was unhappy and wasting his life. Still, he thought coming to America was a gain because here you could get tea, coffee, and meat every day.
