Like the water, the Walden ice close by looks green, but from far away it is a beautiful blue. You can easily tell it apart from the white ice on the river or the slightly green ice on some ponds a quarter of a mile away.

Sometimes, one of the big blocks of ice falls off the ice-man’s sled into the village street and stays there for a week like a huge emerald, catching the attention of everyone who passes by. I have noticed that parts of Walden that look green when they are liquid water often look blue when frozen. The hollows around the pond sometimes fill with greenish water in winter, but the next day they freeze and look blue. Maybe the blue color of water and ice comes from the light and air inside them, and the clearest ice looks the bluest. Ice is really interesting to think about. They told me that at Fresh Pond, they had ice in ice-houses that was five years old and still just as good. Why does a bucket of water go bad quickly, but frozen water stays fresh forever? People say this is like the difference between feelings and thinking.

For sixteen days, I watched from my window as about a hundred men worked hard like farmers, with horses and tools, making a scene like the pictures you see in almanacs. Every time I looked out, I thought of stories like the lark and the reapers or the sower’s parable. Now they are all gone, and in about thirty days, I will look from the same window and see the clear sea-green Walden water, reflecting clouds and trees, with steam rising quietly, and no sign that people were ever there. Maybe I will hear a lone loon laughing as it dives and splashes, or see a lonely fisherman in his boat, like a floating leaf, watching his reflection in the waves where the men once worked.

It seems that people living in hot places like Charleston, New Orleans, Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta drink from my well. In the morning, I read the amazing and ancient philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta, which was written long before our time, and compared to it, today’s world and books seem small and unimportant. I think this philosophy might come from a past life because it is so far beyond what we usually understand. After reading, I go to my well for water, and there I meet the servant of the Bramin, a priest of Brahma, Vishnu, and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges River reading the Vedas, or rests under a tree with his simple food and water jug.
