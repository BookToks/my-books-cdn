I feel fresh and alive when a big freight train passes by me, and I smell all the different things being carried from Long Wharf to Lake Champlain. These smells remind me of faraway places like coral reefs, Indian oceans, and tropical lands, showing me how big the world really is.  

I feel more connected to the world when I see the palm leaves that will cover many blond heads in New England next summer. There’s Manilla hemp and coconut husks, old junk, gunny bags, scrap iron, and rusty nails. This load of torn sails tells a story better than any book could. Who can show the storms they’ve been through more clearly than these ripped sails? They are like history papers that don’t need fixing.  

Here comes lumber from the Maine woods, which didn’t wash away during the last flood. Its price went up four dollars per thousand because some wood did wash away or was cut up. There’s pine, spruce, and cedar of different qualities, all ready to cover bears, moose, and caribou.  

Next is Thomaston lime, a top-quality kind that will travel far before it’s used. These bales of rags, all different colors and qualities, are the last stage for cotton and linen clothes—the patterns that aren’t popular anymore unless maybe in Milwaukee. These old prints, ginghams, and muslins come from everywhere, rich and poor, and will be turned into paper with just a few colors. On this paper, stories of real life, both rich and poor, will be written.  

This train car smells like salt fish, a strong New England and business smell that reminds me of the Grand Banks and fishing places. Everyone has seen salt fish that’s been cured so well nothing can spoil it. You can use it to sweep or pave streets, split firewood, or the driver can use it as shelter from sun, wind, and rain. A trader once hung salt fish by his door as a sign for his business until even his oldest customer wasn’t sure if it was animal, plant, or mineral. But if you boil it, it makes a great fish dinner for Saturday.  

Last are Spanish hides, with tails still twisted like when the oxen wore them running wild across the Spanish plains. They show stubbornness and prove how some bad habits are almost impossible to change.
