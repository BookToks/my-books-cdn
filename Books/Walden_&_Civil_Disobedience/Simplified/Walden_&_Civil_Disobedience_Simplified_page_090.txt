I admit that once I really understand how a person is, I don’t expect to change them for better or worse while they’re alive. Like people from the East say, “A dog’s tail can be warmed, pressed, and tied up for twelve years, but it will still stay the same shape.” The only real way to fix tails like that is to turn them into glue, and then they will stick for sure.

Here’s a big barrel of molasses or brandy sent to John Smith in Cuttingsville, Vermont. He’s a trader in the Green Mountains who brings supplies to the farmers nearby. Right now, he’s probably standing by his warehouse thinking about the newest shipments coming to the coast and how they might change prices for him. He’s telling his customers, just like he has many times before today, that he expects some high-quality goods on the next train. This news is in the Cuttingsville Times.

While some things go up, others come down. I hear a rushing sound, look up from my book, and see a tall pine tree cut from far northern hills flying over the Green Mountains and the Connecticut River. It shoots through the town like an arrow in just ten minutes, and hardly anyone sees it. It’s “going to be the mast of some great admiral.”

Listen! Here comes the cattle train carrying animals from many hills—cows, sheep, and their pens—all moving like leaves blown by the September wind. Drovers with their sticks and shepherd boys with their flocks ride along, except for mountain pastures. The air is filled with bleating calves and sheep, and the sound of oxen moving, as if a whole farm valley is passing by.

When the old lead sheep with the bell shakes it, the mountains seem to jump like rams and the little hills like lambs. A car full of drovers rides in the middle, on the same level as their animals. Their job is done, but they still hold their sticks as a sign of their work. But where are their dogs? The dogs are confused, like in a stampede—they’ve lost the trail.

I think I hear the dogs barking behind the Peterboro’ Hills or panting up the west side of the Green Mountains. They won’t be there at the end of the chase.
