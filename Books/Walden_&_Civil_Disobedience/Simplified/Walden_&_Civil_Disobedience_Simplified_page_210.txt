Isn't this also true for mountains, which are the opposite of valleys? We know that a hill is not tallest at its thinnest part.

Out of five coves, three (or all that were measured) had a bar stretching across their openings. There was deeper water inside, so the bay was wider and deeper, making a kind of basin or pond. The two capes showed where the bar was. Every harbor by the sea also has a bar at its entrance. The wider the cove’s mouth compared to its length, the deeper the water over the bar was, compared to inside the basin. So, if you know the length and width of a cove and what the shore is like, you can almost figure out a rule for all cases.

To see how close I could guess the deepest spot in a pond by just looking at its shape and shores, I made a map of White Pond. It’s about forty-one acres and, like this one, has no island or visible stream going in or out. The widest part was near the narrowest part, where two capes came close and two bays went back. I guessed the deepest point a little away from the narrow part, but still on the longest line. The actual deepest spot was within one hundred feet of my guess, a bit further in that direction, and only one foot deeper—sixty feet.

Of course, if a stream runs through or there’s an island in the pond, it gets much harder to figure out.

If we understood all the laws of Nature, we would only need one fact or one example to figure out everything about a place. But we only know a few laws, so our answers aren’t perfect—not because Nature is confusing, but because we don’t know all the important details. We usually only notice the laws we can see, but there are many more laws working together, even if they seem to conflict. This hidden harmony is even more amazing. The laws we do know are like our points of view. Just like a mountain’s shape looks different from every step you take, it really has just one shape but endless ways to see it.
