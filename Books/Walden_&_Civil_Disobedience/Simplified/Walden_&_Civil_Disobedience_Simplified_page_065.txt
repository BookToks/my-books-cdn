This small lake was really nice to have nearby during a gentle rainstorm in August. When the air and water were completely still, and the sky was cloudy, the afternoon felt as calm as evening. The wood-thrush bird sang all around, and you could hear it from one side of the lake to the other. A lake like this is always calm at times like these. The dark clouds made the air above the lake look shallow, and the water, full of light and reflections, seemed like a little piece of heaven.

From a hill nearby, where trees had just been cut down, I had a beautiful view looking south across the pond. There was a big dip in the hills by the shore that looked like a valley with a stream flowing through it—but there was no stream. I looked between the green hills close by to some taller hills far away, which looked blue. If I stood on my tiptoes, I could even see some mountain peaks even farther away in the northwest, which looked like blue coins from the sky. I could also see part of the village. But in other directions, even from this spot, I couldn’t see past the woods around me. It’s good to have some water nearby because it helps make the earth feel lighter and more alive.

Even the smallest well is useful because when you look into it, you realize the earth isn’t just one big landmass but made up of islands. This is just as important as it being good for keeping butter cold. When I looked across the pond from the hill toward the Sudbury meadows, which during floods looked like a shining coin in a bowl, all the land beyond the pond seemed like a thin crust floating on water. It reminded me that the land I lived on was just dry ground.

Even though the view from my door was smaller, I didn’t feel cramped or stuck. There was enough space for my imagination. The low plateau with small oak trees on the other side of the pond stretched far away toward the prairies in the West and the wide grasslands of Tartary, giving plenty of room for all kinds of people. “No one is truly happy unless they can freely enjoy a big open space,” said Damodara when his animals needed more room to roam.

Both the place and time felt different, and I felt closer to the parts of the universe and history that interested me most.

The place where I lived was as far away as many places astronomers look at every night.
