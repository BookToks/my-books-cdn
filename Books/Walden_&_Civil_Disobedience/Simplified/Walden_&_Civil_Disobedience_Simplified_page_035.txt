When I was six, I passed by him and his family on the road. They carried everything they owned in one big bundle—bed, coffee grinder, mirror, and hens. The only thing missing was the cat, who ran off into the woods and became wild. Later, I found out she got caught in a trap meant for woodchucks and died.

That same morning, I took apart this little house by pulling out the nails. I moved the boards to the pondside in small loads using a cart. I spread the boards on the grass to dry and bend in the sun. As I walked through the woods, an early bird sang a few notes for me. A kid named Patrick told me secretly that our neighbor Seeley, an Irishman, was stealing the good nails and spikes while I was busy moving the boards. When I came back, Seeley acted like nothing was wrong and just stood there, looking calm and thinking about spring. He said there wasn’t much work around. He seemed more like a spectator, making this small event feel as important as the fall of Troy’s gods.

I dug a cellar into the side of a hill that sloped south. A woodchuck had dug a burrow there before. I dug through the roots of sumach and blackberry bushes and the top dirt, making a space six feet wide and seven feet deep. The bottom was sandy, which meant potatoes wouldn’t freeze in winter. I left the sides sloped and didn’t use stones because the sand stayed in place since the sun never hit it. It only took me two hours to dig. I really enjoyed breaking the ground because people everywhere dig into the earth to keep things cool. Even under the fanciest houses in the city, there are still cellars where roots are stored. Long after a house is gone, people notice the hole in the ground where it used to be. The house is like a porch at the entrance to a burrow.

Finally, in early May, some friends helped me put up the frame of my house. They helped more because it was a good chance to be friendly than because I really needed help. I was very proud of them. I hope they will help build even bigger houses someday. I started living in my house on July 4th, as soon as the walls and roof were done. The boards were carefully joined so no rain could get inside. Before putting up the boards, I built a chimney foundation at one end, carrying two cartloads of stones up the hill from the pond by myself.
