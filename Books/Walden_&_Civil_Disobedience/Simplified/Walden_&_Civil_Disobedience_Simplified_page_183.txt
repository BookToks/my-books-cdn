With an axe and shovel, you explore this mine and follow the yellow, fat-like stuff deep into the earth, like you’ve found a vein of gold. But usually, I started my fire with dry leaves from the forest that I had saved in my shed before the snow came. Green hickory wood, carefully split, makes good kindlings for a woodcutter’s camp in the woods.

Sometimes I got a little fire going. When the villagers were lighting their fires far away, I also sent a smoky signal from my chimney to let the wild animals in Walden valley know I was awake. The smoke, like a light bird flying up, was like a message to the gods to forgive my clear flame.

Fresh green wood, even though I didn’t use much, worked better than anything else. Sometimes I left a good fire burning when I went for a walk on a winter afternoon, and when I came back hours later, it was still glowing. My house wasn’t empty when I was gone. It felt like I had left a friendly helper behind—me and the fire lived there, and the fire usually took good care of the house. One time, while splitting wood, I looked out the window to check if the house was on fire because I was worried. I saw a spark had caught my bed, but I put it out before it did much damage. My house was in a sunny, safe spot with a low roof, so I could let the fire go out during the day in winter without worry.

Moles lived in my cellar, eating some of my potatoes and making a cozy bed with hair left from plastering and brown paper. Even wild animals want comfort and warmth like people do, and they survive winter because they work hard to stay warm.

Some friends thought I was going into the woods just to freeze. Animals make a warm bed by themselves in a safe place. But people found fire and built warm rooms to live in, so they don’t have to freeze. They can wear less heavy clothes, have light through windows, and use lamps to make the day last longer even in winter.
