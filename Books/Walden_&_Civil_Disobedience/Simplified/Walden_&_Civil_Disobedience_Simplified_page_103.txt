Morning air! If people won’t breathe this fresh air at the start of the day, then we might have to bottle it and sell it in stores for those who miss out on the morning.

But remember, it won’t stay fresh until noon, even in a cool place. The freshness will disappear long before then, following the sun as it moves west.

I don’t admire Hygeia, who was the daughter of an old doctor named Æsculapius and is shown holding a snake and a cup. Instead, I like Hebe, the cupbearer to Jupiter. She was the daughter of Juno and wild lettuce and could make gods and people feel young again.

Hebe was probably the healthiest and strongest young woman ever, and wherever she went, it felt like spring.
