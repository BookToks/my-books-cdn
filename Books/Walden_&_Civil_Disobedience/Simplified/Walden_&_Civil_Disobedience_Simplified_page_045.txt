Most of the stone a country uses is for building tombs. It’s like the country is trapping itself inside. About the Pyramids, the surprising thing isn’t how big they are but how many people wasted their lives building a tomb for some selfish leader. It would have been better to get rid of that leader quickly and forget about him. I might try to find a reason for them and him, but I don’t have time. The builders’ religion and love for art are pretty much the same everywhere, whether it’s an Egyptian temple or a bank in the United States. They always cost more than they’re worth. The main reason people do it is because of pride, mixed with basic needs like food. A young architect named Mr. Balcom designs the building carefully, and then a company called Dobson & Sons cuts the stone.

After 3,000 years, people start to look up to these big buildings. About your tall towers and monuments, there was once a crazy guy in this town who tried to dig all the way to China. He said he even heard Chinese pots and pans, but I don’t think that hole is worth admiring. Lots of people care about who built the monuments in the East and West. But I wonder who didn’t build them — who thought it was beneath them. Now, let’s get back to my numbers.

Meanwhile, I worked as a surveyor, carpenter, and did other jobs in the village because I can do many things. I earned $13.34. The cost of food for eight months, from July 4th to March 1st, was listed here. I lived there for over two years but didn’t count potatoes, some corn, and peas I grew, or the food I still had. Here are some prices: Rice cost $1.73, molasses $1.73, rye meal $1.04, Indian meal $0.99, pork $0.22, flour $0.88, sugar $0.80, and lard was also listed. Flour was more expensive and harder to use than Indian meal.
