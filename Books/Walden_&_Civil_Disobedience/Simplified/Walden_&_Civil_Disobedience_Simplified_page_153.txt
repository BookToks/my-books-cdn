Because people don’t take risks or believe in themselves, they end up stuck where they are, just buying and selling things and living their lives like slaves.

Oh, Baker Farm!

The land there is simple and peaceful, with just a little sunshine making it special. No one rushes to have fun in your fenced-in fields. You don’t argue with anyone, and you’re never confused by questions. You look calm and steady, like you did the first time I saw you, dressed in plain brown clothes.

Come here, whether you love or hate, whether you’re good or bad. Bring your secrets and plans and hang them from the strong tree branches! People only go home at night from nearby places, where their memories keep them stuck, and their lives feel boring because they just repeat the same things every day. We should come home every day from adventures and new experiences, feeling stronger and different.

Before I got to the pond, something made John Field come out with a new attitude, stopping his usual fishing in the mud before sunset. But he only disturbed a few fish while I caught a good number, and he said it was just bad luck. When we switched spots in the boat, luck switched too. Poor John Field! I hope he doesn’t read this unless it helps him improve. He’s trying to live by old ways from his country in this new place, trying to catch perch with small baitfish. Sometimes that works.

He has his own way of seeing things, but he’s poor, born to be poor, with his family’s old Irish poverty and swampy habits. He and his family won’t get ahead until their swampy, webbed feet get wings to help them fly.
