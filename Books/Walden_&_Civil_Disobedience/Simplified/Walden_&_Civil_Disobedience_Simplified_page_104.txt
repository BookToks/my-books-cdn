I think I like being around people as much as anyone, and I’m happy to stick close to any strong, interesting person I meet. I’m not the kind of person who likes to be alone all the time, but I could probably sit in a busy bar for a long time if I had to.

In my house, I had three chairs: one for being alone, two for friends, and three for a group. When more people showed up than expected, they all had to share the third chair, or they just stood up. It’s amazing how many important people can fit into a small house. I’ve had 25 or 30 people at once in my home, and sometimes we didn’t even realize how close we had become. Many big houses, with their huge rooms and fancy wine cellars, seem way too big for the people who live in them. The houses are so huge that the people inside almost look like tiny bugs. I’m surprised when a messenger calls for someone at a big fancy house and only a tiny mouse-like person comes out and quickly hides again.

One problem with a small house is that it’s hard to get enough space from a guest when we start talking about big ideas using big words. You need room for your thoughts to get ready and move smoothly before you share them.

Your ideas need to stop bouncing around and go straight to the other person’s ear, or else they might miss the point. Also, sentences need space to open up and make sense as you speak.

People, like countries, need enough space between them, even a neutral zone, to feel comfortable. I’ve found it really nice to talk to a friend sitting across a small pond.
