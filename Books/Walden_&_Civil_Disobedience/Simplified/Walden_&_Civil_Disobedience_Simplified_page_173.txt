In October, I went to the river meadows to pick grapes. I gathered a lot, not because they were good to eat, but because they looked and smelled nice.

There, I also saw cranberries. They were small, shiny, and red, hanging from the grass. I didn’t pick them because the farmer used a big rake to collect them, which messed up the meadow. He only cared about how many he could get and how much money he could make. He sold the cranberries to big cities like Boston and New York, where people would make jam from them.

I also looked at the bright red barberries but didn’t pick them. Instead, I found some wild apples that people had missed, and I saved them to cook later. When chestnuts were ready, I collected half a bushel to keep for winter. It was fun to walk through the huge chestnut forests in Lincoln back then. Now, those woods are gone because of the railroad. I carried a bag and a stick to open the chestnut shells, and I didn’t always wait for the frost to come. While I was there, I heard squirrels and jays making noise. Sometimes, I even took nuts they had already started eating because those nuts were usually good.

Sometimes, I climbed trees and shook them to get more chestnuts. There were also chestnut trees behind my house, and one big tree almost covered the house with its branches. When it bloomed, it smelled great and filled the whole neighborhood with its scent. But squirrels and jays ate most of the nuts. The jays came in groups early in the morning and got the nuts before they fell. I let those animals have those trees and went to the bigger woods with just chestnut trees instead. Chestnuts were a good replacement for bread when I needed food.

There might be other foods like this too. One day, while digging for fishworms, I found a ground-nut (Apios tuberosa), which grows on a string. It’s like a potato that Native Americans used to eat. I wasn’t sure if I had really eaten it as a kid or if I had just dreamed about it.
