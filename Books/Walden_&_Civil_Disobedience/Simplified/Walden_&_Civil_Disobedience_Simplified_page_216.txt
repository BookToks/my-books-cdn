I meet his servant who comes to get water for his master, and our buckets seem to scrape together in the same well. The clean water from Walden mixes with the holy water of the Ganges.

With helpful winds, the water floats past the legendary islands of Atlantis and the Hesperides. It travels along the route of Hanno, passes by Ternate and Tidore, and goes near the mouth of the Persian Gulf.

The water moves through the warm winds of the Indian seas and reaches places where even Alexander the Great only knew the names.
