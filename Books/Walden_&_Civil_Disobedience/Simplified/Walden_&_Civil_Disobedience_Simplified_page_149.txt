One time, I stood right under a rainbow’s arch, which was low in the sky. It made the grass and leaves around me glow with color, and it felt like I was looking through a colored glass. It was like being in a lake full of rainbow light, and for a little while, I felt free like a dolphin. If it had lasted longer, it might have changed how I live my life.  

As I walked on the railroad path, I noticed a halo of light around my shadow and liked to think I was special. Someone visiting me said that the shadows of some Irishmen he saw didn’t have halos, and that only people from around here had them.  

Benvenuto Cellini wrote in his memoirs that after a scary dream he had while locked up in a castle, a bright light appeared over his shadow every morning and evening, whether he was in Italy or France. It was especially clear when the grass was wet with dew. This was probably the same thing I saw, which usually shows up in the morning but can also happen at other times, even at night. Even though it happens often, most people don’t notice it. For someone with a wild imagination like Cellini, it was enough to believe in something mysterious. He also said he only showed it to a few people. But maybe those who notice they are being watched are the truly special ones.  

One afternoon, I went fishing at Fair-Haven through the woods to add to my small supply of vegetables. My path took me through Pleasant Meadow, part of the Baker Farm, a place a poet once wrote about:  

“Your entrance is a nice field,  
With some mossy fruit trees,  
Next to a red brook,  
Where muskrats swim,  
And quick trout dart around.”  

I thought about living there before I moved to Walden. I picked some apples, jumped over the brook, and scared the muskrats and trout. The afternoon felt very long, like many things could happen, even though I had already spent half the day. Then it started to rain, so I stood under a pine tree for half an hour, covering my head with branches and using my handkerchief like a roof. When I finally made one fishing cast standing waist-deep in water near the pickerel-weed, a cloud shadowed me, and the thunder rumbled so loud I could only stop and listen.
