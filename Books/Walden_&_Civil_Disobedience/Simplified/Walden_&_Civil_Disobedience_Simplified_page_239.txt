What are the guys celebrating? They’re all part of a planning group, waiting for someone to give a speech. God is just the main leader for the day, and Webster is the one giving the big talk. I like to think carefully and choose what really attracts me; not to try to cheat or imagine things, but to face the real situation. I want to follow the only path that no one can stop me on. It doesn’t make me happy to start building something before I have a strong base. Let’s not fool around. There’s a solid ground everywhere. 

There’s a story about a traveler who asked a boy if the swamp ahead had a hard bottom. The boy said yes. But soon the traveler’s horse sank deep into the swamp, and he said, “I thought you said this bog had a hard bottom.” The boy answered, “It does, but you haven’t reached it yet.” That’s how society’s problems are too; only someone experienced knows that. Only what is thought, said, or done at the right moment is good. I don’t want to be someone who blindly drives a nail into weak wood; that would bother me all night. Give me a hammer, and I’ll find the strong wood underneath. Don’t rely on weak stuff. Drive the nail in deep and make sure it’s solid so you can be proud of your work anytime. That’s how you help make the world work better.

More than love, money, or fame, I want the truth. I once sat at a table full of fancy food and wine, with people acting very polite, but no one was honest or sincere; I left feeling empty. The hospitality was as cold as ice. I thought they didn’t even need ice to be cold. They talked about the age and fame of their wine, but I thought of a better, purer kind of wine they didn’t have and couldn’t buy. Fancy style, big houses, and entertainment don’t impress me. I once visited a king, but he made me wait and acted like he didn’t know how to be a good host. There was even a man nearby who lived in a hollow tree.
