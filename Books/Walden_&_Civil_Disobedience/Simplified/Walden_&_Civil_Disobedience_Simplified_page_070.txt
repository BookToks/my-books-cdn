“Tell me if anything new has happened to anyone anywhere in the world,”—and he reads it while having his coffee and rolls, that a man had his eyes gouged out this morning on the Wachito River; not realizing that he himself lives in the deep, dark cave of the world, and only has a tiny bit of an eye.

For me, I could easily live without the post office. I think very few important messages come through it. Honestly, I’ve only ever gotten one or two letters in my whole life that were worth the postage. The penny-post is usually just a way of paying someone a penny for their thoughts, which is often a joke. And I’m sure I’ve never read any unforgettable news in a newspaper.

If we hear about one man being robbed, killed by accident, one house burning down, one boat wrecked, one steamboat blowing up, one cow run over on the Western Railroad, one mad dog killed, or one group of grasshoppers in winter—then we don’t need to hear about any more. One story like that is enough. If you understand the idea, why do you want to hear a million examples? To a deep thinker, all news is just gossip, and those who edit and read it are like old ladies chatting over tea. Still, many people love this gossip.

I heard that recently, so many people rushed to one office to hear the latest foreign news that they broke several large windows from the crowd’s pressure—news that, honestly, someone clever could have written a year or even twelve years earlier with enough accuracy. For example, if you know how to mix in Don Carlos and the Infanta, Don Pedro and Seville and Granada from time to time—and add a bullfight when nothing else is interesting—you’d have a story that’s exactly like the newspaper reports about Spain. And for England, the last big news was the revolution of 1649; if you know how their crops usually do each year, you don’t need to follow that news anymore unless you just want to make money from it. From what I can tell, and I hardly ever read newspapers, nothing new really ever happens in other countries—not even a French revolution.
