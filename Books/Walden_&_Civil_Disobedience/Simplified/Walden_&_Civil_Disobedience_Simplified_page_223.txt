It's amazing how quickly and perfectly sand shapes itself as it moves, using the best parts it has to make sharp edges in its path. This is how rivers start. In the sandy stuff that water leaves behind, you can imagine the bones, and in the finer soil and organic bits, the soft parts like muscles or cells. What is a person but a lump of melting clay? The round tip of a finger is like a frozen drop. Fingers and toes grow out from the melting body mass.

Who knows how much the human body would stretch and spread out in a warmer place? Isn’t a hand like a big palm leaf with its parts and veins? The ear can be seen, if you imagine, as a kind of plant growing on the side of the head, with its lobe like a drop. The lip—called labium, maybe from the word "labor"—hangs or falls from the sides of the mouth. The nose looks like a frozen drop or a stalactite. The chin is a bigger drop, like dripping on the face. The cheeks slide down from the brows into the face’s valley, pushed and spread by the cheekbones. Each rounded part of a leaf is like a thick, slow-moving drop, bigger or smaller; the lobes are like the leaf’s fingers, and the more heat or warmth, the more they would spread out.

So, this one hill seemed to show how all of Nature works. The Maker of the earth just made a leaf pattern. Who will figure out this natural code for us so we can "turn over a new leaf"? This idea is more exciting to me than vineyards full of grapes. Yes, it’s a bit messy and there are piles of liver and guts, like the world is turned inside out; but this shows Nature has insides, and there is the source of humanity. This is frost coming out of the ground; this is Spring. It comes before the green and flowery spring, just like myths come before real poetry. I know nothing better to clear out winter’s cold and tired feelings. It shows me Earth is still a baby, stretching out tiny fingers everywhere. New curls grow from the baldest head. Nothing is lifeless.

These leaf-like piles lie along the bank like furnace leftovers, showing that Nature is working hard inside. The earth isn’t just a piece of dead history, with layers like pages in a book studied by scientists and historians, but living poetry like the leaves of a tree that come before flowers and fruit. It’s not a fossil earth but a living earth; compared to its huge central life, all animal and plant life is just a small part living on it.
