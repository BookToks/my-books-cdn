I am okay with leaving decisions to the majority. So, your responsibility shouldn’t go beyond what is practical. Even voting for what’s right doesn’t actually fix anything. It just shows people weakly that you want the right thing to happen. A smart person won’t leave what’s right up to chance or rely on the majority to make it happen. Most people don’t have much real goodness in their actions. When the majority finally votes to end slavery, it will be because they don’t care about slavery or because there isn’t much slavery left to end. Then, those people will be the only slaves. Only someone who stands up for their own freedom by voting can speed up the end of slavery.

I hear there’s a meeting planned in Baltimore or somewhere else to pick a presidential candidate, mostly made up of editors and professional politicians. But I wonder, why should any smart, independent, and respectable person care about what they decide? Can’t we rely on some independent votes? Aren’t there many people who don’t go to these meetings? But no, I see that so-called respectable people quickly give up on their beliefs and lose hope for the country, even though the country has more reason to lose hope in them. They immediately support one of the chosen candidates as the only option, showing they can be used by any politician. Their vote is no more valuable than that of a dishonest outsider or a paid local. Oh, for a real man—like my neighbor says, someone with a backbone you can’t push around! Our population numbers are wrong: there aren’t many men living in each big area. Hardly one. Doesn’t America offer a good reason for men to live here? The American has become like a member of a club who is friendly but not smart or confident; whose main worry from birth is making sure there are places to get help when needed; and, before he’s even a grown man, he’s busy collecting money to support widows and orphans. In short, he tries to live only by relying on insurance that promises to bury him properly.

It’s not always a person’s job to fight against every big wrong; they can have other things to focus on. But at least, it’s their duty to stop supporting the wrong, and if they stop thinking about it, they shouldn’t help it in any way.
