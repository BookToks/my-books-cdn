Maybe Nature will give it a try again, with me as the first person to live here, and my house, built last spring, will be the oldest in the little village.

I don’t think anyone has ever built a home where I am now.

I want to be far away from cities built on top of old cities, made from broken ruins, with gardens that are actually cemeteries. The ground there feels dead and cursed, and before it gets worse, the earth itself might be destroyed. Thinking about this, I filled the woods with new life and fell asleep peacefully.

At this time of year, I rarely had visitors. When the snow was deepest, no one came near my house for one or two weeks at a time. But I lived there as cozy as a little mouse in a field, or like cows and chickens that can survive buried in snow for a long time without food. It’s like that old story about a family in Sutton whose house was covered by the huge snowstorm of 1717 while they were away. An Indian found the house only because the chimney smoke made a hole in the snow and saved them. But no friendly Indian came to check on me, and I didn’t need one because I was home. The Great Snow! It’s nice to hear about it! When farmers couldn’t get to the woods with their horses and carts, they had to cut down the shade trees in front of their houses. The next spring, the snow had frozen so hard that trees in the swamps looked cut off about ten feet above the ground.

During the heaviest snow, the path I took from the main road to my house, about half a mile, looked like a dotted line with big spaces in between the dots. For a week straight, I took the exact same number of steps, all the same length, going back and forth, stepping carefully in my own deep footprints—winter makes you very routine. But often, the sky was bright blue above me. The weather never stopped me from going outside. I often walked eight or ten miles through deep snow just to visit a beech tree, a yellow birch, or an old pine tree friend. The ice and snow made the pine trees’ branches droop, turning them into what looked like fir trees. I climbed to the top of the highest hills when the snow was almost two feet deep on flat ground, shaking off fresh snow with every step. Sometimes I even crawled there on my hands and knees when the hunters had gone into their winter homes.
