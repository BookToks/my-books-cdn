I noticed that the important places in the village were the grocery store, the bar, the post office, and the bank. They also had a bell, a big gun, and a fire engine placed around in easy-to-reach spots. The houses were set up in lanes facing each other so that every traveler had to pass through and everyone—men, women, and kids—could get a chance to see or talk to them.  

The people who lived closest to the start of the line, where they could see the traveler first and get the first chance to talk, paid the most for their spots. The few people living on the edges, where the traveler could sneak past by climbing walls or taking side paths, paid very little rent or taxes. Signs were everywhere trying to attract the traveler: some to make them hungry, like the tavern and food cellar; some to catch their interest, like the clothing and jewelry stores; and others to get their attention by offering haircuts, shoes, or clothes.  

There was also a stronger reason to visit every house because people expected company around this time. Most of the time, I avoided these dangers by moving quickly and confidently toward my goal, like someone running through a risky path without stopping. Or I kept my mind busy with big ideas, like Orpheus, who sang loudly to block out the dangerous Sirens. Sometimes I ran off suddenly, surprising everyone because I didn’t care about looking graceful and didn’t hesitate to jump fences. I even barged into some houses, where I was welcomed, learned all the latest news about what was happening in the world, and then slipped out through the back way to escape to the woods again.  

It was really nice to stay in town late and then head out into the night, especially if it was dark and stormy. I would leave from a bright village room, carrying a bag of rye or cornmeal on my shoulder, heading back to my safe spot in the woods. I’d make sure everything was secure outside and then relax inside with happy thoughts, only my body guiding me, or sometimes even just letting things go smoothly on their own. I had many good thoughts by the fire as I made my way home.
