The open and calm eyes of the bird look both grown-up and innocent, which makes them easy to remember. They seem very smart. These eyes don’t just show the innocence of a baby bird, but also a kind of wisdom gained from experience. This kind of eye wasn’t made when the bird was born, but grew along with the sky it reflects.

The forest doesn’t have another treasure like this. Travelers don’t often get to see such clear, peaceful eyes. Sometimes careless hunters shoot the mother bird at this time, leaving the baby birds to be caught by wild animals or to slowly disappear among the dead leaves, which they look like. People say that if these baby birds are raised by a hen, they get scared easily and run off because they don’t hear their real mother’s call to come back. These were my hens and chicks.

It’s amazing how many wild animals live secretly in the woods near towns, hiding from hunters. The otter, for example, lives quietly here and can grow as long as a small kid, but hardly anyone ever sees it. I once saw a raccoon in the woods behind my house and sometimes heard them making noises at night. Usually, I would rest for a bit in the shade after working in the field, eating lunch and reading by a spring. This spring was the start of a swamp and a small stream, coming out from under Brister’s Hill, just half a mile from my field.

To get there, I walked down grassy dips full of young pine trees into a bigger forest near the swamp. There, under a big white-pine tree, was a nice, clean spot with soft grass to sit on. I had dug out the spring and made a well of clear gray water, where I could scoop up water without making it dirty. I went there almost every day in the middle of summer when the pond was warm.

The woodcock bird would come there with her babies, looking for worms in the mud. She would fly just a foot above them while they ran below. If she saw me, she would leave her babies and fly around me, pretending to be hurt to get my attention and lead me away, so her little ones could walk safely through the swamp, following her quietly. Sometimes I could hear the babies’ faint peeps even if I couldn’t see the mother.

Turtle doves also sat near the spring or flew softly between the pine trees above me. A red squirrel running down a nearby branch was especially friendly and curious.
