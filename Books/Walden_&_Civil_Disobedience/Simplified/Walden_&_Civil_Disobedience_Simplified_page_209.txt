If we compare Loch Fyne’s shortest width to Walden Pond, which already looks really shallow from the side, Walden would seem four times shallower. So, when Loch Fyne is empty, it’s not as scary as you might think. Many peaceful valleys with fields might actually be old “scary holes” where water once was, but only geologists really understand this. Sometimes you can spot old lake shores in faraway hills, and you don’t need the land to rise up to hide their story. It’s easiest to find these dips by looking at puddles after it rains. Imagination often makes things seem deeper or taller than they really are. So, probably, the ocean’s depth is small compared to how wide it is.

When I measured the pond’s bottom through the ice, I could tell its shape more clearly than when measuring places that don’t freeze. I was surprised how smooth it was. In the deepest spot, there were several acres as flat as fields that get sun, wind, and plowing. At one spot I picked, the depth only changed by one foot over 30 rods (about 495 feet). Usually, near the middle, I could guess how much the depth changed every 100 feet within just a few inches. Some people talk about deep, dangerous holes even in calm, sandy ponds like this, but water actually smooths out bumps. The bottom’s shape matched perfectly with the shore and nearby hills. A far-away point of land could be found just by listening to the sounds across the pond. Cliffs turn into sandbars, plains turn into shallow spots, and valleys and gorges turn into deep water and channels.

After I made a detailed map of the pond, marking over a hundred depth points, I noticed something cool. The deepest spot seemed to be in the middle of the map. When I measured the pond’s longest length and widest width, those two lines crossed exactly at the deepest point. That was surprising because the middle was almost flat, the pond’s shape wasn’t regular, and the longest and widest parts were measured by stretching into coves. I thought to myself, maybe this idea could help find the deepest part of the ocean too, not just a pond or puddle.
