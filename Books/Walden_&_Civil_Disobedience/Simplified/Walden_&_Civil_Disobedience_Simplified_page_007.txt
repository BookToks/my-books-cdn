I want to say something, not so much about the Chinese and Sandwich Islanders, but about you who live in New England. I want to talk about your situation, especially how things look on the outside—your life in this town. Is it really necessary for your life to be as hard as it is? Can’t it be better or easier?

I have traveled a lot around Concord, and everywhere I go—in shops, offices, and fields—people seem to be suffering in many strange ways. I’ve heard of Brahmins doing painful and strange punishments, like sitting with fires around them, hanging upside down over flames, or looking backward at the sky until they can’t move their necks right. Some are chained to trees for life, measure land with their bodies like caterpillars, or stand on one leg on pillars. Even these amazing punishments don’t seem crazier than what I see every day.

The twelve labors of Hercules were easy compared to what my neighbors go through. Hercules only had to do twelve tasks, and they ended. But my neighbors don’t finish anything—they don’t defeat monsters or complete their work. They don’t have a friend like Iolas to help them burn the roots of problems. When one problem is solved, two more appear.

I see young men in my town who are unlucky to have inherited farms, houses, barns, cows, and tools. It’s easier to get these things than to get rid of them. It might have been better if they were born in the wild and raised by wolves, so they could see more clearly what kind of work they should do. Who made them slaves of the land? Why should they be stuck with sixty acres when most people only have to worry about a little bit of dirt? Why do they have to start digging their own graves as soon as they’re born? They have to live a full life, pushing all these things in front of them and do their best. I have met many poor souls crushed by their heavy burdens, struggling down the road of life, pushing a huge barn and a hundred acres of land that never gets cleaned up. 

Those who don’t have these hard inheritances still find it tough enough to take care of their own bodies and lives.
