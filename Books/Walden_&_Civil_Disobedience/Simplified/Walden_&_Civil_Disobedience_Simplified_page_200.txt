Finally, the jays showed up. You could hear their loud, annoying screams from far away before they even got close. They quietly moved from tree to tree, getting closer bit by bit, and grabbed the seeds that the squirrels had dropped. Then, sitting on a pine branch, they tried to swallow a seed that was too big and got stuck. After struggling, they spit it out and spent an hour trying to crack it open by hitting it with their beaks. They were clearly stealing, and I didn’t think much of them. But the squirrels, even though they were shy at first, acted like they were just taking what belonged to them.

At the same time, groups of chickadees arrived. They picked up crumbs the squirrels had dropped and flew to a nearby twig. They held the crumbs under their claws and pecked at them with their tiny beaks, like they were bugs, until the crumbs were small enough to swallow. A small group of these birds came every day to get food from my woodpile or the crumbs near my door. Their soft, quick calls sounded like ice tinkling on the grass or cheerful “day day day” sounds. In spring, they sometimes made a sharp “phe-be” sound from the woods. They got so used to me that one even landed on the wood I was carrying and pecked at it without being scared. Once, a sparrow even landed on my shoulder while I was working in a garden, and I felt more special because of that than if I had worn a fancy badge.

The squirrels also got used to me after a while and sometimes even stepped on my shoe if it was the easiest way to get somewhere.

When the ground wasn’t fully covered with snow, and again near the end of winter when the snow melted on my sunny hill and near my woodpile, partridges came out of the woods in the mornings and evenings to eat. Wherever you walked in the woods, the partridge would suddenly fly up with loud wing sounds, shaking snow off dry leaves and twigs, which fell like golden dust in the sunlight. This brave bird isn’t scared of winter. Sometimes it gets covered by snowdrifts and even dives into the soft snow, staying hidden for a day or two.
