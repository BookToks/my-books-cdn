Even though it was still cold January, with lots of thick snow and ice, the careful landlord came from the village to get ice to cool his summer drinks. It was kind of smart, and a little funny, to think about the hot July and thirst in the middle of winter—while wearing a thick coat and mittens! Many things weren’t ready yet. Maybe he didn’t save anything for the next world to cool his drink. He cut and sawed the solid ice on the pond, broke the house where the fish lived, and carried away the ice, which was like their home and air, tied up with chains and sticks like stacked wood. They moved it through the cold winter air to cellars underground, to keep cool for summer. The ice looked like frozen blue sky as it was pulled through the streets. The ice-cutters were a happy bunch, joking and having fun, and when I joined them, they even invited me to saw with them while I stood below.

In the winter of 1846–7, about a hundred men from very cold places suddenly came to our pond one morning. They brought many loads of strange farming tools, sleds, ploughs, seed planters, turf-knives, spades, saws, and rakes. Each man also had a special double-pointed stick, something you wouldn’t find in regular New England farm books.

I wasn’t sure if they came to plant winter rye or some new grain from Iceland. Since I didn’t see any manure, I thought they planned to scrape the land, like I had done, thinking the soil was deep and had rested long enough. They said a rich farmer, working behind the scenes, wanted to double his money, which was already about half a million dollars. To do that, he took off the only “coat,” even the skin, of Walden Pond in the middle of a hard winter. They started working right away, ploughing, smoothing, rolling, and making rows, all very organized, like they wanted to make a perfect farm. But when I looked closely to see what seeds they were planting, some guys near me suddenly started pulling up the untouched soil itself, with a quick jerk, right down to the sand or water beneath—it was soft soil, really just all the solid ground there was—and hauling it away on sleds. Then I realized they were cutting peat in a bog.

They came and went every day, with a strange whistle from the train, going to and from what felt like the Arctic, like a flock of snowy birds. But sometimes Walden Pond fought back. A hired man walking behind his team fell through a crack in the ground into what felt like the underworld. He, who was so brave before, suddenly felt tiny and almost lost all his body heat. He was happy to hide in my house and admitted there was something good about having a stove. Sometimes the frozen ground even broke a steel piece from a plough, or a plough got stuck in a furrow and had to be cut free.
