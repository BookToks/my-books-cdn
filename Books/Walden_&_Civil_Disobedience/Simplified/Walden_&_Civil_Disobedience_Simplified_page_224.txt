The earth moves and shakes, making old things buried underground come out again. You can melt metals and shape them into beautiful objects, but they will never excite me as much as the shapes this flowing, hot earth creates. Not only the earth itself, but also the things on it, can change easily, like soft clay in a potter’s hands.

Soon, frost will come up from the ground everywhere—on hills, fields, and in low places—like an animal waking up from sleep. It will move toward the sea with music or fly away in clouds to warmer places. The gentle thawing is stronger than Thor’s hammer because it melts things instead of just breaking them.

When the snow started to melt and the ground dried a bit on warm days, it was nice to see the first small signs of new life. They appeared next to the old, dried plants that survived winter—plants like golden-rods, grasses, and cotton-grass. These plants, though often called weeds, look interesting and beautiful, sometimes even more than in summer. They also feed the earliest birds in spring. I especially like the top of wool-grass because it reminds me of summer during winter. Its shape is something art loves to copy and is very old, older than Greek or Egyptian styles. Many things about winter feel gentle and delicate. We usually think of winter as harsh and rough, but it also decorates summer with kindness.

As spring came, two red squirrels came under my house, right below where I was sitting and reading or writing. They made the funniest sounds—chuckling, chirping, and gurgling—and moved around like they were dancing. When I stomped my foot, they just chirped louder, acting fearless and daring me to stop their wild games.
