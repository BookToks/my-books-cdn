I didn’t want to live a life that wasn’t really living, because life is so precious. I also didn’t want to just accept things without trying, unless I really had to. I wanted to live fully and enjoy every bit of life, to be strong and tough, and to get rid of anything that wasn’t real living. I wanted to experience life deeply, and if life turned out to be bad, I wanted to understand it completely and share that with others. But if life was amazing, I wanted to know that too and be able to tell people about it. 

Most people seem confused about what life really is, whether it’s good or bad, and they quickly decide that our main goal is to “glorify God and enjoy him forever.” But still, we live small, boring lives, like ants, even though stories say we used to be more than that. We fight pointless battles and keep making mistakes, and even our best actions come from unnecessary suffering. We waste our lives on tiny details.

A good person doesn’t need to worry about a lot of things. It’s better to keep life simple—really simple! Let your problems be just a few, not hundreds or thousands. Instead of counting millions, just count a few things and keep your life easy to handle. Life today is so complicated, with so many problems and distractions, that to survive you have to be a great planner or you’ll fail.

Simplify, simplify. If you can, eat one meal a day instead of three; have five dishes instead of a hundred; and cut back on other things too. Our life is messy and divided like a bunch of small, confused states that even the people living there don’t fully understand. The country, with all its improvements that are really just surface-level, is too big and full of clutter, spoiled by luxury and carelessness. The only way to fix this, for the country and for each person, is to live simply, with strict control over spending and a clear purpose. Life is going way too fast.

People think it’s super important for the country to have business, export things like ice, send messages quickly, and travel fast. But whether we should live like wild animals or like real humans is still a question.
