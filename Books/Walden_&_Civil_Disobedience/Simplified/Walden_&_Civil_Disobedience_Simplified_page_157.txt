I think I’m not wrong. It’s a small feeling, like the first light of morning. I have a natural instinct like animals do, but every year I feel less like a fisherman. I’m not more kind or smart, just less interested in fishing. Right now, I’m not a fisherman at all. But if I lived in the wild, I might want to fish and hunt again. Also, eating meat and fish feels dirty to me. I’ve started to understand why people spend so much effort keeping their homes clean and looking nice. I’ve done all the work myself—catching, cleaning, cooking, and eating—and I know what it’s like from start to finish.

The main problem for me with eating animals is that it feels unclean. Plus, after I caught and cooked fish, it didn’t really make me feel full or strong. It didn’t seem worth all the work and mess. A little bread or some potatoes would have been easier and just as good. Like many people my age, I haven’t eaten much meat, tea, or coffee for years—not because they made me feel bad, but because I just didn’t like the idea of them. Not liking meat isn’t from experience; it’s something I just feel inside. Living simply and eating little seemed better to me. I never lived like that fully, but I liked the idea. I believe anyone serious about keeping their mind and creativity sharp tends to avoid eating meat and eating too much in general.

It’s interesting that some scientists say certain insects, like butterflies and flies, don’t really eat much at all as adults, even though they have mouths. The caterpillar eats a lot, but the butterfly only drinks a little sweet liquid. Their big bodies come from when they were larvae. People who eat a lot and don’t use their imagination much are like those larvae—they live in a kind of early stage. Some whole nations act this way, showing they don’t use their creativity or imagination much.
