But history shouldn’t tell all the sad stories that happened here just yet; let some time pass to make them seem less painful and maybe even a little hopeful. Long ago, there was said to be a tavern here, though no one is completely sure. The same well was used to cool travelers’ drinks and give water to their horses. People greeted each other here, shared news, and then went on their way.

Breed’s hut was still standing about twelve years ago, even though no one lived in it anymore. It was about the size of my house. Some mischievous boys set it on fire one Election night, if I remember right. Back then, I lived near the edge of the village and was really tired from trying to read a tough book called Gondibert by Davenant. I wasn’t sure if my tiredness was because of my family—my uncle falls asleep while shaving and has to grow potatoes in a cellar on Sundays to stay awake—or because I tried to read a big collection of English poetry without skipping pages. It really tired me out.

Just as I was about to rest my head, the fire bells rang. We quickly jumped up and ran toward the fire trucks, with me near the front since I could jump over the brook easily. We thought the fire was far away, maybe in someone’s barn or house. “It’s Baker’s barn,” one person said. “No, it’s the Codman place,” another replied. Then sparks flew up from the woods like the roof was falling in, and we all cheered, “Concord to the rescue!” Wagons rushed by fast, loaded with supplies, maybe even the Insurance Company agent who had to get there no matter what. The fire engine’s bell rang behind us, slower but steady. At the very end, some whispered that the fire starters were coming too, having set the fire and then called for help.

We acted like hopeful heroes, refusing to believe what we saw. But when we turned a corner, we heard the fire crackling and even felt the heat over the wall. That’s when we realized the fire was right there. Being so close cooled our excitement. At first, we thought about throwing a frog-pond’s water on the fire, but then decided to just let it burn since it was already too bad and not worth saving. So, we stood around the engine, bumped into each other, shouted through megaphones, or quietly talked about big fires we’d heard of before, like the one at Bascom’s shop. Secretly, we thought that if we had gotten there sooner with our “tub” and a full frog-pond, we could have stopped this fire from becoming a total disaster.
