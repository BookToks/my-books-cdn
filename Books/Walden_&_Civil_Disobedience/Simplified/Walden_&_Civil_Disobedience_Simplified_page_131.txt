So, I basically caught two fish with one hook.

Walden’s scenery is pretty simple and not super grand, but it’s really beautiful. If you haven’t spent a lot of time there or lived nearby, it might not seem that special. Still, this pond is really cool because it’s very deep and clear, so it deserves a detailed description.

It’s a clear, deep green pond, about half a mile long and nearly two miles around. It covers around sixty-one and a half acres. It’s fed by a spring in the middle of pine and oak trees, and there’s no visible way water comes in or goes out except through rain and evaporation. The hills around the pond rise quickly, from 40 to 80 feet high, and on the southeast and east sides, they reach 100 to 150 feet within a short distance. The hills are all covered with forest.

All the waters around Concord show at least two colors: one color when you look from far away, and another when you look up close. The faraway color depends a lot on the light and sky. On clear summer days, the water looks blue from a distance, especially if it’s a bit windy, and at a really far distance, all water looks pretty much the same. On stormy days, the water can look dark gray. The sea can change from blue to green even if the weather doesn’t change much.

I’ve seen our river when the land was covered in snow, and the water and ice looked almost as green as grass. Some people say blue is the color of pure water, whether it’s liquid or frozen. But if you look straight down into the water from a boat, you’ll see many different colors. Walden can look blue at one time and green at another, even if you’re in the same spot.

Because it’s between the earth and the sky, it reflects colors from both. From a hilltop, it mirrors the sky’s color; close to the shore, it looks yellowish where you can see the sand, then light green that gets darker green in the middle of the pond. In some lights, even from a hilltop, it looks bright green near the shore.

Some say the green comes from reflecting the plants nearby, but it’s still green near the railroad sand-bank and even in spring before leaves grow. So, it might just be the mix of blue from the water and yellow from the sand. That’s the color of its “iris.”

In spring, the ice melts first near the edges because the sun’s heat warms the ice from the bottom and through the earth, making a narrow channel around the still-frozen middle.
