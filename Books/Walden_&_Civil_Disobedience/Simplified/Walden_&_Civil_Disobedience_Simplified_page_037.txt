There are some people called architects here, and I know at least one who thinks that decorations on buildings should have a real reason for being there, making them both necessary and beautiful. To him, this idea seemed totally new. This might sound good from his point of view, but it’s only a little better than just messing around without much thought.

He was like someone trying to fix architecture by starting with small details, like the top edges of buildings, instead of starting with the basics. He cared more about making sure the decorations had a real meaning—like candy with a nut inside—rather than thinking about how the people living inside the building should live honestly and naturally, and letting the decorations just happen on their own.

Who really thinks that decorations are just something on the outside, like the spots on a turtle’s shell or the shiny colors on seashells? The turtle didn’t choose its shell’s style, and people don’t control the style of their houses like that either. Just like a soldier doesn’t have to paint his bravery on his flag—the enemy will see it anyway. This architect seemed to focus too much on the surface, quietly telling his half-truth to the people who actually understood it better.

The real beauty in buildings comes from inside, from the needs and character of the people living there, who are the true builders. It grows naturally without worrying about how it looks. The nicest homes in this country are often the simple, plain log cabins and cottages of poor people. What makes them interesting is the life inside, not just how they look. A city person’s simple house will also be interesting when their life is as real and easy, and when they don’t try too hard to make their house look fancy.

Many decorations on buildings are actually hollow and weak, and a strong wind could blow them away easily without hurting the main building. People who don’t have much inside, like food or wine, don’t really need fancy architecture.
