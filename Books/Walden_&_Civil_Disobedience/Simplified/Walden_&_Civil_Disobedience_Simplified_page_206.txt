Early in the morning, when everything is covered in frost, some men come with fishing rods and simple lunches. They fish for pickerel and perch through the snowy field. These are wild men who follow their own ways and trust different things than the people in town. Their coming and going help keep the town connected in places where it might otherwise fall apart. They sit on dry oak leaves by the shore, eating their lunch, and they know a lot about nature, just like city people know about city life. They never read books, but they still know more than they let on. The things they do are said to be unknown to most people.

Here is one man fishing for pickerel using big perch as bait. When you look into his bucket, it’s like looking into a summer pond, as if he kept summer trapped there or knew where it went. How did he catch these fish in winter? He got worms from rotten logs since the ground was frozen, and used them to catch the fish. His life is closer to nature than the scientists who study it; he is even interesting to those scientists. The scientists carefully lift moss and bark looking for insects, but he splits open logs with his axe, sending moss and bark flying everywhere. He makes a living by stripping bark from trees. A man like that has the right to fish, and I love seeing nature in him. The perch eats the worms, the pickerel eats the perch, and the fisherman eats the pickerel; that’s how everything fits together in nature.

When I walked around the pond on a misty day, I was sometimes amused by the simple way some rough fishermen fished. One might put alder branches over small holes in the ice, spaced out evenly from the shore. They would tie the fishing line to a stick so it wouldn’t be pulled through the hole, then pass the loose line over a twig a foot above the ice and tie a dry oak leaf to it. When a fish bit, the leaf would be pulled down and signal a catch. These alder branches stood out in the mist as I walked halfway around the pond.

Ah, the pickerel of Walden! When I see them lying on the ice or in the hole fishermen cut in the ice to let water in, I’m always amazed by how beautiful they are. They seem like magical fish, very different from the fish you see in the streets or even in the woods, as different as Arabia is from Concord. They have a dazzling beauty that sets them far apart from the dull cod and haddock that people often talk about. They aren’t green like pine trees, gray like stones, or blue like the sky. To me, they have even rarer colors, like flowers and precious stones, as if they were the sparkling gems of Walden’s water.
