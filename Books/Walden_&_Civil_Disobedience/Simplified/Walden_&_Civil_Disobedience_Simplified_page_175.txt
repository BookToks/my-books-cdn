I warmed myself by the still glowing embers that summer, like a hunter who had left, had left behind.

When I built my chimney, I learned about brickwork. My bricks were old and used, so I had to clean them with a trowel. This taught me a lot about bricks and trowels. The mortar on the bricks was fifty years old and was said to be getting harder. But people often say things like that whether they are true or not.

These kinds of sayings get stronger and stick around as people keep repeating them. It would take many hits with a trowel to get rid of an old wise guy’s stubborn ideas.

Many villages in Mesopotamia use old bricks from the ruins of Babylon, and their cement is even older and probably harder. I noticed how tough the steel tool was that could take so many strong hits without breaking. Since my bricks had been used in a chimney before, even though I didn’t see Nebuchadnezzar’s name on them, I picked out as many fireplace bricks as I could to save work and waste. I filled the gaps between the bricks around the fireplace with stones from the pond’s edge and made my mortar using white sand from the same place. I spent most of my time near the fireplace, as it was the most important part of the house.

I worked slowly and carefully. I started building from the ground in the morning, and by night, a few rows of bricks above the floor became my pillow. I don’t remember getting a stiff neck from it; that happened later. Around that time, I let a poet stay with me for two weeks, so space was tight. He brought his own knife, and I had two. We cleaned them by sticking them into the dirt. He helped me with cooking too. I was happy to see my work growing strong and straight bit by bit, and I thought that even if it took time, it would last a long time. The chimney stands on its own, rising from the ground through the house toward the sky. Even if the house burns down, sometimes the chimney stays standing, showing how important and separate it is. This was near the end of summer. Now it was November.
