Baker Farm

Sometimes I walked to pine groves that looked like big temples or ships at sea. Their branches waved softly with green leaves, making cool shade. They were so beautiful that even ancient priests might have left their old trees to worship here.

Other times, I went to the cedar woods beyond Flint’s Pond. The trees there had blue berries and grew really tall, like they belonged in a magical place. On the ground, juniper bushes spread out with lots of fruit.

I also visited swamps where strange moss hung from white spruce trees. There were toadstools that looked like tiny tables for swamp gods, and colorful fungi like butterflies or shells grew on old tree stumps. The swamp was full of different plants, like swamp-pink, dogwood, and red alder berries that glowed like little eyes. Wild holly berries were so pretty they made you forget where you were. There were also many other wild fruits that seemed too beautiful to eat.

Instead of asking experts, I spent a lot of time visiting special trees that are rare around here. Some stood alone in fields, others deep in woods or swamps, or up on hills. These included black birch trees, some as wide as two feet, and their cousin, the yellow birch, which had golden bark and a nice smell.

I also liked the beech trees, with smooth trunks covered in pretty patterns. There’s only one small group of big beech trees left nearby, and people say pigeons once helped plant them by dropping beech nuts. The wood shines silver when you split it.

Other trees I liked were the basswood, hornbeam, false elm, tall pines, shingle trees, and perfect hemlocks that stood like little pagodas in the forest. These special trees were like shrines I visited all year round.
