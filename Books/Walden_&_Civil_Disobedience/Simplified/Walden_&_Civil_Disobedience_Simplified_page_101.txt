People often spend too much time together. We see each other so often that we don’t have time to miss each other or learn anything new about one another. We meet three times a day for meals and end up sharing the same old boring stuff about ourselves. To handle this, we’ve made rules called etiquette and politeness so we don’t get into fights. We meet at places like the post office, social events, and around the fire every night. We live close together and often get in each other’s way, which makes us respect each other less. Honestly, it would be better if we didn’t see each other so much, especially for important talks. Think about the girls working in a factory—they’re almost never alone, even in their dreams. It would be nicer if there was just one person living in a big area, like where I live. A person’s value isn’t about touching their skin.

I once heard about a man lost in the woods who was very weak and starving. He felt less lonely because his sick mind made up strange visions that he thought were real. In the same way, when we’re healthy in body and mind, we can feel comforted by a similar kind of company—one that’s normal and natural—and realize we’re never truly alone.

I have a lot of company in my house, especially in the morning when no one visits. Let me explain by comparing my situation to some things. I am not more lonely than the loon (a kind of bird) on the pond that laughs loudly, or than Walden Pond itself. What kind of company does that quiet lake have? But it doesn’t have sad feelings; it has peaceful, beautiful feelings in its blue water. The sun is alone too, except on cloudy days when it looks like there are two suns, but one is just a fake.
