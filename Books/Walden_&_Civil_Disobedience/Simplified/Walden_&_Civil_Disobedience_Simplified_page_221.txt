One of the coolest things I’ve seen is how melting sand and clay move down the sides of a deep cut along the railroad on my way to the village. This doesn’t happen very often on such a big scale, even though there are more places like this now that railroads exist. The sand here is all kinds of fine and comes in different rich colors, usually mixed with some clay.

When the frost melts in spring, or even on a warm day in winter, the sand starts to flow down the slopes like lava. Sometimes it even bursts through the snow, covering places where there was no sand before. Lots of tiny streams of sand cross over and mix with each other. It’s like they follow some of the rules of flowing water but also look a bit like plants growing. 

As the sand flows, it forms shapes like leafy vines or sprays that pile up a foot or more deep. Looking at them from above, they remind you of certain kinds of lichens, or even coral, animal paws, bird feet, or parts of the body like brains or lungs. It’s a strange, almost creepy kind of plant life, and these shapes and colors are sometimes copied in bronze decorations that are older and more classic than common leaf designs like ivy or vines. This kind of sand pattern might even confuse scientists in the future.

The whole cut looks like a cave with its rock formations opened up in the light. The sand colors are really rich and nice, showing browns, grays, yellows, and reds. When the flowing sand reaches the drain at the bottom, it spreads out and flattens. The streams lose their round shape and become wider and more flat, mixing together as they get wetter, until they make almost flat sand with beautiful shades. You can still see the original plant-like shapes in the sand, but once the sand reaches the water, it turns into banks like those at river mouths, and the shapes disappear into ripples on the bottom.

This whole bank is 20 to 40 feet high and sometimes gets covered with this kind of sand “foliage” or broken sand shapes for a quarter of a mile on one or both sides after just one spring day. What’s really amazing is how quickly this sand foliage appears all of a sudden.
