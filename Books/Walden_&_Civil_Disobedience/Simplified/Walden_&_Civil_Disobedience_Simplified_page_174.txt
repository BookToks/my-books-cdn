I had often seen its wrinkled red velvet flower growing on other plants without realizing it was the same one. People growing crops have almost wiped it out. It tastes a bit sweet, kind of like a frozen potato, and I found it better to boil than to roast. This root seemed like a small promise from Nature to grow and feed her own children simply someday.

Today, with big farms and lots of grain, this simple root, which used to be important to an Indian tribe, is mostly forgotten or only known by its vine. But if wild nature takes over again, the fancy grains might disappear because of many threats. Without humans, crows might even carry the last seeds of corn back to where the Indian god brought them from. But this almost gone ground-nut might come back and grow well, even with frost and wild conditions, becoming an important food again for hunter tribes.

Some Indian goddess like Ceres or Minerva must have created and given this plant. When poetry comes back here, its leaves and nuts might be shown in our art.

By early September, I saw a few small maple trees turn bright red across the pond, near where three white aspen trees split at a point by the water. Their color told many stories! Week by week, each tree showed its own character, admiring itself in the calm lake’s reflection. Every morning, nature changed the view like a new, colorful painting on the wall.

In October, thousands of wasps came to my cabin to stay for winter, settling on the windows and walls, sometimes scaring visitors away. Each morning, when they were cold and slow, I swept some out but didn’t try too hard to get rid of them. I even felt honored that they chose my house for shelter. They didn’t bother me much and slowly disappeared, hiding in cracks somewhere to avoid the cold winter.

Before I settled in for winter in November, like the wasps, I spent time on the northeast side of Walden pond. The sun, shining off the pine woods and rocky shore, warmed that side. It’s much nicer and healthier to be warmed by the sun while you can, rather than by a fire you make yourself.
