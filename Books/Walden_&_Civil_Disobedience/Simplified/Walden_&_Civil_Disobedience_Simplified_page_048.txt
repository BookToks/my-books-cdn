They were a real kind of fruit from grains that I helped ripen. To me, they smelled like other fancy fruits, so I wrapped them in cloths to keep the smell as long as I could.

I studied the old and important art of making bread. I read about how people first made bread without yeast, starting from eating wild nuts and meat, and then slowly moving to softer, more refined food. I learned about how dough accidentally soured, which probably helped people figure out how to make bread rise with yeast. I followed how bread-making changed over time until I got to making “good, sweet, healthy bread,” which is a basic food for life.

Some people say yeast is the soul of bread, like the spirit that makes it rise. It’s treated like something very special, maybe brought to America on the Mayflower ship. I always got my yeast from the village until one day I accidentally killed it by using too hot water. That accident showed me yeast isn’t absolutely needed. I stopped using it even though many housewives said you can’t have good bread without it, and older people warned me I’d get weak. But I’ve gone a year without yeast and I’m still fine. I’m glad I don’t have to carry a bottle of yeast around because it sometimes popped and spilled on me, which was annoying. It’s easier and better not to use it.

Humans can live in all kinds of places and situations. I also didn’t add baking soda or any acids to my bread. It seems I made it like Marcus Porcius Cato did over 200 years before Christ. He said, “Make kneaded bread like this. Wash your hands and trough well. Put flour in the trough, add water slowly, and knead it well. When it’s kneaded, shape it and bake it covered,” which means in a baking pot. He never mentioned yeast. But I didn’t always eat just this kind of bread.
