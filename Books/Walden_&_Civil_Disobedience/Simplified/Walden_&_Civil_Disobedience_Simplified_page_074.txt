If people thought more carefully about what they do, maybe everyone would become students and observers because everyone is interested in human nature and life. When we try to get money, start families or countries, or become famous, we are only mortal. But when we deal with truth, we become immortal and don’t need to worry about change or accidents. A long time ago, the oldest Egyptian or Indian philosopher lifted a corner of the veil from a statue of a god. That veil is still lifted today, and I see the same amazing thing he did because it was me in him who was brave back then, and now he is in me, looking at the same vision. The robe hasn’t gotten dusty, and no time has passed since that god was shown. The time we really use well is not past, present, or future.

My home was better for thinking and serious reading than a university. Even though I didn’t have access to a regular library, I had the chance to read special books that have been shared all over the world. These books were first written on tree bark and now copied on paper. The poet Mîr Camar Uddîn Mast said, “Sitting and exploring the spiritual world through books is like getting drunk on a single glass of wine; I felt that joy when I read deep teachings.” I kept Homer’s Iliad on my table all summer but only looked at it sometimes. At first, I worked hard with my hands because I had to finish my house and take care of my beans, so I couldn’t study much. Still, I stayed hopeful about reading more later. I read a few easy travel books when I had breaks, but then I felt ashamed and asked myself where I really lived.

A student can read Homer or Æschylus in Greek without getting distracted or lazy because it means they try to be like the heroes and spend their mornings reading those pages.
