1.F.5. Some states don’t allow people to reject certain promises or limit certain types of damages. If any part of this agreement breaks the law in your state, the agreement will be changed to follow the most allowed rules in your state. If one part of this agreement isn’t valid or can’t be enforced, the rest of the agreement still stays in effect.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY – You agree to protect and keep safe the Foundation, the trademark owner, their workers, anyone giving out Project Gutenberg™ works following this agreement, and volunteers who help with Project Gutenberg™. You will cover any costs or legal fees if you cause any problems by (a) sharing this or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) changing or messing with any Project Gutenberg™ work, or (c) causing any defects.

Section 2. About Project Gutenberg™’s Mission  
Project Gutenberg™ means sharing electronic books for free in ways that work on all kinds of computers—old, middle-aged, or new. It exists because hundreds of volunteers work hard and many people donate money.

Volunteers and money to help them are very important for reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and making sure these free books stay available for a long time. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was started to keep Project Gutenberg™ safe and strong for future generations. To learn more or find out how you can help, check Sections 3 and 4 or visit www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. About the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit educational group created under Mississippi state law and approved by the IRS as tax-exempt.
