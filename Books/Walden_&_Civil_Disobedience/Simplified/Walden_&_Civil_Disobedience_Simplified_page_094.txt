The oldest and most important man, with his chin resting on a heart-shaped leaf that he uses as a napkin for his drooling mouth, drinks deeply from the once disliked water. He passes the cup around, making a sound like tr-r-roonk, tr-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r-oonk! Soon, the same sound comes back from a distant spot where the next biggest man has taken his drink. 

When everyone around the shore has done this, the leader happily says tr-r-r-oonk! and each person repeats it, even the smallest and messiest one, to make sure no one misses it. Then the cup goes around again and again until the sun burns away the morning fog. Only the oldest man isn’t passed out but keeps shouting troonk now and then, waiting for someone to answer.

I’m not sure I ever heard a rooster crow near my home. I thought it might be nice to keep one just for its song, like a bird that sings. The call of this wild Indian pheasant is one of the most amazing bird sounds. If they could live in the wild here without being kept as pets, their call would become the most famous sound in the woods, louder than the honking of geese and the hooting of owls. 

Imagine the hens cackling when the roosters stop singing! It’s no surprise people keep these birds, not just for their eggs and meat but for their sound. Walking in a forest on a cold winter morning where these birds live, you’d hear the roosters crow loud and clear for miles, louder than other birds. Think about it! It would make everyone want to wake up early, and keep waking up earlier every day, making them healthier, richer, and smarter.

Poets from all over the world celebrate this foreign bird’s call along with their own birds’ songs. It lives well in all climates and is even more natural here than some native birds. It stays healthy, has strong lungs, and never loses energy. Sailors on the ocean hear its voice too, but its sharp sound never woke me up. 

I didn’t keep dogs, cats, cows, pigs, or hens, so it was quiet around me. There were no sounds from churning butter, spinning wheels, singing kettles, hissing urns, or crying children to make me feel comforted.
