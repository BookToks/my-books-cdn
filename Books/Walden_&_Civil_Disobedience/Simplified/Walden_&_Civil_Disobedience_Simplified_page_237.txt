Before he found the perfect stick, the city of Kouroo was already an old ruin, and he sat on one of its hills to peel the stick. Before he shaped it right, the Candahar dynasty ended, and with the stick’s point, he wrote the last ruler’s name in the sand, then went back to working.

By the time he had smoothed and polished the staff, Kalpa was no longer the brightest star in the sky; and before he added the metal tip and decorated head, Brahma had woken up and fallen asleep many times. But why should I keep talking about these things?

When he finished his work, the staff suddenly grew in front of him into the most beautiful of all Brahma’s creations. He had invented a new way to make a staff, like creating a whole world with perfect balance; even though old cities and rulers were gone, better and more amazing ones had taken their place. Looking at the fresh pile of shavings at his feet, he realized that the time he thought had passed was just an illusion. Actually, only a tiny moment had passed, like a spark from Brahma’s mind lighting up a mortal’s brain. The materials were pure, and his skill was pure; so how could the result be anything but amazing?

No matter what story we tell about things, only the truth really helps us in the end. The truth lasts. Most of the time, we’re not really where we think we are; we imagine things and put ourselves in pretend situations, which makes life confusing and hard. When you’re clear-headed, focus on the real facts, the real situation. Speak honestly, not what you think you should say. Any truth is better than pretending. Tom Hyde, a tinker, was about to be executed and was asked if he wanted to say anything. He said, “Tell the tailors to remember to tie a knot in their thread before they start sewing.” His friend’s prayer was forgotten.

No matter how simple or tough your life is, face it and live it; don’t avoid it or call it bad. Life isn’t as bad as you think. It seems worst when you feel richest. People who always complain will find problems even in paradise. Love your life, even if it’s poor. You might still have exciting and wonderful moments, even in a poorhouse. The sunset shines as brightly on a poorhouse window as on a rich person’s house; the snow melts just as early in spring. I think a peaceful mind can be happy anywhere, even in a palace or a poorhouse. Sometimes, poor people live the freest lives of all.
