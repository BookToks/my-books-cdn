Truth always agrees with itself and doesn’t mainly try to show justice that supports wrong actions. He truly deserves to be called the Defender of the Constitution. He only fights to protect, not to attack. He isn’t a leader but a follower. His leaders are the people from 1787. “I have never tried,” he says, “and never will try; I have never supported, and never will support, any effort to change the original agreement that brought the States into the Union.” Still thinking about how the Constitution accepts slavery, he says, “Because it was part of the original deal, let it stay.” Despite being smart and capable, he can’t see the issue beyond politics and understand it clearly—like what a person in America today should really do about slavery. Instead, he gives a confused or forced answer as a private person, which makes you wonder what new rules about social duties come from it?

He says, “The way the governments in slave states handle slavery is up to them, responsible to their people, and to laws of right behavior, kindness, justice, and to God. Groups formed elsewhere because of kindness or any other reason have nothing to do with it. I have never supported them and never will.” People who know no better sources of truth stick to the Bible and the Constitution and respect them with kindness and care. But those who see where truth really comes from get ready to keep moving forward to find its true source.

No one with real talent for making laws has shown up in America. Such people are rare in world history. There are plenty of speakers, politicians, and great talkers; but no one has yet spoken who can solve the big problems we face today. We like good speeches just for being exciting, not because they share truth or inspire bravery. Our lawmakers don’t yet understand the real importance of free trade, freedom, unity, and honesty for a country. They aren’t skilled in dealing with more basic issues like taxes, money, business, farming, and manufacturing.
