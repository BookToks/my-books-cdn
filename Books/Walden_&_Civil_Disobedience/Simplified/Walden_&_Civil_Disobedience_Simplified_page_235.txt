When you make your life simpler, the world won’t seem so complicated. Being alone won’t feel lonely, being poor won’t feel bad, and being weak won’t feel useless. If you have big dreams, that’s okay—they belong in your imagination. Now, work on making those dreams real.

It’s silly that England and America expect you to speak so they can understand you easily. People and mushrooms don’t grow the same way. It’s not a big deal if everyone doesn’t get you. Nature supports all kinds of beings—birds, animals, insects—and different ways of understanding. Some people think being simple is safe, but I worry that I don’t express myself boldly enough to show the truth I believe in. Being bold depends on your situation. A buffalo moving to new land isn’t wild, but a cow that runs off during milking time is. I want to speak freely, like someone awake talking to others who are awake, because I believe I can never exaggerate enough to truly explain what I feel. After hearing beautiful music, who’s afraid to speak boldly? Looking ahead, we should live loosely, not be too rigid, just like our shadows grow faint in the sunlight. The truth in our words shows that words alone can’t fully capture what we mean. Words about faith and respect aren’t exact, but they still mean a lot to those who understand them deeply.

Why do we always have to dumb things down and call that “common sense”? The most common sense is like people sleeping and snoring. Sometimes, we think people with a little more understanding are just as clueless because we only get part of what they say. Some people would even complain about the sunrise if they woke up early enough. I’ve heard people say that the poems of Kabir have many meanings—illusion, spirit, mind, and the teachings of the Vedas—but here, if writing has more than one meaning, people complain about it.
