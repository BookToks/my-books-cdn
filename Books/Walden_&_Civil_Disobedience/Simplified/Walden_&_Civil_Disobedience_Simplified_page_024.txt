Imagine a time long ago, when humans were just starting out, and someone brave hid in a cave for shelter. Every kid kind of starts fresh in the world and loves being outside, even when it’s cold or rainy. Kids play house or horse because it feels natural. Who doesn’t remember being curious about caves or rocks when they were little? That feeling comes from a part of our oldest ancestors that’s still inside us. 

We went from caves to roofs made of palm leaves, bark, cloth, grass, wood, and even stones and tiles. Now, most of us don’t know what it’s like to live outside all the time. Our lives are mostly spent indoors. There’s a big difference between being by the fire inside and being out in the fields. Maybe we should spend more time outside under the sky, instead of always being under a roof. Birds don’t sing in caves, and doves don’t stay innocent in birdhouses.

If someone wants to build a house, they need to be smart about it. Otherwise, they might end up stuck in a place that feels like a prison or a museum instead of a home. Think about how little shelter you really need. I’ve seen Penobscot Indians living in thin cotton tents, even when snow was almost a foot deep. They might have wanted thicker tents to keep the wind out.

When I was worried about making a living, I used to see a big wooden box where workers locked their tools. It made me think that anyone could buy a box like that for cheap, drill holes for air, and use it as a shelter when it rained or at night. You could close the lid and be free inside, with no landlord asking for rent. It didn’t seem like a bad idea. You could stay up late and go outside whenever you wanted, without anyone bothering you.

Lots of people struggle to pay rent for big, fancy places but wouldn’t have frozen in a simple box like that. I’m not joking. Saving money is a serious topic, even if you can talk about it lightly.
