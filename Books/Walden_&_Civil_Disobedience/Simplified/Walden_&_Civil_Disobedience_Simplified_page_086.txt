I don’t think there’s a place like this in Massachusetts anymore:— “Honestly, our village has become a target For one of those fast railroad trains, and over Our quiet land its calming sound is—Concord.” The Fitchburg Railroad runs near the pond about a hundred rods south of where I live. I usually walk to the village along its raised road, and it feels like this path connects me to the world outside. The men on the freight trains, who travel the whole length of the track, wave to me like old friends because they see me so often, and they probably think I work for the railroad; and in a way, I do. I wish I could be a track repairman somewhere on this earth.

The train’s whistle blows through my woods in both summer and winter, sounding like a hawk’s cry flying over a farmer’s field. It tells me that busy city merchants are coming into town, or brave country traders from far away. As they travel across the land, they shout warnings to clear the tracks, and sometimes their calls can be heard from two towns away. Here come your groceries, country people; your supplies, farmers! No one working on their farm can say no to them. And here’s your pay for those goods! screams the countryman’s whistle; big loads of timber move fast, like battering rams heading for the city walls, and there are enough chairs to seat all the tired people living in the city. With this heavy but polite delivery, the country sends a chair to the city. All the wild berry hills are picked clean, all the cranberry fields are emptied into the city. Cotton comes up, woven cloth goes down; silk comes up, wool comes down; books come up, but the cleverness that writes them goes down.

When I see the engine with its line of cars moving like planets—or more like a comet, since you don’t know if it will ever come back—its cloud of steam streaming behind like a shining banner, like fluffy clouds I’ve seen high in the sky, spreading out in shining shapes— it’s like this traveling god of clouds is about to take the sunset sky as the uniform of its train. When I hear the iron horse roar through the hills like thunder, shaking the ground with its steps, and breathing fire and smoke from its nostrils (I don’t know what kind of winged horse or fiery dragon people will invent for new stories), it feels like the earth finally has a creature fast enough and powerful enough to live on it.
