I lived there for two years and two months. Right now, I’m back living in regular, everyday life.

I wouldn’t usually share so much about myself unless people in my hometown asked a lot of questions about how I lived. Some might think these questions are rude, but I don’t. Given the situation, they make sense. Some asked what I ate, if I felt lonely, or if I was scared. Others wanted to know how much of my money I gave to charity, and some, especially those with big families, asked how many poor kids I helped.

So, if you don’t really care about me, please forgive me for answering some of these questions in this book. Most books don’t use “I” much, but this one does. That’s the biggest difference. We often forget that it’s always someone talking about themselves.

I wouldn’t talk so much about myself if I knew other people’s stories as well as my own. But since I don’t, I have to stick to what I know. Also, I think every writer should honestly share their own life story, not just what they’ve heard about others. Like sending a letter to family far away — if they’ve lived truthfully, their story might seem like it’s from a far-off place to someone else.

Maybe these pages are mostly for students who don’t have much money. But I hope everyone who reads this finds something useful. And I hope no one tries to make the story fit them if it doesn’t — it’s meant to help those it fits well.
