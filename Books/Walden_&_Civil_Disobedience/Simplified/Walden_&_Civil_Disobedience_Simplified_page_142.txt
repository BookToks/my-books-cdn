When I first paddled a boat on Walden, it was surrounded by tall pine and oak trees. In some small bays, grapevines grew over the trees near the water, making natural arches that a boat could go under. The hills around the lake were so steep, and the trees so tall, that looking from the west end, it looked like a natural theater in the forest.

When I was younger, I spent many hours floating on the water. I would paddle to the middle of the lake, lie back on the seats, and daydream on summer mornings. I only woke up when the boat touched the shore, and I would get up to see where I had landed. Those were days when doing nothing was the best and most useful thing to do. I often snuck away to spend the best part of the day like this. I was rich, not in money, but in sunny hours and summer days, and I used them freely. I don’t regret not spending more time working or studying. But since I left, woodcutters have destroyed many of the woods, and now for years there will be no more walking through the forest paths with occasional views of the water.

My inspiration may be quiet now. How can birds sing when their forests are cut down?

Now the trees in the water are gone, along with the old log canoe and the dark woods. The villagers hardly remember where the pond is. Instead of going there to swim or drink, they want to pipe the water into the village to wash their dishes—to get their Walden by just turning a tap! The terrible Iron Horse, whose loud noise is heard all over town, has dirtied the Boiling Spring with its feet. It also destroyed all the woods on Walden’s shore. This Iron Horse, like a Trojan horse with many men inside, was brought by greedy people! Where is the country’s hero to stop it and protect the land?

Still, of all the places I know, Walden stays the best and keeps its pure beauty. Many people have been compared to it, but few deserve it. Even though woodcutters have cleared some shores, the Irish have built near it, the railroad has come close, and ice-men have skimmed it once, it is still the same water I saw when I was young. The only thing that has changed is me.
