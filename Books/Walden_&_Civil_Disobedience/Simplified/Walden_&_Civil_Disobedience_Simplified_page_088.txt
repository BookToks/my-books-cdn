Haven’t people gotten better at being on time since trains were invented? Don’t they talk and think faster at the train station than they did at the old stagecoach office? There’s something exciting about the train station. I’ve been surprised by what it has done; some people I thought would never get to Boston quickly are now there right when the bell rings. Doing things “railroad style” is now a popular saying, and it’s good to be warned often and clearly by something that won’t stop for anyone. There’s no yelling or warning shots here. We’ve made a fate, like a powerful force, that never turns away. (Let’s call your engine that name.) People know exactly when the train will leave and where it’s going, but it doesn’t mess up anyone’s plans, and kids still go to school on a different track. We live better because of this. We’ve all learned to be steady and reliable. The air feels full of invisible forces. Every path but yours is fate’s path. So, stay on your own track.

What I like about business is its boldness and bravery. It doesn’t just sit around and hope for good luck. I see these people every day, going about their work with courage and a sense of peace, doing more than they realize, and maybe doing better work than they planned. I am less impressed by soldiers who stood bravely in battle for a short time than by the steady, cheerful bravery of the men who live in the snow-plows all winter. They don’t just have early morning courage, which Napoleon thought was rare—they stay brave as long as the storm lasts or until their strong machines freeze. On this morning of a big snowstorm, which is still blowing and making people cold, I hear the quiet sound of their engine bell through the fog and cold breath. It tells me the trains are coming soon, even though the storm is trying to stop them. I see the snow-plow workers covered in snow and ice, their heads poking out above the big blade that’s pushing aside not flowers and mouse nests, but huge rocks like the mountains out west, standing strong at the edge of the world.

Business is surprisingly confident and calm, always ready, brave, and tireless. Its ways are very natural, more so than many strange or emotional ideas, and that’s why it works so well.
