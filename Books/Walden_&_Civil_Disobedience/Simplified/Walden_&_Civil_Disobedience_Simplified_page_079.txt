Even the best books are not read by people who are called good readers.

What kind of culture do we have in Concord? Almost nobody here cares about the best or even very good books in English literature, even though everyone can read and spell the words. Even college-educated men here and elsewhere hardly know the English classics. And when it comes to the ancient classics and Bibles, which are full of wisdom and easy for anyone to find, hardly anyone tries to learn about them.

I know a middle-aged woodchopper who reads a French newspaper—not for the news, because he thinks he's above that—but to keep his French skills sharp. He is Canadian. When I ask him what he thinks is the best thing he can do in life, he says, besides that, to improve his English. This is about the same as what college-educated people usually do. They read English papers just to practice.

If someone just finished reading one of the best English books, how many people could they talk to about it? Or if they read a Greek or Latin classic in the original language, which even uneducated people admire, they would find no one to discuss it with and would have to stay quiet. Even college professors who know the language well don’t always understand the deep meaning and beauty of Greek poetry, so they can’t share their excitement with readers. And who here can even name the sacred Scriptures or Bibles of the world? Most people don’t even know that other nations besides the Hebrews have their own scriptures.

People will go out of their way to pick up a silver dollar, but here we have golden words from the wisest people in history—words that wise people in every age have valued—and yet we only learn to read easy books and stories for kids. After school, our reading, talking, and thinking stay at a very simple level, like tiny little people.

I want to know wiser men than those from Concord, whose names hardly anyone here even knows. Will I hear the name Plato and never read his book? It’s like Plato is my neighbor, but I’ve never seen or listened to him. But the truth is, his famous Dialogues sit on my bookshelf, and I have never read them.
