They are, of course, like little versions of Walden all around, tiny Waldens in the animal world, called Waldenses. It’s surprising that they get caught here—in this deep and big spring, far below the noisy wagons and sleighs traveling the Walden road, this huge gold and green fish swims. I never saw one in any market; it would definitely catch everyone’s attention there. With just a few quick moves, they die easily, as if they’ve been taken to a peaceful place before their time.

I wanted to find out how deep Walden Pond really is, so before the ice melted in early ’46, I measured it carefully using a compass, a chain, and a sounding line. Many stories have been told about the bottom of this pond—or that it has no bottom—but none of these stories were true. It’s amazing how long people will believe a pond is bottomless without checking. In one walk nearby, I even saw two ponds people thought were bottomless.

Some people believed Walden Pond went all the way through to the other side of the world. Some who lay flat on the ice for a long time, looking down through the water, maybe with watery eyes, and worried about catching a cold, thought they saw huge holes “big enough to drive a load of hay into,” if anyone was there to do it. They believed these holes were the real source of the Styx River and the entrance to the underworld from this area.
