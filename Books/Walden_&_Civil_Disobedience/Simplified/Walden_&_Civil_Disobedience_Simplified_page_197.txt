Winter Animals

When the ponds froze solid, they gave me new, shorter paths to many places. They also showed me different views of the land around them. One time, after Flint’s Pond was covered with snow, I crossed it. Even though I had paddled and skated on it before, it looked so wide and strange that it reminded me of Baffin’s Bay. The Lincoln hills stood around me at the edge of a snowy plain, a place I didn’t remember ever standing on before.

Far away on the ice, fishermen moved slowly with their wolf-like dogs. They looked like seal hunters or Eskimos. Sometimes, in foggy weather, they seemed like giant or tiny creatures I couldn’t tell apart. I took this way when I went to a lecture in Lincoln at night, walking without following any road or passing any houses between my hut and the lecture hall.

On the way, I passed Goose Pond, where a group of muskrats lived. They built their homes high above the ice, but I never saw any muskrats when I crossed. Walden Pond, which usually had little or no snow, was like my backyard. I could walk there easily even when snow was almost two feet deep elsewhere and people were stuck on their streets.

Far from the village, and except for the occasional sound of sleigh bells, I slid and skated over the frozen pond. It felt like a huge moose yard covered with oak trees and tall pine trees heavy with snow or shiny with icicles.

At night and sometimes during the day in winter, I often heard the lonely but beautiful call of a hooting owl. It sounded like the frozen earth making music when tapped. This sound was the true voice of Walden Wood, and I got used to it even though I never saw the owl making it. I heard it almost every winter evening when I opened my door. The owl’s call went, “Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer, hoo,” sounding strong and clear. The first three parts sounded a bit like “how der do.” Sometimes it just called “hoo hoo.”
