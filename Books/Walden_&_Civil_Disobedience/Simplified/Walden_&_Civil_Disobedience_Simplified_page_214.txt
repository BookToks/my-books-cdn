Every day, about a hundred Irish workers, supervised by some men from Cambridge, came to cut ice. They cut the ice into blocks using well-known methods. Then, they slid the blocks to the shore, quickly moved them onto a platform, and lifted them up with hooks, pulleys, and horses. They stacked the blocks neatly, side by side and row after row, like building a giant tower reaching for the sky.

They said they could collect about a thousand tons of ice in one good day, which came from about one acre of the pond. The sleds left deep tracks and holes in the ice, just like wheels do on dirt roads. The horses ate their oats from buckets made by hollowing out blocks of ice. The ice blocks were piled outside, making a stack 35 feet tall and about 100 to 130 feet wide. Hay was placed between the outer layers to keep air out because if wind got inside, it would wear away the ice and cause the stack to fall down.

At first, the big pile looked like a huge blue castle or temple. But after they put hay in the cracks and frost and icicles covered it, it looked like an old, mossy, icy ruin—like the home of Winter, the old man you see in calendars. They figured that only about 75% of the ice would make it to where it was going, and a small amount, 2 or 3%, would be lost on the train cars.

Even so, most of this ice pile ended up not being used as planned. Maybe the ice didn’t last as long as expected because it had more air inside or for some other reason. The big pile, made in the winter of 1846–1847 and holding about ten thousand tons, was covered with hay and boards. Although it was uncovered the next July and some ice was taken away, the rest stayed in the sun and didn't melt completely until September 1848. So, the pond got back most of its ice after all.
