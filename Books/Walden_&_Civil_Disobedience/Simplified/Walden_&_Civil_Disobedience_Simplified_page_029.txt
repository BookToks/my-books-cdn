Or I could tell you about Ireland, which is shown as one of the white or enlightened places on the map.

Think about the physical health of the Irish compared to Native Americans, South Sea Islanders, or other wild groups before they met civilized people. I believe the leaders of these groups are just as smart as most civilized rulers. Their poor condition shows that being dirty and messy can still happen in a civilized place. I don’t even need to mention the workers in the Southern States who grow the main crops for this country but are themselves treated badly.

But let’s focus on people who are said to be doing okay.

Most people never really think about what a house should be. They stay poor because they feel they must have the same kind of house as their neighbors. It’s like wearing any old coat the tailor makes or giving up a simple hat and complaining because you can’t afford a fancy crown! It’s possible to design a house that’s even fancier and more comfortable than what we have, but no one could afford it. Should we always try to get more stuff, or sometimes be happy with less? Should grown-ups teach young people that they need lots of extra shoes, umbrellas, and empty guest rooms just to be respected before they die? Why can’t our furniture be as simple as the Arab’s or the Indian’s? When I think about great people who helped humanity, who we often think of as gifts from heaven, I don’t picture them with tons of fancy furniture following them. Or if I allow that our furniture should be fancier than the Arab’s because we are smarter and better, isn’t that weird? Right now, our houses are full of too much stuff, and a good housewife would throw most of it out without feeling like she didn’t finish her morning cleaning.

Morning work! By the colors of dawn and the songs of morning birds, what should a person’s morning work be in this world? I had three pieces of limestone on my desk, but I got scared when I saw I had to dust them every day, while I hadn’t even cleaned my mind yet. So, I threw them out the window in frustration. How could I ever have a well-furnished house?
