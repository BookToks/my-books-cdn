When a man dies, he kicks the dust.

Some wild tribes have customs that maybe we should copy because they try to renew themselves every year. They might not fully understand it, but they get the idea. Wouldn't it be cool if we had a celebration like the “busk” or “feast of first fruits” that the Mucclasse Indians used to do? Bartram says, “When a town celebrates the busk, they first get new clothes, pots, pans, and other stuff. Then they gather all their old clothes and dirty things, clean their houses and the whole town, and burn all the trash and old food in one big pile.” After that, they take medicine and fast for three days, giving up all their wants and desires. During this time, everyone who did wrong is forgiven and can come back to town.

On the fourth morning, the high priest makes new fire by rubbing dry wood together in the town square. Then, every home gets some of this new, pure fire. They eat new corn and fruit, and dance and sing for three days. After that, they spend four days visiting and celebrating with friends from nearby towns who have also cleaned and prepared themselves. The Mexicans did something like this every fifty-two years because they believed the world might end then.

I think this is a real sacred tradition, like a sign that shows a deep spiritual change. I believe they were inspired by Heaven to do this, even if they didn’t have the Bible to guide them.

For over five years, I supported myself by working with my hands. I found that working about six weeks a year was enough to pay for everything I needed to live.
