The energy inside us that, when we’re careless, wastes away and makes us feel dirty, actually makes us strong and inspired when we control ourselves. Being pure is like the best part of being a person; things like talent, courage, and goodness all come from it.

When we keep ourselves pure, it’s like a clear path to something greater. Sometimes our purity lifts us up, and sometimes our dirtiness brings us down. Someone is lucky if they feel the bad, animal side of them getting weaker every day, and their better, spiritual side growing stronger. Maybe everyone should feel a bit ashamed of the wild, animal side inside them. I worry that we’re kind of like gods mixed with wild animals—part divine, part driven by urges—and that might be embarrassing.

“How happy is the person who controls their wild side and clears their mind!

They can handle wild things like horses, goats, and wolves without acting like one themselves!

Otherwise, a person isn’t just like a herd of pigs, but also like the demons that made those pigs go crazy and act worse.”

All kinds of wild desires are really the same thing, even if they show up in different ways. Whether a person eats too much, drinks too much, sleeps around, or acts in other wild ways, it’s all the same craving. You only need to see them do one of these things to know how wild they are. People who are not pure can’t be around pure people. Like a snake hiding in one hole but popping out another, if you want to be pure, you have to be self-controlled. What is purity? How do you know if you have it? You probably don’t really know. We’ve heard about it, but we don’t truly understand it. We just say what we’ve heard from others.

Working hard brings wisdom and purity; being lazy brings ignorance and wild desires. A lazy student is one who is stuck in bad habits of the mind. A dirty person is usually lazy, someone who just sits around and doesn’t do anything useful. If you want to stay clean and avoid bad choices, work hard, even if it’s just cleaning a stable. Nature is tough to beat, but you have to fight it. What good is it to be a Christian if you’re not purer than people who don’t believe, if you don’t say no to yourself more, if you’re not more devoted? I know of many religions people call weird, but their rules make people feel ashamed and push them to try harder, even if it’s just following some rituals.
