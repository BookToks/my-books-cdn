But being wise means not doing crazy or risky things.

When we think about what people really want in life, it seems like most choose to live the usual way because they like it better than anything else. But they often believe they don’t have any other choice. Still, smart and healthy people remember that the sun always rises. It’s never too late to change our minds. No way of thinking or doing something, no matter how old, should be trusted without proof. What everyone believes today might turn out to be wrong tomorrow, just opinions that some thought would help them but didn’t. Sometimes, older people say you can’t do something, but if you try, you might find out you can. Old ways are for old people, and new ways for new people. Maybe old people didn’t know enough before to keep things going, but young people now can do amazing things, moving fast like birds, in ways that might seem too much for older folks. Being old doesn’t always mean you know better than young people because old people have lost more than they’ve gained. You might even wonder if the smartest person has really learned anything truly important just by living.

In real life, old people don’t have much important advice for young people because their experience is limited, and their lives may feel like failures for personal reasons. They might still believe in some hope, but they are just older, not much wiser. I’ve lived about thirty years, and I haven’t heard any useful or serious advice from older people. They haven’t told me anything helpful, and maybe they can’t. Life is a big experiment for me, and it doesn’t help that others have tried it before. If I have any good experience, I’m sure it wasn’t something my mentors ever talked about.

One farmer told me, “You can’t live only on plants because they don’t make bones.” So he spends part of his day eating things that help build bones, while walking behind his oxen that pull his heavy plow, even though their bones are made from plants. Some things are really necessary for some people, while for others they’re just luxuries or even unknown.
