In about three or four years, when the land got used to farming, people built nice houses and spent a lot of money on them. Our ancestors seemed smart because they focused on meeting their biggest needs first. But are those important needs really met now? When I think about getting one of these fancy houses, I hesitate because the land isn’t ready for that kind of life yet. We still have to stretch our basic needs thinner than our ancestors did. It’s not that decorating houses isn’t important, even in simple times; but first, our homes should be beautiful where it matters most, like how a shell protects a shellfish, not just covered up with fancy stuff.

But sadly, I’ve been inside some of these houses, and I know what’s really inside.

We’re not so far gone that we couldn’t live in caves or simple shelters or wear animal skins today. But it’s better to use the helpful things people have invented, even if they cost a lot. Around here, materials like boards, shingles, lime, and bricks are easier and cheaper to get than caves, logs, bark, clay, or stones. I know this well because I’ve studied and tried it myself. With a bit of cleverness, we could use these things to be richer than even the richest people now and make civilization something good. A civilized person is just a smarter and more experienced wild person. But now, about my own project.

At the end of March 1845, I borrowed an axe and went to the woods near Walden Pond, where I wanted to build my house. I started cutting down some tall, slim white pine trees that were still young for wood. It’s hard to start without borrowing things, but maybe it’s good to let others share in what you’re doing. The axe owner said the axe was very special to him, but I gave it back sharper than I got it. The hill where I worked was nice, covered with pine trees, and I could see the pond and a small open field in the woods where pines and hickory trees were growing.
