The shore is uneven enough so it doesn’t look boring. In my mind, I see the west side with deep bays, the stronger northern shore, and the pretty curved southern shore, where one cape overlaps another, making me think there are hidden coves between them.

The forest looks its best and most beautiful when you see it from the middle of a small lake surrounded by hills that rise right from the water’s edge. The water reflects the trees and creates the best foreground, with its winding shore making a natural and nice border. The edge doesn’t look rough or messy like it does where people have cut trees or where fields meet the forest. The trees have plenty of room to grow over the water, and each tree sends its strongest branch that way. Nature has made a natural edge here, and your eyes move smoothly from small bushes at the shore to the tallest trees.

There are very few signs of people around. The water touches the shore just like it did a thousand years ago.

A lake is the most beautiful and meaningful part of the landscape. It’s like the earth’s eye; when you look into it, you think about your own feelings. The trees near the shore are like the eyelashes around the eye, and the hills and cliffs around are like the eyebrows above it.

Standing on the smooth sandy beach at the east end of the pond on a calm September afternoon, when a slight haze makes the opposite shore hard to see, I understand why people say “the glassy surface of a lake.” If you look upside down, it looks like a thin, shiny thread stretched across the valley, shining against the pine trees far away, separating one layer of air from another. It looks like you could walk under it without getting wet, and that the birds flying low might land on it. Sometimes, the swallows do dive below this line by mistake and quickly realize it’s water.

Looking west over the pond, you have to use both hands to shield your eyes from the bright sun and its reflection because they are just as bright. If you look closely at the lake’s surface, it really is as smooth as glass, except where tiny insects skate on it, making tiny sparkles, or when a duck fluffs its feathers, or a swallow flies so low it almost touches the water. Sometimes, a fish jumps out of the water in a smooth arc, shining with bright flashes when it leaves and hits the water again. You might even see a bit of fluffy plant floating on the water, and fish dart at it, making tiny ripples.
