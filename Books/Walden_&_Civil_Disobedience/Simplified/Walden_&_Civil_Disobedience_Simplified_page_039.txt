In total, the materials cost me about $28.12½. This includes everything except the timber, stones, and sand, which I got by squatter’s right. I also have a small woodshed next to the house, mostly made from leftover building materials.

I plan to build a house that will be more impressive and comfortable than any on the main street in Concord. It will cost no more than the house I have now, and I’ll build it when I feel like it.

I realized that a student who needs a place to live can get one for life at about the same cost as the rent they pay each year.

If I sound like I’m bragging, it’s not just for me but for everyone. Even though I have my flaws, the truth of what I’m saying doesn’t change. There’s a lot of fake talk and nonsense out there, which is hard to ignore, but I want to be honest because it feels good for both my mind and body. I won’t be too humble to speak up for the truth.

At Cambridge College, just renting a student’s room, which is only a bit bigger than mine, costs thirty dollars a year. The college can build many rooms together and under one roof, but students still have to deal with noisy neighbors and maybe live on the fourth floor. I believe if people were wiser, students wouldn’t need as much education because they’d already know more, and the cost of education would be much less.

The things students need at Cambridge or anywhere else cost them or others way more than they should because of poor management. The most expensive things aren’t always what students really want. For example, tuition is a big part of the cost, but students get much more valuable education by spending time with smart classmates for free. Colleges usually raise money by collecting fees, then hire contractors to build, who hire workers to do the actual work, while students prepare for their future jobs. Because of these mistakes, future students end up paying more.
