I have looked around the countryside within about twelve miles of where I live. In my mind, I imagined buying all the farms one by one, because I knew they were all for sale and I knew how much they cost. I walked around each farm, tried the wild apples, talked farming with the owners, and imagined buying their farms at any price. I didn’t get the papers to own them, just their word, because I love to talk. I took care of the farms and even got to know the farmers a little. When I’d enjoyed it enough, I left and let the farmers keep running their farms. Because of this, my friends saw me as a kind of real-estate agent. Wherever I sat, I felt like I could live there, and the view spread out around me. A house is just a place to sit, and it’s even better if it’s in the country. I found many good spots for a house that some people thought were too far from the village, but to me, the village was the one that was far away. I told myself I could live there, and for a little while, I did—in my imagination through a summer and a winter. I pictured how I could spend the years, get through the cold winter, and watch spring come. Anyone who builds a house around here later can be sure I thought of it first.

One afternoon was enough for me to plan the land into an orchard, a small forest, and pasture. I decided which big oak and pine trees should stay by the house and figured out where to place each broken tree so it looked best. Then I left the land alone to rest, because a person is rich if they can afford to leave things alone sometimes.

My imagination went so far that I even got the chance to say “no” first if someone wanted to sell a few farms—that’s all I wanted. But I never actually owned any of them. The closest was when I bought the Hollowell farm, started sorting seeds, and gathered stuff to build a wheelbarrow to carry the seeds. But before the owner gave me the official papers, his wife—because every man has a wife like that—changed her mind and wanted to keep the farm. So the owner offered me ten dollars to give up the deal.
