Sometimes, even though there was snow, when I came back from my walk in the evening, I saw the deep tracks of a woodcutter leading from my door. I found his pile of wood scraps on the hearth, and my house smelled like his pipe. On a Sunday afternoon, if I was home, I heard the crunching of snow made by a smart farmer. He came from far through the woods to visit me and have a friendly chat. He was one of the few farmers who really cared about his work. He wore a frock instead of fancy clothes and was just as ready to talk about church or government as to carry manure from his barn. We talked about simple times when people sat by big fires in cold weather with clear minds. When we didn’t have dessert, we tried to crack open nuts, but the ones with thick shells were usually empty because squirrels had already taken the good ones.

The visitor who came the farthest through deep snow and bad storms was a poet. Farmers, hunters, soldiers, reporters, and even thinkers might get scared off, but not a poet, because he works out of pure love. No one can guess when he will show up. He comes at all hours, even when doctors are asleep. We made the small house loud with laughter and serious talks, making up for the quiet times at Walden.

Compared to us, Broadway was quiet and empty. Every now and then, we laughed loudly, either because of the last joke or the next one coming. We made many new ideas about life while eating a thin bowl of gruel. It was fun and thoughtful at the same time.

I should also mention another visitor during my last winter at the pond. He came through the village in snow, rain, and darkness until he saw my lamp through the trees and spent some long winter evenings with me. He was one of the last great thinkers—Connecticut gave him to the world. At first, he sold goods from Connecticut, but later, as he says, he sold his ideas. He still shares his brainpower, inspiring God and embarrassing people, giving only his mind like a nut gives its kernel. I think he must be the most faithful man alive.
