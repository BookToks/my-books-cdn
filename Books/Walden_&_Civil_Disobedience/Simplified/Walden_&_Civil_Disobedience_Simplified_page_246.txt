These people must stop owning slaves and stop fighting Mexico, even if it means they lose everything as a group.

Countries usually agree with Paley’s ideas, but does anyone think Massachusetts is doing the right thing right now?

People who don’t want change in Massachusetts aren’t politicians far away in the South, but merchants and farmers nearby. They care more about business and farming than about being fair to slaves and Mexico, no matter the cost. I don’t argue with distant enemies, but with those close to home who help those far away and make them powerful. We often say most people aren’t ready for change; progress is slow because the few aren’t much wiser or better than the many. It’s not important for many to be as good as you, but that some people are truly good; that can influence everyone.

There are thousands who say they are against slavery and the war but don’t actually do anything to stop them. They think of themselves as followers of Washington and Franklin but just sit around doing nothing because they don’t know what to do. They care more about free trade than freedom, and calmly check prices and news from Mexico after dinner, maybe even falling asleep over them. What is the value of an honest man and patriot today? They hesitate, feel sorry, and sometimes write letters, but don’t seriously act to make a difference. They wait for others to fix problems so they don’t have to feel bad anymore. At best, they give a weak vote and a small good luck to the right side as it passes by. There are 999 supporters of goodness for every one truly good person; but it’s easier to deal with someone who really owns something than with someone who just watches over it for a while.

Voting is like playing a game, like checkers or backgammon, but with some moral meaning. People bet on it. Voters don’t put their real character on the line. I might vote the way I think is right, but I don’t deeply care if that right choice wins.
