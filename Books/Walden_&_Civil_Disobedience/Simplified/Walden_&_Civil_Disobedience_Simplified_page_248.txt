If I want to spend my time on other things or ideas, I have to make sure I’m not doing it by standing on someone else’s hard work or effort.  

I need to stop relying on them so they can have their chance to focus on their own stuff too. It’s crazy how people accept this. I’ve heard some people say, “I wouldn’t go if they told me to help stop a slave rebellion or fight in Mexico,” but these same people have actually paid others to go instead of them.  

People cheer for soldiers who refuse to fight in an unfair war, even though those cheering still support the unfair government that started the war. It’s like the government hires someone to punish itself but won’t stop doing wrong. So, in the name of law and order, we all end up supporting our own weakness. At first, people feel guilty about doing wrong, but then they stop caring, and that bad behavior just becomes a normal part of life.  

The biggest and most common mistakes need the strongest kind of selflessness to keep going. The so-called loyalty to one’s country often gets praised, but real heroes are those who don’t just accept the government’s actions but stand against them. People who don’t like what their government does but still support it are often the biggest blockers to change. Some are asking the government to break apart, but why don’t they break their own connection to it and stop paying taxes?  

Isn’t their connection to the government like the government’s connection to the country? And aren’t the same reasons stopping the government from breaking apart also stopping these people from standing up to the government?  

How can someone be happy just having an opinion and enjoying it?  

Is there any point in that if the opinion is that you’re being treated unfairly? If your neighbor cheats you out of a dollar, you don’t just say you’re cheated and do nothing. You don’t just ask nicely for the money. You take real action to get what’s yours and make sure it doesn’t happen again.
