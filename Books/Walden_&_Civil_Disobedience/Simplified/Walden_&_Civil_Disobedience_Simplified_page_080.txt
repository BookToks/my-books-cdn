We are not well educated and don’t live very well, and I admit I don’t see much difference between the person in town who can’t read at all and the one who only reads easy, childish stuff. We should be as smart as the great people from the past, but first, we need to know how smart they really were. We are like little birds who only fly just above the newspapers we read every day.

Not all books are as boring as the people who read them. There are probably books made for people like us, and if we could really listen and understand, they could help us feel better and see the world in a new way. Lots of people have started new chapters in their lives after reading a book. There might be a book out there that explains amazing things and shows us new wonders. Things we can’t say now might be written somewhere.

The questions that confuse and bother us have been asked by all the wise people before; none of them missed any question. Each wise person has tried to answer these questions the best they could, through what they said and how they lived.

Also, with wisdom, we learn to be open-minded. A lonely worker on a farm near Concord might feel his religious experience makes him isolated and serious, and he might think others don’t understand him. But long ago, a wise man named Zoroaster had the same feeling. He knew it was a common experience and treated others kindly. He is even said to have started worship among people. So, that worker should quietly think about Zoroaster, and through all the great wise people, even Jesus Christ, and forget about the idea of “our church” being the only one that matters.

We like to say we live in the 19th century and are moving forward faster than any nation. But think about how little this town does for its own culture. I don’t want to praise my neighbors or be praised by them because that won’t help us grow. We need a push—like oxen being forced to move faster. We have okay schools for little kids, but except for a weak winter club and a small new library from the state, there’s no school for grown-ups. We spend more money on food and medicine than on feeding our minds. It’s time to have special schools for adults, so we don’t stop learning when we become men and women.
