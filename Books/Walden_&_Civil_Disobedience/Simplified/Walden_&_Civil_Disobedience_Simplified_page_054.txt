Basically, I believe, from both faith and experience, that living on this Earth isn’t hard if we choose to live simply and wisely. People in simpler societies treat life like a game or fun activity, while those in more complicated societies make it a struggle. You don’t have to work super hard to live, unless you get tired easier than I do.

A young guy I know, who owns some land, said he’d live like I do if he could. But I wouldn’t want anyone to copy my way of living. First, because I might change my mind and try something new, and second, because I want everyone to be different. I want each person to figure out their own path, not just follow their parents or friends. If a young person wants to build, plant, or sail, they should do it without being stopped. Being wise is like keeping your eye on a star while sailing—it helps guide you even if you don’t know exactly when you’ll arrive.

It’s true that what works for one person can work even better for a thousand. For example, a big house isn’t much more expensive than a small one because it shares walls and a roof. But I prefer to live alone. It’s usually cheaper to build your own place than to convince others to share a wall. Plus, shared walls are often thin and neighbors might not take care of their side. Working together with others usually only happens in small ways and isn’t very real. True teamwork requires trust. Without trust, people just live like everyone else, no matter who they are with. Real cooperation means sharing how we make a living. I heard about two guys traveling together—one had no money and worked as he went, the other had money in his pocket. They wouldn’t get along long because one wouldn’t join in the work.
