I never found out which side won the fight or why they were fighting; but for the rest of that day, I felt like I had seen something really intense and scary right outside my door.

Kirby and Spence say that ant battles have been famous for a long time and people even wrote down the dates. But they think Huber is the only modern writer who actually saw one. They say, “Æneas Sylvius gave a detailed story about a fight between big and small ants on a pear tree trunk.” He added that “This battle happened during Pope Eugenius the Fourth’s time, with a famous lawyer named Nicholas Pistoriensis watching and telling the story.” Another story from Olaus Magnus tells about a fight where the small ants won and buried their own dead, but left the big ants’ bodies for birds to eat. This happened before the ruler Christiern the Second was kicked out of Sweden. The fight I saw happened in Polk’s area, five years before Webster’s Fugitive-Slave Bill was passed.

Many village dogs, not very good hunters, would wander the woods without their owner knowing. They would sniff around old fox homes and holes made by woodchucks but didn’t find much. Sometimes, a small dog would lead the way, moving quickly through the trees and still scaring the animals living there. The bigger dogs would be far behind, barking loudly at squirrels hiding in trees, then running off, breaking bushes, thinking they were chasing some wild animal. Once, I was surprised to see a cat walking along the rocky edge of a pond because cats usually don’t go so far from home. The cat was surprised too. Still, even a pet cat that spends all day inside seems comfortable in the woods and moves quietly like it belongs there more than the wild animals.

One time, while picking berries, I found a wild cat with her kittens in the woods. They all had their backs arched and were hissing at me angrily. A few years before, there was talk about a “winged cat” living in a farmhouse near the pond in Lincoln.
