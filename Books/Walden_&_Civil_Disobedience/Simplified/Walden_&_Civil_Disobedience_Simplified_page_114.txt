I was not scared of the hen-harriers because I didn’t have any chickens. But I was more afraid of the men-harriers.

I had more visitors this time than before. Kids came to pick berries, railroad workers went for a Sunday walk in clean shirts, fishermen and hunters showed up, along with poets and thinkers. Basically, all honest people who came to the woods to feel free and really leave the village behind.

I was ready to say, “Welcome, Englishmen! Welcome, Englishmen!” because I had talked with people from that group before.
