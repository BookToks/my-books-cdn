I have other things to take care of. I didn’t come into this world mainly to make it a better place, but to live in it, whether it’s good or bad. A person can’t do everything, but they can do something; and just because they can’t do everything, doesn’t mean they should do something wrong. It’s not my job to keep asking the Governor or the Legislature for help, just like it’s not their job to ask me. And if they don’t listen to me, what can I do? But in this case, the problem is the State’s own rules. This might sound harsh and stubborn, but it’s actually the kindest way to deal with the only kind of spirit that really understands or deserves kindness. All big changes, like birth and death, shake things up.

I’m not afraid to say that people who call themselves abolitionists should stop supporting the Massachusetts government with their time and money right now. They shouldn’t wait until they have more people on their side before they let what’s right happen. I think it’s enough if they have God with them, without waiting for anyone else. Also, any person who is more right than others is already a majority of one.

I deal with the American government, or the State government, face to face just once a year, when the tax collector comes to me. That’s the only way I have to meet it. The government then says clearly, “Recognize me.” The easiest and most important way to show how you feel about it is to say no at that moment. The tax collector is the person I have to deal with—because in the end, I’m dealing with people, not papers. He chose to work for the government. How will he know what he really is—as a government worker or as a person—until he has to decide if he will treat me, his neighbor, with respect, or treat me like a troublemaker? He has to figure out how to get past this problem without being rude or angry. I know this for sure: if even ten honest men in Massachusetts stopped supporting slavery and got locked up for it, it would end slavery in America. Even one honest man doing this would make a huge difference.
