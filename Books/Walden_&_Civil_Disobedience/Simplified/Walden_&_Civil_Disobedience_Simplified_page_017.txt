For many years, I took it upon myself to check on snowstorms and rainstorms, doing my job carefully. I didn’t survey roads but instead checked forest paths and trails across fields, keeping them open and fixing bridges so people could use them all year round where it was clear they were useful.

I also looked after the wild animals in town, which can be hard because they often jump over fences. I kept an eye on quiet parts of the farm, even if I didn’t always know who was working in each field—that wasn’t my business. I watered many plants like red huckleberries, sand cherries, nettle trees, red pines, black ash, white grapes, and yellow violets, especially during dry times so they wouldn’t die.

In short, I kept doing this for a long time, honestly taking care of my duties. But it became clear that the people in town wouldn’t officially make me a town officer or give me any pay for my work. Even though I kept track of everything carefully, no one ever checked or accepted my records, and I never got paid. Still, I didn’t mind that.

Not long ago, a Native American man came by to sell baskets at a lawyer’s house nearby. He asked, “Do you want to buy any baskets?” The lawyer said, “No, we don’t want any.” As he left, the man said, “What! Do you want us to starve?” He had seen how well off his hardworking white neighbors were—the lawyer just had to argue in court and somehow got money and respect. So, the man thought, “I’ll go into business and make baskets—that’s something I can do.” He thought making the baskets was enough, and then the white people would want to buy them. But he hadn’t realized he needed to make the baskets so good or useful that people would actually want to buy them, or make something else people wanted more.

I also made something like a basket, delicate and fine, but I didn’t make it good enough for anyone to want to buy it. Still, I thought it was worth my time to make it. Instead of trying to figure out how to sell it, I tried to avoid having to sell it at all. The life people call successful is only one kind of life.
