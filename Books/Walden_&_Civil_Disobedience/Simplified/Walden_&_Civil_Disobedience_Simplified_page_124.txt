After working in the morning, either hoeing or maybe reading and writing, I usually took another bath in the pond. I would swim across one of its little bays for a while and wash off the dust from working or smooth out any wrinkles that studying had made. Then, I was free for the afternoon.

Every day or two, I walked to the village to hear some gossip, which was always happening there. The news spread from person to person or from newspaper to newspaper. Getting a little bit of gossip was actually refreshing, kind of like hearing leaves rustle or frogs croak. 

Just like I walked in the woods to see birds and squirrels, I walked in the village to watch the men and boys. Instead of the wind in the trees, I heard carts rattling. One way from my house, there were muskrats living in the river meadows. The other way, near some elm and buttonwood trees, was a village full of busy men. They looked as curious to me as prairie dogs, sitting outside their homes or running over to a neighbor to gossip. I went there often to watch what they did.

The village felt like a big news center. On one side, they sold nuts, raisins, salt, meal, and other groceries to support it. Some people loved the news so much and had such strong nerves that they could sit outside forever without moving, letting the gossip flow through them like a soft breeze or a gentle drug. Otherwise, some of the news would be painful to hear, but it didnâ€™t bother them.

Almost every time I walked through the village, I saw a group of these people sitting on a ladder in the sun, leaning forward and looking around with a pleased expression. Others leaned against barns with their hands in their pockets, like columns holding the building up. Because they were usually outside, they heard whatever was going on around them. These were the rough places where all the gossip was first broken down and mixed before it was passed on inside to others.
