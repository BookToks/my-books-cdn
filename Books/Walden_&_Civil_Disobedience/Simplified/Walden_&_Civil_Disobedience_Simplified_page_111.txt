“Satisfied!” he said. “Some people are happy with one thing, and others with something else.

One guy, if he has enough, might be happy just sitting all day with his back to the fire and his belly full, by George!” But no matter what I tried, I couldn’t get him to think about deeper or spiritual stuff. The best he seemed to understand was simple practical things, like an animal might. And that’s true for most people. If I suggested he change his life, he just said it was too late, without feeling sorry. Still, he really believed in being honest and other good values.

There was a little bit of originality in him, though, and sometimes I saw he was thinking for himself and saying his own ideas. That’s so rare that I’d walk ten miles just to see it. It was like starting fresh with many of society’s rules. Even if he wasn’t clear or confident, he always had a decent thought behind what he said. But his ideas were pretty basic and focused on survival, so they rarely grew into anything big. He thought maybe there are smart people even in the lowest, poorest parts of life, who always see things their own way or don’t try to understand much at all. They might seem dark or confusing but could be deep, like people thought Walden Pond was.

Many travelers went out of their way to visit me and my house. They usually asked for a glass of water as an excuse. I told them I drank from the pond and showed them where it was, even offering to lend a dipper.

Even though I lived far away, I wasn’t spared from the yearly visitors who come around early April when everyone starts moving about. I got some good luck too, but some visitors were really strange. Half-witted men from poorhouses and other places came to see me. I tried to get them to use all their smarts and tell me their stories. We talked about their cleverness, and I felt like I got something out of it. Actually, some of them were wiser than the so-called leaders and officials of the town, and I thought it was time to switch things up.
