From what I’ve seen, the same thing happens at White Pond.

Walden Pond’s water level goes up and down over long periods. When the water stays really high for a year or more, it’s hard to walk around the pond. But this high water kills the small trees and bushes that grew near the edge since the last time the water was high. When the water goes back down, the shore is left clear. Unlike ponds that have daily tides, Walden’s shore is cleanest when the water is low.

Near my house, a row of pitch pines about fifteen feet tall died and fell over, like someone pushed them with a big stick. This stopped the trees from taking over more land. The size of these trees shows how long it’s been since the water last rose that high. Because the pond’s water level changes like this, it keeps control of its shore, so the trees can’t claim it as their own. It’s like the pond’s lips that don’t grow a beard because it “licks” them now and then. When the water is high, alders, willows, and maples grow long red roots in the water from their trunks, trying to stay alive. I’ve even seen blueberry bushes near the shore, which usually don’t make fruit, produce lots of berries when the water is high.

Some people have wondered how the shore got so neatly covered with stones.

People in my town have heard an old story. The oldest folks say they heard it when they were young. The story says that a long time ago, Native Americans were having a powwow on a hill nearby. The hill was as tall as the pond is deep now. The story says they used bad language, which is strange because Native Americans usually didn’t do that. While they were talking, the hill shook and suddenly sank, leaving only one old woman named Walden alive. The pond was named after her. Some think the stones on the shore rolled down from the hill when it sank.

We know for sure that there wasn’t a pond here before, but now there is one. This old story doesn’t conflict with what an early settler told me. He remembered when he first came here with a special rod to find water. He saw a thin mist rising from the ground and the rod pointed down, so he decided to dig a well.

About the stones, many people think they can’t just be from waves hitting the hills. But I’ve noticed the nearby hills have lots of the same stones. People even had to pile stones into walls along the railroad near the pond. Also, the shore has the most stones where it’s steep. So, sadly, it’s not really a mystery to me anymore.
