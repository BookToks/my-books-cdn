If everything were as it seems, and people controlled the elements for good reasons! If the smoke over the engine came from brave actions, or was as helpful as the mist over the farmer’s fields, then Nature and the elements would happily help people on their journeys and be their guides.

I watch the morning trains like I watch the sunrise, which isn’t much more regular. Their clouds stretch far behind them, rising higher and higher, going up to the sky while the trains go to Boston. The clouds block the sun for a moment and cast the faraway fields in shadow. It’s like a heavenly show, and the small trains on the ground look tiny in comparison.

The train’s caretaker gets up early on winter mornings, guided by the stars in the mountains, to feed and prepare his train. Fire is also started early to give the train the energy it needs to move. If this work were as innocent as it starts! When there’s deep snow, they put on special shoes and use a big plow to clear a path from the mountains to the coast. The trains then spread people and goods all over the country like a farmer planting seeds.

All day, the fiery train speeds over the land, stopping only so its driver can rest. I hear its loud steps and defiant snorts at midnight, somewhere deep in the woods, fighting the cold ice and snow. It only gets back to its stall when the morning star appears, ready to start traveling again without rest or sleep. Or maybe, in the evening, I hear it blowing off extra energy in its stable, calming down for a few hours of hard sleep. If this work were as heroic and powerful as it is long and tireless!

Far away in quiet woods at the edges of towns, where only hunters used to go during the day, bright trains now rush through at night without the locals knowing. One moment they stop at a busy station full of people, the next they’re passing through the dark swamps, scaring owls and foxes. The coming and going of trains now mark the important times in village life. They run so regularly and on time, and their whistles can be heard from far away, that farmers set their clocks by them. So one well-run system controls a whole country.
