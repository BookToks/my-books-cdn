No, you don’t—chickaree—chickaree. They didn’t listen to my reasons or didn’t understand how strong they were, and started saying things that couldn’t be ignored.

The first sparrow of spring! The year beginning with more hope than ever! You could hear soft, silver-like songs from the bluebird, the song sparrow, and the red-wing over the mostly bare, wet fields, as if the last bits of winter were gently falling! At a time like this, what do histories, dates, traditions, or written stories matter? The brooks sing happy songs to the spring. The marsh hawk flying low over the meadow is already looking for the first slimy creatures waking up. You can hear the melting snow dripping in all the little valleys, and the ice is quickly disappearing from the ponds.

The grass lights up the hillsides like a spring fire—“and first the grass grows after the early rains”—as if the earth was sending out heat to welcome the returning sun. The fire isn’t yellow but green—the color of life. The grass blade, like a long green ribbon, grows from the ground into summer. Frost might stop it sometimes, but soon it pushes up again, lifting last year’s dry grass with new life below. It grows as steadily as a small stream flows from the ground. It’s almost the same because in June, when the streams dry up, the grass blades act like channels for water. Year after year, animals drink from this green stream, and farmers cut it early for winter food. Just like grass, human life dies down to its roots but still grows new green blades toward forever.

Walden Pond is melting quickly. There is a strip of water two rods wide along the north and west sides, and even wider at the east end. A big piece of ice has broken off from the main ice. I hear a song sparrow singing from the bushes on the shore—olit, olit, olit—chip, chip, chip, che char—che wiss, wiss, wiss. He is helping to break the ice too. The big smooth curves on the edge of the ice are beautiful, matching the shore but more even! The ice is very hard because it was cold recently but only for a short time, and it looks like a palace floor with water patterns. But the wind slides over its dull surface without moving it until it reaches the open water beyond. It’s amazing to see this strip of water shining in the sun, the clear pond full of life and energy, like it’s showing the joy of the fish inside and the sands on its shore—a shiny glow like fish scales, as if the whole pond was one lively fish. This is how winter and spring are different.
