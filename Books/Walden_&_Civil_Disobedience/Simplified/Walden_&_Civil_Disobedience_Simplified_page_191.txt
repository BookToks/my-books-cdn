Now, there’s only a small dent in the ground where these homes used to be, with old cellar stones buried underneath. Strawberries, raspberries, thimble-berries, hazelbushes, and sumachs grow in the sunny grass there. Some twisted pine or oak tree stands where the chimney once was, and maybe a sweet-smelling black-birch waves where the doorstep used to be. Sometimes you can see a dip where a spring once flowed; now it’s just dry grass, or it might be covered by a flat stone hidden under the grass, placed there when the last person left. Covering up wells must have been a sad thing, like hiding tears. These dents in the ground, like empty fox holes, are all that’s left where people once lived and talked about big ideas. But all I can find out is that “Cato and Brister pulled wool,” which isn’t much more interesting than other old stories.

The lively lilac bush still grows, even after the door, lintel, and sill have disappeared. Every spring, it blooms sweet-smelling flowers that travelers can pick. It was once planted and cared for by children in front yards, but now it stands by old walls in quiet fields, making room for new forests. It’s the last of its family. The children who planted it probably never thought that the small plant they put in the ground, watching it every day, would grow so big, outlive them, and still tell their story to someone passing by fifty years later, blooming just as beautifully as the first spring.

I notice its soft, friendly, and cheerful lilac colors.

But why did this small village, which could have grown into something bigger, fail while Concord kept going? Didn’t it have any advantages, like water? Yes, there’s deep Walden Pond and cool Brister’s Spring—good places to drink plenty of healthy water, though the people didn’t do much to improve them. They all seemed to be a thirsty bunch.

Couldn’t businesses like basket-making, broom-making, mat-making, corn-parching, linen-spinning, and pottery have done well here, making the wilderness bloom and leaving many descendants to inherit the land? The poor soil might have even kept people strong. Sadly, the memory of these people doesn’t make the land any more beautiful.
