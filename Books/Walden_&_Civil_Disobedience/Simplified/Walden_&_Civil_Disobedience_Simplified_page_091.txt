Their job is gone too. They aren’t as loyal or smart as they used to be.

They will sneak back to their homes feeling ashamed, or maybe run wild and join up with wolves and foxes. Just like that, your peaceful life is gone. But the bell rings, and I have to get off the tracks and let the trains pass—What does the railroad mean to me?

I never go to see where it ends.

It fills some empty spots, helps swallows build nests, moves the sand around, and makes blackberries grow, but I cross it like a small path in the woods. I don’t want my eyes hurt or my ears bothered by its smoke, steam, and loud noises.

Now that the trains have passed and the busy world has moved on, and the fish in the pond don’t feel the train’s rumble anymore, I feel more alone than ever. For the rest of the afternoon, my thoughts are only interrupted by the quiet sound of a carriage or wagon far away on the road.

Sometimes, on Sundays, I hear the bells from Lincoln, Acton, Bedford, or Concord when the wind blows right. The sound is soft, sweet, and feels natural, like it belongs in the wilderness. Far away over the woods, the sound seems to hum like the pine needles are strings on a huge harp. All sounds heard from very far away feel the same way, like a universal music. It’s like the air changes a faraway hill into a pretty blue color for our eyes.

The sound that reaches me has been shaped by the air and has talked to every leaf and pine needle in the forest. This part of the sound that the wind carries and echoes from valley to valley is special. The echo isn’t just a copy of the bell; it’s partly the voice of the forest itself, as if a forest spirit is singing the same simple words and notes.
