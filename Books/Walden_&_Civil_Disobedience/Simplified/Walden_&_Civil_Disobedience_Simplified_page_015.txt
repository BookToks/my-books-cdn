How can a person be a thinker and not take care of their energy in better ways than others?

When someone is warmed up by the different ways I have talked about, what do they want next? Surely not more of the same warmth, like more and richer food, bigger and fancier houses, nicer and more clothes, more and hotter fires, and things like that. When they have what they need to live, there is another choice besides getting extra stuff; they can start to enjoy life now, taking a break from hard work. The ground is good for the seed because it has sent its root down, and now it can confidently send its shoot up. Why has a person planted themselves so firmly on the earth, if not to grow upward toward the sky? The best plants are valued for the fruit they grow up high, in the air and light, far from the ground, and are not treated like the smaller plants, which are only grown for their roots and often cut down before they flower.

I am not trying to give advice to strong and brave people who do their own thing, whether in good or bad times, and maybe live bigger and spend more than the richest without ever running out of money, if such people even exist. I am not talking to those who find joy and motivation in the way things are now and love it like a crush—I count myself a little in this group. I am not speaking to those who are busy and know if they are using their time well or not. I am mostly talking to the many people who are unhappy and complain about how hard their life or the times are, when they could actually make things better. Some complain loudly and sadly because they say they are doing their duty. I also think about the people who seem rich but are really poor—they have gathered a lot of money or things but don’t know how to use or get rid of them, and so they have made their own golden or silver chains.

If I tried to explain how I wanted to live my life in the past years, it would probably surprise readers who know some of my story; it would definitely shock those who know nothing about it.
