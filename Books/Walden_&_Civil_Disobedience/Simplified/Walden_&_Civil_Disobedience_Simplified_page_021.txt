Our moulting season, like that of birds, must be a big change in our lives. The loon goes to quiet ponds to spend this time alone. The snake sheds its skin, and the caterpillar drops its old coat as it grows from inside. Clothes are just the outer layer of our body. If we don’t change, we might end up pretending to be someone we’re not, and people will see through it and lose respect for us.

We put on layer after layer of clothes, like plants that grow by adding from the outside. Our outside clothes are like a fake skin that doesn’t really belong to us and can be taken off without harm. Our thicker clothes we wear all the time are like the outer part of our body. But our shirts are like the real bark of a tree, which can’t be taken off without hurting us. I think all people wear something like a shirt sometimes. It’s good to dress simply so we can find ourselves easily, even in the dark, and live in a way that if trouble comes, like an enemy taking over, we can leave without fear or worry.

One thick piece of clothing is usually as good as three thin ones, and cheap clothes can be bought at prices that fit most budgets. A thick coat can cost five dollars and last years, thick pants two dollars, boots one and a half dollars, a summer hat twenty-five cents, and a winter cap about sixty-two cents or you can make one cheaply at home. So, who is too poor to wear such clothes they earn themselves and still be respected by wise people?

When I ask for a certain style of clothes, my tailor tells me seriously, “They don’t make them like that anymore,” without stressing “They,” like it’s an unchangeable rule, as if some powerful force decided it. It’s hard to get exactly what I want because she can’t believe I really mean it. When I hear this, I think deeply about who “They” are, how they’re connected to me, and what power they have over something so personal to me. In the end, I want to answer her just as mysteriously, saying, “It’s true, they didn’t make them like that before, but now they do.”
