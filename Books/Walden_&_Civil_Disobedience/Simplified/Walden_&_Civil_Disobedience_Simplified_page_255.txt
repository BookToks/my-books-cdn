If a plant can’t live the way it’s supposed to, it dies; and the same goes for a person.

The night in prison was new and kind of interesting. The prisoners, wearing just their shirts, were chatting and enjoying the cool evening air by the door when I came in. But the jailer said, “Come on, guys, it’s time to lock up,” so they all left, and I heard their footsteps as they went back inside.

The jailer introduced my roommate to me as “a great guy and a smart man.” When the door was locked, he showed me where to hang my hat and explained how things worked there. The rooms were cleaned and painted once a month, and this one was probably the cleanest and simplest room in town. He naturally wanted to know where I was from and why I was there; after I told him, I asked him the same because I thought he was honest—and I think he really was. “Why,” he said, “they say I burned a barn, but I never did.” From what I figured out, he probably fell asleep drunk in a barn and smoked his pipe there, which started the fire. He was known as a clever guy, had been there about three months waiting for his trial, and would have to wait even longer. But he was used to it and okay with it since he didn’t have to pay for food and thought he was treated well.

He had one window, and I had the other. I saw that if you stayed there a long time, your main job would be to look out the window. I quickly read all the pamphlets left there, checked out where past prisoners had tried to escape, and heard stories about the people who had been in that room. Even in jail, there was gossip and history that didn’t spread outside. This was probably the only place in town where people wrote poems that were printed as little booklets but never published. I was shown a long list of poems written by some young men caught trying to escape, who got back at the jail by writing songs about it.

I asked my roommate as many questions as I could since I might not see him again. Finally, he showed me my bed and left me to blow out the lamp.
