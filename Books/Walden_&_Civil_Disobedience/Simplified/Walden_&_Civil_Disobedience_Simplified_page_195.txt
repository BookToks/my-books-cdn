He always talks and acts like things are better than most people realize, and he’ll be the last person to feel let down as time goes on. He doesn’t care much about the present. Even though people don’t pay much attention to him now, when his time comes, surprising rules will take effect, and family leaders and rulers will come to him for advice. “How blind are those who can’t see calmness!” He’s a true friend to people, almost the only one who helps human progress. He’s like an Old Mortality, or better yet, an Immortality, patiently and faithfully showing the image stamped in people’s bodies—the God they are only imperfect copies of. With his open mind, he welcomes kids, poor people, crazy people, and smart scholars, thinking about all of them and often adding some kindness and style.

I think he should have a place on the world’s main road where philosophers from everywhere can stay. His sign would say, “Welcome to people, but not their animals. Come if you have time and a calm mind, and really want to find the right path.” He’s probably the sanest person I know, with the fewest odd ideas; he’s the same person yesterday and tomorrow. Long ago, we walked and talked, leaving the world behind because he belonged to no group, he was free and honest. Wherever we looked, it felt like the sky and earth had come together because he made the view even more beautiful. He’s like a man in a blue robe, whose best home is the wide sky that reflects his calmness. I don’t think he can ever die; Nature needs him too much.

We each had some pieces of dry wood to carve, sitting and whittling them while admiring the smooth, yellowish grain of the pumpkin pine. We moved carefully and respectfully, or worked together so smoothly that the ideas we thought about weren’t scared away, and didn’t fear any watcher nearby. Instead, they came and went like the clouds floating in the western sky or the shiny pearl-like shapes that sometimes form and fade there. We worked on old stories, fixed some parts, and built dreamy castles in the air that had no real place on earth. Talking with the Great Looker and Great Expecter was like a special New England night’s entertainment. Ah! Such talks we had—the hermit, the philosopher, and the old settler I told you about—the three of us. Our talks were so powerful they shook my little house; it was hard to say how much pressure was on every inch of the roof. The seams opened up and had to be sealed again with boring work to stop the leaks—I had already done enough of that.
