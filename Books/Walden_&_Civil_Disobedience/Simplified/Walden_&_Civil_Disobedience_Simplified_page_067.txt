A person who doesn’t believe that every day has a special, fresh, and important moment they haven’t wasted yet is giving up on life and heading down a dark path. After he takes a break from his physical desires, a person’s soul, or more like its parts, gets stronger every day, and his true self tries again to live a good life. Most important and unforgettable things happen in the morning and during that early time. The Vedas say, “All minds wake up with the morning.” Poetry, art, and the best actions of people come from this time. All poets and heroes, like Memnon, are children of the dawn and create their best work at sunrise. If your strong and flexible mind matches the sun’s rise, your whole day feels like morning. It doesn’t matter what the clock says or what other people are doing. Morning is when I’m awake and feel new inside. Changing for the better means trying to wake up from sleep. Why do people say their day was bad if they weren’t sleeping? They’re actually pretty smart. If they weren’t sleepy, they would have done something. Many people are awake enough to do physical work, but only a few are awake enough to think deeply, and even fewer live a creative or spiritual life. Being awake means being alive. I’ve never met a person who was fully awake. How could I have looked them in the eye?

We need to learn how to wake up again and stay awake, not by using machines or tricks, but by always hoping for a new beginning, even when we’re sleeping deeply. The best thing I know is that people can improve their lives by trying hard and being aware. It’s great to be able to paint a picture or carve a statue and make a few things beautiful, but it’s even better to change the way we see everything around us, which we can do by how we live. Changing the feeling of the day is the highest kind of art. Everyone should try to make their life, even the small parts, worthy of their best and most thoughtful moments. If we stop wasting what little knowledge we have, life would clearly show us how to do this.

I went to the woods because I wanted to live carefully, to face only the most important truths of life, and see if I could learn what life had to teach me, so that when I died, I wouldn’t find out I hadn’t really lived.
