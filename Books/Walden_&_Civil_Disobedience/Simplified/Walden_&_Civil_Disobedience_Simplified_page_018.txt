Why should we make one thing seem way more important than others?

I found out that my neighbors weren’t going to give me any space in the courthouse or any job anywhere else, so I had to figure things out on my own. I decided to focus more on the woods, where people knew me better. I planned to start a business right away, even though I didn’t have much money. I wasn’t going to Walden Pond to live super cheap or super expensive, but to get some private work done with as few problems as possible. It seemed silly, not sad, to get stuck just because I lacked some common sense, courage, or business skills.

I’ve always tried to be very serious about business habits because everyone needs them. If you’re trading with China, then a small office on the coast, like in Salem harbor, is enough. You’d sell things the country makes, like ice, pine wood, and some granite, all shipped in local boats. These deals would be good.

You’d have to handle everything yourself—be the pilot, captain, owner, and insurance all at once. You’d buy, sell, keep track of money, read every letter you get, and write or read every letter you send. You’d make sure imports unload correctly, day and night, and be present at many parts of the coast at once. Sometimes the best shipments arrive on the New Jersey shore. You’d have to watch the sea like a telegraph, spotting all ships moving along the coast. You’d keep goods moving steadily to supply a faraway market that charges high prices.

You’d stay updated on market conditions, news about wars or peace everywhere, and predict how trade and civilization might change. You’d use the results of new explorations, find new routes, and use all the latest navigation tools. You’d study maps, know where reefs and new lights are, and always check your calculations because one small mistake can cause a ship to crash on a rock instead of reaching a safe harbor—like what happened to the explorer La Perouse.

You’d keep up with science, learn from great explorers, adventurers, and merchants, from ancient times to now. And you’d regularly check your stock to know how your business is doing. It’s a tough job that challenges your mind with problems about profit and loss, interest, weights and measures, and all kinds of calculations that require a wide range of knowledge.
