When I look at one side, the bank doesn’t move—the sun hits it first—and on the other side, there are thick, green plants that seem to have grown in just an hour. It feels like I’m in the studio of the Artist who made the world and me. It’s like I’m watching him still working, playfully spreading new designs on this bank. I feel closer to the core of the earth because the sandy area looks like a bunch of leaves inside a living body. Even in the sand, you can see a hint of a leaf. It makes sense that the earth shows itself in leaves because that’s how it works inside. The tiny parts of the earth already follow this rule and are full of it.

The leaf hanging over the bank shows what it started from. Inside the earth or an animal, it’s like a soft, wet part, like the liver or lungs, or thick leaves with fat. Outside, it’s a dry, thin leaf, just like how the letters f and v come from a dried b sound. The word “lobe” comes from soft sounds like lb, where the b is soft and the l pushes it forward. In the word “globe,” the g adds a throat sound. Bird feathers and wings are even drier and thinner leaves.

You can see how a fat worm in the ground turns into a light, fluttering butterfly. The earth keeps changing itself and grows wings as it moves. Even ice starts as delicate leaf-shaped crystals, like water plants left their mark on the surface of water. A whole tree is actually just one big leaf, and rivers are huge leaves filled with earth. Towns and cities are like insect eggs hidden in the branches.

When the sun goes down, the sand stops moving. But in the morning, the streams start again, splitting into many smaller streams. Here you can maybe see how blood vessels form. If you watch closely, you’ll see softened sand pushing forward from the melting area with a drop-shaped tip, like a fingertip, slowly feeling its way down. As the sun gets warmer and the sand gets wetter, the most liquid part breaks away and makes a winding channel or artery. Inside it, a little shiny stream flashes like lightning from one group of soft leaves or branches to another, sometimes disappearing into the sand.
