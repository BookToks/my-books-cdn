I know a couple of families in this town who have wanted to sell their houses on the edge of town and move into the village for almost a generation, but they haven’t been able to do it. Only death will finally free them.

Most people can finally own or rent modern houses with all the new features. While our houses have gotten better, people haven’t always improved the same way. We have built fancy homes, but it’s not so easy to make people noble or kingly. If a civilized person spends most of their life just trying to get basic needs and comforts, why should they have a better house than someone less advanced?

But what about the poor? Maybe, as some people live much better than before, others have gotten worse. When one group lives in luxury, another group’s poverty gets worse. On one side, there are palaces; on the other, there are poorhouses and the “silent poor.” The many people who built the pyramids for the Pharaohs ate simple food like garlic and probably didn’t get a proper burial. The builder who finishes a palace might go home to a hut worse than a simple shelter. It’s wrong to think that in a country with signs of civilization, many people aren’t living as badly as savages. I’m talking about the very poor, not the rich who have fallen. You can see this in the shacks along our railroads, the newest thing in civilization. I see people living in dirty places with open doors in winter just for light, often with no wood to keep warm. Their bodies shrink from the cold and misery, and their growth and abilities suffer. It’s fair to look at the people whose work makes all these modern things possible. This is also true, in different ways, for workers in England, which is known as the big factory of the world.
