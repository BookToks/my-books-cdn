When I came close without being careful, I scared them. They splashed and moved their tails like someone brushing the water with a stick, then quickly swam down deep. After a while, the wind got stronger, the mist got thicker, and the waves started to get bigger. The perch jumped higher than before, half out of the water, and lots of them, about three inches long, appeared above the surface at once. Even as late as December 5th one year, I saw small ripples on the water. I thought it was going to rain hard soon because the air was full of mist. I quickly took my place at the oars and started rowing home. The rain seemed to be getting heavier, but I didn’t feel any drops on my face yet. I was sure I would get soaked. But suddenly, the ripples stopped. They were made by the perch, which got scared by the noise of my oars and swam down deep. I watched their schools slowly disappear, so I ended up having a dry afternoon after all.

An old man who used to visit this pond almost sixty years ago told me that back then, the area around the pond was full of forests. Sometimes he saw the pond filled with ducks and other water birds, and there were many eagles nearby. He came here to fish and used an old log canoe he found on the shore. It was made from two white-pine logs dug out and fastened together, with flat ends. It was clumsy, but it lasted many years until it got full of water and probably sank. He didn’t know who owned it; it just belonged to the pond. He made a rope for his anchor by tying together strips of hickory bark. Another old man, a potter who lived near the pond before the American Revolution, once told him there was an iron chest at the bottom, and that he had seen it. Sometimes it would float up to the shore, but if you went near, it would sink back into deep water and disappear. I liked hearing about the old log canoe, which replaced an Indian canoe made of the same material but nicer design. Maybe the wood for that canoe was once a tree on the bank, then fell into the water, floating there for many years, the perfect boat for the lake. I remember when I first looked into the water, I could see many large tree trunks lying on the bottom, either blown over or left on the ice after wood cutting when wood was cheaper. But now, most of those trunks are gone.
