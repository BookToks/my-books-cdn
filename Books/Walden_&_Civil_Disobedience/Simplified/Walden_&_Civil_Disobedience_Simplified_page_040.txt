I think it would be better for students, or anyone who wants to learn, to build their own foundation. A student who avoids hard work to get free time only ends up with a useless kind of free time and misses out on learning from real experience.

“But,” someone might say, “you don’t mean students should work with their hands instead of their brains?” Not exactly, but I mean something similar. They shouldn’t just pretend to live or only study life while others pay for it. They should actually live life fully from the start. How else could young people learn to live better than by trying it out themselves? I think this would challenge their minds as much as math does.

If I wanted a boy to learn about arts and sciences, I wouldn’t just send him to a professor who teaches everything except the art of living. I wouldn’t have him look at the world only through a telescope or microscope without using his own eyes. I wouldn’t have him study chemistry without knowing how bread is made, or mechanics without knowing how people earn a living. I wouldn’t have him discover new moons around Neptune but fail to see his own problems or realize who controls his life. He might get eaten up by dangers around him while focusing on tiny things in a drop of vinegar.

Who would learn more in a month—the boy who made his own jackknife by digging and melting ore and read just enough to do this, or the boy who went to lectures about metal and got a ready-made penknife from his dad? Who would be more likely to cut himself?

When I left college, I was surprised to hear I had studied navigation—yet if I had just taken a boat ride in the harbor, I would have known more. Even poor students learn about political economy, but the real economy of living, which is like philosophy, isn’t seriously taught in our colleges. So while they read famous economists, they might cause their family to go into deep debt without knowing it.
