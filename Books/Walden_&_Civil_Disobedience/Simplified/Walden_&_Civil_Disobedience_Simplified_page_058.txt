I once heard a smart teacher talk about England. After listing famous people like Shakespeare, Bacon, Cromwell, Milton, and Newton, he talked about England’s Christian heroes. Because of his job, he put them way above the others, calling them the greatest. These were Penn, Howard, and Mrs. Fry.

But everyone should see that this isn’t true. These people weren’t England’s best men and women, just maybe the best at helping others.

I don’t want to take away from how great it is to help others, but I want fairness for all people who do good things for the world. I don’t just care about someone being honest and kind, which are like the stem and leaves of a plant. Those parts might be useful but simple, like making herbal tea for sick people, and often used by fake doctors.

I want the best part of a person—the flower and fruit. I want to feel something nice and real from them, to enjoy being around them. Their goodness shouldn’t be just sometimes or hard for them. It should be natural and easy, something they don’t even notice. This kind of kindness can hide many mistakes.

Sometimes, people who help others remind us too much of their own pain and call it caring. But we should share our strength and happiness, not our sadness and sickness, and be careful not to spread bad feelings.

Where do the sad cries come from? Where do the people live who need help? Who is that wild person we want to save? If someone feels bad inside—even just a stomach ache—that’s where they feel sympathy. Then they try to fix the whole world.

Since they see themselves as a small version of the world, they realize, and this is true, that the world is like a big unripe green apple. They worry that people will eat it too soon. So, they work hard to help people far away, like Eskimos, Patagonians, Indians, and Chinese. After some years, while others might use this person for their own goals, the person feels better, and the world seems to grow a little, like the apple starting to ripen. Life becomes less harsh and more sweet to live.
