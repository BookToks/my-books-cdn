But people make a big mistake. The best part of themselves quickly gets used up like compost in the soil. Because of something called necessity, they work hard, as an old book says, to save up things that will eventually get ruined or stolen. It’s a pointless life, and they’ll realize that when it’s almost over, if not sooner. There’s a story that Deucalion and Pyrrha made people by throwing stones over their shoulders: — Inde genus durum sumus, experiensque laborum, Et documenta damus quâ simus origine nati.

Or, like Raleigh put it in a poem — “From there, our kind is tough, facing pain and trouble, showing that our bodies are like stone.” This shows how people blindly follow old rules without seeing where they lead.

Most people, even in free countries, are so busy with fake worries and hard work that they miss out on life’s better things. Their hands get too tired and shaky from working too much to enjoy the finer things. Workers don’t have time to be honest and real every day; they can’t build strong friendships because their work doesn’t pay enough. They have to be like machines. How can they keep learning when they have to use what they already know so much? Sometimes, we should help them with food and clothes and give them a break before we judge them. The best parts of who we are, like the shine on fruit, need gentle care. But we don’t treat ourselves or others that nicely.

Some of you are poor, struggling to live, sometimes barely getting by. I’m sure some reading this can’t pay for all the meals you’ve eaten or the clothes you wear out, and you’re spending borrowed or stolen time reading this, stealing from people you owe. It’s clear many of you live sneaky, hard lives. I’ve seen it through experience: always trying to start a business and pay off debts, stuck in old problems called “other people’s money,” living and dying in debt. Always promising to pay back, but dying without paying; trying to win favor or business by any way except breaking the law; lying, flattering, pretending to be polite or generous just to convince others to give you work or goods; making yourself sick to save something for a sick day, hiding money anywhere—no matter how much or how little.
