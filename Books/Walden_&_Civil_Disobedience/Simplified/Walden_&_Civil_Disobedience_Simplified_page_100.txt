“They make people all over the world clean and improve their hearts, and dress up in their best clothes to honor and give gifts to their ancestors. There are tiny, smart beings everywhere—above us, to our left, to our right; they surround us all around.” We are part of an experiment that really interests me. Can’t we take a break from our noisy friends sometimes and just enjoy our own thoughts? Confucius said, “Goodness doesn’t stay alone; it needs friends around it.” When we think deeply, we can feel like we are outside ourselves in a calm way. With focus, we can step back from what’s happening and watch everything, good or bad, pass by like a fast river. We aren’t completely caught up in Nature. Sometimes, I feel like a piece of wood floating in a stream; other times, I feel like a god watching from the sky. A play or movie might affect me, but a real-life event that should matter might not. I only know myself as a human being—a place for thoughts and feelings—and I feel like there are two parts of me. One part watches quietly, like a stranger, without feeling anything but noticing everything. That watcher isn’t really me, just like it isn’t you. When life’s “play” ends, the watcher leaves. It was just a kind of story or imagination for that watcher. This feeling of being both inside and outside ourselves can sometimes make us bad friends.

I think it’s good to be alone most of the time. Being with people, even nice ones, can get tiring and distract me. I love being by myself. I’ve never found a better friend than being alone. We often feel more lonely around others than when we are in our own rooms. When a person is thinking or working, they are always alone, no matter where they are. Being alone doesn’t depend on how far you are from other people. A hardworking student in a busy college is as alone as a monk in the desert. A farmer can work all day in the fields alone and not feel lonely because he’s busy. But when he comes home at night, he can’t sit alone with his thoughts; he wants to be around people to relax and enjoy himself after his day alone. He wonders how a student can stay alone in a house all day and night without feeling sad or bored. But the student is still working hard, just in a different way, and also looks for fun and company like the farmer does, just in a more focused way.
