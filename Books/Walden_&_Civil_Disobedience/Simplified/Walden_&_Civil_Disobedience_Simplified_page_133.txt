The shore is made up of a line of smooth, round white stones that look like paving stones, except for one or two small sandy beaches. It is so steep that in many places, you can jump right in and the water will be deeper than you are tall. The water is super clear, so you can see the bottom easily. Some people even think it has no bottom at all. There is no mud anywhere, and if you look quickly, you might think there are no weeds in the water. If you look closer, you’ll find just a few small plants like heart-shaped leaves and some underwater grasses, but no big plants like flags or lilies. These plants are clean and bright, just like the clear water they grow in.

The stones go a little way into the water, then the bottom becomes sandy, except in the deepest spots where some old leaves have settled. Even in winter, some bright green weeds can be found caught on anchors.

There is another pond like this one called White Pond, about two and a half miles west. I know most of the ponds nearby, but none are as pure and special as this one. Many different groups of people have probably drunk from it, admired it, and studied it over time, but its water stays clear and green just like always. It’s not a pond that dries up!

Maybe even when Adam and Eve were sent out of the Garden of Eden, Walden Pond was already here. Back then, it might have been breaking up in the spring rain with mist and a warm wind, full of ducks and geese who didn’t know what had happened. Even then, the pond went up and down, kept its water clear, and had the same beautiful color. It’s like it has a special seal from heaven to be the one and only Walden Pond in the world, collecting pure dew from the sky.

Who knows how many old stories and legends have named this the magical Castalian Fountain? Or what water spirits watched over it long ago? It’s a precious gem that the town of Concord proudly wears like a crown.
