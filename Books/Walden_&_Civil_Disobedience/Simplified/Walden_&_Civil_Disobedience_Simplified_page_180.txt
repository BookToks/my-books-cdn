The bubble was completely in the lower ice but right next to the upper ice. It was flat or maybe a little lens-shaped, with a rounded edge, about a quarter of an inch deep and four inches across. I was surprised to see that right under the bubble, the ice had melted evenly in the shape of an upside-down saucer, rising about five eighths of an inch in the middle. There was a thin layer left between the water and the bubble, less than an eighth of an inch thick. In many spots, tiny bubbles in this layer had popped downward, so under the biggest bubbles—some as big as a foot across—there might not have been any ice at all. I figured that the countless tiny bubbles I first saw stuck to the bottom of the ice had now frozen in place too. Each one acted like a little magnifying glass, melting and weakening the ice underneath. These tiny air pockets are like little air guns that help make the ice crack and pop.

Finally, winter really started just as I finished putting plaster on my house. The wind began to howl around the house like it hadn’t been allowed to before. Night after night, geese came flying in the dark with loud noises and flapping wings, even after the ground was covered in snow. Some landed in Walden, and others flew low over the woods toward Fair Haven, heading for Mexico. Several times, when I was coming back from the village late at night, I heard the footsteps of a flock of geese or ducks on dry leaves in the woods near a pond behind my home. They had come to feed, and I could hear the quiet honk or quack of their leader as they hurried away. 

In 1845, Walden Pond froze completely for the first time on the night of December 22, while shallower ponds and the river had been frozen for ten days or more. In 1846, it froze on December 16; in 1849, around December 31; in 1850, about December 27; in 1852, on January 5; and in 1853, on December 31. Snow had already covered the ground since November 25, suddenly surrounding me with the look of winter. I pulled back even more into my home and tried to keep a bright fire burning both inside my house and inside myself. My outdoor job now was to gather dead wood from the forest, carrying it in my hands or on my shoulders, or sometimes dragging a dead pine tree under each arm to my woodshed. An old forest fence that had seen better days was a big load for me. I gave it up to Vulcan, the god of fire, since it was no longer useful as a boundary marker.
