It’s time for villages to become like universities, where older people, if they have free time, can keep learning new things for their whole lives. Should the world only have one Paris or one Oxford forever? Can’t students live here and get a good education outside, in places like Concord? Can’t we find a smart teacher like Abelard to teach us? Sadly, no.

Because we have to take care of animals and run shops, we don’t get to spend enough time learning, and our education suffers. In this country, villages should be like the rich nobles in Europe, supporting art and culture. Villages have enough money; they just need the generosity and good taste to spend it on important things. People think it’s unrealistic to spend money on education and culture, even though smarter people know it’s way more valuable.

This town spent seventeen thousand dollars on a town hall, which is good, but it probably won’t spend that much on real knowledge and learning for a hundred years. The money spent each year on a Lyceum, a place for talks and learning in winter, is better used than any other money raised here. If we live in the 19th century, why shouldn’t we enjoy what the 19th century offers? Why should our lives be small and limited?

If we read newspapers, why only read local gossip? Why not get the best newspaper in the world right away? Why settle for boring local papers? Let’s get news from all the smart groups everywhere and see what they know. Why should we let publishers pick what we read? Just like rich nobles surround themselves with things that help them learn and grow—like books, art, music, and science tools—our villages should do the same. We shouldn’t stop at just having a teacher, preacher, or a small library like our ancestors did when they survived tough winters.

Working together is how our society is built, and I’m sure that since we are better off now, we have more resources than those nobles did. New England can hire all the smartest teachers in the world, pay for their stay, and not be stuck in a small town mindset. That’s the kind of school we want. Instead of having nobles, let’s have villages full of smart, noble people.
