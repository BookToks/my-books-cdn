An old-fashioned man would have gone crazy or died of boredom before this. There weren’t even any rats in the walls because they were either starved or never attracted here.  

Instead, there were squirrels on the roof and under the floor, a whippoorwill sitting on the ridge pole, a blue-jay screaming under the window, and a hare or woodchuck hiding under the house. There was also a screech-owl or a catowl behind it, wild geese or a laughing loon on the pond, and a fox barking at night.  

No larks or orioles, the gentle plantation birds, ever came to my clearing. No roosters crowing or hens clucking in the yard. Actually, there was no yard—just wild nature growing right up to the house.  

A young forest was growing under the meadows, with wild sumac and blackberry vines breaking into the cellar. Strong pine trees were rubbing and creaking against the roof because they didn’t have enough space, and their roots went all the way under the house.  

Instead of a little door or a broken window flap blowing off in a storm, a pine tree might snap or get pulled up by its roots behind the house for firewood. Instead of a path to the front gate during a big snow, there was no gate, no front yard, and no path to the civilized world!
