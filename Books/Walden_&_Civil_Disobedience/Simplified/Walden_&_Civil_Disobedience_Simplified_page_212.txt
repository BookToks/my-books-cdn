They also showed me another spot they thought was a "leach hole," where the pond might be leaking under a hill into a nearby meadow. They even made me stand on a piece of ice to check it out. It was a small hole under ten feet of water. But I’m pretty sure the pond doesn’t need fixing until they find a bigger leak than that. Someone suggested that if a "leach hole" is found, they could prove it connects to the meadow by putting some colored powder or sawdust into the hole and then catching it at the spring in the meadow with a strainer.

While I was measuring, the ice, which was sixteen inches thick, moved up and down like water when the wind blew a little. It’s well known you can’t use a level on ice. One rod away from the shore, the ice moved up and down about three-quarters of an inch when I checked it with a level from the land. The ice looked stuck to the shore but probably moved even more in the middle. Maybe if our tools were super sensitive, we could even feel the earth’s surface moving like that.

When two legs of my level were on the shore and the third was on the ice, tiny changes in the ice’s height made a big difference in how far away a tree across the pond looked. When I started cutting holes to measure the water, there were three or four inches of water on top of the ice under deep snow, which had made the ice sink a bit. But water started flowing into the holes and kept running for two days in deep streams. This wore away the ice around the holes and helped dry up the pond’s surface. The water raised and floated the ice, kind of like making a hole in the bottom of a ship to let water out.

When these holes freeze again, then it rains, and the pond freezes again, the ice looks really cool inside. It gets dark patterns that look like spider webs or ice flowers, made by the water channels flowing toward the center.

Sometimes, when there were shallow puddles on the ice, I saw a double shadow of myself—one shadow on the ice and the other on the trees or hills behind me.
