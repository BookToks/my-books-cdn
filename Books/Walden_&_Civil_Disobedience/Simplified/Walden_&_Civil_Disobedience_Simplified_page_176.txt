The north wind had already started to cool the pond, but it took many weeks of steady blowing because the pond was so deep. When I began to have a fire in the evening, before I plastered my house, the chimney worked really well because there were many gaps between the boards. Still, I enjoyed some happy evenings in that cool and fresh room, surrounded by rough brown boards full of knots, with rafters that still had bark high above me.

My house never looked as nice to me after it was plastered, though I had to admit it was more comfortable. Shouldn't every place where people live be tall enough to have some shadows playing up high on the rafters in the evening? These shapes are more fun to imagine than fancy paintings or expensive furniture. I really started living in my house when I began to use it for warmth as well as shelter. I got a couple of old fire-dogs to hold the wood off the hearth, and it felt good to see soot form on the back of the chimney I built. I poked the fire more proudly than usual.

My house was small, and it could barely hold an echo, but it felt bigger because it was just one room and far from neighbors. All the good things about a house were in that one room; it was the kitchen, bedroom, living room, and dining room all in one. I enjoyed everything that anyone gets from living in a house. Cato says the head of a family should have a rustic home with an oil and wine cellar and many barrels, so it’s nice to be ready for hard times—it’s good for honor and strength. My cellar had a small tub of potatoes, some peas with bugs in them, and on my shelf a little rice, a jug of molasses, and a peck each of rye and cornmeal.

Sometimes I dream of a bigger and busier house from a golden age, made to last, with no fancy decorations, just one big, rough, strong hall with no ceiling or plaster, just bare rafters and beams above—like a low sky to keep out rain and snow. The big posts would stand like kings and queens greeting you after you step inside, passing over the old dust of another time. It would be a huge house where you’d need a torch on a pole to see the roof, where some people live by the fire, some in window nooks, some on benches, some at one end or another, and some even up in the rafters with spiders if they want.

It would be a house you enter by opening the door, and then you’re home; a place where a tired traveler can wash, eat, talk, and sleep without going anywhere else. A shelter you’d be glad to reach on a stormy night, with everything a house needs but no extra stuff. You could see all the treasures at once, and everything would hang on its hook, ready to use. It would be kitchen, pantry, living room, bedroom, storage, and attic all in one. You’d see important things like barrels and ladders, and handy things like cupboards, hear the pot boiling, and respect the fire that cooks your food and the oven that bakes your bread. The useful furniture and tools would be the main decorations.

There wouldn’t be laundry left outside, or the fire left out, or the lady of the house away. Sometimes you might be asked to move off the trap-door when the cook needs to go down to the cellar, so you’d find out if the ground below is solid or hollow just by stepping carefully.
