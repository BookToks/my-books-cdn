I’ll only mention a few of the projects I really cared about.

No matter the weather or time, day or night, I was always eager to make the most of every moment and mark it down. I wanted to stand right where the past and future meet—that’s the present—and stick close to that spot. Some things I say might sound confusing because my work has more secrets than most jobs do. These secrets aren’t kept on purpose; they’re just part of how it is. I wish I could share everything I know and never tell anyone to stay out.

A long time ago, I lost a hunting dog, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove, and I’m still looking for them. I’ve talked to many travelers about them, telling them what signs to look for and what sounds they made. I even met a few people who said they heard the dog, felt the horse’s footsteps, or saw the dove fly behind a cloud. They seemed just as eager to find them as I was.

I tried to be ready not just for the sunrise or dawn, but if possible, for Nature itself! Many mornings, in summer and winter, before anyone else in town was awake, I was already busy with my work. People probably saw me coming back from these early trips—farmers heading to Boston or woodcutters starting their day. I didn’t help the sun rise, but I believed it really mattered to be there when it did.

I spent many autumn and winter days outside town, trying to catch sounds in the wind and deliver news fast. I almost used up all my money doing this, and I even lost my breath running against the wind. If it had anything to do with politics, you could be sure it would have shown up in the newspaper right away. Other times, I watched from high places like cliffs or trees to spot new arrivals or waited on hills at night hoping to catch some big event. I rarely caught anything, and when I did, it disappeared quickly like manna in the sun.

For a long time, I worked as a reporter for a small newspaper whose editor still hasn’t printed most of what I wrote. Like many writers, I mostly got paid only with my effort.

Still, in this case, the hard work was worth it on its own.
