The winds that blew past my home were like the ones that rush over mountain tops, carrying broken pieces or heavenly parts of earth’s music. The morning wind always blows, and the song of creation never stops; but only a few people can actually hear it. Olympus is just the surface of the earth everywhere.

Before this, the only house I owned besides a boat was a tent, which I used sometimes in the summer for trips. That tent is still rolled up in my attic. The boat, however, passed from person to person and eventually disappeared over time. With this stronger shelter around me now, I was starting to feel more settled in the world. This simple frame around me was like a shape forming, and it affected me too. It felt a bit like a picture made with just outlines. I didn’t have to go outside to get fresh air because the air inside was still fresh. It wasn’t really inside, but more like sitting just behind a door, even when it rained. The Harivansa says, “A home without birds is like food without flavor.” My home wasn’t like that because suddenly I was living close to birds—not by catching one, but by putting myself near them. I was close not only to the usual garden and orchard birds but also to wild, exciting singers of the forest that rarely sing near villages—birds like the wood-thrush, veery, scarlet tanager, field-sparrow, whippoorwill, and many others.

I sat by a small pond about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and a bit higher than it. I was in a big forest between Concord and Lincoln, and about two miles south of the famous Concord Battle Ground. But I was so deep in the woods that the farthest thing I could see was the other side of the pond, half a mile away, covered with trees like everywhere else. During the first week, every time I looked at the pond, it seemed like a small lake high up on a mountain, sitting much higher than other lakes around. As the sun rose, I saw it shedding its night-time mist, and little by little, its soft ripples or smooth reflections appeared. The mists, like ghosts, quietly faded into the woods, like a secret night meeting ending. Even the dew stayed on the trees longer than usual, just like it does on mountain sides.
