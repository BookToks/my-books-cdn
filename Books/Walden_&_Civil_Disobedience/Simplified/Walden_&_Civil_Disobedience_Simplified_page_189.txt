We finally left without causing any trouble and went back to sleep and to reading Gondibert. But about Gondibert, I only disagree with the part in the introduction that says wit is like the soul’s powder—“but most people don’t get wit, just like Indians didn’t know about powder.” 

The next night, around the same time, I walked through the fields again. I heard a soft moaning sound and got closer in the dark. I found the only survivor of the family I know, the one who inherited both their good and bad traits. He was lying on his stomach, looking over the cellar wall at the still burning ashes below, quietly talking to himself like he usually does. 

He had been working far away in the river meadows all day and used the first free moment to visit his old family home. He looked into the cellar from every angle, always lying down as if he was searching for some hidden treasure he remembered. But there was nothing there, just bricks and ashes. Since the house was gone, he looked closely at what was left. 

He felt comforted by my quiet company and showed me, as well as the dark allowed, where the well was covered up. Luckily, it could never burn. He also felt along the wall to find the well-sweep his father had made and attached, searching for the iron hook where something heavy used to hang. This was all he had left to hold onto to prove it wasn’t just any ordinary “rider.” I felt it too, and I still notice it almost every time I walk by, because it carries the family’s story.

On the left side, where the well and lilac bushes stand by the wall in the now open field, Nutting and Le Grosse lived. But now, let’s get back toward Lincoln.

Further into the woods, closer to the pond, Wyman the potter lived. He made pottery for the people in town and left behind children to take over. They weren’t rich and only lived on the land as long as they were allowed. The sheriff often came to collect taxes but found nothing to take and just “attached a chip” as a formality, as I read in his records, because there was nothing else to grab.
