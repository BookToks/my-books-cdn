A house where the inside is open like a bird’s nest, and you can’t walk from the front door to the back without seeing some of the people who live there. When you visit, you’re given the freedom to go anywhere in the house, not locked away in one small room and told to “make yourself at home” alone.

Today, the host doesn’t invite you to sit with them by the fire. Instead, they have someone build a small fireplace for you far away, maybe in an alley, and being polite means keeping you as far away as possible. The cooking is kept secret like they don’t want you to know what’s really going on, almost like they might be trying to poison you. I’ve been on many people’s property and could have been told to leave, but I don’t think I’ve ever truly been inside someone’s real home. I might visit a king and queen dressed simply, living in a house like I described, if I was near them. But if I ever find myself in a modern fancy palace, I’ll just want to get out as fast as I can.

It feels like the words we use in our living rooms have lost their meaning because our lives are so far away from what they really stand for. The living room is so far from the kitchen and work areas that even dinner is just a pretend dinner, like a story instead of the real thing.
