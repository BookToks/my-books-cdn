The fishermen say that when the pond makes a loud rumbling noise, it scares the fish and stops them from biting. The pond doesn’t rumble every night, and I can’t always tell when it will happen; but even if the weather looks the same to me, the pond knows. Who would think such a big, cold, tough thing could be so sensitive? But it follows its own rules and rumbles exactly when it’s supposed to, just like how buds open in spring. The earth is alive and covered with tiny bumps. The biggest pond reacts to changes in the weather just like a drop of mercury in a thermometer.

One reason I wanted to live in the woods was to have time to watch spring arrive. The ice on the pond starts to get full of holes, and I can press my foot into it while walking.

Fogs, rain, and warmer sun are melting the snow slowly; the days are getting longer; and I realize I won’t need to add more wood for fires because it’s not so cold anymore. I watch carefully for the first signs of spring, like hearing a bird I don’t usually hear, or the chirp of a striped squirrel because it’s almost out of food, or seeing a woodchuck come out of its winter home.

On March 13th, after hearing birds like the bluebird, song-sparrow, and redwing, the ice was still almost a foot thick. As it got warmer, the ice didn’t melt away like in rivers or break up and float off. Instead, the edges near the shore melted about a foot wide, while the middle was full of holes and soaked with water. You could even push your foot through ice that was six inches thick! But by the next evening, after warm rain and fog, the ice would be gone, disappeared with the fog like magic. One year, I walked across the middle of the pond only five days before all the ice was gone. The pond was completely ice-free on different dates each year, like April 1st in 1845, March 25th in 1846, April 8th in 1847, and so on.

Every event about the ice breaking on rivers and ponds and the weather changing is really interesting for people living where the seasons are so different. When warm days come, people near the river hear the ice crack loudly at night, sounding like big explosions, as if the ice chains are breaking. Then, in just a few days, the ice quickly goes away.
