My bean plants, with rows stretching seven miles in total, were ready to be weeded. The earliest beans had grown a lot before I even finished planting the last ones. They really needed attention and couldn’t wait. I didn’t really know why I worked so hard on them, but I started to care about my bean rows, even though I had more than I wanted. They connected me to the earth and gave me strength, like the mythic hero Antæus. But why was I growing these beans? Only God knows.

All summer, my job was to turn this piece of land, which used to only have wild plants like blackberries and johnswort, into a place that grew beans. What will I learn from the beans or what will they teach me? I love them, I weed them, and I watch over them all day long. Their big green leaves look nice. My helpers are the dew and rain that water the dry soil, and the little bit of nutrients in the mostly poor soil. My enemies are worms, cold days, and especially woodchucks. These animals ate a whole quarter of an acre of my beans. But did I really have the right to take over the old home of the johnswort and other plants? Soon, though, the strong beans will be too tough for the animals and will face new challenges.

When I was four, I remember being brought from Boston to my hometown through these woods and fields to the pond. That memory is one of the oldest I have. Tonight, my flute played music that echoed over that very water. The pine trees still stand here, older than me; if some have fallen, I’ve used their stumps to cook, and new trees are growing all around, ready to be seen by new eyes. The same johnswort still grows from the same roots in this pasture, and I have finally helped cover that magical place from my childhood dreams. One result of me being here is seen in these bean leaves, corn stalks, and potato plants.
