The fruits don’t show their real taste to the person who buys them or even to the person who grows them to sell. There is only one way to get the true flavor, but not many people do it. If you want to know what huckleberries really taste like, ask a cowboy or a partridge. It’s wrong to think you’ve tasted huckleberries if you never picked them yourself. Huckleberries never make it to Boston; they haven’t been there since the city was built on its three hills. The best part of the fruit is lost when the bloom gets rubbed off during transport, and then they just become ordinary food. As long as fairness exists, no perfect huckleberry can be taken from the country hills all the way to Boston.

Sometimes, after I finished hoeing for the day, I joined a friend who had been fishing at the pond all morning, sitting still like a duck or a floating leaf. We talked about different ideas, and by the time I got there, he usually decided he was part of an old group called the Cœnobites. There was an older man, a great fisherman and expert in forest skills, who liked to think of my house as a place made for fishermen. I felt the same when he sat at my door fixing his fishing lines. Sometimes, we sat together on the pond, him at one end of the boat and me at the other. We didn’t talk much because he was hard of hearing now, but he hummed a psalm that matched well with my thoughts. Our time together was peaceful and easy, much nicer to remember than if we had talked a lot. When I had no one to talk to, I would hit the side of my boat with a paddle to make sounds echo in the woods. It stirred up the forest like a zookeeper waking wild animals until I heard a growl from every valley and hill nearby.
