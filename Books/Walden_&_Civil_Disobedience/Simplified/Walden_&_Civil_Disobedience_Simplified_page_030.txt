I’d rather sit outside because grass doesn’t get dusty unless people have dug it up.

Rich and lazy people create the styles that everyone else follows. Travelers who stay at fancy places soon see this because the owners think they are super rich, and if they let those owners control everything, they’d lose their strength. I think on trains we spend more on fancy stuff than on safety or comfort. Trains are becoming like fancy living rooms with couches, footstools, sunshades, and lots of other fancy things from faraway places made for pampered people. I’d rather sit alone on a pumpkin than be crowded on a soft cushion. I’d rather ride in an ox cart with fresh air than travel in a fancy train car full of bad air.

Long ago, life was simple and people were like travelers passing through nature. After eating and sleeping, they thought about their journey again. They lived like in a tent, moving through valleys, plains, or mountains.

But now, people have become controlled by their own tools. The person who used to pick fruit when hungry is now a farmer, and the one who once stood under a tree is now a house owner. We don’t camp for a night anymore; we’ve settled down on earth and forgotten about heaven.

We’ve taken Christianity just as a better way to live on earth. We’ve built big family homes for this life and big family graves for the next. The best art shows how people try to escape this low life, but art only makes this life more comfortable and makes us forget about a higher life. There’s no place in this town for fine art because our lives, homes, and streets don’t have a good spot for it. There’s no nail to hang a painting or shelf for a statue of a hero or saint. When I think about how our houses are built and paid for, I’m surprised the floors don’t fall through under visitors looking at the fancy stuff on the mantelpiece and drop them into the cellar, where there’s a strong, honest, and simple foundation.
