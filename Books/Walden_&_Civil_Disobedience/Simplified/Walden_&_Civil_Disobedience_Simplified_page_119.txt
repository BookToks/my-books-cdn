When the noise finally stopped, and the buzzing was gone, and the gentle winds didn’t carry any sound, I knew they had safely brought the last bee into the Middlesex hive. Now, they were focused on the honey that was inside.

I felt proud knowing that the freedom of Massachusetts and our country was in good hands. As I went back to working with my hoe, I felt a strong, happy confidence and worked quietly, trusting the future would be good.

When there were many groups of musicians playing, it sounded like the whole village was one big bellows, making all the buildings shake with noise. But sometimes, a really cool and inspiring song reached the woods, like a trumpet calling for fame. I felt ready to fight a Mexican just for fun—because why should we always put up with small stuff?—and looked around for a woodchuck or a skunk to practice on. The war songs sounded far away, like knights marching on a crusade, and the tops of the elm trees near the village moved a little with the music. It was a great day, even though the sky looked the same as it always did from my spot.

I had a strange experience getting to know beans so well, from planting, hoeing, harvesting, threshing, picking over, and selling them—the last part was the hardest. I even tasted them! I was determined to understand beans. When they were growing, I worked from five in the morning until noon, then spent the rest of the day on other things. I got to know lots of different weeds really well because I had to deal with them over and over while working. I hurt their delicate roots with my hoe, cutting down whole rows of one kind and carefully leaving others alone. That’s Roman wormwood, that’s pigweed, that’s sorrel, that’s piper-grass. I chopped them up, turned their roots to the sun so they wouldn’t grow again. If a weed got any shade, it would turn over and be green again in two days. It was a long battle, not with cranes, but with weeds—the Trojans who had sun, rain, and dew on their side. Every day, the beans saw me come with my hoe, thinning out their enemies and filling the trenches with dead weeds.
