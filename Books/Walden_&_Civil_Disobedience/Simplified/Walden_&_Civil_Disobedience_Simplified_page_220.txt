The alligator comes out of the mud with the earth shaking.

An old man who knows a lot about nature, like he has watched it forever, told me a story. I thought he knew everything about nature, so I was surprised when he said he was amazed by something. One spring day, he took his gun and boat to go duck hunting. There was still ice on the meadows, but the river was clear. He traveled from Sudbury, where he lived, to Fair-Haven Pond, but found most of the pond still covered in thick ice. It was a warm day, so he didn’t expect so much ice to be there.

He didn’t see any ducks, so he hid his boat behind an island and then hid himself in some bushes on the other side to wait. Near the shore, the ice had melted a bit, making a smooth, warm patch of water with a muddy bottom, which ducks like. He thought the ducks would come soon.

After waiting about an hour, he heard a strange, quiet sound far away that grew louder and more powerful. It was a deep roar unlike anything he had ever heard. He thought it was a huge flock of birds coming to land, so he grabbed his gun and got ready. But to his surprise, the sound was actually the ice moving. The whole ice sheet had started to drift toward the shore, grinding and breaking apart as it moved. Pieces of ice were pushed up high on the island before everything finally stopped.

Finally, the sun hits the right angle, warm winds bring mist and rain, and the snowbanks start to melt. The sun shines through the mist, lighting up a patchy landscape of brown and white that smells fresh. Travelers make their way carefully from small patch to patch, cheered by the sounds of many little streams filled with melting snow, carrying away the last bits of winter.
