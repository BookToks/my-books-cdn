People say Mirabeau turned to robbing travelers on the road to see how brave someone had to be to openly break society's most important rules. He said that a soldier fighting in a group doesn’t need as much courage as a robber alone, and that honor and religion don’t stop someone with a strong plan. This sounds tough and brave by the world’s standards, but it was pointless, maybe even hopeless. A wiser person would find themselves breaking society’s “important rules” just by following even more important personal rules, testing their courage without trying so hard. It’s not good to purposely fight against society, but to stand strong wherever life puts you by following your own values, which won’t go against a fair government if you’re lucky enough to have one.

I left the woods for as good a reason as I went there. Maybe I felt like I had many lives to live and couldn’t waste more time on just one. It’s amazing how easily we fall into habits and make the same path again and again. I hadn’t been living there a week before I made a clear path from my door to the pond. Even though it’s been five or six years since I walked it, the path is still easy to see. I’m afraid others may have walked it too, keeping it clear. The ground is soft and changes with each step, just like the paths our minds take. So, the main roads of the world must be very worn out from tradition and people following the crowd! I didn’t want to take a safe, easy route, but to be out on the deck of the world’s ship, where I could see the moonlight on the mountains best. I don’t want to hide below deck now.

From my experience, I learned that if you move confidently toward your dreams and try to live the life you imagine, you’ll find success when you least expect it. You’ll leave some things behind, cross an invisible line; new, freer rules will start to grow around and inside you. Or old rules will change to help you more, and you’ll live with the freedom of a higher kind of person.
