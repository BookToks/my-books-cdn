It’s not cruel just because the printing goes only on the surface and can’t be changed.

I don’t think our factory system is the best way for people to get clothes. The workers’ lives are becoming more like those in England, and it’s not surprising. From what I know, the main goal isn’t to make sure people have good, honest clothes, but to make companies richer. In the end, people only hit what they aim for. So, even if they fail at first, it’s better to aim high.

About shelter, I won’t say it’s not necessary now, though some people have lived without it for a long time in colder places. Samuel Laing says that the Laplander, wearing just skins and a skin bag over his head and shoulders, can sleep on the snow night after night, in cold that would kill someone wearing wool clothes. He saw them sleeping like this. But he adds that they aren’t tougher than other people. Still, humans probably didn’t live long without realizing how useful a house is and the comfort it brings. “Domestic comforts” might have meant the happiness of the house more than the family at first, though these comforts are limited in places where houses are only important during winter or rainy seasons. For most of the year, except needing shade, houses aren’t really needed.

In our climate, houses were mostly just a roof over your head at night in summer. In old Indian records, a wigwam showed a day’s travel, and a line of them carved or painted on trees meant how many times people camped there. Humans weren’t built huge or strong enough to live fully outside, so they needed to make a smaller, safer space that fit them. At first, people were bare and outside, which was nice in warm, sunny weather. But rain, winter, and hot sun would have stopped humans from surviving if they hadn’t quickly found shelter. According to the story, Adam and Eve had a garden bower before they had clothes. Humans wanted a home—a place to be warm and comfortable, first physically, then emotionally.
