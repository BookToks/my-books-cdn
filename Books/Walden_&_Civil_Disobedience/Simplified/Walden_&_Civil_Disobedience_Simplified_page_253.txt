This is really tough. It makes it impossible for a person to live honestly and still have a comfortable life on the outside. It’s not worth trying to gather a lot of stuff, because it will just be taken away. You have to rent or live somewhere without owning it, grow just a little food, and eat it quickly. You have to rely on yourself, always ready to move, and not get involved in too many things.

A person can even become rich in Turkey if they follow all the rules of the Turkish government. Confucius said, “If a country is run by reason, then being poor and unhappy is shameful; but if it’s not, then having money and honor is shameful.” No, unless I need Massachusetts to protect me somewhere far away where I’m in danger, or unless I want to build a big estate peacefully at home, I can refuse to obey Massachusetts and give it my property and life. It costs me less to disobey the government than to obey it. If I obeyed, I’d feel like I’m worth less.

Some years ago, the State came to me for the church and told me to pay money to support a preacher my father listened to, but I never did. They said, “Pay up, or go to jail.” I refused to pay. But another person paid it instead. I didn’t see why teachers should have to pay for priests, but priests don’t have to pay for teachers. I wasn’t the State’s teacher; I supported myself with donations. I didn’t see why clubs shouldn’t get tax money like the church does. At the town’s request, I wrote this down: “Know all men that I, Henry Thoreau, don’t want to be part of any group I haven’t joined.” The town clerk has this note. Since then, the State hasn’t asked me to pay again, but it still thinks I belong to the church. If I had known all the groups I wasn’t part of, I would have said so, but I didn’t know where to find a full list.
