I want to say this: the whole Earth we live on is just a tiny dot in space. How far apart do you think the two people living the farthest from each other on a star are? That star is so small that our instruments can barely see it. So why should I ever feel lonely? Isn't our planet just one part of the Milky Way?

The question you asked doesn’t seem the most important to me. What kind of space is it that separates people and makes someone feel alone? I’ve learned that no matter how much you walk or travel, it won’t bring two minds closer together. What do we really want to be close to? Surely not places where lots of people gather, like the store, the post office, the bar, the school, or busy neighborhoods. We want to be close to the true source of life, like a willow tree standing near water and sending its roots toward it.

This place will be different for each person, but a smart person will build their life around it. One evening, I met a man from my town who has what people call a “nice fortune.” I never really saw it, though. He was driving cows to market and asked me how I could give up so many comforts. I told him I actually liked my life quite well and wasn’t joking. Then I went home to bed, while he had to keep going through the dark and muddy road to reach the town by morning.

For someone who feels dead inside, the chance to wake up and really live makes all times and places seem unimportant. The place where this can happen is always the same and feels wonderful in every way. But most of the time, we only pay attention to small, temporary things around us.

Those things actually distract us. The closest thing to everything is the power that creates it. Right next to us, huge laws are always working. Next to us isn’t the worker we hired and like to talk to, but the worker we actually are — the one doing the work.

“How big and deep is the power of Heaven and Earth!” we say. We try to see it, but we can’t. We try to hear it, but we don’t. Because it’s part of everything, it can’t be separated from the things themselves.
