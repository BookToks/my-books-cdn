If we only listened to the long speeches of lawmakers in Congress without learning from the experiences and complaints of the people, America wouldn’t stay important in the world for long. The New Testament was written about 1800 years ago, but I wonder if any lawmaker is smart and practical enough to use the ideas it teaches about making good laws.

The government’s power, even the kind I’m willing to accept—I will gladly obey those who know better than me, and sometimes even those who don’t—is still not perfect. To be truly fair, it needs the approval and agreement of the people it governs. It only has real control over me and my things because I allow it. Moving from a king with total power, to a king with limited power, to a democracy, is a step toward truly respecting each person. Even a Chinese philosopher knew the individual is the most important part of the country. 

Is the democracy we have now the best government possible? Can we not take another step to better recognize and organize people’s rights? There won’t be a truly free and smart country until it sees every individual as a powerful, independent source of its own power, and treats people that way. I like to imagine a country that is fair to everyone and treats each person like a neighbor. This country wouldn’t mind if some people choose to live apart, not getting involved, as long as they act responsibly and kindly to others. A country like this would grow into an even better and more amazing country, one I’ve thought about but haven’t seen yet.
