But even if people get hurt badly, isn’t there a kind of pain that happens inside when someone feels guilty? When that happens, a person’s true strength and spirit leak out, and they suffer forever. I can see that pain happening right now.

I have thought about putting criminals in jail instead of taking their stuff—though both punishments work. People who stand up for what’s right, and are a threat to a corrupt government, usually don’t have much money. The government doesn’t help them much, and even a small tax feels like too much, especially if they have to work hard with their hands to pay it. If someone didn’t use money at all, the government might not even ask them for taxes. But rich people—no offense—are controlled by the system that made them rich. Generally, the more money someone has, the less good they might be; money comes between a person and what they want, and usually it wasn’t hard to get. It solves many problems for them, except the difficult and unnecessary question of how to spend it. So, their sense of right and wrong becomes shaky. Having more money often means fewer chances to truly live. The best thing a rich person can do is try to follow the plans they had when they were poor. Jesus answered tricky questions based on the situation.

“Show me the tax money,” he said;—and someone showed a coin;—if you use money that has the ruler’s face on it, and you accept the benefits of his government, then pay him what he asks; “Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God,”—but he didn’t say which was which; because they didn’t really want to know.

When I talk with the freest people around me, I realize that no matter what they say about how serious the issue is or how much they care about peace, the real reason is they don’t want to lose the government’s protection. They’re scared their property and families will be hurt if they disobey. For me, I don’t want to depend on the government’s protection. But if I refuse to pay my taxes, the government will take all my stuff and keep bothering me and my kids forever.
