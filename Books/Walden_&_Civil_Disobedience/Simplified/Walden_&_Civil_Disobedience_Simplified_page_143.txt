Walden hasn’t gotten any permanent wrinkles after all its ripples. It always stays young, and I can still watch a swallow dip down like it’s picking an insect from the water, just like it used to. Tonight, it hit me again, even though I’ve seen it almost every day for more than twenty years—this is Walden, the same lake in the woods I found so long ago. Where a forest was cut down last winter, a new one is growing by the shore just as strong as ever. The same feelings are rising to the surface as before; it’s the same happy, peaceful feeling for itself and its Maker, and maybe for me too. A brave man made this place, one without any tricks! He shaped this water with his hand, made it clearer with his thoughts, and gave it to Concord by his will. I can tell by looking at it that it reflects the same thing, and I almost want to say, Walden, is that really you?

This is not just my imagination or a pretty thought; I can’t get closer to God and Heaven than when I’m at Walden.

I am part of its rocky shore,  
And the wind that blows over it;  
In my hand I hold its water and sand,  
And its deepest meaning lives high in my mind.

The trains never stop to look at Walden, but I think the engineers, firemen, and regular passengers who see it often are better people because of it. The engineer doesn’t forget, even at night, that he saw this peaceful and pure sight at least once that day. Even seeing it once helps clear away the dirt and noise of the city. Some say it should be called “God’s Drop.” I said Walden doesn’t have any visible streams going in or out, but it’s connected far away to Flint’s Pond, which is higher up, through a chain of small ponds. On the other side, it’s clearly connected to Concord River, which is lower, by a similar chain of ponds. Long ago, water may have flowed between them, and with a little digging—which I hope never happens—it could flow that way again. If living quietly and simply, like a hermit in the woods, has kept Walden so pure for so long, who wouldn’t be sad if the less clean water from Flint’s Pond mixed with it, or if Walden’s sweet water was lost in the ocean?
