The Foundation’s office is at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116. You can call (801) 596-1887 or find email contacts and the latest info on their website at www.gutenberg.org/contact.

Project Gutenberg™ relies on support and donations from the public to keep going. They work to increase the number of free books you can read on lots of different devices, even old ones. Small donations, from $1 to $5,000, really help them keep their tax-exempt status.

The Foundation follows charity laws in all 50 U.S. states.

These laws are different in each state, and it takes a lot of work, paperwork, and fees to follow them. They don’t ask for donations in states where they haven’t gotten official permission. To send donations or check if they can accept donations in your state, visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Even though they don’t ask for donations in some states, they can accept donations if someone from those states offers to give money without being asked.

They also welcome donations from other countries but can’t say how those donations affect taxes outside the U.S. Their staff is too small to handle all the rules.

Check the Project Gutenberg website for the latest ways to donate. You can give by check, online payment, or credit card. To donate, go to www.gutenberg.org/donate.
