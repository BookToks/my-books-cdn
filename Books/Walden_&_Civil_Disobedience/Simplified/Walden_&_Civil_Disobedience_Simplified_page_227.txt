For a whole week, I heard the lonely honking of a single goose in the foggy mornings. It was looking for its partner and made the woods feel like they were full of more life than they really had. In April, pigeons came back, flying fast in small groups. Soon after, I heard martins chirping above my clearing, even though it seemed like there weren’t many birds around. I thought these birds might be from a very old group that lived in hollow trees long before white people arrived. In almost every place, turtles and frogs show up first in spring. Birds sing and flash their colorful feathers, plants start to grow and bloom, and the wind blows to keep nature balanced.

Every season feels best when it comes, but spring is special. It’s like the world waking up from chaos into order and a perfect time. There’s a saying about the east wind moving away and the morning sun shining, marking the start of life. People wonder if humans were made by a divine creator or if the earth, being new, kept some heavenly qualities. A little rain makes the grass look many shades greener. Just like that, our hopes grow when we have better thoughts. We’d be lucky if we always lived in the present and used every chance we got, like grass that grows better with even the smallest drops of dew. Instead, we waste time feeling bad about missed chances, which we call doing our duty. We stay stuck in winter while spring is already here. On a nice spring morning, all sins feel forgiven.

A day like this makes bad behavior take a break. When the sun is shining warm, even the worst people can change. When we find our own innocence again, we can see it in others too. You might have thought your neighbor was a thief, a drunk, or careless yesterday, and just felt sorry for or hated them, losing hope in the world. But on this first warm spring morning, the sun makes everything new again. You see your neighbor working peacefully, and you notice how even their tired and worn-out body feels joy. You feel the power of spring like when you were a baby, and suddenly all their mistakes don’t matter anymore.
