So, he goes a bit beyond just acting on instinct and saves some time for enjoying art. After being outside in the cold for a long time, my whole body got numb, but when I got back to the warm air of my house, I quickly felt better and lived longer. But even people with the nicest homes don’t have much to brag about when it comes to this, and we don’t really need to worry about how humans might finally disappear.

It wouldn’t take much to end us with a stronger cold wind from the north. We keep counting time by cold Fridays and big snowfalls, but just one colder Friday or heavier snow could wipe out humans completely.

The next winter, I used a small cooking stove to save money since I didn’t own the forest. But it didn’t keep the fire going as well as an open fireplace did.

Cooking back then wasn’t about art anymore, just science. Soon, people will forget that we used to roast potatoes in ashes like Native Americans did. The stove took up space and made the house smell, but it also hid the fire, and I felt like I lost a friend. You can always see shapes in a fire. When a worker looks into it at night, it clears his mind from the dirt and worries from the day. But I couldn’t sit and watch the fire anymore. A poem’s words came to my mind stronger than ever:

“May I never be without your bright flame,  
Your warm and close friendship,  
What else but my hopes flew up so bright?  
What else but my bad luck sank so low?  
Why were you taken from our homes,  
You who are loved by everyone?  
Was your existence too dreamy  
For our dull lives?  
Did your bright light share secret talks  
With our kindred souls?  
Well, now we are safe and strong,  
Sitting by a fire where no shadows move,  
Where nothing cheers or saddens,  
Just a fire that warms hands and feet—nothing more;  
By this plain, useful fire,  
We sit down and sleep,  
Without fearing ghosts from the past  
Who once talked with us by the old wood fire’s light.”
