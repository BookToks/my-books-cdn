Heroic books, even if printed in the language of our own country, are still written in a way that feels old and hard to understand today. We have to work hard to figure out what each word and sentence means, guessing at a deeper meaning using whatever wisdom, courage, and kindness we have. Even with many cheap books and translations now, we still don’t get much closer to the heroic writers from long ago. They still feel rare and special, like treasures. It’s worth spending your youth and time learning even a few words of an ancient language because these words rise above everyday talk and give lasting ideas to think about. It’s not useless that a farmer remembers some Latin words he once heard.

Some people say that studying old classics will eventually be replaced by newer, more useful subjects. But a curious student will always want to study classics, no matter what language they are in or how old they are. Classics are the greatest thoughts ever written down by humans. They are like wise oracles that still answer questions better than any modern source. It would be silly to stop studying Nature just because she is old. Reading well, which means reading real important books with the right attitude, is a great challenge. It’s harder than many activities people value today. It takes training like athletes do and almost a lifetime of focus.

Books should be read carefully and slowly, just like they were carefully and slowly written. It’s not enough to just speak the language the books are written in. There is a big difference between spoken and written language—the language we hear and the language we read. Spoken language is temporary, just sounds and words we pick up naturally, like animals do from their mothers. Written language is more mature and experienced; if spoken language is like our mother tongue, written language is like our father tongue. It’s a special way of expressing ideas that we have to learn deeply to truly understand. 

In the Middle Ages, many people could speak Greek and Latin, but that didn’t mean they could read the great works written in those languages. Those books were written in a fancy, special form of Greek and Latin, not the everyday language people spoke. These people hadn’t learned the nobler versions of those languages, so those great books were like useless paper to them. Instead, they chose to read cheap, modern books that were easier to understand.
