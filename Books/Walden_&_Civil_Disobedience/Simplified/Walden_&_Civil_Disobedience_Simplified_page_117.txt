I kept planting peas even though other people had already started weeding their fields, so the minister’s farmer didn’t notice what I was doing.

“Corn, my boy, for animal food; corn for animal food.” The man in the black hat with the gray coat asked, “Does he live there?” The tough-looking farmer stopped his tired horse to ask what I was doing since there was no manure in the soil. He suggested using some dirt chips, garbage, ashes, or plaster to help. But I had two and a half acres of land with only a hoe, one cart, and two people to pull it—because we didn’t want to use other carts or horses—and the dirt chips were far away. People passing by compared my field to others, so I learned how my farming measured up. This field wasn’t included in Mr. Coleman’s report. By the way, who counts the value of crops that grow naturally in wild fields? Farmers carefully measure English hay, but in the woods, ponds, pastures, and swamps, there are many plants growing that no one harvests.

My field was like a bridge between wild and farmed land; like some places are modern, some are partly modern, and some are wild. My field was partly farmed, but not in a bad way. I was growing beans that were going back to their wild, natural state, and my hoe was like a song calling to them.

Nearby, on the top branch of a birch tree, a brown-thrasher bird sang all morning. Some people call it a red mavis. It seemed happy to be around, and it might have looked for another farm if mine wasn’t there.

While I planted seeds, the bird sang “Drop it, drop it,—cover it up, cover it up,—pull it up, pull it up, pull it up.” But I wasn’t planting corn, so the bird didn’t harm my plants. You might wonder why the bird’s singing matters when planting, but I liked it better than using ashes or plaster on the soil. It was a cheap and natural way to help the plants.

As I used my hoe to cover the rows with fresh soil, I found old ashes from ancient people who lived here long ago. I also found tiny tools for war and hunting that came to light. These were mixed with stones, some burned by Indian fires, some by the sun, and pieces of pottery and glass left by recent farmers.
