A man from the town told me that when he saw him walking slowly through the village wearing a small tight cap and whistling, he looked like a prince in disguise.

His only books were a calendar and a math book, and he was really good at math. The calendar was like an encyclopedia to him, and he thought it had most of the important knowledge people need. I liked asking him about the new changes happening in the world, and he always looked at them in a simple and practical way.

He had never heard of many of these things before. I asked him if he could live without factories. He said he had worn homemade Vermont gray clothes, and they were good. I asked if he could live without tea and coffee, and if there was any drink besides water in his country. He said he soaked hemlock leaves in water and drank that, and thought it was better than plain water when it was hot. When I asked if he could live without money, he explained how money was useful in a way that matched the smartest ideas about how money started, even explaining where the word came from.

If he owned an ox and wanted to buy needles and thread from the store, he thought it would be hard and impossible to keep promising parts of the ox as payment each time. He could explain many things better than any philosopher because he talked about them from his own experience. When I told him about Plato’s idea of a man—a two-legged creature without feathers—and showed him a plucked rooster called Plato’s man, he thought it was important that its knees bent the wrong way. He would sometimes say, “I love to talk! By George, I could talk all day!” Once, after not seeing him for months, I asked if he had learned a new idea that summer. He said, “Good Lord, a man who works like I do will forget his ideas if he doesn’t. Maybe the man you work with likes to race; then your mind has to be there, and you think about weeds.” Sometimes he asked me if I had made any progress in my ideas. One winter day I asked if he was always happy with himself, hoping to suggest he find a reason to live inside himself instead of relying on a priest or someone else.
