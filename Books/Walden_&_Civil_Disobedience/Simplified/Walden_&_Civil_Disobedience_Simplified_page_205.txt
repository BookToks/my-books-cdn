The Pond in Winter

After a calm winter night, I woke up feeling like someone had asked me a question. I had been trying to answer it in my sleep but couldn’t figure out what it was—what, how, when, or where? 

Outside, Nature was waking up too. It looked peaceful and happy as it looked through my big windows. Nature didn’t ask any questions like I did. Instead, it seemed like the question was already answered. The snow was deep on the ground, with young pine trees all around, and the hill where my house stands seemed to say, “Keep going!” Nature doesn’t ask or answer the questions people ask. It already made up its mind long ago.

“O Prince,” Nature seemed to say, “our eyes watch and admire this amazing universe. The night hides some of this beauty, but the day shows us the great work that stretches from Earth all the way up into the sky.”

Then it was time for my morning chores. I grabbed an axe and a bucket and went to find water—if that wasn’t just a dream. After a cold and snowy night, it was hard to find. 

Every winter, the pond’s surface, which is usually soft and moves with the wind and light, freezes solid to about a foot or more deep. It can hold even heavy sleds. Sometimes snow covers it so much you can’t tell it’s a pond—it looks just like a flat field. Like the marmots in the hills nearby, the pond “closes its eyes” and sleeps for three months or more.

Standing on the snowy plain like a field between the hills, I cut through a foot of snow and then a foot of ice. I made a small hole, a window under my feet. Kneeling to drink, I looked down into the quiet home of the fish. The light was soft, as if shining through frosted glass, and the sandy bottom looked the same as in summer. The water was calm and peaceful, like a quiet twilight sky, matching the calm nature of the fish living there.

Heaven is not just above us—it’s under our feet too.
