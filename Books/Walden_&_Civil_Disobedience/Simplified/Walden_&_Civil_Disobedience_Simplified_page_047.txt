These numbers, even if they seem random and not very useful, have some value because they cover everything completely.

I was never given anything without explaining how I used it. From the estimate above, my food cost me about twenty-seven cents a week. For almost two years after that, I ate mostly rye and cornmeal without yeast, potatoes, rice, a little salt pork, molasses, salt, and drank water. It made sense for me to eat mostly rice since I liked Indian philosophy so much. 

To answer some critics, I want to say that if I ate out sometimes, like I always did and hope to again, it often made my home food plans harder. But since eating out was normal for me, it doesn’t change the overall comparison.

After two years, I learned it is very easy and cheap to get what you need to eat, even where I lived. You can eat simple food like animals do and still be healthy and strong. I even made a good dinner from purslane, a plant I picked in my cornfield, boiled and salted. I gave the Latin name because it sounds fancy. What more could a reasonable person want for a normal lunch than some boiled green sweet corn with salt? Even the small variety of food I ate was because I wanted it, not because I needed it. But people today often go hungry, not because they don’t have enough food, but because they want fancy things. I know a good woman who thinks her son died because he only drank water.

You can see I’m talking more about the cost of food than about diet. Don’t try to eat like I did unless you have plenty of food stored.

At first, I made bread from just cornmeal and salt. These were real hoe-cakes, baked outside on a piece of wood or stick from building my house. They often got smoky and tasted like pine. I tried flour too, but finally found mixing rye and cornmeal worked best. In cold weather, it was fun to bake small loaves one after another, turning them carefully like an Egyptian watching eggs hatch.
