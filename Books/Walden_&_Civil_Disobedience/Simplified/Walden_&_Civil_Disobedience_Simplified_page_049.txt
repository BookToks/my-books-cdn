At one time, because I had no money, I didn’t see any food like that for more than a month.

Every person in New England could easily grow all their own bread stuff here, like rye and corn, and not have to buy from far away markets. But we are far from living simply and being independent. In Concord, fresh meal is hardly ever sold in shops, and most people don’t even eat hominy or corn in a rougher form. Usually, farmers feed their grain to animals and buy flour from the store, which isn’t any healthier and costs more. I saw that I could easily grow a bushel or two of rye and corn myself, since rye grows on poor land and corn doesn’t need the best soil. I could grind them by hand and live without rice and pork. If I wanted something sweet, I found I could make good molasses from pumpkins or beets. I also knew that planting a few maple trees would help me get sweet syrup easier. While waiting for those to grow, I could use other substitutes. Like the old song says, “we can make liquor to sweeten our lips of pumpkins and parsnips and walnut-tree chips.” For salt, the most basic grocery, I could go to the sea to get some, or just skip it and probably drink less water. I don’t think the Native Americans ever bothered looking for it.

So, I could avoid trading or buying food at all, and since I already had a place to live, all I needed was clothes and fuel.

The pants I wear now were made by a farmer’s family—thank goodness people still have good values. I think going from farmer to factory worker is as big a change as from man to farmer. In a new place, fuel is a burden. If I couldn’t keep living where I am, I could buy an acre of land for the same price I paid for the land I farmed—eight dollars and eight cents. But since I lived there already, I thought I made the land more valuable by staying on it.

Some people who don’t believe ask me questions like if I think I can live only on vegetables. To get straight to the point—the real issue is faith—I usually answer that I could live on board nails.
