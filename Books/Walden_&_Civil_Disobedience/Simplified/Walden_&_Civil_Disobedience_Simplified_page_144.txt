Flint’s, or Sandy Pond, in Lincoln, is our biggest lake and feels like a small sea. It’s about a mile east of Walden. It’s much bigger, said to cover one hundred and ninety-seven acres, and has more fish. But it’s pretty shallow and the water isn’t very clear. I often enjoyed walking through the woods to get there. It was worth it just to feel the wind on my face, watch the waves, and think about sailors’ lives.

In the fall, I went chestnut hunting there on windy days when the nuts would fall into the water and float right to my feet. One day, as I quietly walked along the grassy shore with fresh spray hitting my face, I found an old, falling-apart boat. Its sides were gone, and mostly just the flat bottom left in the rushes. But its shape was still clear, like a big, broken leaf with veins. It was the kind of wreck you’d imagine on a sea shore, and it made you think about life. Now it’s just dirt and plants growing where it used to be.

I used to like looking at the ripple marks on the sandy bottom at the north end of the pond. The water made the sand hard underfoot, and rushes grew in straight lines that matched the ripples, like waves had planted them. There, I also found lots of strange round balls made of fine grass or roots, maybe from a plant called pipewort. They were from half an inch to four inches wide and perfectly round. These balls rolled back and forth in the shallow water and sometimes washed up on shore. They were either solid grass or had a bit of sand inside. At first, I thought the waves made them, like how they shape pebbles. But even the smallest ones were made of the same rough material, and they only appeared at one time of year. I think the waves don’t make them but slowly wear down something that’s already formed. When dry, these balls keep their shape for a long time.

Flint’s Pond! What a boring name. Why did a dirty, dumb farmer who lived next to this beautiful water get to name it? He stripped its shores bare and didn’t care about the wild ducks living there, treating them like intruders. His fingers were crooked and rough from always grabbing money. So, it’s not named after me.
