BOOK FOUR AN INVITATION TO HOLY COMMUNION THE VOICE OF CHRIST COME to Me, all you that labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you.43 The bread which I will give is My Flesh, for the life of the world.44 Take you and eat: this is My Body, which shall be delivered for you. Do this for the commemoration of Me.45 He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, abideth in Me, and I in him.46 The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life."47 The First Chapter THE GREAT REVERENCE WITH WHICH WE SHOULD RECEIVE CHRIST THE DISCIPLE THESE are all Your words, O Christ, eternal Truth, though they were not all spoken at one time nor written together in one place. And because they are Yours and true, I must accept them all with faith and gratitude. They are Yours and You have spoken them; they are mine also because You have spoken them for my salvation.
 
 Gladly I accept them from Your lips that they may be the more deeply impressed in my heart.
 
 Words of such tenderness, so full of sweetness and love, encourage me; but my sins frighten me and an unclean conscience thunders at me when approaching such great mysteries as these. The sweetness of Your words invites me, but the multitude of my vices oppresses me.
 
 You command me to approach You confidently if I wish to have part with You, and to receive the food of immortality if I desire to obtain life and glory everlasting.
