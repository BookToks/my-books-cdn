Chapter 24  
DON’T WORRY ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE’S LIVES  

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
My child, don’t be curious. Don’t waste your time worrying about things that don’t matter. Why should you care if someone is this way or another does that? You only have to answer for yourself, not for others. So why do you get involved in their business?  

I know everyone. I see everything that happens, and I understand what people think and feel, and what they want in the end. Give all your worries to Me and stay peaceful inside. Let others be upset if they want. Whatever they do will come back to them, because they can’t fool Me.  

Don’t stress about being famous, having lots of close friends, or trying to get people to like you. These things only distract you and make your heart feel heavy. I want to share My words and secrets with you if you watch carefully for Me and open your heart. Be wise. Pray often and always stay humble.  

Chapter 25  
HOW TO HAVE TRUE PEACE AND GROW  

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
My child, I said, "I give you peace, not like the world gives." Everyone wants peace, but not everyone wants to do what it takes to have real peace. My peace comes to those who are humble and gentle. You will find peace by being patient. If you listen to Me and follow Me, you will have a lot of peace.  

THE DISCIPLE  
What should I do, Lord?  

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
Watch yourself in everything—what you do and say. Make sure everything you do is to please Me only, and don’t want anything outside of Me. Don’t be quick to judge what others say or do, and don’t get involved in things that aren’t your business. That way, you will be upset very little and rarely.
