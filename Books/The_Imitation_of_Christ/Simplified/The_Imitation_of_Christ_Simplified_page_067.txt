My God, sweetness beyond words, make all the physical comforts that pull me away from loving you feel bitter. Don’t let me be tricked by the good things I see right now that lead me away from what lasts forever. Please, don’t let me be defeated by my body or by the world’s temporary fame. Don’t let the devil fool me with his tricks. Give me courage to fight back, patience to handle hard times, and strength to keep going.

Give me the calm and peace of Your Spirit instead of the temporary comforts the world offers. Instead of loving physical things, fill me with love for Your name.

Eating, drinking, dressing, and other things that keep my body alive feel heavy to my passionate soul. Help me to use these things wisely and not want them too much. I know it’s okay to need them to live, but Your rules say we shouldn’t want extra things just for fun, or else my body will fight against my spirit. Please guide me so I don’t break this rule.

SELF-LOVE IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM TO BEING THE BEST YOU CAN BE

My child, you should give everything for everything and not belong to yourself alone. You need to understand that loving yourself too much is worse for you than anything else. The more you love something, the more it controls you. If your love is pure and simple, you won’t be a slave to anything. Don’t want things you can’t have. Don’t keep things that stop you from being free.

It’s strange you don’t give yourself to Me completely with all you want or have. Why are you sad over silly things? Why do you worry so much for no reason? Trust My will, and you won’t lose anything.

If you want one thing or another, or want to be in a certain place with more comfort and fun, you’ll never rest or be free from worries. There’s always something wrong everywhere, and someone will bother you. Getting more stuff won’t help you. But hating those things and getting rid of them from your heart will help. This isn’t just about money or wealth, but also about wanting honor or empty praise — all of which will disappear with this world.

It doesn’t matter where you are if you don’t have passion in your heart. You won’t find lasting peace by looking outside yourself. If your heart isn’t truly built on Me, you might change but you won’t improve. When problems come and you accept them, you’ll find the same troubles you ran from, and even worse.

A PRAYER FOR CLEANING THE HEART AND GETTING HEAVENLY WISDOM

Strengthen me with the power of Your holy Spirit, God. Help me grow stronger inside and clear my heart of all useless worries and fears, so I won’t be pulled away by too many desires, whether they are for valuable things or small ones.
