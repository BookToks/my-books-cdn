If your heart doesn’t have any wrong or messy feelings, doing good things won’t be hard for you. If you only want to please God and help others, you will feel free and happy inside.

If your heart is pure, every part of the world will teach you something important. No creature is too small or unimportant to show how good God is. If you’re good inside, you will clearly understand everything around you. A pure heart can see both good and bad, and it judges things fairly. If there is happiness in the world, pure hearts have it; if there is pain, people with a guilty conscience feel it too much.

Just like iron loses its rust and shines when put in fire, a person who fully turns to God changes and becomes new. When someone starts to slack off, they don’t want to work hard and prefer comfort. But when they decide to control themselves and follow God bravely, things they once thought were hard become easier.

We shouldn’t depend too much on ourselves because we often lack kindness and understanding. We have only a little natural wisdom, and we lose it quickly if we’re careless. Sometimes we don’t realize how blind our hearts really are. We do wrong things and then make excuses. Sometimes we get upset and call it passion. We criticize others for small mistakes but ignore our bigger ones. We easily remember when others hurt us but don’t think about how much we hurt others. If we looked at our own actions honestly, we wouldn’t judge others so harshly.

A person who looks inside themselves first finds it easier to stay quiet about others. You won’t have a peaceful heart unless you stop talking about others and focus on yourself. If you pay full attention to God and yourself, you won’t be bothered by what’s happening around you.

Where are your thoughts when you’re not thinking about yourself? After dealing with many things, what do you gain if you forget about yourself? If you want true peace and focus, you have to stop worrying about everything else and only think about yourself.

You will improve a lot if you don’t care too much about things that don’t last. Thinking too much about temporary stuff is a big mistake. Don’t think anything is great, important, or pleasing except God or what comes from God.

Think of the comforts from the world as worthless, because a soul that loves God doesn’t care about things less important than Him. Only God, who is forever and unlimited, can truly satisfy you and bring real comfort and joy to your life.
