The enemy knows how powerful and healing Holy Communion is, so he tries hard to stop faithful people from going to it. Some people face strong attacks from Satan when they are getting ready for Holy Communion. Like it says in the book of Job, this evil spirit comes to bother people and make them scared or confused. He wants to weaken their faith so much that they might skip Communion or go without real feeling.

But you should never listen to his tricks, no matter how bad they seem. You have to push his thoughts away. He is someone to ignore and dislike. Don’t miss Holy Communion because of his attacks or the noise he makes inside your mind.

Sometimes, being too worried about being perfect or about confession can stop someone from going. Be smart like wise people. Let go of those worries and doubts, because they block God’s help and ruin your feelings of devotion.

Don’t stay away from Holy Communion just because of small problems. Go to confession right away and forgive anyone who hurt you. If you have hurt someone, ask for their forgiveness humbly, and God will forgive you too.

What good comes from waiting a long time to confess or to take Communion?

Clean yourself quickly and get rid of the bad feelings fast. Hurry to fix things, and you’ll feel better than if you wait. If you skip it today for one reason, tomorrow maybe something bigger will come up. Then you might stay away from Communion for a long time and feel less ready.

Shake off the heaviness and laziness as fast as you can. Worrying too much, staying troubled for hours, and missing Communion because of these things don’t help you. Waiting too long to take Communion is bad because it makes you spiritually lazy.

It’s sad that some careless people want to delay confession and Communion so they don’t have to watch themselves closely. They don’t really love or care about Communion if they put it off so easily.

But those who live right and keep their conscience clean are happy and pleasing to God. They are ready to take Communion even every day if they could, and if no one noticed.

Sometimes, if a person skips Communion out of humility or for a good reason, that’s respectful. But if laziness stops them, they must push themselves to try hard. God will help their desire because He cares about good intentions. When they really can’t go, having the will and right intention still brings the blessings of the Sacrament.

Anyone who is devoted can receive Jesus in their heart at any time through spiritual Communion and gain grace. But on special days and times, they should receive the actual Body of Christ with love and respect, to honor God more than just for their own comfort.
