Let me see everything as temporary, and myself as going away soon with them, because nothing lasts forever in this world, where everything can feel meaningless and full of pain.

How smart is the person who thinks like this!

Please, Lord, give me wisdom from heaven to learn to look for You first and find You, to enjoy and love You more than anything else, and to see other things as they really are, just like Your wisdom shows me. Help me to be careful to avoid people who just flatter me and to be patient with those who don’t agree with me. It is very wise not to be fooled by empty words or listen to those who try to trick me with sweet talk. Then, I will safely follow the path I have started.

My child, don’t take it personally if people say bad or mean things about you. You should think even worse of yourself and believe that no one is weaker than you. If you live by the spirit, you won’t pay much attention to words that don’t last. It’s very wise to stay quiet in hard times, turn to Me inside, and not be upset by what others think. Don’t let your peace depend on what people say. Whether they like you or don’t, it doesn’t change who you really are. Where do real peace and honor come from? Aren’t they in Me? The person who doesn’t care about pleasing others or fears upsetting them will have great peace, because all worry and confusion come from loving the wrong things and being afraid for no good reason.

Blessed be Your name forever, Lord, who have allowed this trouble to come to me. I can’t avoid it, but I must turn to You for help and ask You to make it good for me. I am worried, Lord, and my heart is restless because this pain is very hard.

Dear Father, what should I say? I am trapped in hard ways. Save me from this time, but I know You want me here so You can be praised when I am humble and You set me free. Please, Lord, help me, because I am nothing without You. Give me patience now. Help me, God, and I won’t be afraid, even if I’m upset.

But even in these troubles, what should I say? Your will be done, Lord.

I deserve to be troubled and upset. But I must accept it. I wish I could be patient until the storm ends and peace comes back!
