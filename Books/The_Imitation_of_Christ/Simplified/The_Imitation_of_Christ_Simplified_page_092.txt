She feels sorry for people who are innocent instead of those who have power.

She is happy for honest people rather than liars, and she always encourages good people to try to get better and be like the Son of God by practicing good habits.

Nature quickly complains when it needs something or faces trouble; grace, on the other hand, stays strong even when things are hard. Nature focuses on itself and fights to protect itself. Grace brings everything back to God, where everything comes from. Grace doesn’t think it’s better than others and isn’t proud or bossy. It doesn’t argue or insist on its own opinion but listens to God’s wisdom and judgment in all things.

Nature loves to know secrets and hear news. It wants to be out in the world, have many experiences, be noticed, and be praised. But grace doesn’t care about gossip or curiosity because those come from human weakness, and nothing on earth lasts forever. Grace teaches us to control our senses, avoid showing off, hide good actions quietly, and look for ways to be useful and honor God in everything we do. Grace doesn’t want to be praised but wants God, who gives gifts out of love, to be thanked.

This grace is a special gift from God, a light that helps people who are chosen by God and promises them eternal life. It lifts people from caring only about earthly things to loving heaven. It changes a person who only thinks about physical things into a spiritual person. The more we control our natural desires, the more grace we get. Every day, our inner self is shaped more like God through new experiences.

Chapter 55: THE WEAKNESS OF NATURE AND THE POWER OF GOD’S GRACE

The follower says: O Lord, my God, who made me in Your image, please give me this grace, which You have shown is very important for saving me. Help me overcome my bad nature that wants me to sin and be lost. I feel my body wants to do wrong, fighting against my mind, and I can’t resist these urges unless Your holy grace helps me deeply.

I really need Your grace, a lot of it, to overcome my nature that’s been weak and bad since I was young. Because of the first man, Adam, our nature is broken and weak because of sin, and all people suffer because of it. So nature, which You made good, now shows how weak and sinful we are, because if left alone, it tends to do bad and low things.

The little good left in nature is like a small spark hidden under ashes. That good is reason, which, even though it is surrounded by darkness, can still tell right from wrong and see what is true and false. But it can’t always do what it knows is right or fully understand truth or feel love deeply.
