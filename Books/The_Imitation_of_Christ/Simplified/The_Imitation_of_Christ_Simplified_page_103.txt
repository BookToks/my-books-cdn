Be happy, my soul, and thank God for giving you such an amazing gift and comfort in this hard life. Every time you celebrate this special event and receive the Body of Christ, you take part in saving the world and share in all the good things Christ did because His love never fades, and His mercy never runs out.

So, you should get ready for it by always opening your heart and thinking deeply about how great salvation is. Every time you go to Mass or hear it, it should feel just as amazing and fresh as if it were the very day Jesus became human in Mary’s womb or died on the Cross to save us.

Look, I come to You, Lord, hoping to grow strong with Your gift and to be happy at Your holy meal that You, God, kindly prepared for those who need You. Everything I want or need is in You. You are my salvation, my hope, my strength, my honor, and my glory.

Make me happy today, Lord Jesus, because I have lifted my heart to You. I want to receive You now with respect and devotion. I want to welcome You into my life so that, like Zacheus, I may receive Your blessing and be counted among Your people.

My soul wants Your Body; my heart wants to be close to You. Give Yourself to me — that’s all I need; without You, I have no comfort. Without You, I can’t live, and without Your visit, I can’t survive. That’s why I must come to You often and receive the strength You give, so I don’t get weak on my journey. Once, Jesus, You said while helping people, “I won’t send them away hungry, or they’ll faint on the way.” Please do the same for me, You Who stay with us in this Sacrament to comfort us. You refresh the soul, and anyone who eats You worthily will share in eternal happiness.

I really need to do this because I make mistakes and get weak quickly. I must keep renewing, cleaning, and lighting up my heart through prayer, confession, and receiving Your Body often. If I stay away too long, I might lose my way. From a young age, people’s feelings tend to go wrong, and without God’s help, they fall deeper. But Holy Communion helps us leave evil behind and stay strong in what is good.
