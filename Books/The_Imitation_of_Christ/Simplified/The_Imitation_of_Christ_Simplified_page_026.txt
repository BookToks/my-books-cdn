Learn to let go of the world now, so you can start living with Christ later. Learn to reject all things now, so you can freely go to Him. Control your body with discipline now, so you can be confident and sure later.

Hey, don’t be silly by planning to live a long time when you might not even live a day. Many people have been tricked and suddenly taken away! You’ve probably heard about people dying from drowning, falling, eating, playing, fires, fighting, sickness, or robbery! Everyone dies, and life passes quickly like a shadow.

Who will remember you when you’re gone? Who will pray for you? Do what you can now, because you don’t know when you’ll die or what will happen after. Collect the treasure of eternal life while you still have time.

Think only about saving your soul. Care only about God’s things. Make friends by respecting God’s saints and copying what they do, so when you leave this life, they can welcome you to a happy home forever.

Live like a stranger on earth, like a traveler who doesn’t get caught up in its problems. Keep your heart free and focused on God, because this world is not your real home. Talk to Him every day with your prayers, sighs, and tears, so your soul can be happy with Him after death.

Always think about the end—how you will stand before the strict Judge who sees everything and judges fairly, without accepting bribes or excuses. If you’re a sinner who even fears an angry person, what will you say to God who knows all your sins? Why don’t you prepare for judgment day now, when no one can help you because everyone must answer for themselves? In this life, your good deeds, tears, and sorrow are useful and make you pure.

A patient person goes through a kind of cleansing when they feel more upset about someone’s evil than their own hurt; when they pray for their enemies and forgive from their heart; when they ask for forgiveness easily; when they feel pity more than anger; and when they control their body to obey their spirit.

It’s better to fix your sins now and get rid of bad habits than to save them for punishment later. We fool ourselves by loving our sinful desires. That punishment fire will feed on our sins. The more we spoil ourselves now, the harder the punishment will be later.

People will be punished more severely for the sins they did the most.

There, lazy people will be hurt by burning rods, gluttons will suffer terrible hunger and thirst; those who love sin and lust will be burned in hot pitch and sulfur; and jealous people will cry out in pain like wild dogs.
