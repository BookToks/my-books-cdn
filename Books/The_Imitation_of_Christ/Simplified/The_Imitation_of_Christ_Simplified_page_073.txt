Chapter Thirty-Four  
GOD IS SWEET ABOVE ALL THINGS AND IN ALL THINGS TO THOSE WHO LOVE HIM  

My God and my everything! What else could I want? What greater happiness could I hope for? Such a sweet and wonderful feeling! But it only feels sweet to those who love God, not to the people who only care about the world and its stuff.  

My God and my everything! These words mean a lot to anyone who understands them, and those who love God love saying them again and again. When You are with me, everything is great; when You are gone, everything feels awful. You are the one who gives peace, calm, and happiness to my heart. You help me think good thoughts about everything and praise You no matter what. Without You, nothing stays enjoyable for long because Your kindness and wisdom are what make things truly good. What could upset someone whose happiness is in You? And what could satisfy someone who doesn’t find joy in You?  

The smart people of the world who only want pleasure don’t have Your wisdom. The world is full of empty things, and focusing just on the body leads to death. But those who follow You by ignoring the world and controlling their desires are truly wise. They move from fake things to real truth, from focusing on their body to focusing on their spirit. People like this enjoy God, and any good thing they see in the world makes them praise God, the Creator. But there is a huge difference between loving the Creator and loving the created things, between forever and just a moment, between true light and reflected light.  

O eternal Light, brighter than anything made, send your lightning from above and light up the deepest parts of my heart. Cleanse, cheer, brighten, and bring life to my spirit and all its powers, so it can stick to You in joyful happiness. Oh, when will that happy time come when You fill me with Your presence and become everything to me? Until then, my joy won’t be complete.  

The old part of me still lives inside. It hasn’t been completely destroyed or changed yet. It still fights against my spirit and won’t leave my soul alone. But You, who can calm the wild sea and stop its waves, please come and help me. Scatter those who love war; defeat them in Your sight. Please show Your amazing works and let Your power be praised, because I have no other hope or safe place except in You, Lord my God.
