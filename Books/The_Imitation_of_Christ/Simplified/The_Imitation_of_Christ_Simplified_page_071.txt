No matter what spirit guides us, or what we claim to be—especially those of us who want to be called spiritual—we spend a lot of time and worry on things that don’t last and don’t really matter. But we rarely, if ever, really pay attention to what’s going on inside us.

Sadly, after only a little thought, we give up and don’t carefully think about our actions. We don’t notice where our feelings are focused, and we don’t feel bad when our actions aren’t pure.

Remember, because all people had turned away from what was right, a great flood came. So if our inner feelings are corrupted, then the actions that come from them, which show our inner weakness, are also corrupted. Good actions come from a pure heart.

People often ask how much someone has done, but they don’t think much about how good or kind that person is inside. They ask: Is he strong? Rich? Good-looking? A talented writer, singer, or worker? But they rarely ask about how humble, patient, kind, or spiritual he is. Nature judges by what’s on the outside; grace looks to what’s inside. The first often makes mistakes, but the second trusts God and is not fooled.

Chapter 32: SELF-DENIAL AND GIVING UP BAD DESIRES  
THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
My child, you can never be truly free unless you completely give up selfishness. Everyone who only thinks about themselves is trapped. They are always restless, wanting more, and looking for comfort instead of wanting the things of Christ. They often make plans for things that won’t last, because anything not from God will fail.

So remember this simple but perfect advice: give up your desires and you will find peace. Think about it deeply, and when you live by it, you will understand everything.

THE DISCIPLE  
But Lord, this isn’t something you can do in one day, and it’s not easy; this short advice includes everything perfect people aim for.

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
My child, don’t turn away or feel sad when you hear about the path to perfection. Instead, let it push you to try harder or at least to want to be better.

I wish you had reached the point where you no longer love yourself but only wait for My orders and those of the leader I have placed over you. Then you would make Me very happy, and your whole life would be full of peace and joy.
