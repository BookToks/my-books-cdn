The Fifth Chapter THE AMAZING POWER OF DIVINE LOVE THE FOLLOWER

I thank You, God in heaven, Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, for remembering me, even though I’m just a poor person. Thank You, Father of kindness, God who comforts me, who sometimes helps me even when I don’t deserve it. I always praise You and honor You with Your only Son and the Holy Spirit forever.

Oh Lord God, my holy Lover, when You come into my heart, everything inside me is happy. You are my pride and joy. You are my hope and safe place when I’m having a hard time. But my love is still weak and I’m not perfect, so I need You to make me stronger and comfort me. Please visit me often and teach me how to live right. Free me from bad feelings and clean my heart from messy desires so that I can love well, be strong when things are hard, and keep going without giving up.

Love is an amazing thing, a huge blessing. It makes hard things easier and helps you forgive people who hurt you. Love carries heavy loads without feeling tired and turns bitter things sweet. Jesus’ noble love pushes us to do great things and want something better. Love looks up and won’t be held down by anything low. Love wants to be free and away from worldly things so it can see clearly, not get stuck in temporary stuff, or be defeated by hard times.

Nothing is sweeter than love, nothing stronger, higher, or wider. Nothing is more pleasant, fuller, or better on earth or in heaven because love comes from God and can only rest in God, who is above everything.

Someone in love feels like flying, running, and being happy. They are free, not tied down. They give everything and have everything because they rest in the one true Good, who is above all things and is the source of all good. They don’t focus on gifts but on the Giver.

Love often has no limits and overflows everywhere. Love doesn’t feel tired, doesn’t care about troubles, tries more than it thinks it can, and never says it’s impossible, because it believes it can do anything. That’s why love can do so much, where people who don’t love fail and give up.

Love is always alert. Even when sleeping, it doesn’t really rest. When tired, it’s not worn out. When pressed, it’s not stuck. When scared, it’s not confused. Like a burning flame or torch, love pushes upward and gets through every problem without being hurt.

If someone loves, they will hear this voice. This strong feeling in the soul is like a loud voice shouting to God, saying: "My God, my love, You are all mine, and I am all Yours."
