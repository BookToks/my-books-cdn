A humble person stays calm and peaceful even when things get tough because they trust God, not the world.

You shouldn’t think you’re making progress until you see yourself as less important than everyone else.

Chapter Three: Goodness and Peace in a Person

First, find peace inside yourself; then you can help others find peace too. A peaceful person does more good than someone who just knows a lot. While angry people can turn good things bad and quickly believe the worst, peaceful people see the good in everything.

Someone who is calm doesn’t get suspicious, but a restless person worries a lot and can’t relax or let others relax. They often say things they shouldn’t and fail to do what they need to. They worry about what others should do but ignore their own jobs.

Focus your energy on fixing yourself first; only then can you fairly help others. You’re good at making excuses for yourself but don’t accept the same from others. It would be better to blame yourself and forgive others. If you want people to be patient with you, you need to be patient with them.

See how far you are from true kindness and humility if you get angry at others but not at yourself!

It’s easy to get along with nice, kind people because that’s what most people like. Everyone wants a peaceful life and likes hanging out with people who act like them. But being able to stay peaceful with rude, difficult, or annoying people is a real strength and something to be proud of.

Some people are peaceful inside and with others, but some are never peaceful and make others unhappy too. These people are a problem for everyone, but mostly for themselves. A few people are peaceful inside and try to help others be peaceful too.

In this hard life, real peace comes from patiently dealing with suffering, not avoiding it. The person who handles suffering best is the most peaceful because they have conquered themselves, control their world, are friends with Christ, and will inherit heaven.

Chapter Four: Purity of Mind and Unity of Purpose

A person grows and rises above problems with two things — simplicity and purity. They must have simple intentions and pure desires. Simplicity brings us closer to God, and purity helps us enjoy being with Him.
