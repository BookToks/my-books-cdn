You, my God, who protect my soul and give me strength when I’m weak, always give great gifts to those who receive this Sacrament with devotion. You also comfort them when they face many troubles and lift them from sadness to hope in Your protection. With new graces, You cheer them up inside so that those who feel worried and distant before Communion can feel better after receiving this special food and drink.

You also help Your chosen people realize how weak they are on their own and how much goodness and grace come from You. Even if they feel cold and not very devoted by themselves, through You they become passionate, happy, and faithful.

Who can come close to this sweet source without taking a little of it away? Or stand near a fire without feeling some heat?

You are like a fountain that never runs dry! You are a fire that always burns and never goes out!

So, even if I can’t drink all of this fountain or get completely full, I will still take a small sip to refresh my thirst and not dry up. And if I can’t be as perfect or full of fire as the angels, I will try to be more devoted and prepare my heart to get a little spark of Your divine fire when I humbly receive this life-giving Sacrament.

If I’m lacking anything, good Jesus, holy Savior, please fill it for me with Your kindness and grace. You have called everyone to come to You, saying: "Come to Me all who are tired and burdened, and I will give you rest." I work hard and suffer in my heart. I’m weighed down by sin, tempted, and trapped by many bad habits, and no one can help or save me except You, my Lord God and Savior. I trust myself and everything I have to You, so You can protect me and lead me to eternal life. For the honor and glory of Your name, please accept me, You who prepared Your Body and Blood as food and drink for me. Lord, help me come to Your Sacrament often so my love and devotion will grow.

The Fifth Chapter THE DIGNITY OF THE SACRAMENT AND OF THE PRIESTHOOD THE VOICE OF CHRIST Even if you were as pure as an angel and as holy as St. John the Baptist, you wouldn’t be worthy to receive or give this Sacrament. It’s not because of anything good people do that a man can perform and give the Sacrament of Christ or receive the Bread of Angels as food. This is a great mystery and priests have a great honor because they alone, if properly chosen by the Church, can celebrate Mass and make the Body of Christ holy.
