Don’t just ask for what feels good or easy for you. Instead, ask for what I accept and what brings me honor. If you think carefully, you should want to follow my will, not just do what you want.

I know what you wish for and I hear your sighs. You want to be free and share in the glory of God’s children. You want to enjoy the happy, eternal home in heaven. But that time hasn’t come yet. There’s still a time for struggle, work, and testing. You want to be filled with the best good, but you can’t get it now. I am that best good. Wait for me until God’s kingdom comes.

You still have to be tested on earth and go through many challenges. Sometimes you will get comfort, but not completely. So be brave and strong to do and accept things that feel hard or unnatural.

You need to become a new person. You have to change. You will often do things you don’t want to do and give up things you want. What others like will succeed; what you want might not. People will listen to others but ignore what you say. Others will ask for things and get them; you might not. Others will become famous; no one will talk about you. Others will be trusted with important things; you might be seen as useless. Sometimes this will make you sad, but it’s a big deal if you can handle this sadness quietly. This is how a true servant of the Lord is tested, to see how well they can give up themselves and their own wishes.

The hardest thing you have to do is give up what you want, especially when you have to do things that seem pointless or uncomfortable. Because you must obey those in charge, it can be hard to give up your own opinion and accept what others want.

But think, my child, about the reward for these struggles. They will end soon, and the reward will be great. You won’t be sad but patient, and your patience will bring you the best comfort. Instead of giving up your small will now, you will have your true will in heaven. There, you will get everything you want without fear of losing it. Your will will always agree with mine. You won’t want anything outside of me or for yourself. No one will oppose or stop you there. Everything you want will be there, making you happy and full. I will give you glory for the hard times you had here. For your pain, I will give you praise. For being humble, I will give you a place of power forever. There, your glory will show, your hard work will be joyful, and your humble obedience will be honored.

So, bow down humbly to the will of everyone, and don’t worry about who said or ordered something. But always try to accept and do what is asked or even suggested, whether it comes from someone above, below, or equal to you. Let some people want one thing and others want something else, and let both be praised many times. But you should not care about either of those. Instead, be happy only in being humble and in pleasing and honoring me. Let this be your goal: that in life or death, God is honored through you.
