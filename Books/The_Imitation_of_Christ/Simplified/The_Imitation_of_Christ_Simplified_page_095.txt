Chapter 57: A Man Should Not Feel Too Down When He Makes Mistakes

The voice of Christ says, “My child, being patient and humble when things go wrong makes Me happier than when you feel good and pray a lot.”

Why are you upset over a small thing someone said about you? Even if it was worse, you shouldn’t let it bother you. Just let it go. This isn’t the first time, and if you live long, it won’t be the last.

You act brave only when things are easy. You give good advice to others and help them with your words. But when trouble suddenly comes to you, you don’t give good advice or stay strong. Think about how weak you are, even with small problems. But these troubles happen to help you.

Try to forget it as best you can. If it still bothers you, don’t let it make you sad or confused for too long. At least be patient, even if you can’t be happy about it. Even if you don’t want to accept it and feel angry, control yourself and don’t say bad things that might upset others. The storm will calm down soon, and your sadness will be eased by My help. “I am still alive,” says the Lord, “ready to help and comfort you more if you trust Me and pray to Me.” Stay calm and get ready to handle even bigger problems. Everything is not lost even if you are troubled more or tempted badly. You are human, not God. You have a body, not wings like an angel. How can you expect to always be perfect when even angels and the first man in paradise failed? I save those who are hurting and bring My power to those who know they are weak.

The disciple says, “Blessed are Your words, Lord, sweeter to me than honey. What would I do in big troubles and worries if You didn’t make me strong with Your holy words? If I can just reach the safe place of salvation, it doesn’t matter what or how much I suffer. Please give me a good ending. Help me leave this world peacefully. Remember me, God, and guide me the right way into Your kingdom.”
